There Will Soon Be a New Royal Show to Binge—This Time About the Royal Family of Denmark,Rachel Burchfield,"January 21, 2024 at 4:48 AM·2 min read",20231222,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/missing-crown-already-soon-royal-194828181.html,"The British royal family isn’t the only royal family with drama, and, on the heels of Netflix’s The Crown ending last month, we have a new royal show to look forward to, this time about the royal family of Denmark.
It’s appropriate timing for an announcement like this to be made, as Queen Margrethe—the world’s last reigning queen regnant—just abdicated the throne last week after 52 years on the throne. Her abdication followed rumors of a scandal involving her eldest son and heir, now King Frederik, and in 2022 Margrethe made headlines for unexpectedly stripping the titles of the children of her younger son, Prince Joachim. So, yes, there’s plenty there for a reimagined, Danish version of The Crown.
The Netflix series ran from 2016 to the end of 2023 and was centered on the life of Queen Elizabeth. Deadline reports that Margrethe’s life will be brought to screen in the television show Af Guds nåde (translated to By the Grace of God), and that the show is being developed by the makers of the hit Danish political drama Borgen. The story will follow Margrethe’s life from her birth in 1940 and will be set at Amalienborg Palace in Denmark’s capital city of Copenhagen.
The Guardian further reports that the show’s producers “will tell the story from the perspective of members of the royal family and also royal court employees.” The show has been in development for the past 18 months and is expected to be released in 2025. Of Margrethe—the longest-serving monarch in Denmark’s history before her surprise abdication at the age of 83—the show’s executive producer Meta Louise Foldager Sørensen said that she “has been part of the history of all Danes. It was not on the cards for the little princess to be queen, but times changed, and she became a great queen. Now is the time to tell the magnificent story which can give us an insight we have not had before.”
There is no news yet as to how the show will be distributed internationally, but Netflix? We miss The Crown already. Just saying."

Source: Ekonomichna Pravda with reference to sources in the customs system. This information was also confirmed by the National Bank itself.
Details: Ekonomichna Pravda reports that on 25 September 2022, the National Bank paid UAH 19.487 million (about USD 520,758) to Oerlikon for an installation to apply chromium nitride to a coinage tool. In August 2023, the NBU paid the same company UAH 13,900 (about USD 370) for ten titanium cathodes. Minting coins in circulation requires proper equipment and cathodes.
Following a request from Ekonomichna Pravda, the National Bank confirmed the purchase. At the same time, they pointed out that the procurement procedure had begun in 2020, and the NBU had reached an agreement to purchase these goods in 2021, when there were no legislative restrictions on cooperation with Russian oligarchs' companies.
""This purchase took place in early 2021. There are no manufacturers of such specialised equipment in Ukraine. Three international participants were allowed to present their bids: INORCOAT (Bulgaria), Teer Coatings Ltd (UK), and Oerlikon Balzers Coating (Germany, Liechtenstein).
Based on the results of the bid evaluation, the contract for the supply of equipment was concluded in February 2021 with the German company Oerlikon Balzers Coating [part of the Oerlikon group - ed.], which ""provided the lowest bid"", the NBU explained.
According to financial statements, Liwet Holding AG is Oerlikon's largest shareholder, with a stake of 42.7%. Viktor Vekselberg is Liwet Holding AG's largest shareholder, owning 44.46% of the shares.
Customs data shows that the National Bank purchased goods from a company associated with a Russian oligarch for a total of UAH 19.5 million (about US$521,100) following the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.The final payment for the Oerlikon installation was made after the start of the full-scale invasion, in September 2022, and following the installation and testing of the corresponding equipment.
The National Bank explains that they had no choice but to pay as ""the unlawful termination of contractual relations would have led to multimillion-dollar losses for the National Bank of Ukraine, and also would have had a significantly negative impact on the technological process of producing circulating coins in Ukraine.""
In 2023, the NBU again purchased goods from Oerlikon, whose largest shareholder is Russian oligarch Vekselberg. The total purchase price came to €288. ""This was necessary due to the warranty period of 12 months (until the end of October 2023), during which the use of non-original consumables is prohibited,"" according to the National Bank.
They emphasise that all purchases from Oerlikon were made in accordance with the Ukrainian legislation in force at the time.
At the same time, the NBU stated that they have revised their internal procurement procedures and strengthened their work in the area of sanctions compliance.
""In addition, the National Bank has updated the standard purchase agreement forms and supplemented it with sanctions clauses and assurances that exclude the cooperation of the National Bank with persons subject to sanctions restrictions and/or associated with supervisory relations with sanctioned persons,"" the National Bank said in a response.
The National Bank does not plan to make purchases from Oerlikon in 2024 and in the future.

06JNJATRTA_XN0VDMF4YB8DBX8,Media literacy is more than spotting fake news. How one librarian gives teens the tools to decide what to trust,"Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN","January 22, 2024 at 11:13 PM·9 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/media-literacy-more-spotting-fake-110324423.html,"Along with the smell of old books and the shelves of trendy novels at the South Brunswick High School library are guides for accurately deciphering the digital world.
Poster after poster with “Smart Social Networking” tips and what “Good Digital Citizenship” looks like hang at this New Jersey campus, where school librarian Lisa Manganello has made it her mission to teach teenagers to navigate the vast – often deliberately confusing – landscape of online information.
“Media literacy has absolutely nothing to do with which side of the debate you’re on,” the 17-year veteran of this still-emerging academic subject told CNN. “And I often say to my students, I don’t care if you are conservative or if you are liberal, it really doesn’t make a difference to me.
“Whatever article you’re choosing, I want you to be able to look at it from a critical lens and really make a decision about whether or not this is a trustworthy article,” Manganello told CNN. “You can have an opinion on either side, but you should be able to validate that opinion with a fact-based article.”
Media literacy is the ability to decode media messages – including the systems in which they exist – assess their influence on thoughts, feelings and behaviors, and create media thoughtfully and conscientiously, according to Media Literacy Now, an advocacy group that tracks and drives the subject’s implementation in K-12 schools across the United States.
With lots of kids now getting their news from social media – where disinformation and content created by artificial intelligence run rampant – 18 states have some form of K-12 media literacy education on the books, according to Media Literacy Now. Of those, four – Delaware, Texas, New Jersey and, starting this year, California – mandate media literacy, with lesson standards now being crafted state by state.
Online misinformation, of course, can direct kids not only to messages that aren’t true but also to dangers like cyberbullying, negative body image and a path into substance abuse, the group says. And so the potential impact of teaching them how to interpret what they see online could be nothing short of “life-changing,” said Olga Polites, New Jersey chapter leader for Media Literacy Now.
When cars were invented, for instance, auto safety wasn’t widely talked about, seatbelts weren’t a priority and learning how to drive was a whole new landscape, she said.
“(Cell) phones are like cars,” Polites told CNN. “But we haven’t really taught people how to use them ethically, efficiently and responsibly.”
To do that, a media literacy lesson might include analyzing which emotions the wording of a mass media headline evoke. Or parsing the photo that runs alongside the text of a news piece. Or using “lateral reading” – lining up stories on the same topic in browser tabs to compare credibility, intent and biases – as Manganello did a few weeks ago at South Brunswick High School.
With a variety of news headlines displayed on her projector screen, the librarian asked 25 students in history teacher Jeff Johnson’s American government class the following:
“Te ll me words that you see in these headlines that you think shows bias?”
“Revenge,” one student quickly said, though with a little hesitation in his voice.
“Ah, revenge!” Manganello replied.
The group, armed with personal laptops and seated four to a table, kept discussing: What might a more neutral word choice have been?
“I thought it was very interesting to think about how we get our information and how we interpret it because of what (the media is) telling us, especially the part where it was talking about the word choice that people use and how it can influence your opinions,” ninth grader Harrison Pekosz told CNN later.
In elementary and middle school, Harrison learned about identifying legitimate sources of information based on a web address ending with “.com” or “.org.”
“Now, it’s more in-depth, and I know there’s more to look at than just domain,” he said.
Soon, Manganello shifted the lesson to photos and asked students to identify whether an image attached to a news article was “flattering, neutral or unflattering.” The choice, she said, could help determine whether the piece as a whole is trustworthy – or not.
“Information literacy is the umbrella for all of the things that we teach in the library … to make sure that our students have all the tools they need to do both information gathering and to engage with media that could be online, social media, for research,” Manganello said. “Media literacy kind of falls under that information literacy banner.”
Beyond the library, Manganello works with teachers at South Brunswick High School throughout the year to incorporate information literacy into their lesson plans, from art history to science classes. She also speaks at educational conferences, where attendees have approached her to ask how they can get started implementing her work in their schools, she said.
On her own campus, Manganello’s goal is to see every student a few times a year, focusing on a new skill each time over their four years, she said. In the end, students have a kit of tools to tap into when they’re scanning the latest headlines – especially online.
Akshara Satheesh and Urja Kandale, both ninth graders at South Brunswick High School, get their news from TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat or Google’s News Discovery feed because of how simple it is to understand storylines, they told CNN.
And they’re not alone.
“We found that 75% of them get their information off of social media, many off of TikTok,” Manganello told CNN.
It’s not an unfathomable stat, considering a growing number of adult TikTok users in the US report getting their news on the short-video platform, according to 2023 data from the Pew Research Center.
That in itself isn’t necessarily a problem: Plenty of reputable news agencies share their reports on social media platforms.
Here’s the catch: 96% of high school students surveyed in in 2018 and 2019 failed to accurately judge the credibility of a piece of information online, Stanford University research found. And two-thirds couldn’t tell the difference between news articles and advertisements on the home page of US news agency.
“Students displayed a troubling tendency to accept websites at face value,” wrote the study’s authors.
In fact, more than 80% of middle school students a few years earlier believed an ad identified by the words “sponsored content” was a real news story, a Stanford survey published in 2016 found; some students even mentioned it was sponsored content but still believed it was a news article.
“Young people’s ability to reason about the information on the Internet can be summed up in one word: bleak,” those authors wrote.
The confusion derives – at least in part, experts say – from the fact that most students aren’t being taught how to use mass media critically, said Polites of Media Literacy Now in New Jersey.
“We’ve given (teens) so little guidance,” Polites said. “And there’s so much life-changing risk that comes with that.”
From Manganello’s lesson, Akshara and Urja’s major takeaways included narrowing their focus on key terms, they said.
“I’ve done stuff like this before,” Urja said, “but we didn’t dive deep.”
While Manganello’s program at South Brunswick High School is a great model, right now it’s the exception, said Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education.
“We’re getting legislators to put their foot down and say, ‘We need to see some changes in our education system,’ but now it’s, ‘Where is the funding coming from?’” she said. “‘Where’s the support for teachers and their professional development? How are we really integrating this into our curriculum, across school(s), across a big area, across grade levels?’
“And that is a much broader, slower, more challenging conversation, because it’s expensive and time-consuming.”
New Jersey’s governor last year signed a law that requires the state Education Department to develop student learning standards in information literacy. And California starting this year requires media literacy instruction to be integrated into K-12 mathematics, science and history-social science curriculums when they’re revised, according to the bill.
But getting the frameworks and grade-specific lessons down in writing can take several drafts, even before public comment is sought and polished proposals presented to district leaders, said Elisabeth Yucis, associate director in the Professional Development and Instructional Issues Division at the New Jersey Education Association, an educators union.
All in all, the process could take a while, she said.
Meanwhile, Johnson, the history teacher at South Brunswick, hopes in 10 years his students will be able to find clarity in what they’re thinking and saying because of the foundation Manganello is creating for them.
Johnson wants his students to learn to say, “‘Wait a minute, why am I feeling like this? Do I believe this?’” he said. “Or, ‘I just told somebody something happened, but did I even check that that actually happened or that that’s even a big deal to me? Like, why am I saying it’s a big deal?’”
And indeed, Harrison, the ninth grader, already is thinking about how important these lessons are for the future.
“Now that there are more people turning 18 and a lot of them are getting all of their information from social media … I think that will impact how they vote and will impact the country as a result,” he said.
It’s why Manganello has spent nearly two decades perfecting how she teaches media literacy.
“These are kids that are going to go out and do brilliant things,” the librarian said. “We need them to think about how they accept information in a smarter way because I think that will change the way we all do.”

071RZGG9LI_0JU6AOOCHS6SBEV,House Democrats grow frustrated passing short-term bills to fund government,Ashlee Banks,"January 22, 2024 at 1:57 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/house-democrats-grow-frustrated-passing-165715012.html,"“This isn’t something that used to be that complicated. We used to be able to pass continuing resolutions on a regular basis,” said U.S. Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md.
Democratic U.S. House members have voiced frustrations with passing short-term funding bills after Congress last week again pushed through legislation that quelled fears of a partial government coming to fruition.
Congress on Thursday sent the stopgap funding bill to President Joe Biden, who signed it on Friday. The Republican-led House approved it on a 314-108 vote, much of the support coming from Democrats as Republicans were split. The measure, which funds federal agencies until March, easily passed the Senate, which is led by Democrats.
Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md. called the trend of passing continuing resolutions every couple of months is “dysfunctional and irrational.”
“This isn’t something that used to be that complicated,” he told theGrio.
“Issues may pop up here and there but, we weren’t creating scenarios where retirees or people who received government benefits or rely on government services had to worry about whether there would be some kind of discontinuation, break or delay,” in getting paid or receiving benefits, he added.
Rep. Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, told theGrio that passing so many short-term funding bills “sends a message that the Republican majority is incapable of governing.”
“When it comes to governing and keeping the government from shutting down, that is the most basic responsibility that we have,” she said.
“Hopefully people do recognize that the Democrats are the ones stepping up to make sure that these bills pass,” Brown added. “Republicans are simply creating chaos and confusion and uncertainty for people’s lives.”
Biden signed the short-term government bill into law on Friday, funding some federal government agencies until March 1 and the remaining programs until March 8.
This is the third continuing resolution that the federal government has passed since September, leaving Americans who depend on the federal government for their salaries or benefits unsure of what the long-term future holds.
“With the House Republicans in this Congress, it’s become kind of a Groundhog Day scenario,” Ivey said.
“It’s disappointing. At least we didn’t actually shut down the government, so I’ll give House Speaker Mike Johnson credit for that but, they need to figure out what they’re going to do over there,” he added.
The House passed the continuing resolution with 107 Republicans and 207 Democrats. Meanwhile, 106 House Republicans voted against the measure.
The vote for House Republicans was “almost an exact split down the middle” and then there were House Republicans “who expressly called for the government to shut down, Ivey said.

“I can’t figure it out. We should be able to keep the government open and pay our debts…House Democrats have had to rescue House Republicans from blowing it,” he added.
Brown told theGrio that if the government does not reach agreement to fund the government past March, a shutdown would be catastrophic particularly for constituents who rely on Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, better known as WIC, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.
“A prolonged shutdown could impact the most vulnerable people and increase food insecurity and financial hardship for some,” she said.
Ivey told theGrio that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers would also be impacted and see “payment delays, perhaps depending on what their role is in the agency, they may not get paid at all.”
“Many of them live paycheck to paycheck just like everybody else. So, you’re really putting them in a bad situation,” he said.
“Retirees and veterans are worried about what kind of services they’ll be able to continue to get,” he continued. “As for government contractors, I don’t think there’s any provision in place for them to get compensated.”
Brown told theGrio that it’s important that Americans “understand how dangerous, divisive and destructive the Republicans are with their antics.”
She stated, that House Republicans really want to “advance their own personal agendas over people.”

0982V8V25F_ESO9UXIE27LCVVE,Opinion: Our possibly short national nightmare,"Opinion by Richard Galant, CNN","January 21, 2024 at 11:19 PM·14 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/opinion-possibly-short-national-nightmare-141909751.html,"Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.
On August 9, 1974, the only unelected vice president in American history took the presidential oath of office at a White House ceremony. It was the day after President Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace.
“My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,” President Gerald Ford said.
“Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men. Here the people rule.” In words that sound almost foreign to our ears in the 21st century, Ford added, “As we bind up the internal wounds of Watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate.”
Last week the true-crime docuseries that shot to the top of the list of Netflix shows in the US was “American Nightmare.” But it wasn’t that kind of nightmare, or Gerald Ford’s one, that presidential candidate Nikki Haley invoked Monday after her third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.
“Our campaign is the last best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare,” the former UN ambassador said. She was referring to polls showing that the majority of Americans don’t want a rematch between President Joe Biden and the president he defeated in 2020, Donald Trump.
When the results of the New Hampshire primary are reported Tuesday, we’ll have a better sense of whether anyone can stand in the way of that dreaded rematch. If not, it won’t be as protracted a “national nightmare” as the two-year-long Watergate scandal that put Gerald Ford in the Oval Office. This year’s election is on November 5 — and the inauguration is only one year away. Though, depending on your point of view, the real nightmare could begin after the swearing-in.
Haley is walking a tightrope, trying to challenge Trump’s frontrunner status among Republicans without alienating his MAGA base. “There’s an outside chance she can pull off an upset win, carry New Hampshire and pierce Trump’s perceived cloak of invincibility, changing the course of the race,” wrote Frida Ghitis. “But there’s another way Haley can emerge victorious. That way has more to do with forces outside her control… If Trump is disqualified, somehow unable to run or perhaps convicted and made too toxic even for his supporters, the space could clear for the GOP’s second-place finisher to step in and become the nominee. Call it the banana peel path.”
Haley has been wary of directly going after the former president’s many vulnerabilities, while obliquely arguing that the nation can’t risk having a president in or nearing his 80s and that “chaos follows” Trump, whether or not it is his fault.
“Her ability to build momentum over the course of the primary showcases her political talent and ability to attract college-educated Republicans tired of having to explain away their support for a president whose hair-trigger social media posts verge into the unhinged,” wrote Patrick T. Brown.
Daniel McCarthy isn’t buying into the idea that Haley has momentum: “Former President Donald Trump’s easy win in Iowa on Monday confirms that there really is no race for the Republican nomination this year. With a deep freeze discouraging turnout, the caucuses provided a hard test of voter enthusiasm. Trump’s rivals failed it.”
“A measure of the former president’s insurmountable strength within the party is that he not only beat Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy, he also overcame all of the institutional powers backing them — some of the most formidable interests in the GOP.”
On the Democratic side, Biden isn’t even on the ballot Tuesday and isn’t campaigning in New Hampshire, due to a dispute between state and national party officials over the primary’s timing.
Rep. Dean Phillips, a low-profile 54-year-old legislator from Minnesota, is running in New Hampshire, SE Cupp noted, and is polling more strongly there than around the nation. It’s a longshot, Cupp noted, but “if Biden’s poll numbers keep going in the wrong direction, if voters feel taken for granted or even overlooked by Democrats, if a symbolic win in New Hampshire gives voters a reason to look more closely at Dean Phillips, well he might give Biden a run for his money.”
Karen Finney is the great-great-great-great niece of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and great-great-great granddaughter of a freed slave from Virginia.
“Walking through the door of my grandmother’s home in North Carolina,” Finney wrote, “it was impossible to miss a portrait of Lee proudly displayed on the wall. At mealtimes, during what occasionally felt like indoctrination, she would admiringly describe our famous ancestor, ‘the General,’ as a benevolent slave owner and noble warrior.”
“As she explained it, Lee valiantly fought an unjust ‘War of Northern Aggression’ in defense of ‘states’ rights,’ often referred to as ‘The Lost Cause.’ The South had been defeated, my grandmother insisted, only because the Northern army had more resources and slavery really wasn’t so bad.”
In Finney’s view, the Lost Cause is the backdrop for Trump’s suggestion that the Civil War could have been “negotiated,” the rewriting of history in school curriculums under Florida Gov. DeSantis’ administration and Haley’s struggle over the question of whether America is, or ever was, a racist country.
“Beyond absurdly omitting slavery as the root cause of the War, she made matters worse while trying to clean up her comments during a recent CNN Town Hall, saying she just assumed that slavery was a ‘given’ since all children learn about it in school in the South.”

Trump’s remark that immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of Americans evokes the words of Adolf Hitler in “Mein Kampf,” author Paul Moses pointed out. But he added that the concept goes further back — to the eugenics movement of the early 20th century.
In 1914, the year Edward Alsworth Ross became president of the American Sociological Association, he published a book warning that immigrants, Moses wrote, “would act on Americans’ standards for cleanliness, morality and education ‘like a slow poison.’ A nation that relies on immigration to maintain its population ‘deserves the extinction that surely awaits it,’ he wrote…The prejudice beneath Ross’ opinions was obvious, but his ideas were mainstream and respectable — he was considered a progressive reformer…”
“But Ross came to regret the implications of his ideas about supposedly superior and inferior races, writing shortly after World War II that ‘we never imagined the theory being made a hinge for German aggression to turn on.’ That’s what the phony claims of eugenics led to — Hitler’s ‘Final Solution,’ which resulted in the murder of 6 million Jews. It’s certainly worth having vigorous debates about immigration laws, but those who’ve been indifferent to or even supportive of Trump’s increasingly clear turn toward racist, eugenic ideas should confront what they’ve enabled.”
Republicans describe the immigration surge at the US southern border as an “invasion” that presents a national security threat. Yet, John Avlon wrote, Trump and some members of the House GOP, want to tank an emerging compromise in the Senate that would couple border security measures with aid to Ukraine.
“Speaker Mike Johnson is facing more threats from his far-right flank, who have been signaling that they will balk at any border security bill until a Republican is president.
“Right-wing resistance is entirely consistent with a Trump-ified GOP that is more willing to demagogue an issue than actually deal with it.”

Trump sat in a Manhattan courtroom Wednesday while E. Jean Carroll testified in support of her defamation case against the former president. Last May, she was awarded $5 million for battery and defamation when a jury found Trump liable for sexually assaulting her. Now Carroll is seeking at least $10 million in additional damages for Trump’s 2019 comments about her allegation.
As Danielle Campoamor wrote, “Carroll found herself facing down not only a man found liable for assaulting her, but also a former president and current presidential frontrunner — an unprecedented example of the power dynamics survivors face. While a victim of sexual assault receives death threats, her assailant receives endorsements and secures the Iowa caucus.”
“During Carroll’s testimony, Trump repeatedly shook his head, according to CNN reporters inside the courtroom, and could be heard ‘loudly saying things’ such as ‘it’s false,’ ‘she’s gotten her memory back,’ and, according to Carroll’s lawyer Shawn Crowley, that the lawsuit is ‘a witch hunt’ and a ‘con job.’”
When the judge threatened to oust Trump from the courtroom, the former president said, “I would love it.”
The chaotic court proceeding is just one example of why the Supreme Court should clear the way for allowing television cameras at Trump’s forthcoming election subversion trial, argued Robert C. Gottlieb. “Whether or not cameras are permitted, we know that Trump will continue to impugn the integrity of the proceedings, prosecutor and judge, twist the testimony and repeat his debunked conspiracy theories. His disturbing behavior that was on full display during Wednesday’s court proceedings will undoubtedly continue during his upcoming criminal trial.”
“The American people are entitled to see and hear for themselves what goes on in the courtroom so that they can draw their own conclusions from the evidence.”
The narrative of fast-worsening inequality over the past half century has been challenged in a new study by economists Gerald Auten and David Splinter. They used data to show that, compared to the 1960s, the pre-tax income of the top 1% has increased only by 2.6% and after accounting for taxes, the share of income going to the super-rich “hasn’t budged at all,” wrote Jordan McGillis. The study disputes a 2018 finding by Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman that the top 1% has seen its share of national pre-tax income go from 12% to 20% since the 1980s.
McGillis says there’s something else going on that tends to exacerbate inequality. Among rich Americans, marriage rates remain high, but they’ve plummeted for less affluent people, creating more single-person households with lower levels of income. “This cleavage makes possible what the Brookings Institution’s Melissa Kearney describes as “two-parent privilege,” an emerging phenomenon through which well-off couples transmit educational and economic advantages to their children. Viewed from this angle, it should not surprise us that many Americans think the rich are galloping ever further ahead.”
Elise Gould and Josh Bivens have a different take. Using Social Security Administration data, they found that the “share of earnings for the bottom 90% fell 9.7 percentage points between 1979 and 2022, while the share of earnings for the top 5% grew 8.8 percentage points. The very top — the top 0.1% of wage earners — nearly tripled its share of total earnings from 1.6% in 1979 to 4.6% in 2022… All of this straightforward data on earnings clearly shows a huge rise in inequality of pay in the US economy.”
The US and the UK struck back at the Houthis, the Yemeni insurgent group that is targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, but the lingering question was about how effective such a series of strikes can be. “We think of war as a last resort,” Elisabeth Kendall, head of Cambridge University’s Girton College told Peter Bergen. The Houthis “think of it as a way of life.”
“The Houthis have this massive advantage, which is that they don’t care about casualties, and they also don’t have to be accurate, as we have to be accurate when we’re operating in these theatres because we don’t want to kill civilians. All they have to do is lob missiles and drones into the Red Sea to have the effect that they want, which is to disrupt global shipping, rattle financial markets, create fear and look heroic at the same time. So, by taking out some of their launch sites, we have probably taken out some of their capability, but they will have expected that. They will have hidden some of their military assets,” Kendall said.
CNN Opinion senior editor Sheena McKenzie interviewed Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish, known as the first Palestinian doctor to hold a staff position at an Israeli hospital, and asked him about the future for Palestinian children amid the war in Gaza.
“There is no future for them,” he said. “How can we give them hope to stop this bloodshed? How can we start to give them a future, not to be an extremist or be a fanatic?”
“The cost of this war is not just what is happening now. The cost of war is the invisible ghost. It’s the post-war. The physical, social, spiritual and mental wounds that lasts generations.” (Hear more from Sheena McKenzie on the Tug of War podcast.)
There is a lot of talk but very little real debate about the Israel-Hamas conflict on US college campuses, wrote Peter Rutland, a professor of government at Wesleyan University.
“Instead, we see two parallel sets of conversations, some more civil than others, organized by those who ‘Stand with Israel’ and those seeking ‘Justice for Palestine.’… Many college students are taught that American society is the product of “settler colonialism” — a history of conquest and exploitation. In this simplistic framing, the plight of the Palestinians is just one more example of the familiar evils of settler colonialism. For those who see the conflict through this lens, the founding of Israel is treated as the equivalent of the European colonization of the Americas.”
“The Gaza war is better understood as a conflict between two competing nationalist projects than as a case of settler colonialism. There are a number of inconvenient historical truths that complicate the “settler colonialism” narrative.”
“It is a conflict in which each side — with good reason — sees itself as an embattled and threatened minority.”

When Holly Thomas was 12, she “received a large — unsolicited — Estee Lauder makeup sampler for Christmas. The box felt like a totem of my impending maturity, recognition that I would soon be allowed access to an as-yet out-of-reach club. I gave it pride of place on my bedroom table (swiftly rebranded as a “dresser” with the help of a soon-to-be filthy sarong), and before too long I was regularly being sent out of class, cheeks burning, to wash my contraband mascara off.”
“It wasn’t a particularly edifying phase, but neither was it very consequential. Today however, skin care is a far more serious business. Gone are the days of teens aimlessly browsing random drugstores by day and smudging their pillows with iridescent bronzer by night. Now, kids don’t just know how to cleanse properly, they’ve taken to beauty products with unprecedented zeal. Absurd though it sounds, that fervor is acutely ominous,” Thomas wrote.
“Dermatologists report children as young as nine, many of whom already maintain elaborate at-home skin care regimes coming to their offices for cosmetic consultations. Teens who’ve barely exited puberty are obsessing over the alleged ‘preventative’ anti-aging properties of Botox, and the internet is teeming with youngsters pleading for solutions to their ‘wrinkles.’ The fretting and groupthink involved bear all the hallmarks of a classic youthful infatuation. But this one comes with sinister undercurrents less familiar to the adults who went before them.”
“The most worrying thing about today’s skin care craze isn’t just that the financial and emotional buy-in are completely out of proportion to the “need” being addressed. They may set kids up for lasting damage. And thanks to the misinformation soup of social media, the gnarly, anxiety-provoking call is coming from inside the house.”

Last week, Khartoum had already announced that it was freezing relations with IGAD for inviting paramilitary chief Mohamed Hamdan Daglo – at war with army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan for nine months – to a summit in Uganda that discussed the Sudan conflict.
According to the United Nations humanitarian agency, OCHA, Sudan ""is facing one of the fastest unfolding crises globally,"" with more than 7.4 million people displaced and more than half the population needing humanitarian assistance.
The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project analyst group puts the death toll at more than 13,000.
In a statement released on Saturday, Sudan's foreign ministry said a letter had been sent to President Ismail Omar Guelleho of Djibouti, current chair of the bloc, ""to inform him of the Sudanese government decision suspending its membership in this organisation"".
At a summit on Thursday, IGAD reiterated its call for ""an immediate and unconditional ceasefire"" in the ""unjust war affecting the people"" of Sudan.
The bloc also expressed ""continued readiness to offer its good offices to facilitate an all-inclusive peace process"" and again called for a face-to-face meeting between the two sides.
The RSF has also been accused of ethnically motivated mass killings, rampant looting and rapes.

Meanwhile, President Joe Biden -- who has stated that the U.S.-backed Israel has a right to defend itself in the wake of the October 7 attacks by the Iran-backed militant group Hamas -- seemed to indicate that the same promise of security might not be offered to the Palestinian state.
""There are a number of types of two-state solutions,"" Biden told reporters after a call with Netanyahu. ""There's a number of countries that are members of the U.N. that are still -- don't have their own military; a number of states that have limitations, and so I think there's ways in which this can work.""
Hamas has stated that its attack last year came after raids on the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, by Israeli Police and violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers, leading to the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians in a decades-long conflict that has been on-and-off since before the Israeli state existed.
In his remarks, Guterres said that the denial of the right to full statehood for Palestine, which is already recognized as a nation by most countries around the world, is ""unacceptable.""
""The right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all,"" Guterres said.
But some high-ranking Israeli politicians don't agree, like Itamar Ben-Gvir -- who lives in an illegal Israeli settlement in Palestine's West Bank.""I do deny a Palestinian state,"" Ben-Gvir said on Twitter on Saturday. ""Always!"" His post was liked by nearly 3,000 people as of Sunday morning."

0D74RS41IP_17AHD712PZYXJTB,Historic California floods of 1861-62 featured 8 weeks of atmospheric rivers,Scott Sistek,"January 21, 2024 at 9:00 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/historic-california-floods-1861-62-120046979.html,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. – Imagine Disneyland under feet of water for weeks. Rivers swelling to levels never seen before and never seen since. Days of rain stretch into weeks as floodwaters rise to epic levels.
California may have endured an onslaught of tropically-infused atmospheric river storms that filled the calendar for months at the end of 2022 and the start of 2023 and is staring at another atmospheric river this weekend, but those storms pale in comparison to the historic floods during the winter of 1861-1862.
The storms were a recipe for disaster for a young region that had recently been settled. Abraham Lincoln was president at the time, and America was embroiled in the first months of the Civil War. But out West, California's population was bulging to about a half million in the wake of the great Gold Rush about a dozen years prior.
7 FACTS ABOUT FLOODPLAINS
Many of the newcomers settled in flat areas near the river for water supply and ease of commerce and transportation, with mining, ranching and agriculture the main fuel for the economy. In the East, where many came from, floods occurred with thunderstorms in spring and summer, not during the fall and winter. They were also not accustomed to living near large mountain ranges that concentrate rainfall into confined riverbeds.
So when the first of a series of likely atmospheric river-type storms hit the West Coast on Dec. 2, 1861, it was a new experience for many.
The storm first struck Oregon's Willamette Valley and southern Washington Territory, according to research by meteorologist Larry Schick. The temperature reading at Fort Vancouver in Washington Territory was 58 degrees at 7 a.m. – well above average and signaling a warm, tropically-infused atmospheric river-type storm that would have carried plenty of moisture.
Shick found the storm would dump so much rain it would flood the Willamette River with raging waters equal to the flow of the mighty Mississippi River – a river 100 times larger.  Now 162 years later, that storm still remains the flood of record for the Willamette. It's not alone.
Schick found the storm eventually pushed south and redeveloped into another atmospheric river-type storm as it crashed into southern Oregon, then Northern California.
SEE SOME OF THE MOST CATASTROPHIC ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS AND FLOODING IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY
The Sacramento River would jump from about 2-3 feet deep to 20 feet deep and set the first of four all-time records that winter.
HOW FLOODWATER CAN MAKE YOU VERY SICK
""These sustained and multiple, building river level peaks are rare and are testimony to the consistent magnitude of the series of storms,"" Schick said.
As the end of December neared, the storm track shifted to the south, now aiming one juicy storm after another at California, while the Pacific Northwest went into an eventual deep freeze.
Storms would keep smashing into California for the next 7-8 weeks. Schick estimated that six of the storms would be categorized as at least ""exceptional"" atmospheric river storms.
""Measurements on the Sacramento River indicate the first and most substantial rise in December peaking about Dec. 12,"" Schick said. ""The river did not recede much after that. Subsequent storms pushed it up to several more, even higher peaks into mid-January 1862. The flooding just wouldn't quit.""
THESE ARE THE RAINIEST HOUR AND MINUTE IN AMERICAN HISTORY
Widespread flooding swamped large stretches of Central California's valleys. In one stretch of valley that measured about 30 miles wide and 250 miles long, water depths ranged from a few inches to 30 feet in some areas. Telegraph poles were underwater.
""It's documented that Leland Stanford, newly elected governor of California, was rowed to his inauguration in flooded downtown Sacramento during the floods,"" Schick said. ""Many wanted to move the capital from Sacramento to San Francisco because of the flooding. Damages to California included losing 25% of its tax base. The state teetered with bankruptcy.""
Southern California wasn't spared as the relentless storm track moved south into the region in January 1862. The Santa Ana River in Southern California measured water flow on Jan. 22 at 318,000 cubic feet per second – about half the flow of the Mississippi River despite being a tiny fraction of its size.
Floodwaters stretched across the Los Angeles Basin and parts of Orange County, south into San Diego.  Where Disneyland sits today would have been flooded under 2-4 feet of water for 3-6 weeks, according to Schick.
WHY CALIFORNIA IS PRIMED FOR LANDSLIDES
""Poor little Snow White would have been doing the backstroke to get to Tomorrowland,"" he said.
Finally, some of the cold air that had been freezing the Pacific Northwest sinks down and shuts off the storm track. But not before leaving its icy mark across that region.
The Seattle area would drop below 0 degrees, while the temp dropped to -29 degrees in Walla Walla and just 23 degrees in San Francisco. The Columbia, Willamette and Fraser rivers all froze solid.
It was the incredible amounts of water that fell from the sky that would leave the greatest mark.
Eight major rivers in the West still have the 1862 floods as their high-water marks: The Willamette, Rogue and Klamath rivers in Oregon, and the Stanislaus, American, Tuolomne, Salinas and Santa Ana rivers in California. Schick pointed out that the large floods of 1964 and 1996 on the Willamette may have reached those lofty levels if not for more modern-day flood control efforts.
""Proves dams and reservoirs can help,"" Schick said.
7 FACTS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT FLASH FLOODS
The Salinas River caused major flooding earlier this year with the train of atmospheric rivers and reached a peak flood of 27 feet. In 1862, the river reached 32 feet.
In addition, the Colorado River's largest flow measurement is also from 1862 at an incredible 400,000 cubic feet per second due to massive snowmelt later in the spring.
The 50-day rainfall in San Francisco during last winter's relentless storms peaked at 20.49 inches, according to John Christy, Ph.D., with the University of Alabama. It’s a mere 63% of the 32.43 inches that fell during the 1861-62 storms.
Schick estimated that as impressive as the snowpack was in the Sierras this past winter, it was likely 10-20% more in the winter of 1861-62. California's Mammoth Mountain had 715 inches of seasonal snowfall in 2022-23, but Schick estimates snowfall reached around 840 inches in 1862. Some 16 feet of snow fell in the Holcomb Valley on the eastern slopes of the San Bernardino Mountains in 1862.
THE SOUND OF SILENCE: WHY IT’S QUIETER AFTER A SNOWSTORM
Schick said to put that winter in perspective, take the flooding storms of this past year, then add in the major flooding storms in Northern California in 1964, 1986 and 1997 plus the major Southern California rainstorms of 1938 and 1969, and then you'll see rivers approach or exceed those all-time records.
About 4,000 people died in the floods, and the damage cost in today's dollars is around an estimated $3 billion, according to NOAA.
""We must prepare, but nothing will stop a repeat of 1861-62 ... or something even worse,"" Schick said. ""Most disturbing is that climate models suggest stronger atmospheric rivers in the future.""
WHAT DOES THE TERM '100-YEAR FLOOD' ACTUALLY MEAN?
Climatologists estimate a storm of the magnitude of 1861-62 would occur about every 200 years. Schick said his recent research using paleo sediment profiles indicated another series of atmospheric rivers that hit the area in the early 1600s may have even been much worse than 1862.
""So, understanding, modeling, and preparing for repeat is really important,"" Schick said.

Grant Shapps said it was ""disappointing"" that Israel's prime minister has rejected the idea.
Benjamin Netanyahu's position was not ""a surprise"", he told the BBC.
But Mr Shapps said Palestinians ""deserved"" a sovereign state, adding ""I really don't see that there is another solution"".
Following a call with US President Joe Biden on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu's office released a statement saying he had ""reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty"".
Mr Shapps said the comments were ""very disappointing"".
""It's not in some senses a surprise - he's spent his entire political career against a two-state solution. But the point is, which other route is there to seriously resolve this?"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.
""Palestinians deserve a sovereign state, Israel deserves to have the full ability to defend itself, its own security.
""Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution.""
He added there were a variety of views within the Israeli government ""so we very much distinguish between the views of individuals and our overall support for Israel as a country"".
Labour has also described Mr Netanyahu's comments as ""completely unacceptable"".
Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told Sky News: ""Statehood of a people is not in the gift of its neighbour, it is the right of a people and it is the right of the Palestinian people.""
Netanyahu defies Biden over Palestinian state
Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?
Mr Netanyahu's remarks appeared to deepen a public divide with the US.
Speaking to reporters after the call between the two leaders, Mr Biden insisted a two-state solution was still possible with Mr Netanyahu in office.
""There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that... don't have their own militaries,"" he said.
Hamas killed about 1,300 people and took 240 hostages in its surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October.
In response, Israel launched airstrikes and a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.
According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, more than 25,000 people have been killed in the territory since the start of the conflict.
Also appearing on the programme, Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf, whose parents-in-law were trapped in Gaza for more than three weeks in the early stages of the war, repeated his call for an immediate ceasefire.
Asked if he thought people sometimes placed a different value on Palestinian lives, he said: ""Without a shadow of a doubt. If you talk to anybody who is Palestinian, you speak to many people in the Muslim community, they feel that the Palestinian blood is very cheap."""

JD Vance argued 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley would likely be unable to survive Democratic attacks if elected the party's nominee, saying she's ""the candidate that Democrats haven't teed off on.""
""Nikki does have baggage. She just hasn't faced the onslaught of years of media attacks, of super PAC attacks that Donald Trump has faced. And frankly, the fact that Trump is still standing and still leading in the polls against Joe Biden suggests he has real political resilience,"" Vance told Fox News' Shannon Bream on ""Fox News Sunday.""
Bream aired a clip of her asking New Hampshire voters who they supported ahead of the Granite State's primary on Tuesday, with one woman explaining she's voting for Haley because she has ""no baggage."" Vance, who is serving as a surrogate for the Trump campaign, pushed back that Haley does have ""baggage,"" but Democrats have not attacked her, as they have Trump, in recent years.

""I know a lot of people who are choosing Nikki Haley think she's the low baggage candidate. In reality, she's the candidate that Democrats haven't teed off on, but they will tee off on her if she's the nominee,"" Vance said, adding that Haley ""won't be"" the nominee.

""But if she is [the nominee], she will face exactly what Donald Trump has faced for the past six years, and I don't think she'll survive, and I certainly don't think she'll win the presidency through it. That's why we need to elect the guy who's shown some resilience. That's why we need to nominate Donald Trump,"" he said.
Trump solidified himself as the Republican frontrunner for 2024 last week, when he handily won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. He is now focusing on the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.
While some polls, such as one published by American Research Group Inc., showed Haley and Trump tied for support, others have shown Trump with a stronger advantage over the former South Carolina governor.
HALEY TURNS UP THE HEAT ON TRUMP AS SHE TRIES TO CLOSE THE GAP IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY
Trump has 55% support among those likely to vote in the primary, compared to Haley's 36% support and DeSantis' 6% support, a Suffolk University, the Boston Globe and NBC10 poll found.
Bream cited the Suffolk poll, as well as a CNN poll that found Trump has 50% support to Haley's 39%, and noted to Vance that many voters in New Hampshire are undeclared, but vote in the GOP primary.
TRUMP SAYS NIKKI HALEY 'HAS NO CHANCE' AHEAD OF NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY: 'MAGA IS NOT GOING TO BE WITH HER'
""There are a couple of newspaper editorials today endorsing Nikki Haley, telling people if you're independent get out, ‘save the country and vote in that GOP primary.’ I mean, that's a substantial group of people here. How concerned are you about them showing up and not choosing President Trump on Tuesday?"" Bream asked.
Vance responded that liberals who recently moved out of Massachusetts to New Hampshire would ""never"" vote for a Republican nominee – whether they be Trump or Haley - and are instead ""trying to play spoiler to Donald Trump"" and his primary race.
""I think a lot of them are going to vote for Donald Trump and also liberal… many of them from Massachusetts who are moving to New Hampshire, they're never going to vote for a Republican nominee, even if it's Nikki Haley,"" Vance said.
""They're just trying to play spoiler to Donald Trump. But I think Republicans really have to ask ourselves, do we want liberal suburbanites from Massachusetts to choose our nominee? Or do we want to choose our nominee as Republicans and independent-minded conservatives? I think if we choose our nominee, Donald Trump is going to win, and he's going to win handily,"" Vance added.

0LW4X3QVJS_TDTBPPTKS1DBLML,Iran blames Israel for assassination of its military advisors in Damascus missile strike,"Sarah El Sirgany, Adam Pourahmadi, Artemis Moshtaghian and Jonny Hallam, CNN","January 21, 2024 at 7:32 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/iran-blames-israel-assassination-military-223210390.html,"At least five Iranian military advisors and a number of Syrian forces were killed in an Israeli missile strike on a building in Damascus on Saturday, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, in another sign of building hostilities in the Middle East as Israel’s war with Hamas enters its fourth month.
The alleged strike targeted the Mazzeh neighborhood in Syria’s capital, home to several diplomatic missions including the Iranian embassy, according to Syrian authorities.
Israel “launched an air attack from the Golan Heights at 10:20 a.m. local time that targeted a residential building in the Mazzeh neighborhood,” the Syrian Ministry of Defense alleged, adding that some missiles were shot down by national defense forces.
A number of buildings and nearby vehicles around the targeted building were damaged in the blast, Syria’s state broadcaster reported, with civil defense teams still searching for victims trapped under the rubble.
The Israel Defense Forces declined to comment on the incident, telling CNN, “We do not comment on foreign reports.”
One of the dead, Hojjatollah Omidvar, was described by Iran’s semi-official Student News Network as a deputy chief of the Quds Force intelligence unit in Syria – one of five branches of the Revolutionary Guards unit in charge of foreign operations.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) identified the four others killed as military advisors Ali Aghazadeh, Hossein Mohammadi, Saeed Karimi and Mohammad Amin Samadi. Their presence in Syria had been “at the official invitation of the Syrian government,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson, Nasser Kanaani, noted in a statement on social media.
The attack in Damascus comes amid concerns that Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza is spiraling into a regional war. In northern Iraq, an Iranian missile attack last week targeted what Tehran claimed to be a spy base for Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. in Lebanon, militant group Hezbollah has engaged in near-daily confrontations with Israeli forces across the border. And from Yemen, Houthi rebels have launched a series of attacks on commercial ships and Western military vessels in the Red Sea.
Attacks by Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East won’t stop until Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza ends, Tehran’s top diplomat warned on Wednesday, echoing comments by several groups in Iran’s network of influence.
“If the genocide in Gaza stops, then it will lead to the end of other crises and attacks in the region,” Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday.
Since Israel launched its ground and air campaign in Gaza, in response to Hamas’ bloody October 7 terror attacks, nearly 25,000 people have been killed in the blockaded Palestinian enclave – the majority of them women and children – according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.
The US, a key Israel ally, has also stepped in militarily, launching strikes in Yemen with the aim of degrading Houthi capabilities to harm the vital Red Sea shipping lane. In comments on Wednesday, State Department spokesperson Matt Miller emphasized that a larger conflagration could be avoided and highlighted a flurry of US diplomatic activity in the Middle East.
“We continue to engage in diplomatic efforts to try to make clear to everyone in the region that we don’t want to see the conflict escalated, that we don’t think it’s in any country’s interest to see the conflict escalated,” Miller said Wednesday.
But the path to de-escalation will be hard to find. Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi on Saturday vowed to “punish” Israel for the Damascus missile strike. The killing was “another stain on the record of all governments who claim to be the advocates of human rights because it violated Syria’s airspace and trampled on human and international laws,” he said, in comments reported by Iranian state media.

0N37RBZOIP_TPS36OAKN7EB95J,The Bali purification ceremony gaining popularity among Aussies,Laura Koefoed·News Reporter,Updated 21 January 2024 at 2:36 pm·4-min read,20240121,yahoo.com,https://au.news.yahoo.com/the-bali-purification-ceremony-gaining-popularity-among-aussies-063614238.html,"Walking through a peaceful Balinese temple surrounded by a rainforest the last thing you would expect to hear is the sound of someone loudly sobbing. But, as you get closer to the flowing water the sound is unmistakable — a woman is screaming as if she could be in pain.
Despite how things may first seem, thousands of Aussies and other international travellers continue to flock to Bali for the same experience, with so many saying it is the ""one thing you need to do"" while there. ""Such an amazing experience,"" one woman called Chaz said after sharing a video of herself online crying while taking part in the ceremony.
The traditional Balinese Purification ritual has blown up on social media over the last couple of years as wellness tourism continues to grow in the post-pandemic world.
Videos of tourists like Chaz, wearing traditional sarongs, surrounded by water and flowers as they scream, cry or hold themselves is not an uncommon sight, prompting many to wonder what this emotional ceremony actually is and why so many have chosen to take part in it.
The Balinese purification ceremony, known as ""Melukat"", is part of the Hindu religion and is performed to cleanse the body, both spiritually and physically by washing or bathing in holy water. It is just one element of Tirtayatra — a Balinese Hindu pilgrimage.
""Any religion can join [the] purification ceremony,"" Helena, manager at Tri Desna Spiritual Centre in Ubud, Indonesia shared with Yahoo News Australia. ""This is our tradition here in Bali, and I remember since I [was] little we always perform purification ceremony at least once a year and sometimes more.""
A Balinese healer, known as a Balian, will lead the sacred ritual and guide those participating through their water cleansing. After being washed in the holy water, an offering is left as thanks, usually made of coconut leaves and filled with colourful flowers and other items.
Each place does it slightly differently and may include additional steps before and after Melukat. At Tri Desna, Ibu Desak Akeno is the healer and performs a reading before the ceremony as well as a blessing at the end.

Helena says they receive ""a lot of questions"" about how people react to the purification ceremony. ""It all differs,"" she shares. ""Some people tend to feel drowsy, some people will cry and some will laugh and smile — it all depends on you and how you feel.""
Ibu Desak is there to try to help people ""let go"" of their emotions, which means that while some people let out cries as they release their pent-up emotions, some may not — it is all individual.
As tourism in Bali has grown over the years alongside social media usage, so has the knowledge of their spiritual ceremonies.
Helena explains there have been many Australians coming to join the ceremony in recent years. ""It was always there, but since there is technology like Instagram or other social media it’s just become more popular,"" she shares. ""There [are] more tourists now performing this experience than before.""
Travel companies also offer a huge range of ""wellness"" trips and retreats which include traditional healing ceremonies, meditation, and other traditional Balinese medicine.
This coincides with the growth in wellness trends seen across the globe, particularly since Covid-19. The Global Wellness Institute states the wellness economy has grown a whopping 27% since 2020 and projects that wellness tourism, in particular, will grow by 16.6% annually, reaching $1.4 trillion in 2027.
""The drive to create greater awareness and acceptance of mental health and its nuances has meant more focused programs to support this growing need,"" they stated in 2023 while looking at 2022 wellness trends and the rise in wellness tourism.
Tri Desna performs private purification ceremonies for $152 and is based in Sayan, Ubud but there are many places that host this ceremony in Indonesia. Other locations include the Pura Tirta Empul near the town of Tampaksiring, Bali which is one of the more famous locations to do Melukat or the Taman Mumbul Temple in Badung Regency, Bali.

Ralph Norman, R-S.C., touted GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s ""youth,"" on Sunday and went after former President Trump’s age ahead of this week’s New Hampshire primaries, highlighting moments when Trump named Haley instead of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., while speaking about Jan. 6 during a rally over the weekend.
Norman, one of the few elected officials from South Carolina backing former South Carolina Gov. Haley, appeared on ""Fox News Sunday,"" stressing how Haley, at age 52, is 25 years younger than the 77-year-old Trump. ""His policies were great. What he did was great for the country, particularly with what Biden is doing now,"" Norman said of Trump, explaining why he's now supporting Haley instead. ""But it's time for a change – I think the youth – Nikki just turned 52. She's 25 years younger than Donald Trump.""
""I'm sorry,"" he continued. ""When you have a president, like, the pressures they're going to be facing, when you see what they're going to have to do to attract new talent into the Congress, in the Senate, you've got to go to work doing that. Nikki will do that. And, to the other big thing that people need to know, Donald Trump can only give you four years. It's like a football team can only play half of the game. It's going to take eight years to get this country straight. But Nikki's youth and the fact is, she can give eight years. And I would also make the argument is really three years, because the last year of a term is political, like you're seeing now. And President Trump is going to be tied up in, you know, legal fights.""
Norman argued that the only reason Trump is criticizing Haley now is ""because she's gaining in the polls and she, he knows, she is a serious threat. And it's a two-person race now.""
Trump has argued that with Haley as president, the country would see eight years of war and has called her a globalist.
TRUMP MIXES UP NIKKI HALEY WITH NANCY PELOSI AT NEW HAMPSHIRE RALLY
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
""That's just political talk,"" Norman said, noting how Trump chose Haley to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ""Donald Trump knows that. The same thing, you know, he got her confused yesterday with Nancy Pelosi on Jan. 6 with the National Guard. And I would say 25 years ago, he wouldn't have made that mistake, but he kept saying, Nikki Haley did this, you know, with the National Guard. He was talking about Nancy Pelosi. And that's another example of, you know, he wouldn't have made that mistake if he was younger.""
Trump, while referring to the crowds at a rally in Concord, New Hampshire, Friday, brought up Haley when mentioning the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.
""By the way, they never report the crowd on Jan. 6, you know, Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, you know, they did, you know, they destroyed all of the information and all of the evidence. Everything deleted it. Destroyed all of it. All of it because lots of things – like Nikki Haley is in charge of security. We offered 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guard. So whatever they want, they turned it down. They don't want to talk about that. These are very dishonest people. But when I look over here, I am so honored. They said this is a quaint area, area of the state, but it's quaint. We got a lot of people in this room, this an all time record,"" Trump said, prompting applause.
Trump has long accused Pelosi of refusing National Guard support at the Capitol a day before the riot.
TRUMP: ALMOST EVERYBODY IN SOUTH CAROLINA HAS ENDORSED ME
Yet after the apparent mix-up, conservative voices on X championed the move.
""Trump just got the entire media to finally admit Nancy Pelosi was in charge of security on Jan 6,"" Jack Posobiec, senior editor of Human Events, wrote to his 2.4 million followers.
At another rally Saturday in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump stressed how, ""almost every politician from South Carolina is endorsing me,"" while surrounded by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, the state's lieutenant governor and other senior statewide officials, including the state's attorney general, treasurer and House speaker, as well as U.S. Reps. Joe Wilson, William Timmons and Russell Fry on stage.
Campaigning elsewhere in the Granite State on Saturday, Haley had gone after Trump's mental fitness, pointing to remarks he made on Friday.
""They’re saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he’s talking about Nancy Pelosi,"" Haley said Saturday, as she campaigned in Keene, New Hampshire. ""He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario. The concern I have is – I’m not saying anything derogatory – but when you’re dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do this… We can’t.""
Speaking at a Bloomberg News forum on Saturday in Manchester, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney referenced Haley's remarks and said Trump ""made a pretty apparent gaffe last night."" ""It’s a distinction without a difference. It’s Nikki and Nancy,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said to reporters Saturday night. ""What’s the difference?""
At his rally Saturday night in Manchester, Trump said he took a cognitive test and ""aced it.""
A day earlier, Sen. Tim Scott, who ended his own 2024 bid in November and was appointed to the Senate by Haley in 2012, endorsed Trump over Haley in a rousing call-and-response speech of his own in New Hampshire. Since entering the race nearly a year ago, Haley has advocated for ""mental competency tests"" for older politicians, a swipe at both Trump and President Biden. At age 81, Biden has drawn increasing concern over his mental and physical fitness, even from members of his own party raising eyebrows about his public appearances.

Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said he and the Immigration Minister Marc Miller were considering visas and other measures.
The two ministers are looking for ""the appropriate way to ensure that people who arrived from Mexico arrived for the appropriate reasons and that this doesn't become sort of a side door to get access to Canada,"" LeBlanc said.
""We're looking at a number of measures that would, in fact, put us in a position to have done what's necessary to ensure that these flights directly from Mexico don't become sort of an indirect way to get access to Canada and to claim asylum,"" he added.
In a letter last week, Quebec Premier Francois Legault urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to stem the flow of refugees into the province and to compensate it for costs, claiming Quebec's services were close to a ""breaking point"" due to the rising number.
""Mexican nationals represent a growing proportion of the asylum seekers arriving in Quebec, the possibility of entering Canada from Mexico without a visa certainly explains part of the flow of asylum seekers,"" Legault wrote in the letter.
Ottawa is coming under pressure for its immigration policies because they are blamed for exacerbating a housing crunch, and because some services provided by the provinces, like education and healthcare, are struggling to keep up with population growth.

Nataliya Humenyuk said marines and paratroopers are concerned over huge losses in the assaults.
She said former prisoners and poorly trained reservists typically carry out costly frontal assaults.
Russian marines and paratroopers are refusing to launch certain types of assaults due to concerns over the huge losses other troops are suffering, a Ukrainian official said, the Kyiv Post reported.
Nataliya Humenyuk, a press secretary for the Armed Forces of Ukraine's Joint Command South, said that the soldiers considered ""themselves 'elite troops'"" and did not ""want to go into frontal assaults"" that former felons and reservists typically carry out, the outlet reported.
Throughout the Russian invasion, Russia has become increasingly reliant on high-risk frontal assaults involving waves of attacks that probe Ukrainian positions and seize small portions of territory at the cost of substantial casualties.
The leader of the mercenary Wagner Group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died in a plane crash last August after leading a failed mutiny in June, described the tactic as a ""meat grinder.""
Humenyuk cited Russian attacks on Krynky in the Kherson Oblast in southern Ukraine, saying that Russian troops assaulting Ukrainian marine positions there were being hit with losses of more than 50%.
""At present in our sector the number of units of the type 'Shtorm-Z' [low-grade Russian units made of up older reservists and former felons, often committed to carry out human wave attacks] is falling and we are seeing more naval infantry and paratroopers,"" Humenyuk said.
""But they consider themselves 'elite troops,' and they don't want to go into frontal assaults like that,"" she added.
One of Russia's newly formed paratrooper units, the 104th Guards Airborne Division, appeared to be hit particularly hard in its combat debut in the Kherson region late last year, the UK Ministry of Defence said in an update on the conflict in December.
It said the unit ""highly likely suffered exceptionally heavy losses and failed to achieve its objectives during its combat debut in Kherson Oblast,"" aimed at dislodging Ukrainian positions near Krynky.
Krynky has been the scene of heavy fighting over the past few months as Ukrainian forces have attempted to recapture ground across the Dnipro River.
Conditions in the region have made fighting difficult for both sides, with marshes, water-filled bomb craters, and mud making it almost impossible for troops to dig in, The New York Times reported.
Despite Ukrainian officials' claims that the country's marines had gained ground on the eastern side of the river, soldiers and marines told The Times that this was an exaggeration.
""There are no positions. There is no such thing as an observation post or position,"" Oleksiy, a soldier who fought in Krynky and only gave his first name, said. ""It is impossible to gain a foothold there. It's impossible to move equipment there.""
""It's not even a fight for survival,"" he added. ""It's a suicide mission.""
But its success in the skies above the Dnipro bolstered Ukraine's difficult position on the ground.
Russia appears to be struggling to defend against Ukraine's drone attacks because of a shortage of electronic-warfare capability in the area, the UK's Ministry of Defence said.
Ukraine's forces have been using first-person-view drones to strike Russian vehicles, the UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence update.
The ministry said that a Russian military blogger estimated that 90% of Russian military equipment deployed around Krynky has been destroyed.

Roda Osman, a student in the African and African Diaspora Studies Department at the University of Texas at Austin, was recently charged with felony-level theft by deception. In September, a friend of Osman's started a GoFundMe called ""Help Roda Recover"" after Osman was allegedly hit in the face with a brick.
On Saturday, Osman told Fox News Digital she's innocent and that she is ""heartbroken"" over the allegations.
Osman posted a video on social media where she alleged that she was assaulted by a man who asked for her phone number and was rejected. In the footage, she appeared visibly upset and pointed to a swollen part of her face.

""This man just hit me in my face with a brick and all these Black men just watched, and they don't give a f–k,"" Osman said.

The video was widely circulated on Twitter and, according to NBC reporting at the time, the situation, ""[pointed] to a familiar pattern of backlash hurled at Black women when they publicly denounce harm from Black men.""
According to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital, the Houston Police Department claims that Osman was in an altercation with a man when she was hit with a water bottle.
""It appeared Defendant Osman and [the man] were in the middle of a verbal argument when Defendant Osman swung her right hand while holding an unknown object and hit [the man] in the face,"" the documents read. ""[The man] then swung his right hand while holding what appeared to be a plastic water bottle and struck Defendant in the face.""
""The video footage capturing the incident did not support Defendant Osman's recorded statement.""

Police also said they were contacted by a caller who accused Osman of running a fraudulent GoFundMe in 2020.
The 2020 GoFundMe was reportedly titled ""Help Black Muslim Mother Pay Her Medical Bill,"" and claimed that Osman was ""viciously assaulted by private security in Minneapolis, sustaining multiple facial contusions, a black eye and injuries to her leg. She needs an estimated $5,000 to pay for medical bills, legal fees, a new phone and more.""
The caller contacted the Minneapolis Police Department, but said that police could not corroborate the alleged assault. Authorities also spoke with a roommate named Rachel who accused Osman of scamming in the past.
""Ms. Rachel stated at first they were cool, but that she discovered Roda was scamming people and she wanted no part of it,"" the document said. ""Ms. Rachel mentioned the scam Roda took part in by creating the GoFundMe in 2020 claiming someone hit her but it was a lie.""
Osman spoke with Fox News Digital about the allegations on Saturday. She said that the head injury she suffered prevented her from knowing exactly what she had been struck by.

""I'm not guilty…as a person who suffered from a head injury from blunt force trauma and went online five minutes later for my own safety, I'm not obligated to remember every single detail correctly,"" Osman explained. ""That is unprecedented, and it's dangerous to victim-blame in that way, and to also hold me to a standard that is not legal.""
""I didn't see the weapon he hit me with,"" the student added. ""[A brick] is what it felt like. And that was the only weapon that I saw when I opened my eyes and I looked up…so that's what I believe the weapon of choice was.""
Osman also told Fox News Digital that she was being targeted by the ""manosphere,"" a group of anti-feminist social media users.
""The manosphere [is] targeting me…for speaking out against a Black man because Black women are supposed to protect Black men from the justice system,"" she said. ""But I refuse to be silenced when I have been harmed so brutally.""

According to Osman's UT–Austin webpage, her interests include ""Black feminist theory, ethnography, urban social movements, Black diasporic studies [and] decolonial studies."" Osman told Fox News Digital that the legal situation is making it difficult for her to focus on school.
""It's a horrible precedent to set for Black women, because Black women are already unprotected, and we are already silenced,"" Osman said. ""And this is sending a really bad message to all Black women telling them that if you are assaulted, and you do not remember every single detail correctly, you will be criminalized. And that is awful. And it's a scary, scary thing and I feel so heartbroken.""
GoFundMe told Fox News Digital that Osman has been banned from its website.

(WFLA) — A man with a lengthy criminal history was arrested for stealing a cash register from Walmart in Florida, according to the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office.
Deputies said during the theft at a Palm Coast Walmart on Dec. 10, 43-year-old John Michael Wakefield, of Wellington, was confronted by an employee, who he then shoved out of the way.
‘Get him:’ Florida woman accused of ordering pit bull attack on ex-boyfriend, report says
Detectives used facial recognition, his grey Hyundai SUV and his distinct red “Key West” T-shirt to eventually track and apprehend him in Ocoee. Inside his vehicle was that same “Key West” shirt, along with methamphetamine, a ski mask, and a “realistic looking” airsoft pellet gun.
“This dirtbag made the mistake of coming to Flagler County to commit his crime not knowing we have extensive technology, and an amazing RTCC and investigative team,” Sheriff Rick Staly said. “He didn’t learn from his previous time behind bars and hopefully the courts will send him back to prison. I commend our investigative team, our Real Time Crime Center team, and the Florida Highway Patrol for bringing him to justice and ending his crime spree.”
Wakefield is a convicted felon who spent 10 years behind bars for armed robbery. He was released in 2021. He has a history of trafficking and possessing narcotics, grand theft, and robbery.
Wakefield is being held at the Orange County Corrections Facility and once transferred to a Flagler County detention facility, he will be held on a $60,000 bond.

12KRQ1I2HY_FHH9W7QAOU0JMSK,Latest EPA assessment shows almost no improvement in river and stream nitrogen pollution,BY MELINA WALLING and MICHAEL PHILLIS,"January 21, 2024 at 10:40 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/latest-epa-assessment-shows-almost-144002016.html,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — The nation’s rivers and streams remain stubbornly polluted with nutrients that contaminate drinking water and fuel a gigantic dead zone for aquatic life in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a recently released Environmental Protection Agency assessment.
It’s a difficult problem that's concentrated in agricultural regions that drain into the Mississippi River. More than half of the basin’s miles of rivers and streams were in poor condition for nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer that drains into waterways, the agency found. For decades, federal and state officials have struggled to control farm runoff, the biggest source of nutrient pollution that is not typically federally regulated.
It’s a problem only expected to get harder to control as climate change produces more intense storms that dump rain on the Midwest and South. Those heavy rains flood farm fields, pick up commercial fertilizers and carry them into nearby rivers.
“It’s really worrying that we are clearly not meeting the goals that we’ve set for ourselves,” said Olivia Dorothy, director of river restoration with the conservation group American Rivers.
The assessment is based on samples collected in 2018 and 2019 and it allows experts to compare river conditions from previous rounds of sampling, although different sampling sites were used. It takes years for the agency to compile the results and release the report, which is the most comprehensive assessment of the nation’s river and stream health. Phosphorus levels dipped slightly while nitrogen levels remained almost exactly the same.
About half of all river miles were found to be in poor condition for snails, worms, beetles and other bottom dwelling species that are an important indicator of biological health of the river. About a third were also rated as having poor conditions for fish based on species diversity.
“Controlling pollution is a big job. It is hard work,” said Tom Wall, director of watershed restoration, assessment and protection division at EPA. “Things are not getting worse, despite the tremendous pressures on our waterways. And we would like to see more progress.""
Water pollution from factories and industry is typically federally regulated. The Biden administration recently proposed toughening regulations on meat and poultry processing plants to reduce pollution, Wall said.
When nutrient pollution flows into the Gulf of Mexico, it spurs growth of bacteria that consume oxygen. That creates a so-called “dead zone,” a vast area where it’s difficult or impossible for marine animals to survive, fluctuating from about the size of Rhode Island to the size of New Jersey, according to Nancy Rabalais, professor of oceanography and wetland studies at Louisiana State University.
That affects the productivity of commercial fisheries and marine life in general, but nutrient pollution is also damaging upstream. Too much nitrate in drinking water can affect how blood carries oxygen, causing human health problems like headaches, nausea and abdominal cramps. It can especially affect infants, sometimes inducing “blue baby syndrome,” which causes the skin to take on a bluish hue.
The EPA established the hypoxia task force in the late 1990s to reduce nutrient pollution and shrink the dead zone, but it relies on voluntary efforts to reduce farm runoff and hasn't significantly reduced the dead zone.
Anne Schechinger, Midwest director with the Environmental Working Group, said new regulations are needed, not voluntary efforts. She said the Biden administration has done a lot to improve drinking water, but not enough to reduce agricultural runoff.
Methods to prevent runoff include building buffers between farmland and waterways, creating new wetlands to filter pollutants and applying less fertilizer.
It’s a politically fraught issue, especially in major Midwest farming states that significantly contribute to the problem. Many of those states cite their voluntary conservation programs as evidence they’re taking on the problem, yet the new EPA data shows little progress.
Minnesota is one of the few states that has a so-called “buffer law” that requires vegetation to be planted along rivers, streams and public drainage ditches. But because groundwater and surface water are closely connected in much of the Upper Midwest, nutrient pollution can end up leaching underground through farm fields and eventually bypass those buffers, ending up in streams anyway, said Gregory Klinger, who works for the Olmsted County, Minnesota soil and water conservation district.
There should also be a focus on preventing over-fertilizing – about 30% of farmers are still using more than the recommended amounts of fertilizer on their fields, said Brad Carlson, an extension educator with the University of Minnesota who communicates with farmers about nutrient pollution issues.
Martin Larsen, a farmer and conservation technician in southeast Minnesota, said he and other farmers are interested in practices that reduce their nutrient pollution. He’s broken up his typical corn and soybean rotation with oats and medium red clover, the latter a kind of plant that can increase nitrogen levels in the soil naturally. He's been able to get by with about half as much fertilizer for a corn crop that follows a clover planting as compared to a corn-corn rotation.
Growing oats and red clover as cover crops improves soil, too. But Larsen said it’s difficult for many farmers to plant them when they often rely on an immediate payback for anything they grow. Cover crops are planted on just 5.1% of harvested farmland, according to 2017 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Larsen said since regulations are so unpopular, more should be done to incentivize better practices. For example, he said that could include companies shifting the makeup of feed they use for animals, giving farmers an opening to plant some crops that use less fertilizer. Or government programs that do more to subsidize things like cover crops.
He said that many farmers in his community acknowledge the need to do things differently. “But we also feel very trapped in the system,” he said.

The SNP leader said he was ""absolutely sure"" that his party would win the most seats in Scotland and it was inevitable that Sir Keir would be prime minister.
He said he was ""very willing"" to work with a Labour government and had invited Sir Keir to Edinburgh.
Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar described his election plan as bizarre.
Mr Yousaf told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show: ""I think there's plenty we can work on.
""There'll be disagreements, the constitution perhaps being the obvious one, but I do think there's plenty of areas we could work on.""
Why on earth is Yousaf predicting 'inevitable' Starmer victory?
Shift in tone as SNP gears up for election
The best and worst year of Humza Yousaf's career
When asked about what policy areas they could co-operate on, the SNP leader said Labour should and commit to scrapping the two-child benefit limit.
""In doing so, he would lift 250,000 children out of poverty across the UK, 15,000 children here in Scotland,"" said Mr Yousaf.
""Let's scrap the bedroom tax, which is keeping too many people in poverty.""
The first minister said Sir Keir was ""20 to 25% ahead in the polls"" and that he ""does not need Scotland to win"".
He insisted that the only way to ""wipe the Tories off the map"" in Scotland was for voters to back the SNP.
And he insisted that ""support for independence is absolutely rock solid"".
Ten years on from the Scottish independence referendum, Laura Kuenssberg asked Mr Yousaf if he accepted another vote was not going to happen any time soon.
The first minister denied that and said: ""I want the SNP to win the general election to help to send a really strong message to Westminster that Scotland will not be ignored.""
Mr Yousaf, who succeeded Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister in March 2023, also defended Scotland's ""progressive"" tax system, despite Conservative claims that many Scots are now paying more than people in the rest of the UK
He said the SNP was asking the top 5% of earners ""to pay a little more"" so that policies such as free university education and childcare services could be provided.
Mr Yousaf said he believed people ""will recognise that we've prioritised public services over tax cuts for the wealthy"".
The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, hit back at what he called the SNP's ""completely chaotic messaging"" on voting in the upcoming election.
Speaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, he said: ""They seem to have gone in a matter of weeks from saying you don't need to vote Labour because they can't win in England to now saying you don't need to vote for Labour because they can't lose in England.
""Polls are going to narrow, polls are going to tighten. We could be months away from an election. That's what happens in an election campaign, is that the argument gets more face to face.
""We should always believe we can still lose and we should also always believe that we don't own any voters.
""How bizarre that you have the SNP saying that Scottish votes don't matter. Every Scottish vote matters.""
Scottish Conservative party chairman Craig Hoy said: ""This was another interview where Humza Yousaf confirmed independence will be page one, line one of the SNP manifesto.
""Instead of pursuing their obsession with breaking up the UK, the SNP should focus on the people's real priorities: growing the economy to help Scotland's ailing public services.
""The first minister once again refused to accept that his high-tax regime is preventing that - despite business groups warning repeatedly that the widening tax gap with the rest of the UK is deeply damaging our competitiveness and risks driving away key workers."""

The base came under a tactical missile attack, and more than 15 U.S. Patriot missiles were launched to intercept. But some missiles got through, according to Charles Lister, a senior fellow and director of the Middle East Institute Syria Program and the Middle East Institute Countering Terrorism and Extremism Program.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed Iraqi militants, claimed responsibility, Lister wrote.
US MILITARY BASES IN IRAQ, SYRIA ATTACKED AGAIN, BRINGING TOTAL TO AT LEAST 90 SINCE OCT. 17
A defense official told Fox News the missiles were launched from inside Iraq and that two U.S. personnel sustained concussions described by the Pentagon as ""traumatic brain force injuries.""

IRAN ANNOUNCES STRIKES IN NORTHERN IRAQ, SYRIA
Since the Israel-Hamas war began in October, the U.S. military has come under attack at least 58 times in Iraq and another 83 times in Syria by Iran-backed militants, usually with a mix of rockets and one-way attack drones, according to Reuters. The militants are seeking to impose a cost on the United States for its support of Israel against Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas.
The U.S. has 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 in Iraq on a mission to advise and assist local forces trying to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State, which in 2014 seized large parts of both countries before being defeated.
The attack comes after three armed drones were shot down in Iraq Tuesday near where U.S. and other international forces are stationed, officials said.
Reuters contributed to this report.

""We have 22 people. One of them is a single adult male. The rest of them are either family units or unaccompanied children,"" Chris Cabrera, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, told a small group of reporters standing just feet away.
""I believe there's four unaccompanied children ranging in age from 7-11. There's also a family unit. One of them has a little boy that's approximately 16 months old.""
Cabrera said they were from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Ecuador. After turning themselves in to Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, they then boarded buses on the U.S. side, where their asylum claims will be further processed.
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT POPULATION SOARS UNDER BIDEN: GOVERNMENT DATA
But it’s not just asylum seekers agents encounter there, Cabrera explained.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
""You have runners in the same area … and then you’ll see a lot of drugs coming through here. And, at times, you’ll have money or guns going south through here. You’ll have people trying to smuggle it into Mexico.""
Migrant encounters at the border have fallen off this month, the union spokesman said, but not before agents were overwhelmed by more than 300,000 people encountered in December, a record high.
""I remember there were times when you’d have one, two agents and 400 people,"" he said.
BIDEN ADMIN EYES MORE DEPORTATION FLIGHTS TO VENEZUELA AS MIGRANT NUMBERS SHATTER RECORDS
He spoke to reporters near a port of entry in McAllen, Texas, about 100 yards away from where the Rio Grande acts as a border between the U.S. and Mexico. Ladders were strewn across an open field that had been used by migrants to scale the 15-foot drop beyond the wall.
Cabrera said the ladders were used to try to bring people in illegally, mostly by human smugglers, in a ""coordinated effort.""
""At any given time, you’ll have 40, 50 people giving themselves up at this point,"" he said. ""And while our agents are doing paperwork on them … you’ll have three different groups within half a mile of here, throwing ladders up on the wall … knowing we can’t handle all the people we’re writing up and who’re climbing the wall at the same time.""
The CBP veteran, who has more than two decades’ experience in the field, said the environment he is working in has ""changed dramatically"" in recent years.
""It used to be we would have a downtime. We had a busy season. … People were coming in to work the fields, to pick crops and stuff like that. And then everybody would go home in November, December and start their journey back north again at the beginning of the year,"" Cabrera said.
""This past year, we had record number of apprehensions in December. They’re not coming to pick crops in December.""
Cabrera noticed a change in the people arriving.
""Not everybody's coming to work,"" he said. ""They're coming in for, you know, for asylum, or the illusion of asylum.
""Living in the bad neighborhood is not what asylum is. Not finding a job is not asylum. Fleeing from religious persecution, that's asylum. But, for some reason, this administration decided that asylum is whatever they want it to be,"" he said.
The record surge of undocumented migrants since 2021 has strained local infrastructure in Texas and other areas along the border. It’s also caused problems for large Democrat-run cities where migrants have been sent, like New York City, Chicago and Washington, D.C.
The next day, Cabrera pointed out that the flow of illegal drugs was hitting areas further north as well.
""We don't have a heroin problem in the Rio Grande Valley. We don't have a meth problem in the Rio Grande Valley. It comes through here, but it doesn’t stay here,"" he said. ""We don't have MS-13. … They're in Virginia, Maryland and D.C. They come through here, but they don't stay here. They're going to your areas.""
It comes as Democrats and Republicans in Washington negotiate policy changes to help control the border crisis, with the GOP pushing for stricter measures than the left has so far accepted.
Cabrera was concerned the message to D.C. was ""falling on deaf ears"" and pleaded with federal officials to put party affiliation aside.
""They need to put this aside as a partisan issue. It's not. It needs to be something that gets fixed for the good of this country,"" he said.

16W5I7RB6T_PR0LWBVWW0LOI2N,An alarming life expectancy statistic for Hispanic women in SC stirs a call for action | Opinion,David Lauderdale,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/alarming-life-expectancy-statistic-hispanic-110000727.html,"Surely Thomas C. Barnwell Jr. wasn’t surprised to hear a local health care statistic that hushed the crowd at Hilton Head Island’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day ceremony on Monday.
He’s 88 now, and his decades of activism trace the long and often slow march of progress on his native island.
His mother, Hannah White Barnwell, was the island’s first nurse long before there was a bridge, bringing her training from a nursing school for African Americans in Columbia back to her sandy, remote home with no doctors, no hospital.
Then, Barnwell was the first director of Beaufort Jasper Comprehensive Health Services, one of America’s earliest community health centers. It was established in 1970 to address children of Beaufort and Jasper counties infected with intestinal worms and other problems linked to poverty.
Barnwell testified on the jarring local conditions before a U.S. Senate subcommittee in 1968. And he met his wife, Susan, when she came to the Lowcountry to help fight the worm problem caused by shallow wells, a lack of plumbing, scant health care and poor hygiene.
So surely, Barnwell could feel each bump along this long march as he and Susan listened to the ceremony’s keynote speaker, Dr. Faith Polkey who is chief executive of the Beaufort-Jasper-Hampton Comprehensive Health Services. She’s the one who laid the jaw-dropping statistic on the audience, as stunning today as the thought of local children with worms.
“Martin Luther King Jr. said, ‘Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman because it often results in physical death,’ ” she said.
That was in 1966, and soon thereafter a small group of people from Hilton Head, Bluffton and St. Helena Island “got together to solve a problem — infections from Ascaris worms in children in the community.”
She credited Barnwell, Emory Campbell and Roland Gardner for getting a clinic started in Chelsea, with the credo “Health is a right, not a privilege.”
“With the support of the community, as well as federal, state and county funding, BJHCHS has been able to expand over the past 54 years to include 10 locations, 10 school-based health centers, and three mobile units,” Polkey said. “Services include adult medicine, pediatrics, OB-GYN, dental, pharmacy, nutrition, behavioral health and many other supportive services. We have been able to serve over 17,000 people every year in the three counties and beyond.”
Today, she said, Beaufort County is called the healthiest county in South Carolina.
But she shared data about Beaufort and Jasper counties from the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control that show current health disparities often depend on race, ethnicity, gender, ZIP code or socioeconomic status. Life expectancy can vary by four years on Hilton Head Island, depending on where you live. Life expectancy for Black people on the island is a decade shorter than for white people, she said.
Then there was this.
“Most alarming to me was the median age of death among Hispanic men and women,” Polkey said of the 2023 data. “For men it was age 53 — and worse still, Hispanic women in Jasper County died at the median age of 44!
“That is exactly what MLK was talking about,” Polkey said. She added: “You can’t just let that sit there on a piece of paper.”
Causes for health disparities are varied and complex, Polkey said, and must be addressed by various entities including government, private citizens, businesses and health care providers. “It will take all of us working in different ways to make a difference,” Polkey said, “but if BJHCHS is any example of a few people making a difference, I know that we all can.”
Many things change, but one thing is the same today as when Hannah Barnwell went off to study nursing and when her son went off to rattle the cages in Congress. Somebody has to see something and do something.
“So I call upon you all to think about that thing that you can do to change our community,” Polkey said. “What issue has been bothering you for a while? Who can you partner with to make it happen?”

Passing hikers noticed the woman's dog stuck on a steep slope, barking.
Rescuers saved the dog, then launched a search for its missing owner.
Rescuers in Honolulu saved a 35-year-old woman who had fallen roughly 170 feet down the side of a mountain thanks to her dog, who barked incessantly and alerted passersby.
The Honolulu Fire Department said in a statement that a group of hikers called 911 on January 15 to report a barking dog on a steep mountain slope, who was apparently without a handler. A rescuer rappelled some 20 feet down the slope and airlifted the dog to safety — but the pilot noticed an object roughly 70 feet below where the dog has been found.
The same rescuer rappelled down to the object and discovered that it was a bag filled with personal items.
The fire department said rescuers noticed the dog's collar had its owner's name and phone number — but when they called the number, no one answered. They said the Honolulu Police Department performed a wellness check at the owner's address, but found no one home.
Ultimately, rescuers realized the dog's owner had parked her car at the trailhead and they launched ""an extensive and coordinated search by air and ground"" for the missing owner.
Rescuers located the woman shortly after, and found her underneath some ""thick foliage"" roughly 100 feet below the spot where her bag was found. Rescuers put her on a stretcher and airlifted her off the mountain and brought her to the hospital.
The woman's condition remains unclear.

Now, two law enforcement agencies are working together to track down the suspects.
The businesses – Madison Tree and Landscape Co. and Rival Motorsports – said they weren’t surprised, but what’s interesting is that the two are more than an hour away from each other and sell completely different products.
Both thefts happened just a few days apart, with Madison Tree getting hit Wednesday around 3:30 a.m.
“A couple of guys just drove through the gate,” said Madison Tree and Landscape Co. employee Jake Spegal. “They didn’t try to unlock it or anything; they just drove through the gate.”
The suspects left with nearly $11,000 worth of equipment in just minutes.
“All together, they took 12 chainsaws, they took a couple of backpack blowers,” Spegal said. “So they took some stuff to the back of their truck, but they left and then, I’d say, they were there for about 10 minutes.”
One of the suspects returned about 30 minutes later to take more merchandise.
“We think there’s a chance that they probably, at some point, had come in the store before to kind of see how it was set up and stuff because obviously, they had a power grinder to get the saws off and that’s not really something that people just carry around,” Spegal said. “Definitely stinks seeing how much stuff they took because like I said, we’re a smaller business and being a garden center, the winter is usually a little tougher for us in the first place. So something like this definitely doesn’t help out.”
Two days later, and in another county an hour away, police said the same men hit Rival Motorsports. They did the same thing: after unsuccessfully trying to pry the door open, the men rammed the truck through the front door.
“It’s a little bit shocking. It’s angering, also,” said Scottie Lawrence, the owner of Rival Motorsports. “This is the first time that someone’s actually broke into the store. We’ve had items stolen around the outside of the store, trailers or even scrap metal, things like that. But this is the first time someone’s actually broken into the store and taken something.”
The men were in and out in a matter of minutes, leaving with a $3,000 quad.
“It’s unbelievable that somebody would back up their truck into the door like that, damage the truck and do what they did over a $3,000 quad,” said Don Bennett, a Rival Motorsports employee who first discovered the damage. “I mean, it’s just unbelievable what people are doing today.”
Lawrence is offering a $1,000 reward for anyone who can lead to the arrest and conviction of the men responsible. He says putting up the reward was an easy decision.
“Just catching these people and possibly keep them from doing this again to somebody else’s business is well worth $1,000 to me,” he said.
Police said the black Mazda pickup truck used in the robberies was recovered, left not too far from Rival Motorsports.
Both the Perry County Sheriff’s Office and the West Jefferson Police Department are asking anyone with information to come forward. Anyone with any information can reach the Perry County Sheriff’s Office at (740) 342-4123 or the West Jefferson Police Department at (614) 879-7672.

1CGWHCSK18_E1YDJF8ODL36CV7,Did Biden blunder with New Hampshire primary snub?,Frankie TAGGART,"January 22, 2024 at 12:58 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/did-biden-blunder-hampshire-primary-155808305.html,"With all eyes on Donald Trump's bid to lead Republicans back into the White House, Joe Biden's reelection push has slipped under the radar in an unusual start to his campaign.
After a dispute with officials in New Hampshire over scheduling, he will not be on the ballot when the state's primary kicks off the party's nomination process on Tuesday.
The quarrel threatens to leave the president in a theoretical third place among Democrat candidates, behind little-known gelato magnate Dean Phillips and low-polling self-help author Marianne Williamson.
""He is taking the Granite State for granted... He should be campaigning in New Hampshire, he should be showing up in front of voters,"" Phillips said at a debate with Williamson that Biden skipped.
""He should be on the ballot in New Hampshire, for goodness' sake. He's the president.""
Biden lost badly in overwhelmingly white New Hampshire in his bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020 and was only rescued by strong support from African Americans in the South Carolina primary.
Once he was elected he effectively dethroned New Hampshire, along with fellow early nominating state Iowa, instructing the party leadership to place South Carolina ahead of both.
- Write his name in -
Iowa caved quietly but the move angered Democrats in New Hampshire, where first-in-the-nation status is a sacred cow, and the Republicans who control the state government in Concord ignored the directive in any case.
The Democratic National Committee responded by refusing to seat the state's delegates at the summer nominating convention in Chicago -- essentially denying New Hampshire its say.
Many grassroots Democrats worry that even though Biden is not on the ballot, his performance against Phillips and Williamson will be judged as a measure of his popularity.
So, despite their anger over Biden's snub, local activists have determined to ensure his supporters know they can write his name on the ballot.
Beneath a wintry Manchester sky, 20 or so hardy Biden supporters swaddled like Arctic explorers braved the biting cold Saturday to chant and wave banners that read: ""Ask me about writing in Joe Biden.""
They were even rewarded by a magnanimous cameo from Phillips, as the entrepreneur and US congressman came out of his nearby campaign headquarters to hand out coffee to his shivering opponents.
""We're all frustrated that (Biden's) not on the ballot,"" said Kathy Sullivan, 69, a retired lawyer from Manchester.
""But we put that aside because it's really important that Joe Biden beats Donald Trump in November.""
- Local frustration -
Dan Seferian, 62, a retired state government worker who had traveled with wife Colleen from Reading, Massachusetts, hit out at Williamson and Phillips for not getting behind the Biden reelection campaign.
""I think they should stand behind the party and the incumbent president. Phillips, he's is a young man. He could run in 2028. He should have waited his turn,"" he told AFP.
Some Biden aides have reportedly voiced concerns that the write-in effort could fall short, delivering an unnecessary defeat.
Democratic presidents seeking reelection typically garner around 80 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, and party strategists believe Biden needs to win somewhere around 60 percent to avoid humiliation.
""A win is a win, and I think we can deliver that,"" said New Hampshire state senator Donna Soucy, co-chair of the campaign.
""We've been working really hard on this write-in effort across the state, and I think voters today -- those of us that are out here bearing the cold -- are evidence of the enthusiasm for President Joe Biden.""
Soucy acknowledged the frustration with Biden but blamed party officials in Washington rather than the president himself.
""It's a little more complicated to express our support in this election but we're still going to do it because we're devoted to our president,"" she said.

Supporters of the trans community also spoke to the community to remind them their community stands with women and reproductive justice. Leaders in the trans community told FOX 5 they are also running into barriers accessing the same services.
Organizers said the topic of reproductive justice has been their focus since the beginning, with the first march held in 2017. Now they only host the rally.
Leaders and organizers said the reminder on this topic is prevalent as reproductive rights is front and center during this election year.
Democrats look to abortion politics to draw voters to polls
“When we frame it in terms of choice, we are looking at ‘I choose to kill somebody.’ No ‘I choose to live my life, because I believe in life. And I believe that I have the human right to determine as best I can my life.’ We have kind of been stuck in that argument, are you pro-life, are you pro-choice,” said Sue Alderson, the North County Womxn’s March Chair.
“This reproductive justice movement has the backing of the trans community. It’s like a mutual aid sort of situation for us, where we need the feminist community, and we need the women’s rights community to be showing up for us in trans spaces, because we are going to keep showing up in women’s rights spaces, and reproductive justice spaces as well,” said Evan Johnson, one of the North County Womxn’s Rally speakers.

Monadnock State Park rangers called the agency just before 5 p.m. Friday, Jan. 19, to report three hikers lost on the mountain just before dark, officials said in a news release.
The hikers were not prepared for the “impending darkness and cold temperatures” on the mountain, which had a -10-degree wind chill factor, officials said.
Rescuers contacted the hikers by phone and guided them from the summit to the treeline as night fell, but they were unable to proceed because they had no lights, rescuers said.
Rescuers reached the hikers, ages 63, 50 and 37, and provided them with equipment to descend the mountain, the agency said.
“Due to their lack of warm clothing and exposure to extreme cold,” the condition of the 63-year-old woman deteriorated on the way down and rescuers carried her the rest of the way to the trailhead, officials said.
She was taken to a hospital for treatment, rescuers said. The other two hikers finished descending on their own.
Two of the hikers are from Quincy, Massachusetts, and the third is from Thailand.
The agency credited the “herculean” efforts of rescuers with saving the three hikers.
“Outdoor enthusiasts are encouraged to check the weather forecast and prepare for the current winter weather conditions,” officials said in the release.
Mount Monadnock is a 3,165-foot mountain about 50 miles southwest of Concord, New Hampshire.
If you’re planning to hike, the National Park Service says there are 10 essentials you should take:
Navigation: Pack a map, compass and a GPS system. Make sure you study your route beforehand and understand how to use the tools.
Sun protection: Sunglasses, sunscreen and a hat can help protect your skin and eyes from UV rays.
Insulation: A jacket, hat, gloves, raincoat and thermal underwear can help you be prepared for rapidly changing weather conditions.
Illumination: A flashlight, lantern and headlamp can create light if you get stuck in the dark — and don’t forget to pack extra batteries.
First-aid supplies: It’s a good idea to have a first-aid kit on hand while hiking. Check the expiration date on items before you pack them.
Fire: Matches and a lighter can help start fire to act as an emergency signal in times of need.
Repair kit and tools: Duct tape, a knife, screwdriver and scissors can be helpful if items break during your hike or you need assistance.
Nutrition: You should pack an extra day’s worth of food in case something goes wrong. Park officials recommend having “salty and easy to digest snacks.”
Hydration: You should drink water often and before you feel thirsty if you’re hiking in hot weather. Keeping your body hydrated is “of utmost importance,” park officials said.
Emergency shelter: Packing a tent, space blanket, tarp and bivy can help you be prepared if severe weather breaks out or your plan takes a turn.

Long obsessed with Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, Gutierrez was reading some of the books about her and realized there was enough material for Kahlo to narrate her own story. “When I started looking at research material, I found that no one had truly focused on her voice and let Frida herself carry a narrative,” said Gutierrez via a Zoom interview.

She went to her “RBG” and “Julia” directors Julie Cohen and Betsy West and pitched them the idea of digging deep into a third “kick-ass woman,” said Gutierrez. They became executive producers, but when they went out to find backing, some companies were afraid of a Spanish-language archive movie that might feel historically distant. “We knew that we were coming in with a new approach,” said Gutierrez, “that was a lot more intimate than what had been done before.” But Time and Imagine saw the film’s potential, and swiftly Amazon also joined as distributor.
Early on, Gutierrez felt strongly that actors should portray all the voices in the film, from Frida to her husband Diego Rivera. She cast them sight unseen, looking for theater veterans who could transmit emotion.
Relying on Frida’s words was “liberating,” said Gutierrez. “All her writings are in different parts of the world in different collections. And there is no one extensive interview with her. There are some interviews toward the end of her life. But it’s not like she was telling the story of her life. That opened up the possibility to lean into her emotions and offer more of an intimate perspective. It was important for me to make that connection between her life experiences and the development of her paintings.”
One key decision in bringing Kahlo to life was the subject of some debate, but Gutierrez felt strongly that animating Kahlo’s art would be visually additive. “Cinema is a different art form,” said Gutierrez. “When you have interaction with Frida’s art, a lot of times it’s either in a museum, if you’re seeing an actual painting, or through books, and you have an opportunity to live with the painting and live with the art, and observe it and have an interaction with it. I found that wasn’t possible through film. There was this distance that I felt.”
“We did a lot of early, rough-cut editing of some segments where we only had the static paintings. And these paintings are full of details. A lot of them have different meanings. With the animation, I wanted the audience to key into specific details that highlighted the emotions that we were touching on in those specific segments. For me, going into the paintings this way was immersing myself in her mind.”
The filmmakers licensed high-resolution photos and then the animators used 2D techniques, cutting out different elements of the pictures. “We never add any outside elements to her art,” said Gutierrez. “We do cut-outs and pay special attention to the movement and specific details of the paintings.”
The estate of Frida Kahlo wasn’t an impediment. After her death at age 47 in 1954, her estate passed to her husband Diego Rivera, who was a Communist. He gave their estate to the Mexican government, which also supervises the Casa Azul Museum in Mexico City.
Other voices came from those who knew Kahlo very closely, from Rivera to a letter, diary, or a quick interview. “At the beginning of the process,” said Gutierrez, “I thought we were going to rely on other voices more. Because again, we knew that Frida could give us the emotional content that we needed. But I was surprised to see, as we were putting the film together, that Frida could carry the story as much as she could. We used phrases from the friend in the United States who was present when Frida had her miscarriage. In her diary at the time, she described quite a bit of what was happening, and those descriptions were present and raw.”
Gutierrez also edited the film. “What I’ve done is to try to build the world, and present it to the audience as if the protagonist was walking you through it,” she said. “So you’re holding the hand of Frida Kahlo, as she’s walking through the world. Everything is dictated by her emotion or her presence there.”
“Frida” will stream March 15 around the world on Amazon Prime Video.

1EL29PXPQ4_KDR9H00KVFO3A07,NYC Mayor Adams accused of 'getting his Trump on' by vetoing council bill to track every police stop,Danielle Wallace,"January 21, 2024 at 9:12 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nyc-mayor-adams-accused-getting-121254582.html,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams vetoed a controversial city council bill that would require police officers to document every ""investigative encounter"" with the public.
At a press conference Friday, Adams said the proposed legislation, known as Intro. 586-A or the ""How Many Stops Act,"" could slow NYPD response times, undermine community-oriented policing, and add tens of millions of dollars in overtime to the NYPD budget. Namely, he took issue with how the proposed legislation would force New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers to spend more time filling out reports after Level 1 interactions with the public instead of patrolling the street and keeping the public safe.
""As young men, my brother and I were beaten by the police in the basement of a local precinct, but I turned my pain into purpose and joined the police force to effect change from within the system. And, in my time as a police officer and throughout my career in public service, I have fought for transparency and against abusive policing tactics that targeted communities of color. While Intro. 586 has good intentions behind it, the bill is misguided and compromises our public safety,"" Adams said in a statement.
""Our administration supports efforts to make law enforcement more transparent, more just, and more accountable, but this bill will handcuff our police by drowning officers in unnecessary paperwork that will saddle taxpayers with tens of millions of dollars in additional NYPD overtime each year, while simultaneously taking officers away from policing our streets and engaging with the community,"" he siad. ""That is why I am vetoing this legislation today. I ask my colleagues in government to please work with our administration to improve public safety because New Yorkers want their police out on patrol — taking criminals off our streets and keeping them safe.""
DANIEL PENNY'S ATTORNEY CONFIDENT HE WILL BE 'FULLY EXONERATED' AFTER JUDGE DENIES MOTION TO DISMISS CHARGES
Adams cited serial stabbing suspect 27-year-old Jermain Rigueur, accused of at least five stabbings within about a week, arguing the bill would impede such quick arrests, FOX 5 reported.

The bill, co-sponsored by New York City Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams, passed the council in December. It would require the NYPD to log and report basic information on level one, two, and three investigative encounters between the police and civilians. Officers would report on the race, age, and gender of the person approached, any factors leading to the interaction, and its outcomes. But NYPD Commissioner Edward A. Caban countered that the NYPD is already the country’s ""most intently watched, deeply scrutinized, and openly transparent law enforcement agency,"" saying the measure vetoed by Adams ""is an overreach that would result in the unintended consequence of literally slowing down the city’s progress.""

""Each day and night, NYPD officers carry on the dangerous, critical work of fighting crime on the streets. Terrorist plots have also been thwarted, and there is a renewed commitment among our rank and file to further build trust and strengthen relationships in every community,"" Caban said in a statement. ""These vital efforts will continue — and must continue, unimpeded by bureaucratic time-wasting tasks — because that is what New Yorkers expect and deserve.""
""On our watch, there is a continuation of lower overall crime, including a reduction in bellwether indicators like murder, burglary, and assault. We just ended a year in which NYPD officers reduced shooting incidents citywide by a factor not seen in nearly 30 years,"" Caban added. ""And as of this week, index crimes in New York City have dropped another 5 percent compared to last year — and an incredible 74 percent from three decades ago.""
At a press conference of his own, Williams accused Adams and the NYPD of being ""fearmongers who mislead the public.""

He and other councilmembers say the bill is meant to address the ""longstanding inequities"" faced by Black New Yorkers.
""The fact that Mayor Adams is getting his Trump on right now makes this even more difficult than it has to be,"" Williams said, according to FOX 5.
Adams also vetoes a separate city council bill aimed at banning solitary confinement.

1FESNE3L84_YN36CCIRLBROPD5,"If life exists on Mars, don't count on sample-return missions to find it, scientists say",Leonard David,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/life-exists-mars-dont-count-110017858.html,"While the clamoring to bring bits and pieces of Mars back to Earth for intensive study continues, scientists are also devising instruments and techniques that can be sent to the Red Planet to perform on-the-spot probes for life. Could these low-cost approaches usurp the early need for samples shot directly from Mars?
That option brings to mind the comment from Marcel Proust — a French novelist, literary critic, and essayist who wrote the novel In Search of Lost Time: ""The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes."" For the discovery of prior life on Mars, a sample return program would work best, but if we want to discover present-day life on the Red Planet, doing so with instruments right there on Mars is the way to go.
That's the view of Dirk Schulze-Makuch, a professor for astrobiology and planetary habitability at the Technical University Berlin in Germany. Additionally, he thinks currently available methodologies are suitable and far enough developed to determine whether there is life on Mars.
""However, in order to get unambiguous results we would have to put a suite of several of these methodologies together,"" Schulze-Makuch told Space.com.
Related: NASA's troubled Mars sample-return mission has scientists seeing red
Schulze-Makuch points back in time to the dual NASA Viking lander missions in the 1970s. It was a heady time for trying to answer a provocative question: Is Mars an abode for life?
While biology experiments detected unexpected and enigmatic chemical activity in the Martian soil, a majority of Viking Mars investigators leaned toward no clear, slam dunk proof for the presence of living microorganisms in soil near the landing sites.
Arguably, the twin Viking landers did respond to the life on Mars query by responding: Can you repeat the question?
""In principle the Viking approach was correct,"" Schulze-Makuch said. ""The problem at that time, nearly 50 years ago, was that our methods were not as sophisticated yet. We did not have a good understanding about the Martian environments. We have made major advances in both regards,"" the astrobiologist said.
Schulze-Makuch said it's true that with Mars sample return, scientists can apply even more of our most sophisticated methods, including those not yet available for a space mission.
But due to the long time period a soil sample is boxed up — both on the surface of Mars and during the long haul from Mars to Earth, ""we would likely only find organic remnants of possible life, which would be difficult to interpret. This approach would work well for past life on Mars,"" Schulze-Makuch said, ""but if our goal is to find extant life, then an in-situ mission is the way to go.""
""There is an inevitable tension in Mars sample return and the search for life,"" said Chris McKay, a space scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, California.
""It is clearly the case that the best search for life would be done on samples in laboratories on Earth,"" McKay told Space.com. ""But the prospect of bringing back a sample that may have Martian life in it gives many people pause and indeed is regulated, some might say prohibited, by the [United Nations] Outer Space Treaty.""
Can we assume based on the Viking results that there is no life on the surface of Mars?
""My answer to this is yes and no,"" McKay responded. The Mars researcher underscores data gleaned by Viking in 1976, the NASA Phoenix lander discovery of perchlorate in 2007, as well as the analysis from the still-cranking Curiosity Mars rover that showed low levels of organics since landing in 2012.
""Most Mars scientists contend that the reactivity seen in the Martian soil is chemical and there is no surface biology now. So yes,"" McKay said. ""But No. This view is not unanimous,"" he said, citing the case for extant life on Mars and its possible detection by the Viking labeled release experiment.
NASA and the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), an interdisciplinary scientific body, both consider any sample return from Mars as a potential biological risk, said McKay.
McKay said he has argued in print that ""the standard of evidence to achieve scientific consensus is clearly lower than the standard that must be applied to the precautionary protection of the Earth. Life may not be the scientifically preferred explanation for the [Viking Labeled Release] results but it cannot yet be ruled out.""
It may well be that public opinion or legal procedure, McKay said ""will not support an assumption of no life on Mars for the purposes of sample or astronaut return to Earth without further analyses on Mars, regardless of the scientific consensus,"" he concluded.
One potential NASA mission that has gained support is the Mars Life Explorer (MLE). This deep-digging lander would focus on a search for signs of currently existing Red Planet life.
MLE received a hearty endorsement from the most recent planetary science decadal survey, a report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine that was issued in April 2022.
The instrument suite on MLE is designed to be ""instrument agnostic,"" said astrobiologist and MLE's ""science champion,"" Amy Williams, an assistant professor in the University of Florida's Department of Geological Sciences in Gainesville.
There are suites of instruments that already exist that could fly with the proposed MLE, or new instruments and technologies that are currently in the maturation pipeline that could be swapped in, Williams told Space.com. ""There are very real opportunities for alternative and novel instruments to join the mission.""

In the interim, research teams are pioneering the SOLID (""Signs Of LIfe Detector""), work carried out by Spain's Center for Astrobiology. There's also a Microfluidic Life Analyzer, or MILA, that has evolved at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Or how about building an instrument to be used during robotic ice mining missions, a high-tech device to seek Martian life thriving today?
That approach is underway by Steven Benner, founder of the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution and Firebird Biomolecular Sciences LLC.
In fact, the Agnostic Life Finding Association (ALFA) has been established, with both Benner and Jan Špaček, inventor of the Agnostic Life Finder (ALF), as leadership members.
""The only way to achieve the goal of ALFA Mars is to conduct the life screening of Mars before the first humans land there,"" the association's website declares.
So, in the end, it appears that the ""whether or not"" forecast about life on Mars remains foggy with patches of uncertainty.
Revisiting Carl Sagan's famous words that ""extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence,"" the take by astrobiologist Schulze-Makuch's is that ""based on our current understanding of Mars, I think that the extraordinary claim is that Mars has no life and never had any life. We should finally go and find out!"""
1J9AN3ZST5_IDC3AVQD0BDWMO3,Group Linked to Sam Altman Launches AI to Defeat Joe Biden,Sharon Adarlo,"January 21, 2024 at 8:30 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/group-linked-sam-altman-launches-113005955.html,"A super PAC with deep ties to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman launched an AI chatbot this week in a bid to deny President Joe Biden from winning a second term in office, The Washington Post reports.
The group, We Deserve Better, launched the Dean.Bot as an AI stand-in for Dean Phillips, a Minnesota congressman who's running a quixotic campaign to challenge Biden in the Democratic primary.
Phillips has attracted the attention of Altman and other Silicon Valley elites, who say they're concerned about Biden's recent low poll numbers and his chances against former President Donald Trump, the likely winner of the Republican primary.
But tellingly, the formation of the super PAC to support Phillips occurred in early December, soon after Biden signed a sweeping executive order that seeks to regulate AI tech.
Altman and other AI proponents have said in the past that they want regulation and safeguards on AI, but that stance often changes when proposals become reality. For example, Altman earlier threatened that OpenAI would quit operating in Europe if certain AI regulations came to pass, and has also lobbied hard to water down those same regulations.
So it's interesting that a group with deep ties to Altman would launch an AI-powered chatbot to try to unseat Biden, who wants to curb AI technology. One of the founders of the super PAC, Matt Krisiloff, used to be an employee of OpenAI and apparently dated Altman.
Strikingly, OpenAI's ChatGPT once powered the chatbot, but now it relies on open source models, according to WaPo.
The Dean.Bot is clearly labeled as an AI chatbot and has disclaimers such as: ""Feel free to ask it anything, but please take answers with a grain of salt!""
If you ask him about any recent campaign controversy, the Dean.Bot, like any seasoned politician, passes the buck.
For example, the Phillips campaign quietly changed a header on its website that once read ""Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,"" The New York Times reports. It now reads instead ""Equity and Restorative Justice.""
This change comes after the Phillips campaign received an infusion of $1 million from Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager who's mounted a recent assault on DEI initiatives.
When you ask the Dean.Bot about the recent removal of DEI from the Phillips campaign website, the chatbot says that ""I must clarify that as a digital clone, I don't control the content of websites or make decisions about what is posted or removed.""
""However, I can tell you that my commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is unwavering,"" the chatbot continues. ""My actions and policies consistently reflect the importance of these principles in creating a fair and just society for all. If there have been changes to my website, they would be made with the intent to best represent my current focus and priorities in serving the people.""
As it stands, the Biden campaign probably shouldn't worry too much about the chatbot, because it's still pretty clunky when compared to dealing with a real flesh and blood human being, more an election year curiosity than anything else.
Beyond the chatbot being an avatar for a monied class who want to influence elections, though, it does feel like a prototype of how AI and tech may change politics going into the future.
Late last year, the campaign of Pennsylvania Democrat politician Shamaine Daniels ran a chatbot called Ashley to help in her phone banking efforts.
Both Dean.Bot and Ashley have been clearly labeled as AI chatbots, but they could be laying the groundwork for a reality in which bad actors can release chatbots that can lie or obfuscate rival politicians' policy platforms.
""I see this as a Pandora’s box problem,"" New York University Stern Center for Business and Human Rights' deputy director Paul Barrett told WaPo. ""Once we have AI versions of candidates chatting up voters, it’s a short step to bots used by political opponents to fool voters into thinking that politicians are saying things they never said. And soon, everyone gets so cynical about all of this fake communication that no one believes anything anyone is saying.""

Matt Gatez (R-Fla.) said on Sunday that he would “welcome” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R ) back into the Trump campaign fold if the governor dropped out of the presidential primary.
“I remember the good old days when I was Ron DeSantis’s transition chairman and he and President Trump worked so well together,” Gatez, a top surrogate to former President Trump, told a crowd of Trump supporters at the campaign’s headquarters in Manchester.
“I hate when mom and dad fight,” he continued, receiving laughs from the crowd. “It turns out we might get Ron DeSantis back on side pretty soon and I would welcome that,” he said to applause.
Gaetz’s comments come after DeSantis canceled his scheduled appearances on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. The governor’s presidential campaign said the decision to cancel the interviews was the result of a “scheduling issue” and that they would be rescheduled. DeSantis’s campaign also said that the governor has public events scheduled Sunday evening through Tuesday in New Hampshire ahead of the state’s primary.
However, the scheduling claim did not stop Gatez and the Trump campaign from questioning the future of the governor’s primary bid.
“I guess I would ask what are his plans then?” Gatez told reporters at the same event. “If his plans aren’t to drop out, and he doesn’t have any advertisements running and he won’t achieve earned media by turning down two Sunday shows, a reasonable person might ask what is the DeSantis plan or path?”
“Think about the stages of grief—we’ve had denial with the DeSantis campaign. We’ve had a good amount of anger, this last week on television you saw the bargaining,” he continued. “After that, we ultimately get to acceptance.”
Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, further dug into DeSantis’s move to cancel the television appearances.
“You don’t do that if you’re coming from a position of strength,” Miller said.
After coming in a distant second to Trump in Iowa, polls show DeSantis trailing Trump and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley in New Hampshire and South Carolina. The Hill’s Decision Desk HQ average shows DeSantis coming in third place in New Hampshire with 7.2 percent and in South Carolina with 8.3 percent.

The latter led to a reckoning over racial inequity in arrests, prosecutions and punishment. Voters wanted Gascón to set a corrective course in the nation’s largest local jurisdiction while keeping people safe.
He is doing what he promised, and doing it well, despite intense and dishonest backlash from opponents inside his office and among right-wing politicians and pundits across the nation. L.A. County voters would be wise to reject the nonsense and keep Gascón on the job and criminal justice reform in place.

Falsehoods about his policies, and about the apocalyptic landscape that Los Angeles has supposedly become because of them, are widespread — so much so that voters who supported him 3½ ago may have forgotten why.
So let’s remember who he is, and why he was the right choice then and now.
Read more: Editorial: Gascon’s reform vision comes to the Supreme Court
Gascón is a former police officer who rose through the ranks to become LAPD assistant chief under William Bratton. He then became the chief of police in Mesa, Ariz., a conservative city adjacent to Phoenix and Arizona’s third most populous municipality. From there he became chief of San Francisco’s Police Department, and then San Francisco’s district attorney.
This background gives him firsthand knowledge of the criminal justice system from the ground level. Gascón knows what cops face on the street, how they think, how they can sometimes go wrong, and how police and prosecutors together serve and occasionally distort justice. He is the only Los Angeles County district attorney in the last century, and perhaps ever, to step into the job after learning the ropes in a parallel post in another county. Other prosecutors may know the courtroom; Gascón knows the system.
Read more: Editorial: Anti-Gascón drive extends era of destructive, distracting recall mania
L.A. voters picked him because he correctly saw the self-defeating nature of a system that does not know when to stop punishing. Studying the data, Gascón realized that punishment must be properly “dosed,” like medicine. Too much for too long, the numbers show, and the imprisoned offender is broken instead of corrected, loses the ability to responsibly reenter society and becomes more likely to reoffend. That phenomenon has endangered all of us for far too long — and it has perpetuated multigenerational racial inequities by disproportionately locking up Black and Latino Angelenos and leaving too many families without two parents present.
Gascón’s policies seek the most fitting rather than the longest possible sentences. This smart approach was such a departure from older, failed strategies that the MAGA right promptly distorted it into the false narrative that Gascón refuses to prosecute misdemeanors at all, and generally avoids prosecuting felonies.
Read more: Editorial: Now that a second recall effort has failed, let George Gascón do the work he was elected to do
This fairy tale is so entrenched that several of his challengers repeated it on the campaign trail — and one of them, former Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan Hochman, told it to the Times editorial board. When asked to show evidence, he couldn’t — because there is no such policy. This is particularly troubling because the ex-Republican has attracted support from GOP donors across the country.
Besides, jurisdiction over prosecution of misdemeanors in more than half the county — including the cities of L.A., Pasadena and Santa Monica — lies with city attorneys, not Gascón’s office.
As for felonies, the number of cases filed during his tenure is on par with that of earlier administrations. The argument that Gascón is lax or lenient on crime simply does not hold up to the facts. The various crime surges in the last few years — wrongly attributed to Gascón — occurred nationwide and have largely abated. Prosecutorial policies have no short-term effect on crime.
Read more: Endorsement: George Gascón for L.A. County district attorney
Seven of Gascón 11 challengers in the March primary are current or former L.A. deputy district attorneys who adamantly oppose the office’s direction and the voters’ 2020 decision. They promise to bring back archaic and unjust sentencing policies, and most want to roll back key provisions of the voter-approved Proposition 47, which among other things made drug possession a misdemeanor.
Eric Siddall was the vice president of the prosecutors’ labor union, which has led the charge against Gascón from the start. John McKinney and Jon Hatami were likewise vocal Gascón critics. Maria Ramirez said she tried to give her new boss a chance but soon gave up. Craig Mitchell, Debra Archuleta and David Milton are former deputy D.A.s who became judges. Also running are San Bernardino County deputy D.A. Lloyd “Bobcat” Masson and Dan Kapelovitz, a criminal defense attorney.

Jeff Chemerinsky, a former federal prosecutor, has won the backing of some L.A. liberals and local Democratic clubs that have been swayed by the accounts that Gascón's policies have stoked crime or that his office is in chaos. They may be comforted by his name — his father, Erwin Chemerinsky, is the renowned dean of UC Berkeley law school and a constitutional scholar who strongly supports defendant rights.

1PBVDJCTPP_S7V3EJD9JXR9JRD,Deadly ice storm could cause treacherous travel in Chicago for Tuesday morning commute,Steven Yablonski,"Updated January 23, 2024 at 10:41 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ice-storm-could-snarl-monday-171047590.html,"FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – The Midwest, including major cities like Chicago and Indianapolis, will look to have another slow and treacherous morning commute on Tuesday as a deadly ice storm slides across the region, causing power outages and slick travel.
The hazardous situation began to unfold on Sunday after a disturbance moved out of the Southwest and into the mid-South and Midwest, spreading icy precipitation across the region.
The Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) said they responded to 631 calls for service, 319 reports of stranded motorists and 273 crashes. At least 18 crashes with injuries were also reported, as well as at least three fatalities on Monday.
The video above shows even officials can't get to all calls safely. The firetruck was seen losing control on an icy road in Imperial, Missouri.
THE HIDDEN DANGERS OF ICE STORMS
In Mississippi, officials reported a death in Marshall County on Monday. No immediate details were known, but emergency managers said this marks the 12th winter weather-related death since January 14.
HOW MUCH ICE IS NEEDED TO KNOCK OUT POWER, DAMAGE TREES?
Millions of people from the Midwest, Great Lakes region and Northeast have been placed under a Winter Weather Advisory because of the threats of snow and ice into Tuesday.
Winter Weather Advisories include major cities across the region like St. Louis, Chicago, Indianapolis, Detroit, Cleveland and Pittsburgh.
TRAVELING THIS WINTER? HERE'S WHAT TO KEEP IN YOUR CAR IN CASE YOU GET STUCK
The FOX Forecast Center says that the warm air will continue to move in, and that will push the colder air farther north.
Ice and snow have already broken out in the Midwest and the Great Lakes region, and conditions are expected to deteriorate throughout Tuesday.
Unlike what occurred in the Plains, the duration of ice is still in question, and it’s unclear how severe the impacts will be.
DON'T LEAVE ANY OF THESE ITEMS IN YOUR CAR THIS WINTER
Slick roads are expected across the region, as well as accumulating ice on elevated surfaces. Power outages cannot be ruled out either.
The colder air will also allow snow to break out across much of Wisconsin, Michigan and the eastern Great Lakes.
Quick bursts of heavy snow are possible Tuesday morning, but impacts should remain low. All winter weather should then clear out of the region by Tuesday evening.
In terms of snow totals, most areas will see less than an inch. However, some areas, like northern Michigan and portions of western and northern New York state, could pick up 1-3 inches of snow.
On Monday, warm air aloft had helped to melt snow into rain, but with temperatures near or below freezing, the precipitation was reaching the ground as freezing rain. Ice rapidly developed on the surface due to the cold temperatures.
And that ice caused numerous issues.
The National Weather Service office in Kansas City had warned residents to ""stay home unless absolutely necessary"" due to the dangerous travel conditions on local roads and highways.
The warning was also echoed by the NWS office in St. Louis, who said that if anyone did need to venture out, it was crucial to ""take it slow.""
And it did turn out to be a treacherous commute.
DRIVING ON THE ICE AND DRIVING IN THE SNOW: WINTER DRIVING TIPS FOR DRIVING IN INCLEMENT WEATHER
Video recorded in Arkansas shows a tractor-trailer nearly jackknifing on Interstate 40 near Van Buren.
And FOX Weather Correspondent Katie Byrne was in Fayetteville, Arkansas, and said roads and sidewalks across the region were icy and dangerous.
""The whole thing started up in Oklahoma last night, then it pushed into Arkansas and also is getting into Missouri,"" she said.
HIDDEN DANGERS EXIST AFTER SNOW MELTS
She said the roads appeared to be only wet, and that’s why conditions were dangerous.
""(The roads) are very shiny,"" she said. ""That’s what you’re going to deal with, the potential for black ice.""
WHY DO BRIDGES AND OVERPASSES FREEZE BEFORE ROADS?
Conditions on the roads in Missouri were also extremely dangerous.
The MSHP shared video on X, formerly Twitter, that showed a car driving down a hilly, ice-covered road in Pleasant Hill and then driving off the side after sliding back and forth to avoid disabled vehicles.

It's likely taking advantage of the ""freezing ground conditions"" to move armored vehicles.
Data from the Ukrainian General Staff suggests these attacks result in huge losses.
Russia is ramping up its front-line offensives against Ukraine, likely taking advantage of the ""freezing ground conditions"" to move armored vehicles around the country, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in an update on the conflict on Sunday.
In the military intelligence update, the MoD said that data from the Ukrainian General Staff pointed ""toward a steady increase in the intensity of Russian offensive activity across the front over the last two weeks.""
But Russia's mounting attacks are leading to huge losses to its military vehicles and personnel, the MoD said, citing data from the Ukrainian General Staff.
From January 14 to January 18, it said the data suggested that Russian military vehicle losses had climbed 88%, while tank losses had soared 95%. The number of Russian casualties over the period had also increased by 15%, it added.
For example, Russian forces are repeatedly carrying out large-scale infantry ""meat assaults"" on the city of Avdiivka, a Ukrainian commander said, CNN reported.
""Assault after assault, non-stop. If we kill 40 to 70 of them with drones in a day, the next day they renew their forces and continue to attack,"" ""Teren,"" an artillery reconnaissance commander of Ukraine's 110th Mechanized Brigade, told CNN.
Russia has become increasingly reliant on high-risk frontal assaults, or ""human-wave attacks,"" which attempt to overwhelm Ukrainian positions.
Russian forces may be attempting to make the most of the hard, frozen grounds left by Ukraine's harsh winter before the spring thaw and mud season, which caught Russia out at the outbreak of the war in February 2022, set in again.
The rapid melting of snow and ice in parts of eastern Europe in spring gives way to thick mud that makes travel extremely difficult. Russians call the period ""Rasputitsa,"" translated as ""when roads stop existing,"" The Guardian reported.
The mud season causes problems for Russia and Ukraine, with artillery and military vehicles trapped in the sodden, heavy clay soil.
Butm experts previously told Business Insider that Ukraine's US-provided Abrams tanks could be key during the mud season fighting.
""The Abrams was made for this environment,"" Robert Greenway, a former adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank, said.
""The mud could become impassable for almost any vehicle,"" Greenway said, ""but the reality is that the Abrams is best equipped to deal with that environment, far better than any other tracked vehicle in existence.""

1SWIW7ARRV_7JU9TP8KJ3QE9XP,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Compass Group PLC (LON:CPG),editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 5:26 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-compass-group-082639204.html,"The projected fair value for Compass Group is UK£19.06 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
Current share price of UK£21.70 suggests Compass Group is potentially trading close to its fair value
Analyst price target for CPG is UK£23.42, which is 23% above our fair value estimate
In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Compass Group PLC (LON:CPG) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.
View our latest analysis for Compass Group
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = UK£14b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.4%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = UK£2.8b× (1 + 1.5%) ÷ (8.4%– 1.5%) = UK£42b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= UK£42b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= UK£19b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is UK£33b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of UK£21.7, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Compass Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.156. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Strength
Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.
Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.
Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.
Weakness
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.
Opportunity
Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the British market.
Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.
Threat
Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Compass Group, we've put together three additional aspects you should look at:

Comics lineups to shift in weekday, Sunday Arizona Republic","Greg Burton, Arizona Republic","Updated January 22, 2024 at 7:03 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/whats-look-comics-lineups-shift-130025363.html,"If you’re like me, you started reading newspapers for the comics. I started with kid-of-the-‘60s staples – ""Family Circus,"" ""Dennis The Menace,"" ""Peanuts.""
Over time, new favorites caught my eye: ""Pearls Before Swine,"" ""Opus"" (before Berkeley Breathed ended the strip) and ""The Far Side"" by Gary Larson, who retired his single-panel comic for 24 years before teasing a refreshed approach in 2020.
Larson and I attended Washington State University about a decade apart, so I followed his career with a step-version of pride known only to fans of perennial underdogs like the Cougs.
Tastes change, subscribers evolve, old strips retire and new strips are born. As Breathed and Larson found, change can be restorative. We hope you agree and that you’ll embrace changes to The Arizona Republic’s weekday and Sunday comics lineups.
Beginning Monday, Jan. 29, you’ll find the same number of weekday strips, 22, with a handful of comics replaced by ""Jump Start,"" ""Ziggy,"" ""Crabgrass,"" ""Crankshaft,"" ""Baldo,"" ""Frank & Ernest"" and ""Born Loser."" Sunday's in-living-color comics section will be remixed by a few departures and the additions of ""Peanuts,"" ""Jump Start,"" ""Ziggy,"" ""Marmaduke,"" ""Crankshaft,"" ""Baldo,"" ""Frank & Ernest"" and ""Born Loser.""
To make way for the new, we must let go of a few beloved comics. The strips being replaced are ""Andy Capp,"" ""B.C.,"" ""Carpe Diem,"" ""Doonesbury,"" ""Drabble,"" ""F Minus,"" ""Fred Basset,"" ""Macanudo,"" ""Mother Goose,"" ""Mutts,"" ""Rose is Rose,"" ""The Other Coast"" and ""Wallace the Brave.""
Reader feedback, surveys and staff research informed these choices. To prepare for the switch, a few reporters and editors from the USA TODAY Network, of which we are a part, spent the last half of 2023 examining the history of comics in newspapers, from Joseph Pulitzer’s The Yellow Kid to Arizona’s own Bil Keane, the creator of ""Family Circus.""
Keane lived in Scottsdale for five decades, drawing portraits of middle America from a home on Lincoln Drive. Keane died in 2011. Today, his son Jeff (Jeffy from the strip) carries on the family tradition.
“Oh, I always think of it as his cartoon,” Jeff told Republic columnist Bill Goodykoontz in a recent interview. “I don't have a problem with doing the cartoon. It’s our family, is really what it is when I’m doing the cartoon. I think of it as ‘This is my mom, this is my dad, this was me, my brothers, my sister.’
“And it brings me great memories when I'm doing that. I’m nothing but proud of the opportunity to continue something that he created that I really think is a special cartoon in the newspaper. I think it has a unique place on the comics page.”
And we’re proud to run it.
Appealing to the young and old is not an easy thing. Some cartoonists don’t try. Others try and fail. A rare few defy age and time.
Earlier this month, we ran a strip of the ""Peanuts"" crew readying for a school field trip in a patch of cold and snow not unlike the polar plunge gripping half the nation this week.
Standing by a yellow bus, the oft-underestimated Sally Brown spoke as if she had climbed through a portal to the politics of today.
“If my ears fall off,” Sally said, “I’m gonna sue the school board.”
""Peanuts"" debuted in 1950. Much has changed, including ""Peanuts.""
The summer after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, ""Peanuts"" creator Charles Schultz integrated his cartoon. In that strip, he introduced the Black character Franklin Armstrong. While the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968 outlawed Jim Crow and enforced fair housing, many public spaces remained racially separate.
""Schulz showed Franklin and Charlie Brown meeting on the beach at a time when beaches were segregated,” said Jenny Robb, curator at Ohio State University’s Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum.
Columbus Dispatch’s Belinda M. Paschal interviewed Robb as we readied our comics refresh.
""Schulz was sending a message,” Robb told Paschal. “A lot of papers were uncomfortable in the South, but he stood his ground. It's an important moment.”
Not every cartoon has the staying power of Charlie Brown.
But I hope these new cartoons find a place in your daily Republic routine.
If you want more comics than we offer in print, we publish a larger selection online at www.azcentral.com/comics.
If you want your comics in a print format but accessible anytime, anywhere, our weekday and Sunday comics pages are available in The Republic’s daily eNewspaper on the azcentral app, desktop and tablet.

26DA2EBCZY_B3SL5SUHV8H17H4,5 reasons DeSantis’ presidential campaign collapsed before the GOP’s first primary,Max Greenwood,"January 22, 2024 at 6:55 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/5-reasons-desantis-presidential-campaign-215537175.html,"Once viewed as the strongest contender to former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis aborted his stumbling presidential campaign on Sunday, acknowledging that he had no path to the Republican nomination.
His announcement, by video, ended a campaign that was marred from the jump, beginning with a glitch-plagued announcement on the platform formerly known as Twitter and lasting another eight months, despite in-fighting and missteps.
Here are five of the biggest reasons his campaign collapsed:
DeSantis’ campaign and an allied super PAC, Never Back Down, went all-in on Iowa, betting that a strong showing in the first nominating contest would undercut Trump and project him forward. They assembed a massive door-knocking and voter outreach operation that was unrivaled in modern politics.
DeSantis himself campaigned in each of the state’s 99 counties — and went on to lose every one of them.
READ MORE: Republicans see narrow path for DeSantis through early primary states: ‘Iowa is crucial’
He tailored his message to the political appetites of an Iowa electorate, deploying anti-abortion rights rhetoric and a populist tone that cast him as a political outsider who could use the force of government to accomplish conservative policy priorities. His focus appeared to hobble his campaign in other important early-voting states, like libertarian-leaning New Hampshire.
Polling in the Granite State showed DeSantis performing notably worse than in Iowa prior to ending his campaign on Sunday.
From the outset, DeSantis’ campaign showed signs of internal struggles. Many of his top staffers had never worked on a presidential operation before, including his first campaign manager Genera Peck, who was removed from the post after less than two months on the job.
RELATED: Don’t know DeSantis’ campaign manager? Generra Peck would like to keep it that way
But instead of replacing her with an experienced campaign veteran, he instead elevated his chief of staff from the Florida governor’s office, James Uthmeier, who also lacked presidential campaign experience.
To fill gaps in his formal campaign operation, DeSantis leaned heavily on Never Back Down to handle key functions typically reserved for a candidate’s campaign. The super PAC was staffed by longtime political operatives like Republican strategists Jeff Roe and David Polyansky, a veteran of Iowa campaigns. Polyansky was eventually brought onto DeSantis’ team as deputy campaign manager.
The reliance on Never Back Down led to its own set of problems. Many of the group’s experienced operatives found themselves at loggerheads with members of DeSantis’ inner circle — and sometimes even the governor himself — over messaging strategies. Late last year, a group of DeSantis loyalists formed a new super PAC called Fight Right to handle TV ad spending.
Never Back Down also struggled with internal strife. Several of the group’s leaders and high-profile staffers either resigned or were fired in the weeks before the Iowa caucuses, including CEO Chris Jankowski and Roe.
DeSantis put his governing record in Florida front and center on the campaign trail, preaching what he called the “Florida blueprint” to voters nationwide.
He boasted about his decision to reopen Florida’s economy early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, bragged about reducing the state debt and rallied supporters over his ongoing fight with Walt Disney World over the company’s special tax district in Central Florida.
Voters shrugged.
Steve Long, 60, of Ogden, Iowa said that he liked what he had heard about DeSantis’ record on education in Florida, but raised an issue that has been a persistent political headache in the Sunshine State.
“I heard that insurance is getting pretty expensive down there,” said Long, who was supporting entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy’s presidential campaign.
Jackie Sapp, 68, a retired school teacher from Kelly, Iowa said that she had considered supporting DeSantis, but ultimately decided to back former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. Sapp said that DeSantis wasn’t “real concrete on his main policies.”
“It seems like he attacks. But what are your ideas? How are you going to approach it? It’s always about ‘me, me, me.’ And I don’t want someone who’s ‘me, me, me.’ ”
From the outset, the biggest challenge facing DeSantis’ campaign — and those of virtually every 2024 Republican candidate — was how to loosen Trump’s vise-like grip over the GOP voter base.
Despite losing reelection in 2020 and facing numerous legal problems, Trump has consistently polled double-digits ahead of his nearest Republican rivals, prompting him to treat the primary, in some ways, as more of a coronation than a contest. Ultimately, convincing Republicans that it was time to move on from Trump proved too tall an order for DeSantis.
Throughout much of his campaign, he treaded lightly when it came to contrasting himself with the former president, who was once a key political ally of the governor. DeSantis’ argument hinged on the notion that he could accomplish the promises that went unfulfilled during Trump’s tenure in the White House.
In the final weeks of his campaign, DeSantis began to sharpen his criticism of Trump. He notably insisted that the former president is not “pro-life” during a nationally televised CNN town hall. On the trail, he repeatedly deployed the line that Trump was campaigning for president on “his issues,” while DeSantis was focused on voters’ issues.
David Kochel, a veteran Republican strategist in Iowa, said that part of the challenge for DeSantis and the other candidates was that Trump’s supporters have stood firm with the former president and aren’t likely to abandon him. That means that the GOP nominating contest has simply been a race to determine who will run one-on-one against Trump, he said.
“The Trump vote is already there,” Kochel said. “The job of Iowa and New Hampshire is to answer the question of which candidate earns the right to take on Trump. And if that doesn’t get resolved, then Trump runs away as the nominee.”
DeSantis and his campaign bet that he could ascend nationally the same way he did in the state: by attacking reporters and stiff-arming most of the press, preferring interviews with friendly, conservative outlets. Last week, he admitted that he should have done more “corporate shows.”"

Hutchinson has been sharply critical of Trump before and was booed last year after he said in front of a Republican crowd that it was likely Trump would be found guilty of a felony before the election was over.
He also said earlier last year that Trump should drop out of the race after he was first indicted on criminal charges, saying that it would be a ""sideshow and distraction"" during the election.
Haley placed a narrow third in Iowa to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis but is polling second in New Hampshire to Trump who also won Iowa. Trump, however, won Iowa by 30 points and has a double-digital lead in New Hampshire.

2BD6B6JIK2_90QG5WMWNPL6I02,"Palestinian death toll in Gaza surpasses 25,000 while Israel announces the death of another hostage",NAJIB JOBAIN and SAMY MAGDY,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 6:01 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/palestinian-death-toll-soars-past-091315604.html,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Palestinian death toll from the war between Israel and Hamas has soared past 25,000, the Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip said Sunday, while Israel announced the death of another hostage and appeared far from achieving its goals of freeing more than 100 others and crushing the militant group.
The war's deaths, destruction and displacement are without precedent in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The war has divided Israelis while the offensive threatens to ignite a wider conflict involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that support the Palestinians.
Furious with the Israeli government and demanding the release of remaining hostages, relatives and others set up a tent camp outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem and vowed to stay until a deal is reached.
Netanyahu, in a defiant new statement, said he stressed in his conversation Friday with U.S. President Joe Biden that he rejects Hamas demands for a cease-fire, Israeli forces' withdrawal and the release of Palestinians held by Israel in exchange for the remaining hostages. He said that agreeing means another devastating Hamas attack “would only be a matter of time.”
Netanyahu also rejects calls from U.S, its closest ally, for postwar plans that would include a path to Palestinian statehood. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the refusal to accept a two-state solution unacceptable.
“The Middle East is a tinderbox. We must do all we can to prevent conflict igniting across the region,"" Guterres added. ""And that starts with an immediate humanitarian cease-fire to relieve the suffering in Gaza.”
GAZA DEATH TOLL CLIMBS
The war began with Hamas’ attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 hostages back to Gaza.
Israel's military announced the death of 19-year-old Sgt. Shay Levinson, who was among the hostages. His date of death was given as Oct. 7, but there were no further details. According to Israeli media, his body is still in Gaza.
Israel has responded to the Oct. 7 attack with a bombing campaign and ground invasion that laid waste to entire neighborhoods in northern Gaza and spread south, striking some areas where it told civilians to seek refuge. Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation.
“The plumes of smoke from tanks, artillery and the planes of the air force will continue to cover the sky over the Gaza Strip until we will achieve our goals,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said.
Since the war started, 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, while another 62,681 have been wounded, the Health Ministry said. The toll included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza’s hospitals since Saturday, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said.
The overall toll is thought to be higher because many casualties remain buried under rubble or in areas that medics cannot reach, Al-Qidra said.
The Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures but says about two-thirds of the people killed in Gaza were women and minors. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but its casualty figures from previous wars were largely consistent with those of U.N. agencies and even the Israeli military.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense neighborhoods. The military released footage of a tunnel under a residential neighborhood in Khan Younis where the army believes at least 20 hostages were kept at different times.
Israel’s military said the demolition last week of a key building at Israa University in Gaza was under review, and asserted that preliminary findings indicated Hamas had used the compound for military purposes. The university has said the “attack” came weeks after Israeli forces occupied the building.
The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza’s residents, with hundreds of thousands packing U.N.-run shelters and camps in the south. U.N. officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as a trickle of humanitarian aid reaches them because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions.
Israel said 260 trucks of aid entered Gaza on Sunday, the highest number since the war began. About 500 entered daily before that, according to the U.N.
“Bread does not suffice for one hour,” said Ahmad Al-Nashawi, who accepted donated food at a tent camp in the southern city of Rafah. “You can see how many children we have other than women and men. What matters most for a child is to eat.”
ISRAELIS INCREASINGLY DIVIDED
At the new protest camp outside Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence, hostages' families urged the government to act.
""It’s not logical that you’re telling us the war must continue, and you keep saying that because of military pressure we will release them, but we don’t see a single one released because of this pressure,” said Gilad Korengold, the father of hostage Tal Shoham.
Some top Israeli officials have begun to acknowledge that Netanyahu's goals of “complete victory” over Hamas and returning the remaining hostages might be mutually exclusive.
A member of Israel’s War Cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, said last week that the only way to free the hostages was through a cease-fire.
But Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners push him to step up the offensive, with some calling for the “voluntary” emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there.
Hamas is believed to be using the hostages as shields for its top leaders. Israel has rescued one hostage, and Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations.
Hostages' families want an exchange like the one during a weeklong November cease-fire. Other Israelis are frustrated by the security failures ahead of the Oct. 7 attack and by Netanyahu's handling of the war.
Near the site of an Oct. 7 massacre during a music festival, families of Israeli victims planted trees.
“What happened after 109 days? Nothing. We’re just still waiting,” said one father, Idan Bahat.

President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi slammed Ethiopia’s agreement with the breakaway region. He called on Ethiopia to seek benefits from seaports in Somalia and Djibouti “through transitional means,” rather than through attempts to “control another (country’s) territory.”
“We will not allow anyone to threaten Somalia or infringe upon its territory,” el-Sissi told a joint news conference in Cairo with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mahmoud. “No one should attempt to threaten Egypt’s brothers, especially if our brothers asked us to stand with them.”
Somaliland, a region strategically located by the Gulf of Aden, broke away from Somalia in 1991 as the country collapsed into a warlord-led conflict. The region has maintained its own government despite its lack of international recognition.
Somaliland leader Muse Bihi Abdi signed a memorandum of understanding with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed earlier this month to allow Ethiopia to lease a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) stretch of coastline to establish a marine force base.
Sheikh Mohamud, the Somali president, rejected the deal as a violation of international law, saying: “We will not stand idly by and watch our sovereignty being compromised.”
He arrived in Egypt this weekend to rally support for his government. He met with the Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit and Al-Azhar mosque's Grand Imam, Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb.
Egypt is at odds with Ethiopia over a controversial hydroelectric dam Ethiopia has built on the Nile river's main tributary. The two countries — along with Sudan — have been trying for over a decade to reach a negotiated agreement on the filling and operation of the $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam.
The latest round of talks last month ended without a deal and Cairo and Addis Ababa traded blame for the failure.
Negotiators have said key questions remain about how much water Ethiopia will release downstream if a multi-year drought occurs, and how the countries will resolve any future disputes. Ethiopia rejects binding arbitration at the final stage.
The dam is on the Blue Nile near the Sudan border and Egypt fears it will have a devastating effect on its water and irrigation supply downstream unless Ethiopia takes its needs into account.
The dam began producing power last year and Ethiopia said it had completed the final phase of filling the dam’s reservoir in September."

Three hours later, a few hundred joined the Boise March for Life parade from Julia Davis Park to the steps of the Capitol in support of the abortion policy that bans nearly every rationale for the procedure.
The dueling protests come about a year and a half after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to determine their own abortion policies.
Idaho has taken one of the hardest stances against abortion in the nation — banning nearly every case aside from when a pregnant person is at risk of death or in cases of rape or incest that have first been reported to police.
The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state in August 2022, saying that its policy violated the federal Emergency Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA).
EMTALA is a federal law that requires hospitals to treat patients if they are experiencing an emergency medical condition, or transfer them to a different hospital if they don’t have the capability to treat them, according to the National Institutes of Health. The law allows doctors to carry out abortions if the pregnant person’s health is at risk.
Idaho’s policy bans abortion even in emergency medical situations. Physicians who perform an abortion and are not exempt under Idaho’s law can face up to five years in prison, according to prior Idaho Statesman reporting.
The legal case has stalled and resumed the state’s abortion policy several times and has since made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. On Jan. 5, the Supreme Court allowed the state’s abortion ban to stand.
Since then, Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Viola, introduced a bill to ban abortion even in cases of incest or rape and allow the procedure only if it was certain the pregnant person would die without it, according to prior Statesman reporting.
“We have the most extreme abortion ban in the nation with … absolutely no exception for women’s health or for a non-viable fetus,” said House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, during the Women’s March. “We’re in a crisis situation.”
Rubel said Republicans in the Idaho Legislature blocked proposed bills that would have helped women, such as expanding Medicaid that would have allowed free contraception to low-income women. She added that Idaho is one of four states in the country that has no public pre-K.
“We had an opportunity to get that pre-K using federal money that wouldn’t have cost us any state dollars,” Rubel said. “But they turned down that money.”
In March, the Legislature passed a budget that excluded $36 million for an ongoing child care stabilization grant funded through federal dollars, according to prior Statesman reporting.
Catherine Glenn Foster, a lawyer and former president of anti-abortion group Americans United for Life, argued for bolstering childcare quality and making it affordable in the state during the March for Life, despite the Legislature’s actions.
“We have to figure out how to articulate what we as a pro-life movement are for because we are pro-life, not anti-child,” Foster said.
Foster said they needed to serve women, babies, refugees and vulnerable and disenfranchised populations through pregnancy resource centers.
“We’re here to talk about the total whole life viewpoint, which includes workforce development, adult education, care for immigrants and refugees and people with diagnoses and elder care,” Foster said. “All of that is pro-life.”
Multiple health systems in Idaho, such as Bonner General Health in Sandpoint, have ceased delivering babies over fears that doctors could be prosecuted, according to prior Statesman reporting.
“Our healthcare system is getting hollowed out,” said Dr. Cynthia Brooke, a speaker at the Women’s March and an obstetrician-gynecologist in Meridian. “Idaho is like a rudderless ship.”
Foster argued the opposite — saying doctors were leaving the state because they were forced to perform abortions by the Biden administration."

Not everyone would consider it a compliment, but an Australian woman is thrilled after an international panel gave her the ""World's Ugliest Lawn"" award.
Officials from the Swedish island of Gotland launched the competition to ""save water by changing the norm of green lawns,"" according to a press release from the island. Judges included Gotland officials and individuals from Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, and the US.
""That's the genius of this competition. It uses humor to shine a light on such a serious subject,"" the press release said. ""It awards those willing to proudly proclaim that theirs is the lawn which deserves disgusted glances from neighbors – and a round of applause from around the globe.""
As a prize, the Swedish competition awarded Kathleen Murray of Tasmania with a ""Proud owner of The World's Ugliest Lawn"" t-shirt. The press release noted that all contestants had ""a lot of ugliness to be proud of"" in their dry yards.

Murray, a 53-year-old mother of four, told The Washington Post she meant to start landscaping her yard, but eventually, she just gave up, allowing local burrowers and grazers — such as wallabies, kangaroos, echidnas, and bandicoots — to be ""nature's lawn mowers.""
""They don't think my backyard is ugly,"" Murray told the Post. ""They think it's beautiful.""

Euren Balbuena, 33, was sentenced to 33 years to life in prison for killing his girlfriend, 31-year-old Zaira Patino-Trejo, Ventura County District Attorney Erik Nasarenko announced in a Thursday press release.
According to the Ventura Star, citing Joey Buttitta, a spokesperson for the Ventura County District Attorney’s Office, a ""brief altercation"" happened as the emotional victim impact statements were being read in court.
Buttita said that Patino-Trejo's stepfather lunged at the convicted killer and landed ""at least"" one punch.

Photos released by the Ventura County District Attorney's Office showed Balbuena's reaction from the attack.
The stepfather was removed from the courtroom following the attack, the local outlet said.
The district attorney said that Balbuena was sentenced following a brutal attack on February 27, 2020.
Officials said the 33-year-old and Patino-Trejo were in the middle of an argument inside their Simi Valley, California apartment when the victim's mother arrived at the couple's shared Simi Valley, California apartment.
When Patino-Trejo noticed ""signs of more abuse"" on her daughter's face, she attempted to leave with her but Balbuena would not let her out of the apartment.

Patino-Trejo's mother managed to escape the apartment and contacted a bystander who called local police offices.
Balbuena was arrested by police and convicted by a jury on November 21, 2023, of the first-degree murder of Patino-Trejo, battery causing great bodily injury, and assault with a deadly weapon against her mother, the DA said.
Following Balbuena's sentencing, Supervising Senior Deputy District Attorney Melissa Suttner said in a statement that they ""pursued justice"" for the victim's family.
""Zaira Patino-Trejo was such a vibrant young woman with a bright future,""Suttner said. ""We cannot replace her unimaginable loss, but we pursued justice for Zaira and her family. We hope that this sentence brings some small relief to her family, knowing that Euren Balbuena was held accountable for her brutal murder.""

Chief Deputy District Attorney John Giordani said in court that the indictment also charges the teenagers with conspiracy to commit battery, a gross misdemeanor.
The Associated Press is not naming the students because they were juveniles at the time of the Nov. 1 beating.
Nine students have so far been arrested in connection with the attack that left 17-year-old Jonathan Lewis Jr. dead. Giordani said the other students are awaiting separate hearings.
According to Las Vegas police, 10 students between the ages of 13 and 17 participated in the beating that unfolded after school in an alleyway just around the corner from Rancho High School. The police department said Friday that investigators are still searching for the 10th suspect.
In the aftermath, students, teachers and staff were left to grapple with how a conflict over a stolen vape pen and a pair of wireless headphones escalated.
Police said that Lewis walked to the alley with his friend after school but don’t believe he was the target.
Lt. Jason Johansson said the cellphone video showed Lewis taking off his shirt to prepare for the fight, then the 10 students “immediately swarm him, pull him to the ground and begin kicking, punching and stomping on him.”
After the fight, according to Johannson, a person in the area found Lewis badly beaten and unconscious and carried him back to campus, where school staff called 911 and tried to help him.
In Nevada, a teenager facing a murder charge can be charged as an adult if they were 13 or older at the time of the alleged crime.

Live music promoters FKP Scorpio UK, who have worked with artists including Diana Ross and Ed Sheeran, will run three events in Queen Square, Bristol, between 9-11 August.
Almost 50 residents and business owners have opposed the plans because of noise, disruption and security fears.
Bristol City Council granted permission for the event on Thursday.
Resident Carlos De Souza told the meeting: ""It's not a suitable proposal. Security is a concern.
""The police don't have the capacity to police the city centre as it is, let alone another 15,000 people.""
Julian Ellacott, director of National Friendly, which has an office in the square, said the concerts would cause disruption, and resident Janet Wilson said previous big events - Arcadia in 2015 and Massive Attack's 2003 gig - were ""disastrous"" and a ""horrific experience"" for neighbours.
""Children's eardrums will be pierced by the kind of noise levels they're suggesting - 96 decibels,"" she added.
But solicitor Matthew Phipps, representing the applicants, said FKP Scorpio had significant experience and that the concerts would ""enhance Bristol's reputation nationally and internationally as a home of music"".
Mr Phipps added: ""It would be absolute nonsense for me to pretend you could walk at the side of Queen Square and be unaware of the event, so our job is to minimise disruption.
""This is a challenge that we will need to rise to, but that is true of all licensing applications.""
Bristol City Council senior pollution control officer Mark Curtis said he had agreed conditions with the promoters over the management of the site but not on noise levels, which would be required before the events could happen.
Councillor Richard Eddy said: ""I hope and believe the applicants are committed to making this work on what is a challenging site.""

Ron DeSantis suspended his Republican presidential campaign Sunday on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, ending a White House bid that failed to meet expectations that he would emerge as a serious challenger to former President Donald Trump.
DeSantis announced his decision in a video posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.
The ambitious big-state governor entered the 2024 presidential contest with major advantages in his quest to take on Trump, and early primary polls suggested DeSantis was in a strong position to do just that. He and his allies amassed a political fortune well in excess of $100 million, and he boasted a significant legislative record on issues important to many conservatives, like abortion and the teaching of race and gender issues in schools.
Such advantages did not survive the reality of presidential politics in 2024. From a high-profile announcement that was plagued by technical glitches to constant upheavals to his staff and campaign strategy, DeSantis struggled to find his footing in the primary. He lost the Iowa caucuses — which he had vowed to win — by 30 percentage points to Trump.
And now, DeSantis’ political future is in question after suspending his presidential bid after just one voting contest. The 45-year-old is term limited as Florida governor."

Russia would of course prefer to avoid relying on external assistance as ""this has always been considered beneath them, it’s an indignity.""
Another problem Russia faces is manpower. According to Budanov, Moscow is losing as many, or even more, troops than it can recruit.
According to Defense Express, Moscow may have received KN-23 ballistic missiles, which are similar to the Russian Iskander-M, from Pyongyang.
U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that Russia struck Ukraine with North Korean ballistic missiles on Dec. 30, 2023, and Jan. 2 and 6, 2024.
During the first attack, a missile sourced from the DPRK fell in Zaporizhzhya Oblast. More North Korean missiles were fired by Russia on Jan. 2.
According to the White House, Russia again fired several North Korean missiles at Ukraine on Jan. 6.
South Korea's representative to the UN, Hwang Joon-kook, said that North Korea is using Ukraine as a ""testing ground"" for ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.
North Korea called the U.S. accusations of transferring ballistic missiles to Russia for the war against Ukraine ""groundless.""

Ron DeSantis (R) dropped out of the Republican presidential primary Sunday, marking the end of a stunning rise and fall for a candidate once seen as the most formidable rival to former President Trump.
“Following our second-place finish in Iowa, we’ve prayed and deliberated on our way forward,” DeSantis said in a video message posted on X, a few hours ahead of an event he had scheduled in New Hampshire. “If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it. But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.”
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” the governor continued. “While I have had disagreements with Donald Trump such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. That is clear.”
DeSantis went on to signal his support for Trump while hitting former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear. A repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
DeSantis had been seen as the most viable Trump alternative after sweeping to reelection as Florida governor during last year’s midterm elections. His victory was in sharp contrast to how other Republicans performed around the country, including many who had been endorsed by Trump.
The Florida governor launched his official bid in May with the support of a number of GOP campaign veterans in his campaign apparatus and super PAC.
But DeSantis was not able to gain traction against Trump, his one-time political ally. DeSantis’s campaign got off to a rocky start when its Twitter Spaces launch was plagued with technical glitches. And the governor faced criticism over his personality on the campaign trail, with critics labeling him as awkward.
Though he placed second in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, he still fell well short of Trump, winning just 21 percent to Trump’s 51 percent. He was widely expected to fare poorly in New Hampshire, where former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley (R) is seen as the most competitive rival to the former president.
Ahead of his exit from the GOP primary on Sunday, The Hill’s Decision Desk HQ average showed DeSantis coming in third place in New Hampshire with 7.2 percent and in South Carolina with 8.3 percent.
DeSantis’s exit from the race is likely to benefit Trump, who shares a base with the Florida governor. At a campaign event at Trump campaign headquarters in Manchester, N.H. on Sunday prior to DeSantis dropping out, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said he would welcome DeSantis back into the Trump orbit.
“I remember the good old days when I was Ron DeSantis’s transition chairman and he and President Trump worked so well together,” Gatez, a top surrogate to Trump, told supporters.
“I hate when mom and dad fight,” he continued, receiving laughs from the crowd. “It turns out we might get Ron DeSantis back on side pretty soon and I would welcome that,” he said to applause.

Both candidates have seen an increase in support since the previous survey earlier this month, when Trump had the backing of 39% of voters and Haley registered at 32%, CNN reported. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis stood at just 6% in the latest poll, below the 10% level of support that would be needed to win delegates in line with GOP rules.
Among voters who say they haven’t yet locked in a choice ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, 51% broadly support Haley, while 28% are behind Trump and 14% favor DeSantis. In Democratic polling, about two-thirds of likely voters plan to support Biden, according to the survey.
CNN said the poll was conducted from Jan. 16-19 from a sample of 2,348 New Hampshire adults, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

2PZB66IL4Y_MO0HCY2366IAV7I,Chimney Cake: A Barbecued Street Food With A Transylvanian Past,Maria Scinto,"January 22, 2024 at 7:15 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/chimney-cake-barbecued-street-food-221500676.html,"Chimney cake may not sound too appetizing, but the name doesn't refer to its being charred and soot-blackened, but rather to its tall, cylindrical shape. The chimney cake, or Kürtőskalács, is Hungary's take on the type of European pastry known as a spit cake — again with the off-putting monikers, we know. The spit, or, if you prefer, spindle, involved in the cooking is a horizontal rotisserie, and some of the more elaborate versions of these cakes include Poland's infamously difficult sękacz, Lithuania's similar sakotis, and Germany's multi-layered baumkuchen (""tree cake"").
Hungary's chimney cakes originated in Transylvania — which is today part of Romania — and aren't quite as complex as some of the above cakes, as these require constant attention from a baker who ladles batter over the cakes as they rotate. Kürtőskalács, however, is made from a strip of yeast dough that is wrapped around a spindle and baked.

If we trace the history of chimney cake back as far as we can, the earliest known mention of such a dish is in a 15th-century German manuscript. The first recipe, however, wasn't published for another 300 years or so, as it appears in a 1784 cookbook attributed to Countess Mária Mikes of Zabola, which is located in Transylvania. At the time, the region was part of Hungary, but after some back-and-forthing subsequent to the First World War, Transylvania (including Zabola) officially became part of Romania in 1947. Despite Transylvania's 20th-century split, it seems that Hungary got custody of the chimney cake in the divorce proceedings.
The original version of kürtőskalács, or ""kürtős kaláts' à la Mrs. Poráni,"" seems to have been a savory one because the recipe makes no mention of sugar. A different recipe that came out some 11 years later did offer the option of sweetening the cake after it was cooked, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that anyone suggested adding sugar before baking. As for the crushed nuts that are a typical kürtőskalács coating today, these date back only as far as a 1980 cookbook called ""Erdélyi Lakoma"" authored by Pál Kövi (later republished in 1985 as ""Paul Kovi's Transylvanian Cuisine."" This Hungarian-born restaurateur not only left his stamp on chimney cakes but also helmed New York's Four Seasons restaurant for over 20 years.
The actual chimney cake itself is nothing too fancy, at least if the ingredients are anything to go by. The dough is made from what appears to be a pretty standard array of cake ingredients. Butter, eggs, flour, milk, salt, sugar — yep, all of the usual suspects are present, although most recipes typically don't call for any spices, seasonings, or flavoring extracts like vanilla or almond. What sets the kürtőskalács dough apart from most cake batters is the inclusion of yeast, so the texture and flavor are more akin to that of sweet bread, while some people have compared it to babka.
Most of the flavor in a chimney cake comes from the coating. This may be plain sugar, which was the case with most chimney cakes baked in the 19th and early 20th centuries, although these days the sugar is often mixed with cinnamon, cocoa powder, or crushed walnuts. When the sugar melts, it provides the kürtőskalács with a caramel taste and crispy coating, while any mix-ins will, of course, lend their influence, as well.
What makes the chimney cake so special — not to mention, gives it its name — isn't what goes into it, but how it's cooked. As the title implies, one of the methods of cooking the cake is over an open flame, although this is something you may be more likely to see at a Christmas market or other outdoor festival, and then, too, only if you should happen to be traveling in Hungary at the time. Commercial kürtőskalács bakers, though, also have the indoor option of using a special rotisserie grill that bakes multiple cakes at a time on rotating spits.
Home cooks, too, have multiple options for baking kürtőskalács. While you could use a purpose-built mold made of metal or wood, you can also DIY such an implement by wrapping foil around a rolling pin or pint-sized aluminum can. Another even simpler, option involves rolling the dough strips up into spirals without using any kind of mold at all. These cakes are then baked standing on end in a standard oven, with no need to rotate them as the upright position should ensure even cooking.
Even though using crushed walnuts as a kürtőskalács coating didn't really kick off until the 1980s, these days they are considered to be fairly traditional, along with cinnamon sugar and cocoa powder. This leaves lots of room for bakeries to experiment with other, less-traditional toppings, though, including chocolate chips, coconut, poppy seeds, pistachios, almonds, hazelnuts, and colored sprinkles. Yet another way restaurants will change up a chimney cake is by using it as an extra-tall ice cream cone or filling it with whipped cream, Nutella, or fruit.
Savory kürtőskalács is also a thing, at least in Hungary where you may be able to find them stuffed with meatballs or even the tomato-pepper stew called lecsó. Homemade chimney cakes could also be made into a main dish by omitting the sugar from the dough and filling the bread-like cones with sausage, pulled pork, shredded chicken, or chili. You could also do breakfast kürtőskalács, too. One eatery in Australia is already offering eggs Benedict in a chimney cake, while chimney cake omelets, quiches, and huevos rancheros could all be pretty tasty, as well.
While one of the most enjoyable ways to experience kürtőskalács may be to travel to Budapest during the holiday season and buy one fresh off a street vendor's grill, Hungary's capital city also has a number of bakeries and restaurants specializing in this cake. Among these are Vitéz Kürtős, a bakery that sells not only chimney cakes but also kürtőskalács layer cakes and fondues; Kató Néni's, where some chimney cakes come in rainbow colors; and Hoppácska, where each week brings three new savory kürtőskalács that might include such options as a bacon cheeseburger served in a chimney cone.
Outside of Hungary, a mini-chain called Merika Café brings its array of chimney cakes to outposts in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Australia. If you're looking to try kürtőskalács without leaving the U.S., however, you can also find them at Kürtős Cakes in Sarasota, Florida, or Chimney Cake Island in Chicago (the latter appears to be a home baker with no outlet open to the public, so you may need to order via email or Facebook and then pick the cake up at their home). It does not look as if chimney cakes can be ordered online for nationwide delivery, although Amazon sells the similar baumkuchen in a box and a non-edible but adorable kürtőskalács plushie was being offered on Etsy last we checked.

The crash happened at a railroad intersection in Harvey, a suburb 20 miles south of Chicago, a CSX spokesperson confirmed to the Daily News.
“At approximately 1:50 am CT this morning, a CSX train came into contact with a vehicle at the Wood St. crossing intersecting W 147 St. in Harvey, Illinois,” the spokesperson said. “The incident did not result in any injuries to the train crew; however, several occupants of the vehicle were injured.”
The women, said to be in their teens or early 20s, were attempting to go around the barrier when their vehicle was hit by the freight train, Harvey Fire Department Captain Steve Gorman told CBS Chicago.
Two of the women were trapped within the wreckage, forcing emergency crews to use a hydraulic rescuing tool known as the jaws of life to extricate them.
Three victims were taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center, in neighboring Oak Lawn, Illinois. At least one of them is listed in critical condition, Gorman told ABC Chicago. The fourth victim refused treatment.
Authorities have not released the identities of the victims. The incident remains under investigation.

The inferno, which took place at the Yingcai School in Yanshanpu village, was reported to the local fire department at 11:00 pm (1500 GMT) on Friday and was put out around 40 minutes later, official news agency Xinhua said.
Thirteen students died in the accident, while one other person suffered injuries.
Dozens of police were in and around a cordoned-off area near the school on Sunday, AFP journalists saw.
An official at the scene told AFP: ""There is an investigation ongoing inside. Nobody can go in.""
Several windows on the side of the school were broken -- the only obvious signs of a major accident at the building.
Vertical metal bars covered the school's windows, AFP saw, while a permanent sign on the building's facade read: ""Enter the kindergarten happily and go home happily.""
In a video shared Sunday on Chinese social media site Weibo, a man surnamed Fan -- the father of a boy who died in the fire -- said that blood samples had been taken from parents to compare their DNA with the victims.
""We parents haven't seen our kids yet... We can only see them when the results are available,"" said Fan.
""My kid has been studying very hard,"" he added.
""I can't accept it.""
Little information about the boarding school is publicly available, though social media videos published earlier showed young children including kindergarteners wearing smocks with the school's logo as well as older children learning calligraphy.
A teacher at the school told state-run Hebei Daily that all the victims were from the same third-grade class of nine and 10-year-olds.
- 'Rapid response' -
On Sunday morning, a row of shops next to the school stood mostly shuttered, while a small clinic in a crumbling courtyard building appeared unattended.
A few locals went about their day and a couple of children played as police cars made loops around the cordoned-off area.
Some people passing by Sunday morning stared at the scene, and one man at an auto workshop across the street told AFP that he had been unaware of the fire until the following morning.
Authorities in the area are investigating the fire's cause, and at least one person linked to the school has been detained, Xinhua reported Saturday.
No official explanation of the precise cause of the deadly blaze has yet been provided, although some domestic media reports suggested it was related to an electric heating device.
Yanshanpu village lies on the outskirts of Nanyang, a city of nearly 10 million people about 850 kilometres west of Shanghai.
Nanyang Radio and Television reported Sunday that local officials had held a meeting on Saturday to discuss follow-up work for the deadly fire and improving safety measures in the future.
""Life is above all else and a rapid response is necessary,"" a readout of the meeting published by Nanyang Radio and Television said.
""Do a good job in dealing with the aftermath, put oneself in the others' shoes, be compassionate, patient and meticulous in giving emotional comfort to families of the victims, lawfully compensate them, and provide relief for those in need,"" read the report.
The reason for the fire must be ""quickly identified"", it said, adding that ""relevant duties will be strictly investigated in accordance with the law"".
Fires and other deadly accidents are common in China due to lax safety standards and poor enforcement.
In November, 26 people died and dozens were sent to hospital after a fire at a coal company office in northern China's Shanxi province.
The month before, an explosion at a barbecue restaurant in northwestern China left 31 dead and prompted official pledges of a nationwide campaign to promote workplace safety.
In April, a hospital fire in Beijing killed 29 people and forced desperate survivors to jump out of windows to escape.

Details: The presidents discussed cooperation issues between Lithuania and Poland, as well as regional security and support for Ukraine.
""We will step up cooperation, conduct joint exercises, and strengthen military mobility,"" Nausėda told reporters after his meeting with Duda.
The Lithuanian president stressed that the unity of Lithuania and Poland in supporting Ukraine is crucial and expressed hope that a meeting between representatives of the Lublin Triangle countries together with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could be organised shortly [the Lublin Triangle is a trilateral regional alliance for political, economic, cultural and social cooperation between Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine, which aims, in particular, to strengthen dialogue between the countries, support Ukraine's integration into the European Union and NATO and jointly counter Russian aggression against Ukraine – ed.].
The Lithuanian president said that supporting Ukrainian people through political, financial and military means is necessary.
Nausėda emphasised the importance of military support in order to ensure Ukraine's quicker victory over the aggressor.
Background:
Duda stated that he believes it is impossible for Ukraine to join NATO until the war with Russia is over, but he believes that the process might be initiated even at this stage.
In addition, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz recently had a telephone conversation to discuss further assistance to Ukraine.

2YIHCPK9MI_LM9M3VKW4OH8SC4,Scientists warn melting permafrost could unleash ancient ‘zombie viruses’,Andy Gregory,"January 23, 2024 at 5:49 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ancient-zombie-viruses-melting-permafrost-135956888.html,"Ancient “zombie viruses” frozen in melting Arctic permafrost could fuel a new pandemic if unleashed by climate change, scientists have warned.
Global heating is enabling increased human activity in the Earth’s northernmost reaches, as melting sea ice opens up shipping and industrial possibilities, including mining deep into the permafrost which covers a fifth of the northern hemisphere, mainly in Canada, Siberia and Alaska.
But scientists have reportedly started to plan an Arctic monitoring network to watch out for any early cases of a disease sparked by ancient viruses, also known as Methuselah microbes.
Ancient viruses have already been found in Siberian permafrost, including one sample which was 48,500 years old. A team led by geneticist Jean-Michel Claverie has revived several such viruses, capable of infecting only single-cell organisms.
But the scientists fear viruses capable of infecting humans likely also lurk in the permafrost. “We see the traces of many, many, many other viruses,” Professor Claverie told CNN in March, adding: “If the amoeba viruses are still alive, there is no reason why the other viruses will not be still alive, and capable of infecting their own hosts.”
As a result, Prof Claverie is among scientists working with the University of the Arctic network on plans to establish quarantine facilities and provide medical expertise that could pinpoint and attempt to treat any early cases without them leaving the region, according to The Observer.
“At the moment, analyses of pandemic threats focus on diseases that might emerge in southern regions and then spread north,” Prof Claverie, of Aix-Marseille University in France, told the paper. “By contrast, little attention has been given to an outbreak that might emerge in the far north and then travel south – and that is an oversight, I believe.
“There are viruses up there that have the potential to infect humans and start a new disease outbreak.” Among the genomic traces of human pathogens identified already by the team in Siberian permafrost are pox viruses and herpes viruses, he said.
Virologist Marion Koopmans agreed, telling the paper: “We don’t know what viruses are lying out there in the permafrost but I think there is a real risk that there might be one capable of triggering a disease outbreak – say of an ancient form of polio. We have to assume that something like this could happen.”
With forecasts suggesting the Arctic Sea will be ice-free as early as 2040 due to climate breakdown, it is the prospect of increased human activity in the Arctic, as opposed to melting permafrost, which most concerns Prof Claverie.
“Huge mining operations are being planned, and are going to drive vast holes into the deep permafrost to extract oil and ores,” he said. “Those operations will release vast amounts of pathogens that still thrive there. Miners will walk in and breathe the viruses. The effects could be calamitous.”
“Our immune systems may have never been in contact with some of those microbes, and that is another worry,” said Prof Claverie. “The scenario of an unknown virus once infecting a Neanderthal coming back at us, although unlikely, has become a real possibility.”
Prof Koopmans added: “If you look at the history of epidemic outbreaks, one of the key drivers has been change in land use. Nipah virus was spread by fruit bats who were driven from their habitats by humans. Similarly, monkeypox has been linked to the spread of urbanisation in Africa.
“And that is what we are about to witness in the Arctic: a complete change in land use, and that could be dangerous, as we have seen elsewhere.”"

AfD was the first right-wing party since the Nazis to win a mayoral and district council election when it did last year. It has also made significant gains in state elections in Bavaria and Hesse.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the AfD and Identarian Movement in a statement on social media last week, comparing them to the Third Reich.

(AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)
RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Palestinian death toll from the war between Israel and Hamas has soared past 25,000, the Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip said Sunday, while the Israeli government appeared far from achieving its goals of crushing the militant group and freeing more than 100 hostages.
The level of death, destruction and displacement from the war already is without precedent in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Yet Israeli officials say the fighting is likely to continue for several more months.
The slow progress and the plight of the hostages held in Gaza has divided ordinary Israelis and their leaders even as the offensive threatens to ignite a wider war involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that support the Palestinians.
The United States, which has provided essential diplomatic and military support for the offensive, has had limited success in persuading Israel to adopt military tactics that put civilians at less risk and to facilitate the delivery of more humanitarian aid. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has rejected U.S. and international calls for postwar plans that would include a path to Palestinian statehood.
GAZA DEATH TOLL CLIMBS AMID BLISTERING OFFENSIVE
The war began with Hamas’ surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, during which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostages back to Gaza.
Israel responded with a blistering three-week air campaign and then a ground invasion into northern Gaza that laid waste to entire neighborhoods. Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation.
Israel continues to carry out airstrikes throughout the besieged territory, including areas in the south where it told civilians to seek refuge. Many Palestinians have ignored evacuation orders, saying nowhere feels safe.

Since the war started, a total of 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, while another 62,681 have been wounded, the Health Ministry reported Sunday. The death toll included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza’s hospitals since Saturday, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said. Another 300 people were wounded in the past day, he said.
The overall toll is thought to be even higher because many casualties remain buried under the rubble from Israeli strikes or in areas where medics cannot reach them, Al-Qidra said.
The Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures but says around two-thirds of the people killed in Gaza were women and minors.
The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but its casualty figures from previous wars were largely consistent with those of U.N. agencies and even the Israeli military.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense neighborhoods, often near homes, schools or mosques.
The military says 195 of its soldiers have been killed since the start of the Gaza offensive.
The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza’s residents from their homes, with hundreds of thousands packing into U.N.-run shelters and tent camps in the southern part of the tiny coastal enclave. U.N. officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as only a trickle of humanitarian aid reaches them because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions.
ISRAELIS INCREASINGLY DIVIDED
Netanyahu has vowed to keep up the offensive until Israel achieves “complete victory” over Hamas and returns all the remaining hostages. But even some top Israeli officials have begun to acknowledge that those goals might be mutually exclusive.
Hamas is believed to be holding the captives in tunnels deep underground and using them as shields for its top leaders. Israel has only managed to rescue one hostage since the war began, and Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations.
A member of Israel’s War Cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, said last week that the only way to free the remaining hostages was through a cease-fire. In an implicit criticism of Netanyahu, he said claims to the contrary amounted to “illusions.”
Hamas has said it will not free more hostages until Israel ends its offensive. The group also is expected to make any further releases conditional on securing freedom for thousands of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, including high-profile militants involved in attacks that killed Israelis.
Israel’s government has ruled that out for now, but it faces rising pressure from families of the hostages, who are pushing for another exchange, and from Israelis frustrated by the security failures that preceded the Oct. 7 attack and by Netanyahu’s handling of the war.
Thousands of people gathered in Tel Aviv over the weekend to call for new elections.
Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners are meanwhile pushing him to step up the offensive, with some calling for the “voluntary” emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from the territory in 2005, two years before Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces.

Mayor Shammas Malik has restructured his Cabinet, consolidating some functions, creating new ones and discontinuing others. As one example, Malik reclassified the police and fire chiefs into Cabinet-level positions reporting directly to the chief of staff, eliminating the deputy mayor for public safety job.
""This is a structure that's designed to be a more proactive city government,"" Malik said. Here's an introduction to some of the main players in his administration:
As chief of staff, Brittany Grimes Zaehringer will be responsible for innovative and effective planning, organizing, managing, directing and overseeing of the day-to-day operations of the mayor's office and director level staff while also providing strategic counsel to the mayor and other city leaders.
Zaehringer will also coordinate city responses to crisis and emergency matters.
Salary: $179,000.
In the newly created chief of strategy role, Nanette Pitt will lead implementation of strategic initiatives from Malik’s Together For Akron vision, including violence intervention, youth opportunity, universal preschool and more. Pitt will oversee a team of strategists and serve as a key liaison with intergovernmental offices and community stakeholders.
This new role will shoulder some of the responsibilities previously fielded by the deputy mayor of intergovernmental affairs, a position held by Marco Sommerville during Mayor Dan Horrigan's administration.
Salary: $179,000.
Chris Ludle remains as director of public service after filling that role during Horrigan's administration. He oversees the Engineering Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, the Sewer Bureau and the Water Bureau.

Moritz, Austin American-Statesman","January 21, 2024 at 9:04 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/walking-away-whistleblowers-suit-ken-120440843.html,"By saying he'll quit contesting allegations of corruption leveled against him by whistleblowers in a lawsuit, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sought to accomplish two things:
First, and perhaps most importantly, avoid — at least for now — having to publicly answer questions about the myriad accusations against him, which led to the Texas House impeaching him and ultimately the Texas Senate clearing him. And second, go back to calling his once-trusted top aides ""rogue employees,"" political pawns and whatever else he wants.
Paxton filed a motion Thursday saying he no longer wants to continue his court fight. He didn't admit wrongdoing; he just said he wasn't going to argue the point. But the next day, Travis County state District Judge Jan Soifer set a Feb. 1 date for the attorney general to sit for a deposition in the case.
If Paxton is allowed to walk away from the case with no further legal proceedings, he could deny his political adversaries the potential opportunity to see him admit to wrongdoing or to plead the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination. At the same time, he's free to go back on the offensive and further cement his standing with the Texas GOP's conservative base.
Paxton's statement and the accompanying filing with the 250th District Court in Austin about him wanting to walk away from the long-running litigation contain no shortage of bombast aimed at the whistleblowers who leveled the accusations of possible criminal misconduct against him, including that Paxton used his office to help a political benefactor, and, in turn, that benefactor helped Paxton's alleged mistress get a job.
Paxton accused the whistleblowers of escalating a ""crusade"" against him and of seeking to ""sabotage"" his leadership as the state's top lawyer. But then, Paxton said in his recent motion that he ""hereby elects not to contest any issue of fact in this case.""
It's fair to ask why the three-term Republican is eager to fire broadsides against his adversaries on paper, but he is avoiding having to sit for questions from their lawyers, as the Texas Supreme Court ruled that Paxton would have to do if the litigation continues.
Paxton's official response, ostensibly, is that his walking away ""precludes further unwarranted expense"" to taxpayers for continued litigation and to have more time to file lawsuits and take other actions against the Democratic Biden administration.
Another plausible explanation is that answering questions under oath is a huge risk for anyone, but especially for a politician. If the whistleblowers' allegations are true, Paxton would have to admit to them in a deposition or perhaps on the witness stand. Or he could invoke the Fifth and stay mum. Neither would be a good look.

Another option would be to follow the playbook of former President Donald Trump, a Paxton ally. In some of the sundry court actions taken against him, Trump admits to nothing and he counterattacks with bombast and gusto. As much as they might hate to admit it, the former president's adversaries understand that it has been a pretty darned effective strategy — at least for him.
Paxton has sought to emulate Trump in the past. Recall that after the Texas House voted to impeach him on charges that mirrored those of the whistleblowers, the attorney general went before reporters and TV cameras to offer a Trumpian defense, calling the Republican House members who brought the charges corrupt and politically motivated.
But once reporters tried to ask him questions, Paxton tucked his chin to his necktie and walked away without saying another word. During the Senate trial, Paxton's lawyers invoked Trump's catchall response to any allegations of wrongdoing made against him: ""Witch hunt.""
More: 'Worth every penny': AG Paxton impeachment cost more than $4 million
Paxton has the right to testify in his own defense, but he has chosen not to. In fact, he scarcely attended his impeachment trial — reportedly opting to get a massage at a high-end Austin spa and resort instead of sitting through the first full day of the hearing. And he left it to his lawyers to take reporters' questions after the Senate acquitted him on all impeachment charges.
If Soifer's Feb. 1 deposition order stands, questions will be asked of Paxton. And he'll be under oath. It's an open question whether he'll be playing offense or defense when, and if, that time comes.

34HNG36UBY_YPXFL7E4KJLUZXN,Fact Check: Here's the Truth Behind That Video of a Woman Allegedly Creating an Ice Sculpture During the Polar Vortex,Jack Izzo,"January 21, 2024 at 9:00 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/fact-check-heres-truth-behind-000000053.html,"Claim:
A video posted to TikTok and Instagram during the January 2024 polar vortex shows a woman in Canada making a helix out of ice by pouring it on the ground in a spiral pattern.
Rating:
Every few years, when the cold, arctic air of the polar vortex plunges south, internet users around the globe are treated to viral videos about the cold snap. Examples include frozen sculptures made of ramen and clothes as stiff as a board. You can even throw hot water into the air and watch it turn into a white cloud of steam and ice.
TikTok user QueenChelsea wanted to take it a step further in January 2024, posting a video to her TikTok and Instagram page showing her pouring water on the ground and creating a helix out of ice. The video quickly went viral, with over 13 million likes on TikTok (with 191 million views) and over 5 million likes on Instagram. The frozen sculpture looked real enough to fool many commenters, and Snopes received emails inquiring if the video was real.
Unfortunately, Canada being cold was the only real part of the video. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble (another great thing to play with in sub-zero temperatures), although it is certainly a testament to QueenChelsea's editing prowess that some people believed the ice sculpture was real.
QueenChelsea, whose real name is Chelsea Laufer, is a Canadian content creator who makes short viral videos using clever editing tricks and incredible visual effects. She included the VFX hashtag in the captions on both the TikTok and Instagram posts, and her bio on both platforms includes the sentence, ""I like making impossible things.""
Snopes reached out to Laufer for comment, and she replied via email.
""I’m a visual effects content creator so all of the videos I post are edited with a sort of magical realism in mind,"" she wrote. ""I'll also add that the response to this video has been absolutely astounding! I made this video as a way to practice working with 3D CGI, and I never expected so many people to see it.""
On Jan. 18, she posted a video to TikTok breaking down how she made the effect.

Jeffrey Chase Jones, 35, is charged with first-degree making terroristic threats, a Class C felony, with bond to be set by a judge, said Stephanie Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Tuscaloosa Police Department.
Taylor said Jones sent messages to the hospital system’s accounts threatening violence against hospital staff, along with images of weapons. Officers responded to the hospital at 2 p.m. and conducted a thorough search of the facility and determined there was no threat.
The officers coordinated with Northport police to ensure safety measures were in place at Northport DCH.
Investigators with TPD's Criminal Investigations Division identified Jones as the suspect. Members of the U.S. Marshals Task Force and TPD located Jones and took him into custody in Bessemer around 7 p.m., Taylor said.

An incident in Berlin involving a red Ferrari 488 Spyder and turquoise Lamborghini Huracan being loaded onto wreckers on the same day caused quite the stir on social media. Berlin police posted images of both supercars suspended mid-air by the wrecker’s crane before the Italian beauties were finally loaded. Plenty of Germans and others flooded the comments section to let everyone know their disdain for anyone who owned such machines.
Check out a grandma’s secret supercar stash here.
Ah, class warfare, one of the most universal things about human existence. In today’s society, few things bring it out quite like a supercar owner getting nabbed for breaking the law. While fans of such automotive beauties might watch in horror as careless tow truck drivers load up vehicles which are worth more than most houses, those who are envious of such trappings mock, jeer, and applaud.
According to police, these two drivers violated the law in Berlin twice over. A bicycle patrol noticed both were parked in restricted areas. They were also parked within give meters of an intersection, a big no-no since that obstructs others’ view of cross traffic.
Undoubtedly, police posted the photos to Twitter to act as a warning against any other scofflaws who might seek to violate parking laws in Berlin. They knew seeing two expensive supercars dangling in the air like a bovines being airlifted from one location to another would pique interest, although from the comments it seems people weren’t talking about the law.
For what it’s worth, the owners of the Ferrari and Lamborghini no doubt got their supercars back quickly and with relatively little financial discomfort. This is probably why the rabble on Twitter took to mocking the unnamed owners so viciously while they could. After all, they might work for these people, rent an apartment from them, or otherwise be beholden to the anonymous parking violators. The Twitter mocking might have been their only chance to feel like they had an upper hand in life so they took it and did so with glee.

Denis Pushilin described the strike on a busy market as ""horrendous"", and said the number of casualties could rise.
A Ukrainian army group operating in the region said it did not carry out the attack. Mr Pushilin blamed Ukraine.
BBC News was not able to immediately verify the circumstances around the strike.
Photographs published by Reuters news agency appeared to show destroyed shop fronts, as well as bodies lying in the street.
According to AFP, a local resident named Tatiana told local media she heard an incoming projectile overhead, and hid under her market stall.
""I saw smoke, people screamed, a woman was crying,"" she was quoted as saying.
In a statement posted on Facebook, the Tavria unit - part of the Ukrainian army - said its forces ""did not engage in combat operations in this case"".
It continued: ""Donetsk is Ukraine! Russia will have to be held accountable for the lives of Ukrainians taken.""
The Russian Foreign Ministry called it ""a barbaric terrorist act against the peaceful people of Russia"" by Ukrainian forces who, it said, had ""used weapons supplied by the West"".
Donetsk city and parts of the wider region in eastern Ukraine were first seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014, and the area has been partially controlled by Moscow ever since.
The city is around 20km (12 miles) from the frontline. Areas near Donetsk city - including Mariinka and Avdiivka - have seen some of the fiercest fighting of late.
It has been almost two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it has made little progress in recent months.
On Saturday it claimed to have captured the village of Krokhmalne in north-eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv region. A Ukrainian military spokesman confirmed its forces had withdrawn from the area, but said the territory was of little military importance.
Days earlier Moscow also claimed to have taken control of a settlement named Vesele in Donetsk. Kyiv has not confirmed the claim."

Details: Zelenskyy noted that on Sunday alone, ""Russian savages shelled more than a hundred cities, towns, and our Ukrainian villages in nine regions."" The most brutal Russian attacks on 21 January occurred in Donetsk Oblast.
""Russia will be held accountable for all this terror – it must be. If it hadn't been for Moscow's decisions to start this aggression and this terror, thousands and thousands of people would be alive today.

Russia must feel and remember forever that the aggressor loses the most from aggression"", the President stressed.

“2024 is going to be a very exciting year. I’m either going to jail, be president, or frankly, The Purge,” Johnson as Trump said, an apparent reference to the movie franchise where all crime is legal for a half-day out of the year.

In reality, Trump is expected to be in the courtroom Monday, the day before the Granite State primary, as he has been attending the second civil trial brought by E. Jean Carroll. A jury last year already found Trump liable of sexual assault of Carroll, and the latest trial is largely to determine damages.
The proceedings are just a prelude to a year in which Trump faces spending much of the presidential campaign in courthouses, with several criminal trials still scheduled even as his attorneys seek to delay them. So far, Trump has capitalized on the lack of camera access to court proceedings by giving lengthy statements to the media just outside the chambers, essentially running a big chunk of his campaign for the nomination in the halls of justice.
“This is the campaign, folks,” Johnson’s Trump said. “This is all there is — me yelling in courthouse lobby, standing behind a barricade like a Guatemalan family at JFK passenger pickup.”
In the skit, Trump also relished his Iowa caucus blowout, ribbing one of his rivals, Ron DeSantis, for his distant second-place showing. “He went to 99 counties but bitch couldn’t win one,” he said, while nicknaming the Florida governor “Ron DeStupid.” In reality, DeSantis canceled some network morning show appearances scheduled for Sunday, raising speculation that he may drop out, but his campaign says it was a scheduling issue before he returns to New Hampshire.
Johnson’s Trump then went to former rival Vivek Ramaswamy (“Dropped out of the race and has agreed to live in my suit pocket”) and current one Nikki Haley (“She thought I was done — but I am back in a big way. I’m back like Mean Girls.”)
The skit did make a bit of a reference to Haley’s line of attack on Trump today — that there are questions of whether he is mentally fit for office. At a rally on Friday evening, Trump mentioned Haley multiple times when he actually was referring to Nancy Pelosi.
“I am doing very well, cognitively doing great with cognitive,” Trump said in the skit. “I think I’m doing great. With cognitive, I’m more cognitive than ever.”
Johnson’s imitation often is spot on, especially when he drifts into Trump’s streams of consciousness and non-sequiturs, particularly those about random young celebrities. (“Mean Girls. Where’s Lacey Chabert? Left out of remake. So sad.”)
Later in the skit, he referred to the taped footage of him dancing with Jeffrey Epstein. “Boy is that some dark energy,” he said.
But then he claimed that he “wouldn’t be surprised if that footage is fake. Of course, it’s very real, but you have to think, in many ways, it could not be.”
“We’ve seen a lot of success saying things that did not happen,” Johnson’s Trump said. “I think we’ll continue to do that. It’s an innovation I am particularly proud of. Seems to be working very well. But I love this country and it’s traditions. That’s why I’m not doing any debates and barely doing elections.”

3DYBO5AZRX_UV33OG6TR8BWD1F,It's 3 weeks into January and your New Year's resolutions might be starting to slip. Here are 6 tips from an entrepreneur to make lasting goals in 2024.,Sawdah Bhaimiya,"January 21, 2024 at 7:22 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/3-weeks-january-years-resolutions-102201080.html,"Keeping New Year's resolutions for a full 12 months can prove difficult.
Entrepreneur Mimi Ikonn shared six valuable insights about making goals with Business Insider.
Some unusual tips include making mood boards, sharing goals on social media, and having an accountability buddy.
Making New Year's resolutions is an age-old tradition that sees people around the world sit down and reflect on their big goals for the coming year — only to abandon them a few weeks later.
A recent Forbes Health survey of 1,000 adults in the US found that the average New Year's Resolution lasts just 3.74 months with only 6% of respondents sticking to their goals until December.
Meanwhile, the series of dates celebrating the failure of New Year's resolutions such as ""Quitter's Day"" on the second Friday of January and ""Ditch New Year's Resolutions Day"" on January 17 suggests there's a gap between making goals and actually turning them into lifelong changes.
Mimi Ikonn, the cofounder of wellness brand Intelligent Change and a social media influencer, told Business Insider that making lasting changes requires a holistic approach.
""We have to keep in mind that unless we make these fundamental subconscious changes, nothing is going to change in our life because we are guided every day to make decisions based on our subconscious mind,"" Ikonn said in an interview.
""It literally makes more than 95% of all the decisions we make. So unless we change certain habits day to day and rewire the way the brain works, nothing is going to change in our lives because we go back to our old habits.""
Ikonn offered six valuable insights about keeping New Year's resolutions.
Ikonn said that Intelligent Change launched tools that were based on the founders' personal lives to help users develop goals based on all of the different facets of their identity.
Ikonn said you have to look at ""your whole life as a system.""
""So you are not just somebody who works, you're somebody who has relationships, you're somebody who has a relationship to self, and has spiritual practises.""
She suggests viewing goals like slices of a pie or even an umbrella and slotting them into each section like it's a different facet of your life.
But she warned against making too many goals and instead to narrow it down to three to five ultimate goals for the year.
""I think the reason people fail is because we can be a little bit over ambitious about our capabilities and we set out too many goals and then we quickly disappoint ourselves and the moment we disappoint ourselves, we feel deflated and then we just stop trying,"" Ikonn explained.
The most important thing to consider when setting a goal is the ""why"" factor which can help you determine the motivation behind achieving the goal.
""If you have a strong 'why,' you will find a way to get there, and if you don't, most likely you won't,"" Ikonn said.
An exercise that can help you determine your ""why"" could be creating a list of values before you write down your goals for the year.
""Once you create the values, when you create the goals, it's so much easier to see if your goals are aligned with your values and then that allows you to create a bigger vision of your life.""
The saying ""moving in silence"" is a popular sentiment meaning working on your goals in private is more rewarding because you're cutting out external judgment.
However, according to Ikonn, this isn't necessarily true, and can be a mistake. In fact, sharing your goals with others is actually a worthwhile pursuit because it will encourage you to not give up.
""I think one thing that people miss out on is having accountability partners,"" she said. ""The more people you tell about your goals and dreams, the more chances you're going to actually do it.""
An accountability buddy can be a friend or family member who you can check in with every week.
""Accountability is huge when it comes to forming any new habits,"" Ikonn said. ""Sometimes we need a little bit of support from our community and it can make a world of a difference.""
Similar to having an accountability buddy, sharing your resolutions on social media can actually put gentle pressure on you to achieve them.
Ikonn said that one of her goals in 2024 was to do more public speaking and she decided to share this on social media. People started inviting her to more events and giving her the opportunities to do so as a result.
""So it is fascinating what happens once you put it out there into the world, whether you do it on your social media, whether you do it in person with your friends in your community, where people will hear what you're doing, and they will connect you with the right person. They will tell you about a workout program or maybe a new job opportunity.""
The hashtag #newyearmoodboard has almost a million views on TikTok with users putting together aesthetic collages of images and quotes that often represent their dream life.
Although it may just look like a fun activity, Ikonn says there's a deeper reason behind why it can work.
""There's a part of our brain called the reticular activating system, which helps us filter through all the information that we are faced with every single day because we're overwhelmed by all this information.
""So when you focus on something specific, it allows your brain to filter for opportunities and people and ways to get to those opportunities.""
However, it's not just about creating the vision board, you actually have to do the work and take actions to bring the dreams to life but it's ""extremely helpful to visualize where you're going.""
You've created your list of goals, found yourself an accountability buddy, and ensured that it aligns with your values and long-term vision for your life. Now, how do you make sure it actually sticks?
Ikonn says your goals have to be ""very clear and actionable and something you can measure."" You should also avoid being vague.
""For example, instead of saying, 'Oh I want to be healthier' you can say, 'I want to start running three times a week' or 'I'm going to take three yoga classes a week' or 'I'm going to do this workout program on an app and I'm going to commit to it five times a week.'""
The next step is breaking those goals down into actionable steps to schedule into our months and weeks because ""things we don't schedule will never get done.""
Ikonn emphasized that it's not always possible to do something everyday.
""In real life, there will be times when we feel unwell, when our family needs us, when work needs us more than usual, and we'll be unable to actually keep the habit going. But the truth is we can always pick up where we left off and restart the habit at any point in time.""

Emergency crews in Indiana were called around 7 a.m. Jan. 18 in Trafalgar, the Daily Journal reported.
The woman was found two blocks away in a driveway by a man and his wife, according to WTHR.
“It was just immediate action. It was, like, ‘we have to figure out what’s going on here’,” Damien Lutz told the news outlet.
Officials are awaiting a toxicology report but say foul play is not suspected and the cold temperature was a contributing factor, WXIN reported.
Officials don’t know why the woman left her home, or how long she was outside but say when they found her she was barefoot in a nightgown, WTHR reported.
It was 24 degrees that morning, Weather Underground reports.
Laura Forbes, the communication director for the Greater Indiana Chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association told WXIN that wandering is a sign of dementia.
“And if it happens at this time of year in frigid temperatures, that can certainly be very dangerous,” she said.
The Alzheimer’s Society lists tips to help prevent a loved one from wandering out in the cold. Sticking to a regular routine and staying active are recommended.
“Just really meeting them where they are is so important,” Forbes told WXIN. “Having as much structure as possible, people with dementia respond really well to routines.”
The Alzheimer’s Association also lists ways to reduce risks of wandering and ways to prepare your home.

The evaluations follow a missile barrage launched by Iran-back militias on the Al-Asad airbase.
Regional tensions have been escalating, with this militia's actions mirroring the Houthis' aggression.
US personnel in Iraq are undergoing traumatic brain injury evaluations after Iranian-backed militias launched a barrage of ballistic missiles and rockets at the Al-Asad airbase in western Iraq on Saturday, according to a statement from the US Central Command (CENTCOM).
The press release stated that multiple ballistic missiles and rockets were launched at about 6:30 p.m. Baghdad time on January 20.
""Most of the missiles were intercepted by the base's air defense systems while others impacted on the base,"" per CENTCOM.
CENTCOM said that damage assessments are ongoing, and several US personnel are undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries.
At least one Iraqi service member was reportedly wounded.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an Iran-backed militia group, claimed responsibility for firing the missiles that were launched from inside the country.
The attack is believed to be the largest among more than 140 incidents since mid-October, signifies a pattern of Iranian-backed militia groups targeting US forces in Iraq and Syria, ABC News reports.
The attacks are seen by some as acts of solidarity with Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, mirroring similar actions by Houthi militants in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden against commercial shipping.
Unlike previous attacks primarily using Iranian-made drones and rockets, Saturday's assault involved more powerful ballistic missiles and repesents an escalatory move, per ABC News.
Iran also backs the Houthis and have triggered retaliatory strikes from the US.
The Pentagon has labeled its strikes on Houthi missiles as ""defensive"" measures.
The Houthis rebels' attacks on Red Sea shipping sought to support a ceasefire in Gaza.
The heightened tensions between Iran-backed militias and the US in Iraq follow a US military drone strike in Baghdad on January 4, which targeted a senior leader of one such militia, the Guardian reports.
There are 2,500 US troops still stationed in Iraq, part of the ongoing mission to counter the Islamic State terror group.
Another 900 US troops are deployed to Syria to prevent a resurgence by the Islamic State, the Pentagon reports.

Those listed include Prime Minister Amadou Ba, chosen by President Macky Sall as his successor after Sall announced in July that he would not seek a third term.
Also named were former prime ministers and rivals Idrissa Seck and Mahammed Boun Abdallah Dionne, the ex-mayor of Dakar Khalifa Sall and Bassirou Diomaye Diakhar Faye, presented as a substitute candidate for Sonko.
Faye, 43, a member of Sonko's dissolved party, is also detained but has not yet been tried.
Sonkyo, who came third in the 2019 presidential election, has been at the centre of a bitter stand-off with the state that has lasted more than two years and sparked often deadly unrest.
The 49-year-old opposition figure has generated a passionate following among Senegal's disaffected youth, striking a chord with his pan-Africanist rhetoric and tough stance on former colonial power France.
Sonko was sentenced in June to two years' imprisonment for morally corrupting a young person.
He has been jailed since the end of July on other charges, including calling for insurrection, conspiracy with terrorist groups, and endangering state security.
He has denied the charges, saying they are intended to prevent him from running in February's election.
The published list of candidates also includes two women, gynaecologist Rose Wardini and entrepreneur Anta Babacar Ngom.
Karim Wade, who served as a minister when his father was in power, was excluded as his candidacy was deemed ""inadmissible"" because of his dual French and Senegalese nationality, according to the Constitutional Council.
According to the constitution, presidential candidates ""must be exclusively of Senegalese nationality"" and aged between 35 and 75 on election day.
With just a month to go, there is total uncertainly as the outcome of the two-round election, Senegal's first without the participation of the outgoing president.
Sall, elected as president in 2012 for seven years and re-elected in 2019, declared in July that he would not stand again.

3N9UF0RBQV_2S1M8ZKOH92GNMN,UN urges Ethiopia and Somalia to talk to solve dispute,Mustafa HAJI ABDINUR,21 January 2024 at 9:00 pm·2-min read,20240121,yahoo.com,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/un-urges-ethiopia-somalia-talk-120046941.html,"United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Sunday urged Addis Ababa and Mogadishu to open dialogue to settle their dispute over Ethiopia's maritime deal with the breakaway region of Somaliland.
Tensions in the Horn of Africa have escalated since landlocked Ethiopia struck a deal with Somaliland on January 1 that gives it much sought-after access to the sea.
In return, Somaliland -- which unilaterally declared independence in 1991 -- has said Ethiopia would give it formal recognition. Addis Ababa has not confirmed this.
Somalia on Thursday ruled out mediation with Ethiopia unless the deal is cancelled, and vowed to fight by ""all legal means"" to oppose it.
""We are always guided by our principles and our principles are related to the unity, the sovereignty and territorial independence of countries, including Somalia,"" Guterres told a press conference at the G77 plus China summit in the Ugandan capital.
""We hope that through dialogue it will be possible to overcome the current situation,"" he said.
His comments added to calls led by the United States, China, the European Union, African Union and Arab League to respect Somali sovereignty.
Ethiopia and neighbouring Somalia have a history of stormy relations and territorial feuds, fighting two wars in the late 20th century.
Mogadishu has branded the maritime pact an act of ""aggression"" by Ethiopia, which has in turn insisted no laws have been transgressed.
Under the deal, Somaliland agreed to lease 20 kilometres (12 miles) of its coast for 50 years to Ethiopia, which wants to set up a naval base and a commercial port.
Somalia vehemently opposes the independence claim by the former British protectorate of 4.5 million people that is not recognised by the international community.
Ethiopia -- the second most populous country in Africa -- was cut off from the coast after Eritrea seceded and declared independence in 1993 following a three-decade war.
Addis Ababa had  access to a port in Eritrea until the two countries went to war in 1998-2000. Since then Ethiopia has sent most of its sea trade through Djibouti.
While Somaliland is largely stable, Somalia has witnessed decades of civil war and a bloody Islamist insurgency.

3P9CQT6EQY_6ERH37GOAEA1MHK,Half of America’s Cities Are Depopulating. We Could Be Headed for a Ghost Town Era.,Tim Newcomb,"January 22, 2024 at 12:00 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/half-america-cities-depopulating-could-150000111.html,"""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.""
By studying population trends and forecasting models, a group of researchers have come to believe that nearly 15,000 U.S. cities will face noticeable depopulation by 2100.
Populated areas of the cities in question could experience a decline of up to 44 percent.
Projections call for the biggest drops in city populations to occur in the Northeast and Midwest.
No city in the Northeast or Midwest is safe from a trend toward depopulation. And just because states such as Texas and Utah experience growth now, doesn’t mean it will last. At least, not according to new research. Major depopulation is coming for the United States, and it’s coming fast.
A new study published in Nature Cities forecasts the behavior of U.S. populations by investigating a variety of trends, data, and models. The results paint a rough picture of the future for cities across the country.
“We found that, by 2100, close to half of the nearly 30,000 cities in the United States will face some sort of population decline, representing 12-23 percent of the population of these 30,000 cities and 27-44 percent of the populated area,” the authors wrote. “The implications of this massive decline in population will bring unprecedented challenges.”
The project started as an analysis commissioned by the Illinois Department of Transportation to analyze coming transportation challenges within the state due to population changes, but the data led the study’s authors to expand the research across the country. Looking at more than just the nation’s largest cities creates a robust picture of the scale of change ushered in by depopulation.
By extracting data from both the U.S. Census for the past 20 years and the annual American Community Survey, and pairing it with a mixture of climate forecasts known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, the researchers from the University of Illinois Chicago show that 2100 could look plenty different for U.S. cities.
The depopulation won’t be everywhere, however. And it may be tricky to predict. The study estimates that the largest losses will come from the Northeast and Midwest as people move to the South and West. That doesn’t mean there won’t be some growth, though, in the areas anticipating depopulation, or that every city in the growth zones will prosper.
Cities such as Cleveland, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh—and even currently growing cities like Louisville, Syracuse, and New Haven—may all experience population collapse. Vermont and West Virginia are most at risk, with the potential for 80 percent of cities in those states to shrink. Illinois, Mississippi, Kansas, New Hampshire, and Michigan aren’t far behind, with up to 75 percent of cities in jeopardy of dropping population.
The losses may not always be inter-state. The paper’s authors believe that California, for example, will see population loss along the southern coast as people flock to the northern coast. They also expect that the population growth currently being enjoyed by Texas and Utah will reverse.
“The projections suggest that, by 2100, all states will have cities facing some type of depopulation, expect the District of Columbia and Hawaii,” the authors wrote.
When nearly a quarter of an entire city vacates, leaving behind swaths of unused area, it can disrupt basic services—everything from the power grid to water pressure to transit services. “Resource distribution challenges will persist unless a paradigm shift happens away from growth-based planning alone,” the authors wrote.
And pairing depopulation with aging infrastructure creates an entirely new set of social, economic, and policy challenges. “Having an estimation of future population trends can assist authorities in better planning and designing cities and their infrastructure systems for depopulation,” the authors wrote.
This isn’t just about the major metropolitan areas, which have been the sole focus of past studies. Instead, this survey looked at population centers irrespective of their size. And the news for smaller cities isn’t pretty. In fact, depopulation may pose even more challenges in these areas, which have more limited financial, human, and natural resource wells from which to draw.
Typically, depopulation occurs as working-age residents move elsewhere to take new jobs, leaving the cities they vacated with an older population. That can exacerbate economic and city service challenges.
Depopulation could also have other ramifications, such as the closing of stores in certain areas that can lead to food deserts. Transportation systems may have to adapt to help vulnerable residents reach needed services. “It is imperative to consider how depopulation will impact all infrastructure systems,” the authors wrote. “Moreover, with infrastructure deserts already existing, the challenges to mee the basic needs of residents will be amplified.”
The study authors hope decision makers adapt now. “What is certain is that an important cultural shift in planning and engineering communities is needed,” they wroye, “away from conventional growth-based planning to accommodate a dramatic demographic shift.”

The seizure of the village has no strategic value, he said.
About 45 people lived in Krokhmalne before the full-scale invasion. During the fighting, Russia destroyed the residential buildings in the village.

Ground Forces also noted that Russian propaganda loudly celebrates the capture of every meter, in order to demonstrate their ""victories"" and justify huge losses at the front. Since the beginning of January alone, Russia has lost more than 7,000 troops in the Khortytsia area alone, said Fitio.
The village of Krokhmalne in the Kupyansk district of Kharkiv Oblast was occupied by Russians at the beginning of the invasion in 2022. During the Kharkiv offensive, the Defense Forces recaptured the village.
The U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War published a new report on Jan. 21 stating that Russian forces had indeed advanced along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line and captured Krokhmalne.
Geolocation footage also indicates that Russian troops have slightly advanced east of Ivanivka and east of Zolotarivka. Russian troops have also advanced southwest of Bakhmut and on the southern outskirts of Avdiivka, ISW wrote.

In high school, Alice Wade spent a year planning how they would come out as transgender. And to be safe, they planned what to do if it went poorly.
“When I was 15, I made plans for what I would do, and which friend’s house I would go to, and how I would work to make enough money to live on my own if I had to become homeless,” Wade told New Hampshire lawmakers earlier this month.
Wade wanted to do it on their own terms. The process was gradual: first, Wade told their close friends, then a teacher, then their mom. Finally, they felt they could tell their dad. That was crucial, Wade said.

“While it wasn’t perfect, if my parents had found out before I was ready to tell them, I don’t know if I’d be alive here to give you my testimony,” Wade testified.
The experience of coming out in high school – and the choice of when to inform parents  – is once again at the center of a legislative fight. State Senate Republicans are pushing for a bill this year that would require schools to disclose information to parents who ask for it, echoing efforts in the past two years that have fallen short. LGBTQ rights groups have said the bill could out a student’s sexual orientation or gender identity to their parents before they are ready to tell them.
Senate Bill 341 would require any school staff member to answer any written requests sent by parents for information about their children within 10 days of receiving the request.
School employees who feel that responding to such a request “would put that student at risk of endangerment of physical harm, abuse, or neglect” must file a report to the Division for Children, Youth, and Families within 48 hours, the bill states.
The bill adds that any violation of the requirement to provide the information must be referred to the school board to determine disciplinary action, which can include termination. Under the bill, if a parent isn’t satisfied with the school board’s chosen disciplinary action, they can appeal the decision to the state board of education, which could make its own final call to terminate the staff person.
Sen. Tim Lang, the Sanbornton Republican sponsoring the bill, likened it to the state’s right-to-know law, RSA 91-A. That law requires public officials to produce documents and information when requested by a member of the public, with exceptions for confidentiality.
“This bill extends that to the school setting,” Lang said during a press conference held by Senate Republicans this month.
“The school is obligated to respond in an honest and complete answer, and not hide any information from the parent,” he said.
During a Jan. 3 hearing, some members of the public agreed. Bridgewater’s Aubrey Freedman, who is gay, doesn’t support pronoun changes in school.
“It’s all about honesty,” said Freedman. “Nobody’s outing anybody, (but) if the parents want to ask the school personnel a question, they should be honest. I don’t think that’s a big deal.”
But advocates and young trans people countered that they believed the bill would result in children being outed, and would complicate the trust that teachers are trying to build with students.
Megan Tuttle, president of the National Education Association of New Hampshire, a teachers union, argued that parents and educators already work well together, and that the bill would “fracture” that relationship.
Tuttle said the bill’s disclosure requirements would override the chain of command within schools, and could interfere with collective bargaining agreements. And she cited a recent report by a legislative committee studying the teacher shortage that found that a climate of culture and fear has helped drive educators from the profession.
“We believe Senate Bill 341 would only be an extension of the sort of legislation that the committee found was driving current and prospective educators away from the profession,” she said.
Barrett Christina, executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association, took issue with the appeals process to the state Board of Education, whose members are appointed by the governor and Executive Council, calling them “unelected bureaucrats.”
Sara Smith, a retired teacher, also opposed the bill. “I fundamentally believe in honesty, and if anybody asked me to lie I wouldn’t,” she said.
But Smith said as a teacher, her fundamental purpose “was to teach children to think for themselves.” Part of that effort involved building a “scaffolding” and a foundation of trust among students that the teacher would be there for them.
Teachers often have an open door for students to discuss personal issues, Smith said, which can help in the discovery of abuse and neglect issues. “But once this law is enacted, students can no longer expect their teachers to keep confidential issues they have shared with them,” Smith said.
The bill comes on the heels of two major attempts in 2022 and 2023 to pass similar legislation. Each time, the effort was thwarted in the House, which was narrowly dominated by Republicans in the 2021-2022 session and is now nearly evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats.
Opponents to the bills have raised concerns that requiring a school to divulge information to parents about a student’s sexual orientation or gender expression at school could lead to dangerous situations of abuse or neglect if the parents disapprove. Lang said the bill was intended to give an option for school officials to not inform parents and instead file a DCYF report if abuse is likely.
But Chris Erchull, staff attorney at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), said the bill as currently written does not allow school staff the option to stop informing parents, even if they file the DCYF report.
In an interview last week, Lang said he listened to some of the concerns and will be making tweaks to the bill in an upcoming amendment.
Lang plans to add language to make clear that if teachers suspect abuse or harm could result, they do not need to disclose the information to parents, as long as they file a report with DCYF.
And Lang said he would narrow the bill to apply to certified school staff, such as teachers and administrators, and not other staff members like bus drivers or custodians.
“I heard what people said,” he said. “I’m adjusting accordingly – the things I think are reasonable requests.”
Linds Jakows, an advocate who experienced their own retaliation from their father after being involuntarily outed in high school, said the bill would disrupt a delicate process.
“Many LGBTQ young people feel a strong need to come out to peers first, regardless of whether or not their parents are affirming,” Jakows said. “… This bill doesn’t explicitly name situations related to trans or LGBTQ youth like last year’s bill, but we know the forced outing will be the same.”
The bill is likely to spur months of acrimonious testimony and contentious floor votes. To Lang, the bill is simply about strengthening communication.
“I think we’ve lost sight of the fact that when we talk about trusting adults in the school system, the trust is between the parent and the teacher and the parent and the school system,” Lang said “… And so this bill seeks to make sure that that trust is not eroded.”

(KOIN) — Portland City Council adopted an emergency ordinance on Wednesday to launch a two-year food truck pilot program in the Central City Plan District.
The ordinance waives right-of-way city code that prohibits food trucks from operating within the district, and builds off of the Portland Bureau of Transportation’s Healthy Business Program, which allowed downtown property owners to request food truck services for their employees and tenants during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The pilot aims to revitalize downtown by offering more dining options for downtown workers and residents while expanding food truck operator’s reach to more customers. The program is only for mobile food trucks, not fixed food carts, officials said.

Commissioner Mingus Mapps introduced the ordinance, explaining, “We get to start with some good news: More and more workers are returning to downtown Portland.”
“And we have some tough news: Unfortunately, downtown Portland’s food scene has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, so returning workers at some locations have limited dining options … the pilot project before us today aims to fill that gap,” Mapps continued.
“The pilot project will contribute to the vitality of some commercial areas, increase the walkability of the Central City Plan District and decrease the need for auto-oriented transportation,” Mapps added.

David McEldowney, PBOT’s Right of Way Management and Permitting Division Manager, explained that Portland city code 14A.50.040 prohibits the sale of merchandise and services in the public right of way – including within 250 feet of library grounds, public park grounds, or any open business selling similar items. The pilot program will waive the code through the end of 2025.
If the pilot is successful, McEldowney anticipates asking city council for a permanent program with code and rule changes in the fall of 2025.
“I did want to make it clear that the waiving of this portion of Title 14 would not result in a chaotic wild, wild west situation in which any random person would be able to vend food from any parking space downtown,” McEldowney explained. “Instead, vending would only be approved at sites that were vetted through PBOT through a set of criteria – one of which would be that the adjacent property owner must invite this activity to occur.”

City-owned locations, like parks, can also invite food trucks to serve those locations.
Under the pilot, Suburban Events will act as a coordinating permittee and will work with PBOT to evaluate the viability of potential food truck locations.
Restaurant owners and food truck operators who want to join the program can contact PBOT’s Portland in the Streets team.
Officials noted program fees include a $450 application fee, and a $400 parking fee; however, some fees may be eligible to be waived under American Rescue Plan Act funding.

It's likely taking advantage of the ""freezing ground conditions"" to move armored vehicles.
Data from the Ukrainian General Staff suggests these attacks result in huge losses.
Russia is ramping up its front-line offensives against Ukraine, likely taking advantage of the ""freezing ground conditions"" to move armored vehicles around the country, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in an update on the conflict on Sunday.
In the military intelligence update, the MoD said that data from the Ukrainian General Staff pointed ""toward a steady increase in the intensity of Russian offensive activity across the front over the last two weeks.""
But Russia's mounting attacks are leading to huge losses to its military vehicles and personnel, the MoD said, citing data from the Ukrainian General Staff.
From January 14 to January 18, it said the data suggested that Russian military vehicle losses had climbed 88%, while tank losses had soared 95%. The number of Russian casualties over the period had also increased by 15%, it added.
For example, Russian forces are repeatedly carrying out large-scale infantry ""meat assaults"" on the city of Avdiivka, a Ukrainian commander said, CNN reported.
""Assault after assault, non-stop. If we kill 40 to 70 of them with drones in a day, the next day they renew their forces and continue to attack,"" ""Teren,"" an artillery reconnaissance commander of Ukraine's 110th Mechanized Brigade, told CNN.
Russia has become increasingly reliant on high-risk frontal assaults, or ""human-wave attacks,"" which attempt to overwhelm Ukrainian positions.
Russian forces may be attempting to make the most of the hard, frozen grounds left by Ukraine's harsh winter before the spring thaw and mud season, which caught Russia out at the outbreak of the war in February 2022, set in again.
The rapid melting of snow and ice in parts of eastern Europe in spring gives way to thick mud that makes travel extremely difficult. Russians call the period ""Rasputitsa,"" translated as ""when roads stop existing,"" The Guardian reported.
The mud season causes problems for Russia and Ukraine, with artillery and military vehicles trapped in the sodden, heavy clay soil.
Butm experts previously told Business Insider that Ukraine's US-provided Abrams tanks could be key during the mud season fighting.
""The Abrams was made for this environment,"" Robert Greenway, a former adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank, said.
""The mud could become impassable for almost any vehicle,"" Greenway said, ""but the reality is that the Abrams is best equipped to deal with that environment, far better than any other tracked vehicle in existence.""

Speaking to Radio Wales Breakfast, NRW's Dylan Williams said: ""What we would urge people to do is keep vigilant and look at our website for updates. ""A lot of this happened through the night, so today we will be assessing the damage.""
Fire services were called to multiple incidents overnight, with isolated flooding in Ystrad Mynach and Blackwood in Caerphilly.
There were also reports of people caught in floodwater at Capel Curig and Betws y Coed in Gwynedd.
The coastguard asked people to take care by the coast.
""Keep away from cliffs, watch out for tidal surges, and steer clear of big waves,"" it said.
There has been widespread travel disruption, with numerous road closures and flight cancellations.
BBC presenter Jennifer Jones described a ""hair-raising"" experience when a plane she was travelling on from Geneva attempted to land at Bristol Airport on Sunday evening.
""It was incredibly turbulent and the plane was lurching from side to side and it was pretty harrowing, I have to say,"" she told Radio Wales Breakfast.
Ms Jones described how she ""burst into tears"" when the plane eventually landed in Edinburgh after the Bristol landing was aborted.
""When we landed, everyone on board just burst into applause and my friends and I just burst into tears. It sounds dramatic but I was thinking of my husband and my children. It was pretty hair-raising.""
The Met office said the disruption would continue throughout Monday morning.
""Some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs, could happen,"" the forecaster said.
""Injuries and danger to life from flying debris are possible.
""Power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage.
""Injuries and danger to life could occur from large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties.""

That’s the translation of what Google says is an Indonesian phrase — “Mersa Dustoe” — found sprawled across the top of the entrance of the Henry E. Kinney Tunnel on Sunday morning.

While no one would dispute that the tunnel is a bit dusty after more than two years undergoing a $28.4 million upgrade, the artwork came as a surprise to commuters using the tunnel after its most recent construction-related closure.
The letters, in teal and black, were expertly spaced across the tunnel’s four lanes.
The graffitist obviously spent some time on the project — whenever he or she did it.
“I guess someone thought (the tunnel) needed prettying up,” Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis said.
The tunnel, part of U.S. 1, runs under the New River and is a key gateway to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
Trantalis said the city is working with the Florida Department of Transportation, the agency responsible for maintaining the tunnel, to remove the graffiti. That should happen within the next day or two, Trantalis said.
Meanwhile, the city is investigating whether security footage in the area exists that could help identify the person, he said.
Asked whether the graffiti would affect the city’s image to motorists using the tunnel to get to the airport, Trantalis said the site already looked “obnoxious.”
“I guess it gives some artistic respite to what we’ve been dealing with the past two years,” he said.

(KOIN) — After receiving approval from city leaders, Portland Fire & Rescue will officially launch its overdose response team next month.
At a city council meeting on Wednesday morning, Mayor Ted Wheeler and four city commissioners unanimously voted in favor of health insurance agency CareOregon’s $389,577 grant for the pilot program.
New COVID-19 variant JN.1 becomes most common strain in Oregon
Whereas Portland Street Response focuses on residents experiencing mental and behavioral health crises, PF&R’s new “Mobile Medication for Opioid Use Disorder” pilot is more focused on preventing overdose deaths.
Through the program, the city’s Community Health Assess and Treat team will administer medication to people on the site of an emergency, instead of after they’ve been hospitalized. CHAT will provide Narcan, the overdose reversal medication also known as naloxone, and buprenorphine, a medication that treats opioid use disorder.
According to PF&R, the team will also direct patients to addiction treatment resources in the area, such as “drug counseling” and “after-care services.”

“Portland’s surge in opioid overdoses has devastated our first responders and unsheltered residents,” Commissioner Rene Gonzalez said in a statement. “After visiting all 31 Portland fire stations in 2023, the urgent need for an alternative solution to how our city handles overdose calls, particularly in Old Town/Chinatown, became clear.”
The program is a joint effort between the fire agency, Multnomah County Health Department’s Emergency Medical Services division, the Oregon Poison Center and CareOregon.
The program will begin on on Feb. 5. Afterward, it will operate every Monday through Thursday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.

The contract ends on June 30, 2025. Officials will determine the success of the program by monitoring how many residents CHAT serves, the number of medications administered, the number of patients directed to local treatment facilities and more.
“Portland will be among the first U.S. cities using both medications during active overdose crises to save lives, and then block the most severe withdrawal symptoms,” Gonzalez.

Ron DeSantis canceled his scheduled Sunday appearances on NBC and CNN.
Hours later, he dropped out of the race and endorsed former President Donald Trump.
The Florida governor had fallen behind both Nikki Haley and Trump.
GOP presidential candidate Gov. Ron DeSantis canceled planned appearances on cable news channels Sunday morning, hours before officially ending his campaign and endorsing former President Donald Trump
The Florida governor was scheduled to appear on both CNN and NBC ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday but canceled both, citing a ""last-minute schedule change,"" according to NBC's Kristen Welker.
""Gov. Ron DeSantis has pulled out of his #MTP appearance tomorrow morning due to what a person familiar says is a last-minute schedule change. Per his campaign, he will now hold an event in New Hampshire tomorrow evening. He is currently campaigning in South Carolina,"" Welker posted on X on Saturday evening.
But later Sunday, DeSantis announced he was suspending his campaign and endorsing Trump.
""I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory,"" DeSantis said in a message to supporters. ""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance.""
DeSantis also used a fake Churchhill quote in his speech.
CNN reports that Trump's campaign has been prepping for the announcement since Saturday.
The New Hampshire primaries will take place on Tuesday. The Republican primary in South Carolina will occur in late February. CNN previously reported the latter would likely be the ""last stand"" for the DeSantis campaign.
""I'm asking for your support as we get into this primary next month,"" DeSantis told voters in a restaurant in Florence, South Carolina on Saturday, according to CNN. ""I'll be a candidate that will be able to bring our party together up and down the ballot, just like I did in Florida.""
Once considered a leading Republican presidential contender, DeSantis had fallen slightly behind candidate Nikki Haley and well behind the GOP frontrunner, former President Donald Trump, despite his multiple indictments. The Florida governor's performance at the Iowa caucus was disappointing and has fueled speculation that his days on the campaign trail are numbered.
""What we did in Iowa, we did make an impression,"" DeSantis said after the Iowa caucus. ""I had people come up to me saying, 'I love you, man. I'm gonna do Trump this time and do you next time.'""

Clayton McGeeney, 36, Ricky Johnson, 38, and David Harrington, 37, were found dead outside another friend’s home in the Northland neighborhood of Kansas City, by McGeeney’s fiancée on Jan. 9, local news station WDAF reported.
As of Saturday, medical examiners had not made a ruling on causes of death, a Kansas City police spokesperson told HuffPost in an email. The spokesperson added that there were “no apparent signs of foul play.”
Harrington’s mother, Jennifer Marquez, told WDAF that her son went to the house to watch the Kansas City Chiefs game, and she never heard from either him or his two friends after that.
Clayton McGeeney, Ricky Johnson, and David Harrington via Facebook
“I was at work, and I just never thought I’d be one of those people that would respond the way I did. I collapsed, I think. I don’t remember,” Marquez said.
The homeowner did not answer calls from friends and family, prompting McGeeney’s fiancée to break into the home after no one answered the door. They found one of the men deceased on the back porch.
Police later found two more bodies in the backyard, according to the outlet.
John Picerno, the attorney representing the homeowner, said in an interview with NewsNation’s Dan Abrams that his client had “no idea” the bodies were there.
“They were in the backyard. He doesn’t use that particular door. He goes out in the front. And so, he had no knowledge that they were out there until, you know, Tuesday, when he was told that they were out there,” Picerno told NewsNation.
Kansas City Police have ruled out foul play, and the homeowner has not been charged with any crimes.Picerno told Abrams that the homeowner had no reason to harm his friends.
“They were his friends. They were at his house socializing. If he had found them there, or if they were in danger, he would have called the police and tried to help them,” the lawyer said.
Alan McGeeney, Clayton’s cousin, told KCTV the incident seemed “strange” and said the families are looking for answers.
“I’m not looking for anyone’s head or anything, but my cousin was frozen to the dirt for two days,” McGeeney told the outlet.

Larry Hogan (R) said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s bid for the White House was over after he came in second place in the Iowa caucuses last week.
Hogan said on ABC’s “This Week” that it is essentially a “two-person race” between former President Trump and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley for the GOP presidential nomination. He dismissed DeSantis’s campaign when discussing Haley’s chances for a win in the New Hampshire primary this week.
“I think the DeSantis campaign ended in Iowa,” he said.
DeSantis came in second place in the Iowa caucuses last week with about 21 percent support, trailing behind Trump, who won the caucuses with about 51 percent. Haley came in third place with 19 percent support in the state.
However, DeSantis is currently trailing both Trump and Haley at a distance in New Hampshire just days before the primary begins in the state. Haley has about 36 percent support in the state, only trailing Trump by about 11 points, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, while DeSantis has about 5.7 percent support.
Hogan endorsed Haley for the GOP nomination last week, saying that she is the “best possible candidate” the Republicans can put forward in November’s general election. He also said Sunday that it is not “impossible” for Haley to secure the GOP nomination despite Trump’s lead in the polls.
“But it’s not impossible for her. If she overperforms expectations, I think she rolls into South Carolina with a lot of momentum,” Hogan said, speaking of Haley’s chances in the Granite State.

Symonenko fled to Russia with the assistance of Russian special forces during the occupation of Kyiv Oblast, said Ukraine’s SBU security service.

As Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Symonenko, known for supporting Russian aggression, sought ""evacuation"" from the Russian leadership, the SBU reported on Aug. 11.
The Kremlin ordered a special forces unit to escort him and his family out of the occupied town of Berezivka in the Makariv district of Kyiv Oblast. Following the arrival of Russian forces, Symonenko personally welcomed them and accommodated them in his own house.
The Russian special unit ""accompanied"" Symonenko and his family through Russian checkpoints to Belarus in March, 2022. He then relocated to Russia, where he assumed the role of deputy head of the Central Committee of the International Communist Union ""Union of Communist Parties — Communist Party of the Soviet Union.""

This pro-Kremlin organization operates under the control of the Russian Communist Party, led by State Duma deputy Gennady Zyuganov, the SBU said.
Symonenko, under Zyuganov's direction, initiated a public campaign supporting Moscow's aggressive policy even before the start of the full-scale war against Ukraine.
Participating in the International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties in Havana, Cuba, in October 2022, Symonenko attempted to legitimize the seizure of part of Ukraine's territory and the activities of the so-called ""L/DNR.""
He also attended an ""antifascist forum"" in Minsk in April 2023, advocating for the continuation of Russia's war against Ukraine and justifying Kremlin narratives regarding the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons.
Symonenko is accused of making public calls to overthrow the constitutional order and of justifying  Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine since 2014.
Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council decided in March 2022 to halt any activities of political forces associated with Russia during martial law. The parliament banned the activities of pro-Russian parties in Ukraine on May 3, 2022. A few months later, the Eighth Administrative Appeals Court definitively prohibited the Communist Party of Ukraine's activities.

Muhaimin Iskandar, the running mate of presidential candidate Anies Baswedan, said the goverment’s so called “downstreaming” policy had caused major environmental damage without significantly benefiting local people. While the measures helped create much needed jobs in outlying islands, in particular on Sulawesi, foreign workers have dominated the new roles, Iskandar said.
“We saw in our mining business downstreaming is done recklessly,” Iskandar said at a debate with other vice presidential candidates on Sunday, ahead of the country’s election next month. “Downstreaming development is not significantly affecting people’s welfare.”
The comments are the fiercest criticism yet of the flagship industrial policy of Widodo — better known as Jokowi — which all three leading presidential candidates had until recently said they would uphold. The outgoing head of state banned the export of raw nickel ore in 2020, drawing in billions of dollars worth of investment in plants to process it into more valuable products, spearheaded by Chinese firms including Tsingshan Holding Group.
The move fueled a nickel mining and processing boom which upended the global market, causing the metal’s price to plunge and forcing miners in other countries to cut their output. The sector’s explosive growth has also driven large-scale deforestation, while predominantly coal-fueled smelters have led to massive carbon emissions. Nickel is needed to create high-performing batteries for electric vehicles.
Iskandar also criticized the deadly accidents that have occurred at industrial facilities run by foreign firms, the most recent of which claimed 21 lives. He also attacked the proliferation of illegal nickel mining, which is particularly environmentally destructive.
“What kind of downstreaming do we want to continue while illegal mining is still widespread,” he said.
Meanwhile, Mohammad Mahfud Mahmodin, running mate of presidential hopeful Ganjar Pranowo, pointed to the slow pace with which regulators had cracked down on illegal mining. Gibran Rakabuming Raka, the vice presidential pick of poll-leader Prabowo Subianto and Widowo’s son, said those breaching the rules should have their mining permits revoked.
Indonesia’s heads to the polls next month. The next leader will take over from Jokowi after nearly a decade in power. Though the President has not officially endorsed a candidate, Subianto is widely seen as his favored pick after the former-general picked his son as running mate.

Ron DeSantis trailing behind former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former President Trump with only 6 percent of support ahead of the state’s key primary on Tuesday.
The CNN/University of New Hampshire (UNH) poll shows Haley with 39 percent support and Trump once again leading his opponents by double digits with 50 percent support. Trump increased his lead in New Hampshire compared with a CNN poll in January that showed him with 39 percent support and Haley with 32 percent.
The pool of likely GOP primary voters in New Hampshire includes non-Republican affiliated voters, unlike other primaries. Among those who identify as Republicans in the Granite State, 63 percent support Trump, 25 percent support Haley and 8 percent support DeSantis.
Overwhelmingly, Haley won the backing of self-described “liberal/progressive/socialists,” with 91 percent supporting her and 71 percent of self-described “moderates” backing her as well.
Haley also wins among likely GOP primary voters who identify as “Independent/Democrat,” winning 73 percent of the vote to Trump’s 20 percent.
When looking at party registration, similarly, 58 percent of “registered undeclared/not registered” voters support Haley, while 30 percent support Trump and 4 percent support DeSantis. Among registered Republicans, 67 percent support Trump, 23 percent support Haley and 4 percent support DeSantis.
The New Hampshire primary is set to take place this Tuesday, marking the second major presidential nominating contest after Iowa, which Trump won in a rout.
Haley has risen to double-digit support ahead of DeSantis in recent polls. DeSantis, once seen as Trump’s most formidable contender, has seen his support drop among Republican primary voters in recent weeks. Nationally, Trump is leading by 50 percentage points, according to Decision Desk HQ’s latest national polling average.
The CNN/UNH poll was conducted online between Jan. 16 and Jan. 19 and included 2,348 respondents, including 1,242 likely 2024 Republican primary voters. The CNN poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points among likely GOP primary voters in New Hampshire.

4CLMKFU7WB_0NP8H6NBDN40FDC,Seven ideas to reduce political polarization,Rachel Kleinfeld,"January 21, 2024 at 1:04 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/seven-ideas-reduce-political-polarization-040407611.html,"Editor’s note: This essay is part of Deseret Magazine’s January/February double issue addressing political polarization.
Democrats and Republicans have long disagreed on policy issues — that’s the normal, useful contestation that drives democracy. Today, each side fears the other will destroy the nation if they achieve power.  When obliterating the other side becomes the ultimate goal, democracies fall apart.
How can we heal our country’s toxic polarization? Here are seven research-backed ideas for pundits, politicians, reporters and regular citizens to bring down the temperature.
Humans are social creatures — we want to belong. We look to those with status to tell us what it takes to be part of the in-crowd.
That means politicians, pundits and ideological leaders should stand vocally against polarizing and hateful language and actions.
Public stands by people seen as associated with a political side can change partisans’ perceptions, by making such behavior appear unacceptable to that group.
Professors at NYU, Harvard and UCLA have found that it is most influential to criticize one’s own “tribe.” That is because critiquing one’s own group signals what is acceptable to group members in a way that taking potshots at the other side doesn’t.
You might never dream of condoning partisan murder — but you might still share a funny meme to that effect. Watch it: jokes have a particularly strong effect on normalizing prejudice — far more than an overtly prejudiced argument.
Particularly dangerous are jokes that employ violent rhetoric or dehumanize with language like “groomers” or animal comparisons. A slew of research shows that dehumanizing language removes inhibitions to perpetrating violence, especially when the language cultivates preexisting grievances and the speaker is respected by his or her group.

The myth of left and right
Depolarizing ourselves
You may not be able to alter someone’s deeper beliefs, but there are three ways regular people can reduce the spread of hateful memes and curb prejudiced or polarizing speech on social media.
First, remind users that online speech has real-world, offline consequences (both to the writer, since employers can see posts, as well as to the person or group targeted). Second, making a personal or empathetic connection with the speaker can lead to posts being deleted. Finally, humorous words or images that make fun of the original idea can also defuse the spread of hateful speech.
Americans are more polarized emotionally than ideologically — we actually disagree on policy far less than people think. Stunningly, a majority of Americans agree on the broad strokes of abortion, immigration and gun legislation.
Because partisans tend to have distorted views of who composes the other party and how many people believe stereotypical views attributed to that party, providing real information that overturns these beliefs can reduce polarization.
Reminding people that partisans have a range of opinions can dial back polarization. Immigration policy can be framed as left versus right, or as a complex issue that pits some right-wing business owners against others, some left-wing unions against more progressive activists, and so on.
The Difficult Conversations Lab at Columbia University found that when people read nuanced articles on policy issues that underscored this kind of intraparty disagreement, their conversations with people from the other party were of higher quality.
Repetition leads our brains to think things are true, regardless of the accuracy of the information being repeated. This tendency is even stronger when people want to believe a piece of false information, because our brains seek out information we want to hear.
So, if people read that “the 2020 election was not fraudulent,” many will remember “there were questions about the 2020 election.” The best way to avoid deepening misinformation is to simply state alternative information: “American elections are well run.”
Many countries are as emotionally and ideologically polarized as the United States — but are in much better shape. America is in particular peril because polarizing the public has become a winning political strategy.
With more than 80 percent of Congressional seats and 39 states controlled by one party, politicians have no incentive to speak to the center. Instead, the real elections are the primaries, which are dominated by small numbers of more polarized voters.
That means politicians win votes and donations by intensifying the emotion of their base, not reaching out to the center. No wonder they benefit from telling voters that the other side is not just wrong, but is malevolent and immoral.
Competition can change these incentives. Reforms like ranked choice voting in primary elections and Alaska’s final four system allow all voters to get a say. These systems can moderate polarization and create more positive elections.
Can America fix itself? It’s time to give these ideas a try.

4CMTMQTUPL_VUA7R0C86RYYJ3R,Modi opens grand Hindu temple with eye on India’s upcoming elections,Mithil Aggarwal and Jennifer Jett,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 4:11 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/modi-open-grand-hindu-temple-210041896.html,"India came to a halt Monday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi presided over the opening of a grand Hindu temple on a contested holy site that has become a symbol of religious tensions in the world’s largest democracy.
The $217 million Ram Mandir honors Lord Ram, the most revered deity in Hinduism, and is transforming Ayodhya, a city of about 3 million people in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, into a tourist hub that officials hope will be a Hindu version of the Vatican.
Dressed in a traditional kurta tunic, Modi led the consecration ceremony as Hindu priests chanted hymns and a 4.25-foot statue of Lord Ram was unveiled in the temple’s inner sanctum. Indian Air Force helicopters showered the temple with flower petals as Modi placed a lotus in front of the black stone idol, which was adorned with gold ornaments.
“After centuries of waiting, our Ram has arrived,” he said in a speech after the ceremony, addressing thousands of devotees, politicians, businesspeople and celebrities gathered for the event.
“We are laying the foundation of India for the next 1,000 years from this moment,” he said.
The temple was built on the site of Babri Masjid, a mosque dating to the 16th century that was destroyed by Hindu nationalist mobs in 1992, setting off riots across the country that killed about 2,000 people, mostly Muslims. In 2019, India’s Supreme Court ruled that the temple could be built on the disputed 7-acre site, in a controversial decision that was criticized by Muslim groups.
The inauguration of the temple, which is still far from complete, comes as Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party prepare to run for a record third consecutive term in elections this spring. The BJP had been advocating for the temple for decades as a way to celebrate Hindu identity after centuries of Mughal and British rule. Its opening could help Modi win favor with voters in India, a country of 1.4 billion people that has been majority Hindu since it gained independence in 1947.
The consecration ceremony was celebrated as a national event, with many states declaring a public holiday, stock markets closing down and temples across the country holding their own ceremonies.
The Indian news media was dominated by coverage of the event, which was broadcast live across India and at Indian diplomatic missions and other sites around the world, including in Times Square in New York late Sunday.
In Mauritius, a small island nation in the Indian Ocean where almost half the population is Hindu, public officers of Hindu faith were given two hours off work to watch it.
Some Hindu religious leaders had refused to attend the ceremony, saying a Hindu temple cannot be consecrated until it is finished. Other critics, including India’s main opposition Congress party, accused Modi of stoking religious tensions.
Sunita Viswanath, executive director of the U.S.-based nonprofit group Hindus for Human Rights, said the ceremony was an “electoral stunt” that “should not be happening in the name of my faith.”
“Modi is not a priest, so leading this ceremony for political gain is both technically and morally wrong,” she said in a news release. “This weaponization of our religion tramples what’s left of India’s secular democratic values.”
The city of Ayodhya is remaking itself around the temple, which will be able to accommodate about 200,000 visitors a day. Roads have been widened, with the 8-mile, four-lane Ram Path guiding pilgrims to the pink sandstone, three-story structure.
A new airport, inaugurated by Modi last month, depicts the temple architecture on its facade and will eventually be able to handle 6 million passengers a year. Big new hotels are under construction, while local residents such as Amit Gupta are turning their homes into guesthouses.
Gupta, 35, who was born and raised in Ayodhya, said he was “very happy” about the temple.
“Now we are getting to see it completed in front of our eyes,” he said.
Gupta and his staff are pulling out all the stops to prepare for the anticipated influx of tourists in the coming weeks, with Gupta saying he is almost fully booked with visitors from around India.
“We are working very hard to ensure nobody arriving here has any trouble,” he said in a phone interview. “They should leave Ayodhya feeling that, ‘Not only Lord Ram but also the people there took care of us.’”
Some Hindus believe that Lord Ram was born on the exact site of Babri Masjid, and that the mosque had replaced a Hindu temple that was destroyed by Muslim invaders.
A spokesperson for Vishva Hindu Parishad, a Hindu nationalist group that has been criticized over its role in the destruction of the mosque in 1992, said this month that the effort to construct the temple was “bigger than the independence movement itself.”
In its 2019 ruling, the Supreme Court set aside a different area for the construction of a mosque, about 15 miles away. Though Haji Arfat Shaikh, head of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation and a BJP politician, has said the new mosque will be “more beautiful than the Taj Mahal,” construction has yet to begin on the 5-acre site.
Modi has a high level of support in India, where his approval rating of 77% makes him the most popular leader in the world, according to the U.S.-based firm Morning Consult. His state visit to the White House last June drew crowds of supporters from the Indian diaspora but also protests over his human rights record.
Since Modi took office in 2014, press freedom in India has declined and communal violence against Muslims, Christians and other religious minorities has grown. He was also criticized in 2019 for revoking the limited autonomy of Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority region.
At the same time, India has risen in global stature, strengthening its ties with the United States and its allies as they seek to counterbalance China while also promoting its role as a leader of the Global South.
The U.S.-India relationship is not without its strains. In November, U.S. prosecutors charged an unnamed Indian government official they accused of plotting to assassinate a Sikh separatist leader living in New York. India has said such a crime would be “contrary to government policy.”

Ambassador Nikki Haley, heading into a major test as she takes on Donald Trump in the New Hampshire primary this week, criticized the former president, in whose Cabinet she served, on Sunday for his relationship with ""dictators that want to kill us.""
""You can't have someone who's trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us,"" Haley told ""Face the Nation."" ""Instead, you have to let them know what we expect of them. That's the difference.""
The comments came as Haley has attempted to draw a line between her foreign policy chops and the former president's throughout her campaign, in recent days releasing a new advertisement about American college student Otto Warmbier, who was taken hostage by North Korea in 2016 and died soon after his release, that she said shows ""the contrast,"" while pointing to Trump's approach to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Haley said Sunday that Trump's engagement with the North Korean leader ""goes back to a pattern,"" referencing Trump's positive statements about Chinese President Xi Jinping and what she called a ""bromance"" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""When you've got wars all over the world now and the instability that we have, our goal is to prevent war and we can't do that by trying to buddy up with them,"" she said.
The moves come ahead of the New Hampshire primary, where Haley has staked much of her White House ambitions — hoping to make inroads with independents and moderates, especially after her third-place showing in Iowa. Polls suggest that the Granite State could be much friendlier to Haley, and she received the coveted endorsement of New Hampshire's largest newspaper, the Manchester Union-Leader. A storng finish could set Haley up for a possible boost in momentum heading into other early states like her home state of South Carolina.
Accordingly, Trump has ramped up his Haley opposition in recent days, fresh off of a decisive victory in Iowa, claiming that she's busing in Democrats for the primary.
Haley fired back at the claim in a social media post on Friday, noting that Democrats can't vote in the New Hampshire primary and haven't been able to change their registration for months.
""Another reason we need to move on from Trump: too many lies,"" she wrote.
Haley reiterated her pitch on Sunday that Americans don't want a Biden-Trump rematch in 2024, emphasizing that a Trump presidency would result in ""chaos.""
""No matter what it is, chaos follows him, rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him,"" she said. ""And so what happens is that puts the rest of America in chaos.""

Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who became a household name at just 19 after performing at the royal event, said that some “don’t realise how uncomfortable a song like that can make a lot of people feel”.
His comments are likely to reignite the long-running debate over the singing of the patriotic anthem, which critics say has uncomfortable associations with slavery and Britain’s colonial past.
In 2020 the BBC provoked an outcry when it revealed a plan to perform the song without lyrics, a decision that was reversed one day after Tim Davie took over as the corporation’s director general.
The performance of Rule Britannia is always accompanied by vociferous flag waving.
Speaking to Lauren Laverne on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Kanneh-Mason said: “I don’t think it should be included and I didn’t stay for that. That’s just my opinion.
“I think, maybe, some people don’t realise how uncomfortable a song like that can make a lot of people feel, even if it makes them feel good.
“I think that’s somehow a big misunderstanding about it.”
He has previously suggested that the Last Night instead focus on folk tunes, although he conceded it would be “probably not as popular”.
Kanneh-Mason performed at 2023’s Last Night alongside conductor Marin Alsop, who made history in 2013 as the first woman to lead the occasion.
He performed Maz Bruch’s Kol Nidrei, and a Samuel Coleridge-Taylor arrangement of Deep River.
The cellist also spoke about his experience as a young black classical music artist and said there were occasions he had not been “taken seriously”.
“Very often, in the spaces that I was in within classical music, myself and my family were very often the only black people in those places,” he said.
“Most of the time it was fine in the sense I felt comfortable and all good but there was certainly occasions where my being black meant that I wasn’t necessarily taken seriously in some situations.
He said he was able to deal with prejudice from the example of black role models, such as Muhammad Ali.
“What gave me the strength in those situations is, we would spend a lot of time as children watching documentaries of real black heroes succeeding and being challenged and overcoming”.
The 24-year-old from Nottingham, who won the BBC Young Musician 2016 award, has said he was not affected by nerves when his performance at the 2018 royal wedding in St George’s Chapel, Windsor was broadcast around the world.
“I think at the time of performing, it felt like very much just playing to the people in the room,” he said.
He added: “I think in terms of nervousness, I’m more nervous for my cello lesson, because I know that my teacher listens in (a) certain way.
“I guess what I’m saying is, the audience, yeah, I’m grateful for them being there, but I don’t think who is there necessarily puts ... more pressure.”
The Last Night of the Proms has become a political and cultural battleground in recent years.
Last year the BBC faced calls for an inquiry into its coverage of the event after it showed a sea of European Union Flags being waved.
It was announced in November that David Pickard, the Proms director, would step down later this year, having led the music festival since 2015.
During his time in post he also oversaw the Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra play in 2022 and the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage and the end of the First World War in 2018.

The level of death, destruction and displacement from the war already is without precedent in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Yet Israeli officials say the fighting is likely to continue for several more months.
The slow progress and the plight of the hostages held in Gaza has divided ordinary Israelis and their leaders even as the offensive threatens to ignite a wider war involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that support the Palestinians.
The United States, which has provided essential diplomatic and military support for the offensive, has had limited success in persuading Israel to adopt military tactics that put civilians at less risk and to facilitate the delivery of more humanitarian aid. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has rejected U.S. and international calls for postwar plans that would include a path to Palestinian statehood.
The war began with Hamas’ surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, during which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostages back to Gaza.
Israel responded with a blistering three-week air campaign and then a ground invasion into northern Gaza. Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation.
Israel continues to carry out airstrikes throughout the besieged territory, including areas in the south where it told civilians to seek refuge. Many Palestinians have ignored evacuation orders, saying nowhere feels safe.
Since the war started, a total of 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, while another 62,681 have been wounded, the Health Ministry reported Sunday. The death toll included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza’s hospitals since Saturday, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said. Another 300 people were wounded in the past day, he said.
The overall toll is thought to be even higher because many casualties remain buried under the rubble from Israeli strikes or in areas where medics cannot reach them, Al-Qidra said.
The Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures but says around two-thirds of the people killed in Gaza were women and minors.
The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but its casualty figures from previous wars were largely consistent with those of U.N. agencies and even the Israeli military.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense neighborhoods, often near homes, schools or mosques.
The military says 195 of its soldiers have been killed since the start of the Gaza offensive.
The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza’s residents from their homes, with hundreds of thousands packing into U.N.-run shelters and tent camps in the southern part of the tiny coastal enclave. U.N. officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as only a trickle of humanitarian aid reaches them because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions.
Netanyahu has vowed to keep up the offensive until Israel achieves “complete victory” over Hamas and returns all the remaining hostages. But even some top Israeli officials have begun to acknowledge that those goals might be mutually exclusive.
Hamas is believed to be holding the captives in tunnels deep underground and using them as shields for its top leaders. Israel has only managed to rescue one hostage since the war began, and Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations.
A member of Israel’s War Cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, said last week that the only way to free the remaining hostages was through a cease-fire. In an implicit criticism of Netanyahu, he said claims to the contrary amounted to “illusions.”
Hamas has said it will not free more hostages until Israel ends its offensive. The group also is expected to make any further releases conditional on securing freedom for thousands of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, including high-profile militants involved in attacks that killed Israelis.
Israel’s government has ruled that out for now, but it faces rising pressure from families of the hostages, who are pushing for another exchange, and from Israelis frustrated by the security failures that preceded the Oct. 7 attack and by Netanyahu’s handling of the war.
Thousands of people gathered in Tel Aviv over the weekend to call for new elections.
Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners are meanwhile pushing him to step up the offensive, with some calling for the “voluntary” emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from the territory in 2005, two years before Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces."

FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets across towns and cities in Germany this weekend as the country enters a second week of nationwide protests against the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Demonstrations have gained momentum after reports emerged from investigative news website Correctiv of a meeting of right-wing extremists in Potsdam at which migration policies including mass deportations of people of foreign origin were discussed.
The AfD, which is polling second in nationwide surveys, has denied the reported migration plans are party policy.
On Sunday, rallies were held in Berlin, Munich and Cologne, as well as in more traditional AfD voting strongholds in eastern Germany such as Leipzig and Dresden, with turnout in many places far higher than expected.
Organisers in Munich ended the demonstration early due to overcrowding with around 100,000 participants, according to police. Protest organisers said 200,000 people attended. At the start of the event in Berlin, there were 30,000 people and the number was growing, police said.
Several tens of thousands also took to the streets in Cologne and Bremen on Sunday. Event organisers estimated around 300,000 people demonstrated nationwide on Saturday.
""It's a signal to the world that we won't let this happen without commenting on it,"" said protestor Steffi Kirschenmann, a social counsellor based in Frankfurt, one of tens of thousands that gathered peacefully in sub-zero temperatures in Frankfurt's centre on Saturday.
Lord Mayor of Frankfurt, Mike Josef, addressed crowds on Roemer Square, which he reminded protesters was the same spot where the Nazi regime had burnt books.
The AfD declined to comment on the demonstrations against it.
Business leaders have voiced their concerns, with Siemens Energy supervisory board chairman Joe Kaeser telling Reuters the reports trigger ""bitter memories"".
President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has seen the rallies across Germany against right-wing extremism as a sign of strength. In a video message distributed on Sunday, Steinmeier said: ""You are standing up against misanthropy and right-wing extremism, these people encourage us all.""
He called for an alliance of all democrats, saying ""Let's show that we are stronger together.""
German Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck told a local newspaper he saw the demonstrations as an encouraging sign for democracy.
""It is impressive to see that many people are now taking to the streets and flying the flag for our democracy"", the Green party politician told the Augsburger Allgemeine. The Central Council of Jews in Germany also welcomed the demonstrations. For Jews, this is an image ""that can restore confidence in the democratic conditions"" of the country, Central Council President Josef Schuster told Welt-TV.
Germany's Boersen-Zeitung on Saturday published a series of statements from companies listed in Germany's DAX stock market index in which the companies spoke out against xenophobia, anti-semitism and political extremism on the right-wing fringe.

(Reuters) -Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration on Monday of a grand temple to the Hindu god-king Ram on a site believed to be his birthplace, in a historic event for the Hindu majority of the world's most populous nation.
Coming months before Modi seeks a rare third term in general elections due by May, the event delivers on a campaign promise his political party made more than three decades ago, but also calls to mind some of India's worst sectarian strife.
WHY DOES IT MATTER?
The idol represents Ram as a five-year-old child, as many Hindus consider the temple site to have been the deity’s birthplace and where he spent his childhood.
As the temple replaces a 16th-century Mughal-era mosque razed by radical Hindu groups in 1992, many Indians hail it as a sign of Hindu reawakening from centuries of foreign subjugation, including rule by Muslim dynasties such as the Mughals.
Analysts say Modi's leadership of the ceremony symbolises for supporters of his Hindu nationalist party that India is finally ready to end what they call appeasement of minorities and move towards their goal of building a Hindu-first nation.
WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF THE NEW TEMPLE?
Construction began in 2020, with Modi laying the foundation stone of the temple to one of Hinduism's principal deities on a 2.7-acre (one-hectare) plot within a complex that sprawls over 70 acres (28 hectares).
Supervised by a panel headed by Modi's former chief of staff Nripendra Misra, construction cost an estimated 15 billion rupees ($181 million), funded by contributions amounting to more than twice that from 40 million people in India.
WHAT WAS THE RELIGIOUS DISPUTE ABOUT?
The Indian epic, the Ramayana, mentions Ayodhya, a town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh nearly 700 km (435 miles) east of New Delhi, as the birthplace of Ram, whom Hindus believe to be a physical incarnation of Lord Vishnu.
The razed mosque dating from 1528, during the rule of Babur, India's first Mughal emperor, is believed by many Hindus to have been built on the spot where Ram was born, following the demolition of an earlier temple there.
In Dec. 1949, authorities seized the mosque after Hindu activists placed idols of Ram inside the disputed structure. Court orders barred removal of the idols, and use as a mosque effectively ceased.
Hindu and Muslim groups filed separate claims over the site and the structure. In 1989, a high court ordered the maintenance of status quo.
HOW WAS THE MOSQUE RAZED?
Hindu and Muslim groups tried unsuccessfully to resolve the dispute through talks, before Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) launched a nationwide campaign in 1990 to build the temple.
Lal Krishna Advani, the president of the party at the time, embarked on a cross-country journey on a truck fitted out to resemble an ancient chariot.
It whipped up Hindu fervour, deepening rifts with Muslims but also catapulting the party to national prominence.
The BJP campaign climaxed in a rally in Ayodhya on Dec. 6, 1992, when a mob climbed the mosque and smashed its domes with axes and hammers, levelling the entire structure.
The event triggered sectarian riots in several parts of India, killing about 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.
Muslims are a minority in mainly Hindu India, making up about 14% of its 1.42 billion people.
As a foot soldier of the party at the time, Modi helped organise the chariot's journey, which began in his home state of Gujarat.
He rode to the office of prime minister in 2014 on a Hindu nationalist platform that included the promise to build the temple.
Temple construction began after the Supreme Court permitted it in 2019 on condition that Muslims received another plot for a mosque.

4W5XUB9TVG_JOJE4J606EY2H2T,Media literacy is more than spotting fake news. How one librarian gives teens the tools to decide what to trust,"Alisha Ebrahimji, CNN","January 22, 2024 at 11:13 PM·9 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/media-literacy-more-spotting-fake-110324423.html,"Along with the smell of old books and the shelves of trendy novels at the South Brunswick High School library are guides for accurately deciphering the digital world.
Poster after poster with “Smart Social Networking” tips and what “Good Digital Citizenship” looks like hang at this New Jersey campus, where school librarian Lisa Manganello has made it her mission to teach teenagers to navigate the vast – often deliberately confusing – landscape of online information.
“Media literacy has absolutely nothing to do with which side of the debate you’re on,” the 17-year veteran of this still-emerging academic subject told CNN. “And I often say to my students, I don’t care if you are conservative or if you are liberal, it really doesn’t make a difference to me.
“Whatever article you’re choosing, I want you to be able to look at it from a critical lens and really make a decision about whether or not this is a trustworthy article,” Manganello told CNN. “You can have an opinion on either side, but you should be able to validate that opinion with a fact-based article.”
Media literacy is the ability to decode media messages – including the systems in which they exist – assess their influence on thoughts, feelings and behaviors, and create media thoughtfully and conscientiously, according to Media Literacy Now, an advocacy group that tracks and drives the subject’s implementation in K-12 schools across the United States.
With lots of kids now getting their news from social media – where disinformation and content created by artificial intelligence run rampant – 18 states have some form of K-12 media literacy education on the books, according to Media Literacy Now. Of those, four – Delaware, Texas, New Jersey and, starting this year, California – mandate media literacy, with lesson standards now being crafted state by state.
Online misinformation, of course, can direct kids not only to messages that aren’t true but also to dangers like cyberbullying, negative body image and a path into substance abuse, the group says. And so the potential impact of teaching them how to interpret what they see online could be nothing short of “life-changing,” said Olga Polites, New Jersey chapter leader for Media Literacy Now.
When cars were invented, for instance, auto safety wasn’t widely talked about, seatbelts weren’t a priority and learning how to drive was a whole new landscape, she said.
“(Cell) phones are like cars,” Polites told CNN. “But we haven’t really taught people how to use them ethically, efficiently and responsibly.”
To do that, a media literacy lesson might include analyzing which emotions the wording of a mass media headline evoke. Or parsing the photo that runs alongside the text of a news piece. Or using “lateral reading” – lining up stories on the same topic in browser tabs to compare credibility, intent and biases – as Manganello did a few weeks ago at South Brunswick High School.
With a variety of news headlines displayed on her projector screen, the librarian asked 25 students in history teacher Jeff Johnson’s American government class the following:
“Te ll me words that you see in these headlines that you think shows bias?”
“Revenge,” one student quickly said, though with a little hesitation in his voice.
“Ah, revenge!” Manganello replied.
The group, armed with personal laptops and seated four to a table, kept discussing: What might a more neutral word choice have been?
“I thought it was very interesting to think about how we get our information and how we interpret it because of what (the media is) telling us, especially the part where it was talking about the word choice that people use and how it can influence your opinions,” ninth grader Harrison Pekosz told CNN later.
In elementary and middle school, Harrison learned about identifying legitimate sources of information based on a web address ending with “.com” or “.org.”
“Now, it’s more in-depth, and I know there’s more to look at than just domain,” he said.
Soon, Manganello shifted the lesson to photos and asked students to identify whether an image attached to a news article was “flattering, neutral or unflattering.” The choice, she said, could help determine whether the piece as a whole is trustworthy – or not.
“Information literacy is the umbrella for all of the things that we teach in the library … to make sure that our students have all the tools they need to do both information gathering and to engage with media that could be online, social media, for research,” Manganello said. “Media literacy kind of falls under that information literacy banner.”
Beyond the library, Manganello works with teachers at South Brunswick High School throughout the year to incorporate information literacy into their lesson plans, from art history to science classes. She also speaks at educational conferences, where attendees have approached her to ask how they can get started implementing her work in their schools, she said.
On her own campus, Manganello’s goal is to see every student a few times a year, focusing on a new skill each time over their four years, she said. In the end, students have a kit of tools to tap into when they’re scanning the latest headlines – especially online.
Akshara Satheesh and Urja Kandale, both ninth graders at South Brunswick High School, get their news from TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat or Google’s News Discovery feed because of how simple it is to understand storylines, they told CNN.
And they’re not alone.
“We found that 75% of them get their information off of social media, many off of TikTok,” Manganello told CNN.
It’s not an unfathomable stat, considering a growing number of adult TikTok users in the US report getting their news on the short-video platform, according to 2023 data from the Pew Research Center.
That in itself isn’t necessarily a problem: Plenty of reputable news agencies share their reports on social media platforms.
Here’s the catch: 96% of high school students surveyed in in 2018 and 2019 failed to accurately judge the credibility of a piece of information online, Stanford University research found. And two-thirds couldn’t tell the difference between news articles and advertisements on the home page of US news agency.
“Students displayed a troubling tendency to accept websites at face value,” wrote the study’s authors.
In fact, more than 80% of middle school students a few years earlier believed an ad identified by the words “sponsored content” was a real news story, a Stanford survey published in 2016 found; some students even mentioned it was sponsored content but still believed it was a news article.
“Young people’s ability to reason about the information on the Internet can be summed up in one word: bleak,” those authors wrote.
The confusion derives – at least in part, experts say – from the fact that most students aren’t being taught how to use mass media critically, said Polites of Media Literacy Now in New Jersey.
“We’ve given (teens) so little guidance,” Polites said. “And there’s so much life-changing risk that comes with that.”
From Manganello’s lesson, Akshara and Urja’s major takeaways included narrowing their focus on key terms, they said.
“I’ve done stuff like this before,” Urja said, “but we didn’t dive deep.”
While Manganello’s program at South Brunswick High School is a great model, right now it’s the exception, said Michelle Ciulla Lipkin, executive director of the National Association for Media Literacy Education.
“We’re getting legislators to put their foot down and say, ‘We need to see some changes in our education system,’ but now it’s, ‘Where is the funding coming from?’” she said. “‘Where’s the support for teachers and their professional development? How are we really integrating this into our curriculum, across school(s), across a big area, across grade levels?’
“And that is a much broader, slower, more challenging conversation, because it’s expensive and time-consuming.”
New Jersey’s governor last year signed a law that requires the state Education Department to develop student learning standards in information literacy. And California starting this year requires media literacy instruction to be integrated into K-12 mathematics, science and history-social science curriculums when they’re revised, according to the bill.
But getting the frameworks and grade-specific lessons down in writing can take several drafts, even before public comment is sought and polished proposals presented to district leaders, said Elisabeth Yucis, associate director in the Professional Development and Instructional Issues Division at the New Jersey Education Association, an educators union.
All in all, the process could take a while, she said.
Meanwhile, Johnson, the history teacher at South Brunswick, hopes in 10 years his students will be able to find clarity in what they’re thinking and saying because of the foundation Manganello is creating for them.
Johnson wants his students to learn to say, “‘Wait a minute, why am I feeling like this? Do I believe this?’” he said. “Or, ‘I just told somebody something happened, but did I even check that that actually happened or that that’s even a big deal to me? Like, why am I saying it’s a big deal?’”
And indeed, Harrison, the ninth grader, already is thinking about how important these lessons are for the future.
“Now that there are more people turning 18 and a lot of them are getting all of their information from social media … I think that will impact how they vote and will impact the country as a result,” he said.
It’s why Manganello has spent nearly two decades perfecting how she teaches media literacy.
“These are kids that are going to go out and do brilliant things,” the librarian said. “We need them to think about how they accept information in a smarter way because I think that will change the way we all do.”

Fred J. Edwards, 46, of Salt Lake City, will be booked into the Salt Lake County Jail on a murder charge, according to the Unified Police Department.
Snowboarder recounts near-death experience after being caught in avalanche in Brighton’s backcountry
At 6:20 a.m. on Jan. 20, the Salt Lake Valley Emergency Communications Center received a “distressing” call of a body located near a dumpster at 3994 S 300 W in Millcreek, UPD said.
Officers quickly responded and found the body of Esperanza Chavez, 25, of Salt Lake City.
Detectives started an investigation canvassing for surveillance footage. They said a nearby business provided footage that showed a black truck arrive at the scene at 12:28 a.m. In the footage, officers said they could see a male figure, identified as Edwards by his license plate, pulling a body from a vehicle.
Attempts were reportedly made to dispose of the body in the dumpster, but police said Edwards left the scene, leaving the victim beside the dumpster.
According to UPD, preliminary findings suggest the incident occurred in that vehicle and involved a shooting, resulting in the death of Chavez.
Police apprehended Edwards at the University of Utah Hospital, where he was being evaluated.

Larry Hogan (R) said Sunday that GOP presidential hopeful Nikki Haley may still have a chance at clinching the Republican 2024 nomination despite former President Trump’s double-digit lead in the polls.
Hogan said on ABC’s “This Week” panel that the New Hampshire primary “sometimes really surprises us,” suggesting that Haley could come out with a win in the state. Hogan also endorsed Haley for the nomination last week and praised her for having the “momentum” to be the GOP’s best candidate next November.
“That’s the place where things happen that you don’t expect to happen. Look at Bill Clinton. Look at John McCain, and the fact that she’s only down 11 with a lot of momentum. It’s not going to look anything at all like Iowa,” Hogan said.
He also said a lot of independent voters will come out in support of Haley to stop Trump from securing the nomination because it is an open primary in which voters of all affiliations can cast a ballot.
“And I think what you’re going to see is a lot of independents. There’s no Democratic primary, independents that want to stop Donald Trump. This is the last line of defense. Republicans, the 50 percent of Republicans that don’t like Trump. Tuesday’s their day, so she got a couple more days. Let’s see what plays out,” Hogan said.
“But it’s not impossible for her. If she overperforms expectations, I think she rolls into South Carolina with a lot of momentum,” he added.
According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling averages, Trump is leading Haley by about 11 points with about 47 percent support. Haley has about 36 percent, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trailing with a distant 5.7 percent. The New Hampshire primary will be held Tuesday, just over a week after Trump won the Iowa caucuses.

It marked the 80th anniversary of the code-breaking computer's invention.
The device's existence was largely kept secret until the early 2000s.
British intelligence has released ""rare and never-before-seen images"" of the World War II era ""Colossus"" code-breaking computer.
GCHQ, the UK's intelligence, security and cyber agency, said in a press release that the new photos were released to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the computer's invention.
Colossus, which was shrouded in secrecy until the early 2000s, was designed by engineer Tommy Flowers to decipher coded messages between some of Nazi Germany's most senior officers.
It played a key role in helping the Allies win World War II. It provided critical intelligence that German leader Adolf Hitler had been duped into believing the Allies would invade occupied France via Pas-de-Calais rather than Normandy, where they would carry out the famous and pivotal D-Day landings on June 6, 1944 — codenamed Operation Overlord.
The huge machine was at the cutting edge of technology for its time, contained 2,500 valves, and was a precursor to the computer age.
GCHQ said the images shed ""new light on the genesis and workings of Colossus, which was over two meters tall and considered by many to be the first-ever digital computer.""
Soldiers from the Women's Royal Naval Service (Wrens) were recruited to the large teams of operators and technicians needed to run and maintain Colossus' spy operation against Nazi Germany.
Bill Marshall, a former GCHQ engineer who worked on the computer during the 1960s, said he had to sign the ""Official Secrets Act"" and ""was told very little"" about the machine he was working on, per GCHQ.
""What the machine was actually doing was not for me to know,"" he added. ""It wasn't until much later that I found out that the several of the systems and detailed design information were supposedly destroyed at the end of WWII.""
Andrew Herbert, a computer scientist who has served as the chairman of Microsoft Research and is the chairman of trustees at The National Museum of Computing, said: ""Colossus was perhaps the most important of the wartime code breaking machines because it enabled the Allies to read strategic messages passing between the main German headquarters across Europe.""
Housed at the UK's code-breaking center, Bletchley Park, 10 Colossus computers helped 550 people decrypt ""63 million characters of high-grade German communications"" by the end of World War II, according to The National Museum of Computing.

58OUBDLAIT_ZUVUBK68RHHLZHC,The total return for AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) investors has risen faster than earnings growth over the last five years,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 6:05 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/total-return-astrazeneca-lon-azn-090506850.html,"Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the AstraZeneca share price has climbed 96% in five years, easily topping the market return of 0.9% (ignoring dividends).
Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 3.3%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price.
View our latest analysis for AstraZeneca
While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.
During five years of share price growth, AstraZeneca achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 14%. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of AstraZeneca, it has a TSR of 124% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
We regret to report that AstraZeneca shareholders are down 4.2% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 3.4%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 17% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand AstraZeneca better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.  We've identified 2 warning signs  with AstraZeneca , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.
There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.

For many people, there are few things quite as refreshing as adding a few ice cubes to your cold drink. If you agree with this sentiment, then you'll probably be surprised to hear that most folks in the U.K. do not feel the same way. In the United States, almost any restaurant you go into will serve your cold drink with ice cubes. Most households have some means of storing ice to add to drinks. Yet, in Britain, things are different. Most people think you should never get ice in your drink and the reason why is embedded in history.
The practice of keeping frozen water on hand dates back to 1100 BC. By the 19th century, it was common for folks in the U.K. to head to department stores to buy ice from the U.S. and Canada to store in their homes. That may seem like a lot of work for some ice water to most of us. When you don't have ice cubes at your disposal, though, an extra cold drink can feel like a real luxury. During this time, ice cubes became exactly that in Britain; a luxury. The use of ice in drinks started as a trend for the British elite and it ended like one, too.

In the 19th century, as people in other nations worked to obtain ice, wealthy British folks discovered that people were willing to go to great lengths for it. Consequently, putting ice in drinks became a sign of wealth in British homes. Wealthy British people became known for not only adding ice cubes to things like cold water or cocktails but any drink typically served room temperature or chilled got the extra cold treatment. People would even put ice cubes in champagne.
Still, even when iced drinks became particularly trendy, most people couldn't afford them. As a result, the trend never took off for those who weren't wealthy and ultimately faded for those who were. Even as freezers and refrigerators became commonplace in homes and having ice on hand became easier, most people just weren't used to having drinks with ice. It's difficult for Americans to imagine, but people in the U.K. just never considered it to be important, especially with cooler temperatures. Even as heatwaves rise in the U.K., they aren't used to dealing with higher temperatures and, therefore, don't consider coping with heat as vital as people in the U.S. do. In fact, air-conditioning is still far less common in Britain than it is across the pond. So, if you travel to the U.K., you might want to pack an ice cube tray just in case.

Dorman,"January 22, 2024 at 5:05 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/florida-gov-ron-desantis-once-200510842.html,"Ron DeSantis is ending his 2024 presidential campaign.
DeSantis entered the race with lofty expectations, with many conservatives seeing him as a next-generation GOP figure.
But Trump has had a disciplined campaign, and DeSantis lost key support in many early-voting states.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday suspended his presidential campaign, a stunning fall for the conservative leader who had long been seen as the biggest threat to former President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.
""I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory,"" DeSantis said in a message to supporters. ""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance.""
""While this campaign has ended, the mission continues,"" he continued. ""Down here in Florida, we will continue to show the country how to lead.""
DeSantis, who entered the presidential race last May, sought to build on the national profile that he had built for himself as an immigration hard-liner and as a politician who had fought against COVID-19 mandates. After winning reelection in November 2022 in a 19-point landslide, DeSantis' profile exploded, and he was immediately viewed by many Republicans as the conservative who could go toe-to-toe against Trump and capture the GOP nomination.
In several polls taken before DeSantis entered the race, the governor actually polled ahead of Trump, which at the time revealed the vulnerable state that the former president found himself in politically after Republicans faltered in the 2022 midterm elections.
After DeSantis entered the race, he was competitive in the early-voting states, but as the summer and fall went on, his numbers slipped precipitously across the country. He staked his campaign on winning the Iowa caucuses, but Trump's standing in the state only strengthened by the end of last year.
Trump's myriad legal issues seemingly had the effect of boosting his polling numbers with GOP primary voters, which in turn iced out DeSantis as the leading alternative to the former president.
Trump would go on to win the Iowa caucuses, taking 51% of the vote to DeSantis' 21% share and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley's 19%. Despite campaigning in all 99 of Iowa's counties, DeSantis did not win a single county in the state.
DeSantis' exit from the race also comes two days before the New Hampshire primary, a contest where he was struggling for relevancy, with most his polling numbers mired in the single digits.
The governor in recent days had sought to pivot to the South Carolina Republican primary on Feb. 24, but with Trump riding high there and Haley have a sizable level of support in her home state, his pathway to continuing in the race became incredibly murky.

Her gym serves around 200 members at any given time and has worked with more than 2,000 over the past decade. Most have been women, with a few men coming in to work out throughout the years.
Carson lives in Massillon, is a single mother of four and has six grandchildren all under the age of 5.
“My current fitness 'why' is to be strong, healthy, and agile enough to play with my grandchildren like I'm their mom, not their gramma,"" she said.
Carson is a NASM certified personal trainer and an ASFA certified group fitness instructor. She started her training in the park in the summer of 2014 working out with friends and it gradually grew into a business.
ReZist Ohio serves primarily women ages 30 to 65, teaching them how to lift weights safely in a group environment. Carson said it became her passion because strength training is under-supported for females, but it is so necessary for them and their health and longevity.
“When I got divorced, I started taking cardio classes at the YMCA to kill time while my kids were with their dad,” she said. “I discovered I really liked it but after a few years still didn't see the results I thought I should. So I did some research, added weightlifting to my routine, and soon changed the shape of my body. Strength training is the missing link for women who want to look and feel fit.""
The ReZist brand is ""resistance"" training with every class utilizing some form of resistance to build strength and muscle mass, which is critical for middle-aged women.
“We run periodic challenges at the studio to keep engagement high,"" Carson said. ""The members are very good at holding each other accountable — so if you don't show up for class someone will be texting you after,” Carson said.

That’s obviously a considered decision, and there are more than enough not-very-veiled references to Trump and the MAGA “movement” to make clear that Toscano understands the symbolic importance of America’s homegrown would-be dictator to the phenomenon he’s trying to delineate.
For that matter, the notorious European political leaders of the 1930s with whom Trump is frequently compared — you know who I mean, the strutting Italian peacock and the little Austrian with the ‘stache — don’t play starring roles in “Late Fascism” either. That’s partly because Toscano is more concerned with political and philosophical theories of fascism and anti-fascism, with the backstage machinery, so to speak, rather than the actors facing the crowd.
But beyond that, it’s because Toscano’s central argument — as I read this admittedly challenging work — is that fascism should be understood as a “dynamic” or a “process” unfolding throughout recent history, not as a “singular event” associated with charismatic leaders, mass rallies and fashion-forward uniforms that emerged during a global economic crisis and then was defeated, only to resurface unexpectedly in the 21st century.
Toscano writes in his preface that he does not “intend ‘late fascism’ to operate like an academic brand,” meaning a trendy label embraced as an all-purpose explanation, à la “neoliberalism,” “late capitalism” or “globalization.” He may protest too much: “Late Fascism” is so loaded with moments of insight and illumination into the tormented historical, political and psychological roots of our current crisis that such an outcome may be inevitable.
Although Toscano never provides a single straightforward definition of what fascism is or isn’t, his thought and language are so precise and specific that he can’t be accused of flinging the term at every right-of-center political formation that contains elements of nostalgia. Until recently he was primarily known as a translator and scholar steeped in the work of European leftist titans like Alain Badiou, Georges Bataille and Antonio Negri. But with this book he stakes a claim as a major voice in the 21st-century renovation of Marxism, especially alert to the ways that the collision of racism, antisemitism and corporate capitalism have fueled a global mood of crisis and opened the door for a “late fascist” renaissance.
Toscano’s entire book can be read as a taxonomy of fascism, but he comes closest to a working definition in his discussion of German philosopher Ernst Bloch’s “Heritage of Our Times,” a “protean, fascinating and unsettling work” first published in 1935 but not available in English until 1991, which seems startlingly germane to the contemporary moment. Writing near the beginning of the Nazi regime, Bloch understood fascism as a “perverted utopian promise,” in Toscano’s phrase, with a strange relationship to time and history. That promise appeals most strongly to social groups who find themselves “somehow out of sync with the rationalizing present of capitalism,” offering them a fraudulent reactivation of “unfulfilled pasts and unrealized presents.”
That strikes me as an almost perfect description of Trump’s most loyal supporters: As reams of social-science research have confirmed, they are not necessarily poor or unemployed or economically struggling in any objective sense — but they clearly perceive themselves as “out of sync” with the dominant social order, and feel enraged or cheated out of something they cannot define but believe they deserve.
The problem for leftist opponents of fascism, as Bloch sees it (and as Toscano seems to agree), is that fascist ideology is not purely or entirely deceptive; it also contains fragments of “an old and romantic antagonism to capitalism, derived from deprivations in contemporary life, with a longing for a vague ‘other.’” To put that in more familiar terms, fascism is driven by mythic yearning — whether for an imaginary premodern “Aryan” folk culture or for America’s ahistorical lost greatness — and the rationalist counternarratives about economic progress or class conflict variously put forward by socialism and liberalism have a tough time competing with that.
There is an ironic contradiction within the MAGA version of fascist mythology, however, which few mainstream commentators have noticed. As Toscano writes, Trump’s movement is conspicuously driven by nostalgia for America’s postwar affluence, for “the ‘Fordist’ heyday of Big Capital and Big Labor (generally coded as male and white) … for a racialized and gendered image of the socially recognized patriotic industrial worker.” Yet that era of rising if unequal prosperity was fueled by progressive taxation, widespread union membership and an unprecedented explosion of government spending and social welfare programs, all of which are not just anathema to the MAGA creed but unimaginable under current political conditions. The Trumpian false utopia promises the benefits of social democracy, in other words, without compelling the ruling class to pay for them.
Bloch’s book is only one of the numerous little-known or underappreciated works that Toscano draws upon, although usual suspects like Hannah Arendt, Antonio Gramsci and Theodor Adorno certainly appear as well. He offers a powerful re-reading of 1970s work by Black radicals Angela Davis and George Jackson, arguing that they offer a prophetic understanding of fascism as a “differential” process, in which some groups effectively live in a police state while others experience a reasonably functional democracy. In a later chapter, Toscano resurrects another ‘70s radical, the Italian literary critic Furio Jesi, whose extraordinary insights into the “religion and mythology of death” in right-wing culture were entirely new to me.
Toscano’s understanding of fascism as a kind of mythic current — both in the liquid and the electrical sense — that runs below the surface of postwar society but is never entirely absent, leads to one of his most compelling and, no doubt, most controversial points: It is a comforting but dangerous delusion, he argues, to view liberal democracy and fascism as polar opposites, or to assume that we know where one stops and the other begins.
He attacks this question in a number of ways throughout the book, beginning with the observation that “our knee-jerk identification of fascism with a monolithic, bureaucratic state and its opposition to liberalism in all its forms” is misguided. Contrary to Arendt’s oft-quoted assertion that totalitarianism “aims at abolishing freedom, even at eliminating human spontaneity in general,” Toscano offers ample evidence that both German and Italian fascism defined themselves as forces of liberation, offering a project of “racial imperialism” based on a masculine-identified notion of freedom drawn from all those vague myths about the past and linked to the “authoritarian rebel” personality described by Erich Fromm, “who, on the basis of their inner strength and integrity, fight those forces that block their freedom and independence.”
It’s impossible to read that quotation without recognizing an early version of the MAGA conception of “liberty from so-called ‘medical totalitarianism,’ for and of property ownership, or as a marker of civilizational difference from migrants and their religions,” as Toscano puts it. When Italian fascism first came to power just over a century ago, he writes, it was not as a “totalitarian” fusion of political and economic forces but “as a particularly virulent strain of state-led anti-statism,” which is about as pithy a summary of the federal government during Trump’s (first) term as one could offer.
Toscano’s deeper point, although he doesn’t exactly put it this way, is that “democracy” and “fascism” exist on a continuum. They share the same fundamental conception of individual or “bourgeois” liberty, ultimately drawn from the likes of John Locke, Adam Smith and Edmund Burke (all of whom would no doubt be horrified by every aspect of 21st-century politics). It’s self-flattering nonsense to treat them as binary states of light and darkness, or to resort to idiotic metaphors about America’s sacred democracy teetering on the edge of a bottomless abyss.

I think many of us understand this on a basic level — I’ve written about it a couple of times myself — and feel more than a little squidgy about the relentless torrent of political and journalistic sermons urging us to embrace the last chance to save democracy from the red-hatted barbarians who will storm the gates if they can actually get off the sofa. (Which is exactly what we were told about the last election, not to mention the one before that, and also what we will be told about the next one.)
You don’t have to be an acknowledged Marxist like Toscano to look at the political reality created by Citizens United, the Federalist Society and the Electoral College (none of which can be blamed on Trump or his followers) and ask what democracy Joe Biden and his party claim to be defending. Fewer than one in five American voters live in a state likely to be contested in this year’s presidential election, and the widely dreaded rematch between Trump and Biden will probably be decided by the whims and grievances of 100,000 or so “swing voters” scattered across those states.
Furthermore, both Mussolini and Hitler first gained power through electoral victories, and only gradually subsumed the state apparatus to their purposes. Toscano points out that the Nazis never bothered to replace the constitution of the Weimar Republic, which theoretically remained in force right through 1945. That’s one of many occasions when he observes that the fascist reputation for ruthless efficiency and administrative competence is completely undeserved. (He also argues that the pop-culture presentation of Nazis as stylish, sophisticated and erotic is ludicrous projection.)
Donald Trump’s attempted coup of 2021, let’s remember, was scripted by lawyers who meant to contain it within the purported constitutional guardrails of democracy. In many respects they hoped to emulate the notorious Compromise of 1877, when a presidential election that was ultimately decided in Congress brought an end to Reconstruction, set democracy back by many decades and launched the Jim Crow era, in what could fairly be described as a capitulation to proto-fascist forces in the white South.
Whether the Capitol attack of Jan. 6 was part of that original script or was (more likely) an improvised response to its failure, that became the moment when it was acceptable for mainstream voices to label Trump’s movement as fascist. Toscano would argue that they were finally, and reluctantly, naming a tendency that was present in our politics long before Trump, and will be there long after he’s gone."

(WKRN) – Nearly 50 dogs have been taken to a rescue center in Gallatin after authorities found them confined to crates, exhibiting signs of chronic neglect, and living amongst animals who had frozen to death.
On Sunday, Jan. 14, law enforcement in Casey County, Kentucky reached out to Animal Rescue Corps (ARC) – a national animal protection nonprofit – to assist in the rescue of 44 large dogs who were found living in deplorable conditions.
Authorities said the rescue, named “Operation Frozen Sorrows,” occurred at a home in Liberty, Kentucky that claimed to be a self-described rescue.
8 dogs seized from Erin home
Responders said the deplorable conditions were discovered after the tenant was unexpectedly hospitalized.
Upon arrival at the property, rescuers found 44 dogs inside and outside the home. Several were running loose while others were confined to crates, said the ARC.
In addition to the discovery, three deceased dogs were also located on the property. According to the ARC, two of the dogs had frozen to death.
Belgian Malinois, Great Danes, St. Bernards, German Shepherds, pit bulls, border collies, and cattledogs were just a few of the breeds rescued.
MACC responds to hundreds of calls during winter storm
The ARC said most dogs showed signs of chronic neglect and had many health issues.
“Many of the dogs exhibit signs of obvious and chronic neglect including eye injuries, fur loss, internal and external parasites, anemia, gastrointestinal issues, bite wounds, and matting,” stated the ARC. “Some of the dogs are emaciated and the majority of the dogs are underweight.”
Before becoming hospitalized, the tenant was allegedly running a self-described rescue out of the home called “Everything’s Going to be Alright Rescue & Rehabilitation.”
“The alleged rescue operated by the tenant stands as a stark reminder that good intentions must be backed by responsible actions. The suffering of these dogs underscores the ethical responsibility that comes with operating an animal rescue; neglect has no place in the realm of animal rescue and sheltering. This is a very sad situation and a tremendous amount of suffering has ended.” said ARC Executive Director, Tim Woodward. “I’m glad we could assist.”

Each dog rescued in “Operation Frozen Sorrows” was taken to ARC’s rescue center in Gallatin.

“But whether it’s 1960, the year 2000, 2016, there was concern raised by the Hillary Clinton campaign. In 2020.. This is something, as a country, that we’ve got to work hard to face..and I think we’re slowly —” Burgum continued.
Raddatz interjected, pointing out Burgum had said the election wasn’t stolen, yet was supporting a candidate who repeatedly asserted it was.
“Well, I – I know that we’ve got – certainly we’ve got irregularities. When we went through COVID, and we had these mail-out ballots, that creates all kinds of opportunities for mischief,” Burgum responded. “When you’re bailing out more ballots to a – in a state than there are registered voters, you know, I think we have… that’s a problem.
Raddatz shot back and asked, “Do you think the election was stolen now? Now when you look back.”
Burgum said he was “not saying that,” but rather the country needs to “look forward,” and ensure Americans’ confidence in elections.
“We know that the social media companies and the media companies have admitted that they suppressed stories leading into the – the November 2020 election, that they’ve admitted to all that. And so Americans lack confidence in this, and that’s why – that’s why we’ve got to make sure going forward that we have confidence,” Burgum continued.
Burgum endorsed Trump for president last week after dropping out of the presidential race last month. He has touted Trump for his policies on the economy, border, and energy, arguing the former president “can make a difference.”
The conversation between Burgum and Raddatz then shifted to Trump’s recent barrage of attacks on Haley.
Trump has come under fire for sharing a conspiracy theory on social media that Haley was ineligible to run for president and referred to her birth name, Nimrata. The former South Carolina governor, whose parents are from India, has noted she was born in Bamberg, S.C., and eligible for the White House.
Asked by Raddatz why Trump is doing this, Burgum said, “Well, I just…all I know is that I believe this election, the primary election is going to be over after Tuesday. President Trump is leading in all 50 states. We’ll be talking… tonight. I think that’s the time –”
Raddatz interrupted, “No, please answer the question, sir. Answer the question about why you think Donald Trump is doing that.”
Burgum said he thinks “it’s politics,” and pointed to attacks against Trump from the Biden campaign.
“He [Joe Biden] didn’t talk about the open border, where we’ve got a massive invasion and now we’ve had more fentanyl deaths than four Vietnams in our country under Joe Biden the last three years. No, he talked about attacking his opponent. That’s politics around the world and it’s politics in America,” Burgum said.
Raddatz then asked if Burgum believes this is the “kind of politics” Trump is using, to which Burgum referenced the “vicious things” previous White House hopefuls said about President Biden.
“This is all in the norm inside of – for north – for politics in our country. But once we agree as parties, we get behind candidates. The Democrats got behind Biden in 2020,” Burgum said. “I’m confident Republicans are going to get behind President Trump because they’re concerned about the direction that this – the world – the world is going and the direction the United States is going.”
Trump, Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis will go head-to-head in New Hampshire this week as polling shows Trump with a lead over both the candidates. A polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ shows Trump with a 11.1 point lead over Haley in the Granite State, while DeSantis trails far behind.
Trump easily won in Iowa last week, with DeSantis trailing behind him by nearly 30 points and Haley close behind.

Take a look,"Olivia Evans, Cincinnati Enquirer","January 22, 2024 at 7:24 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/10-biggest-manufacturing-businesses-kentucky-222403589.html,"When thinking of Kentucky, bourbon, horses and bluegrass are sure to come to mind, but the commonwealth is also a major player in the manufacturing sector across the country.
""Manufacturing is a vital part of our state’s record economic success, and the industry is a significant part of our plans for continued growth statewide,"" said Jeff Noel, secretary for the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development.
View this post on Instagram
A post shared by Kentucky Economic Development (@cedkygov)
Across the state, some 259,000 workers are employed in the manufacturing sector at some 6,000 facilities including at global brands like Ford Motor Co., GE Appliances, and Tyson Foods Inc. This means roughly 13% of workers in the state are employed in the manufacturing sector, besting the national count by more than 4%.
The greater Louisville area alone ""is home to 2,400 manufacturing companies employing more than 82,500 in the areas of automotive, food and beverage, plastics, appliances, and electrical components,"" according to Greater Louisville Inc., the metro chamber of commerce's website.
On top of providing lots of jobs for Kentuckians, the manufacturing industry helped contribute more than $45 billion to the state's gross domestic product, the monetary measure of all goods and services produced in this sector, according to Noel. Kentucky-made products can be found around the world, with $34.4 billion in products having been exported outside the U.S. in 2022. Workers in manufacturing also stand to make an average of $71,000 annually, according to data from JobsEQ that Noel shared.
Since 2020, the Beshear administration has emphasized supporting manufacturing, Noel said, creating $24 billion in new investments and 32,100 full-time jobs.
""A robust manufacturing sector means great jobs for Kentucky families in every corner of the state,"" said Noel. ""Success in manufacturing means growth in numerous other areas as well. Distribution and logistics, automotive, metals, food & beverage, and so on. All of these industries are directly connected to – or thriving thanks to – our incredible manufacturing growth.""
One advantage lending to Kentucky being an ideal place for manufacturing-related businesses is its central geographic location, putting each company within 600 miles of roughly two-thirds of the U.S. population. Kentucky is also home to two major shipping and logistics facilities, UPS Worldport in Louisville and DHL Express in Northern Kentucky, allowing companies ease in getting products from assembly lines to customers.
""Kentucky is perfectly located and has the distribution presence needed to serve the supply chain of numerous key industries in the Eastern United States,"" Noel said. ""And we have leadership in Gov. Andy Beshear and the legislature that understand the importance of manufacturing to our state and want to see it become an even greater strength in the years ahead.""

The conviction stems from charges related to the distribution of 50 grams or more of actual methamphetamine and the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
>>> STREAM ACTION NEWS JAX LIVE <<<
Dixon entered a guilty plea on October 4, 2023.
According to court documents, the incident took place on January 6, 2023, when Dixon engaged in the sale of methamphetamine to a confidential informant outside a hotel off Lane Avenue in Jacksonville. Alongside the narcotics transaction, Dixon also sold two 20-gauge shotguns.
As a convicted felon, Dixon is legally prohibited from possessing firearms or ammunition under federal law. Notably, Dixon was on probation at the time, following a previous conviction in Duval County for the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The total amount of pure methamphetamine involved in the case was at least 146 grams.
The investigation into this case was conducted jointly by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. The prosecution was led by Assistant United States Attorney John Cannizzaro.
This case is part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a comprehensive program aimed at reducing violent crime and gun violence by fostering collaboration among law enforcement at all levels and the communities they serve.
The strategy, launched by the Department on May 26, 2021, focuses on building trust in communities, supporting violence prevention through community-based organizations, setting strategic enforcement priorities, and measuring outcomes.

Brief, TIME’s politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.
By the time Ron DeSantis pulled up his anchor from Iowa on Jan. 15, it was pretty clear to anyone watching that the Florida Governor was likely enjoying the high-water mark of his bid for the White House. Sure, he came in second place in the lead-off caucuses. But he had done so with the backing of the state’s popular Governor, and boasted the top money haul of anyone running for the GOP nomination. Ultimately, though, DeSantis trailed former President Donald Trump by 30 points despite heavy spending: the DeSantis campaign spent about $3 million on ads and his super PAC dumped $35 million, essentially burning about $1,500 per eventual supporter in the state.
This was, as they say, a whole lot of money set on fire without a lot to show in the ash.
Put simply: there weren’t a whole lot of reasons for DeSantis to summon optimism as he wrapped his work in Iowa, a legitimate operation that saw him visit every one of the state’s 99 counties and win not one of them.
So, on Sunday, DeSantis bowed to the reality of the 2024 dynamic and suspended his campaign, effectively ceding the MAGA lane to its creator. His exit puts Trump one leg closer to a third nomination in eight years and perhaps within striking distance of another four years in the White House.
""I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources when we don't have a clear path to victory,"" DeSantis said in a video posted on social media, two days before the New Hampshire primary in which polling showed he was likely to come in a distant third. ""Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.""
As he left the trail, DeSantis seemed resigned to falling in line for the good of the Republican Party. “Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,"" DeSantis said. ""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge.""
To say that DeSantis’ campaign is one of the worst in history is a stunning statement, but one that isn’t easily proven false. His launch via a glitchy Twitter rally—replete with server meltdowns, hard-right rhetoric, dodgy facts, and a cameo from Elon Musk himself—proved that the executive competence aura around DeSantis might be more hallucination than halo. Once officially a candidate, DeSantis proved an awkward fit for the hagiography that preceded him. Yes, DeSantis crushed his re-election bid months earlier, but what worked in Destin didn’t always translate to Des Moines.
The campaign itself oozed inauthenticity, and it was evident at every put-your-finger-in-the-air moment. DeSantis went to war on fronts as varied as inclusive corporate policies, diversity-focused coursework, college free speech, bathrooms and locker rooms, even Mickey Mouse’s self-governance at the Magic Kingdom. Availing himself as the quartermaster of the culture wars seemed like a good choice—until it wasn’t.
The Trump, But Less Bad pitch went only so far. They never crafted him as Trump, But Better. The candidate being sold didn’t match the hype, and voters knew it instantly. Money woes, staff infighting, strategy brawls, even wardrobe choices befell DeSantis’ orbit. While counting on Trump’s supporters to transfer their loyalty to him, DeSantis was careful not to lay too tough a case at his former ally’s feet. Somehow, he expected defections to happen automatically without any effort at persuasion. DeSantis understood Trump’s ability to turn on former friends without any compunction. DeSantis knew loyalty was not in Trump’s toolbox, so he didn’t count on lingering familiarity for any protection.
Ultimately, DeSantis couldn’t make the case why MAGA-styled Republicans would line up behind his facsimile when the original article was just as viable—at least for now. Polls showed an utter indifference to Trump’s looming legal challenges among Republicans, and Trump is not incorrect when he says every case and lawsuit brought against him only hardens his supporters’ resolve to have his back. From that reality, DeSantis never was able to ding Trump for realities that would have disqualified other candidates, those who are beholden to the rules of political gravity.
Every Republican dream candidate ultimately faces this sort of crash. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was supposed to have been a political behemoth who won three statewide elections in four years. No one was tougher than Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty had the policy knowhow and the national buzz to run a technocratic machine. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush had the organization and the gold-plated name to deliver him the nomination. All flamed out. Bigly.
Since the Tea Party revolution of 2010, the Republican Party is looking for a nihilistic streak that found its personification in Trump. Everyone else trying to win under the old rules has been turned back and exiled. The candidates didn’t figure it out until it was too late in 2016. Ultimately, the fight came too late this cycle and with too little urgency behind it.
Which is why, the race now finds itself down to a two-person grudge match: Trump versus Nikki Haley, his one-time top diplomat to the United Nations. Trump is running as the original MAGA nihilist while Haley is pitching herself as an alternative to burning-it-all-down indulgence. It’s not much of a glamorous dichotomy, but it’s what Republicans are left with.

5QITWR2066_GGX104YA2TA0QGD,Ugandan internet propaganda network exposed by the BBC,Marco Silva - BBC Verify,"January 21, 2024 at 11:22 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ugandan-internet-propaganda-network-exposed-022217076.html,"A BBC investigation has uncovered a network of fake social media accounts in Uganda. Under false identities, they spread pro-government messaging and target critics with threats. But who are the people behind it?
It is not every day that you get to take a selfie with the long-serving President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni. When the opportunity arose, Dr Jamechia Hoyle went for it.
She is a senior consultant in the United States, focused on global health security. Back in October 2017, she had travelled to the Ugandan capital, Kampala, to attend an international conference.
Mr Museveni was there to welcome his foreign guests.
Making her way through the crowds, Dr Hoyle approached him, smartphone in hand. ""He was really happy to engage with us and take the picture,"" she recalls.
Seeing a broad-smiling Dr Hoyle and the president, surrounded by smiling faces trying to get in the shot, photographers couldn't resist - and they too captured that image.
Four years later, this exact photo would be used to create a fake social media account aimed at spreading state propaganda and targeting government critics.
Dr Hoyle only recently found out about it, after the BBC got in touch with her.
""Seeing my own picture and then understanding the context of some of the things that were shared... I couldn't believe it,"" she says. ""I was truly taken aback.""
Listen to BBC Trending: Crude fakes in Uganda on BBC Sounds.
The fake account using Dr Hoyle's photo was created on X, then called Twitter, in October 2021.
From early on, it appeared to have no interests outside Ugandan politics, regularly posting in praise of the Ugandan government and its policies.
Much harsher words - including occasional threats - were directed at opposition supporters and government critics.
""We know you support terrorist activities"", the account posted without presenting any evidence, in response to a tweet from opposition leader Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi.
""You will die"", read a separate tweet directed at Hillary Innocent Taylor Seguya, a Ugandan climate activist based in the US and a member of Mr Wine's party, the National Unity Platform.
On social media, Mr Seguya has become known for his criticism of one of Uganda's flagship projects: the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP).
When finished, the $3.5bn (£2.7bn) pipeline will connect Uganda's oil fields to Tanzania's port of Tanga, along a 1,445km (898 mile) route.
What you need to know about EACOP
Supporters of the project say it will create thousands of jobs and generate millions in oil revenue.
But critics have argued that EACOP could prove disruptive for local communities, while having a significant impact on the environment.
""Trolls keep coming for me on a daily basis,"" he says. ""They keep labelling me as the enemy of progress in Uganda and Africa. Sometimes they call me a 'US-backed puppet' or a sell-out.""
The account belonging to ""fake Jamechia"" was just one of dozens attacking, harassing, and at times threatening Mr Seguya.
But, on closer inspection, the profiles all bore striking similarities to each other.
They all claimed to be Ugandan citizens - often women - whose accounts appeared to have the sole purpose of posting praise for the president and pushing back against critics.
The Ugandan Media Centre, which handles public communications on behalf of the government, did not respond to our requests for comment.
By analysing those accounts' behaviour, BBC Verify was able to map out a network of nearly 200 fake social media accounts operating on X and on Facebook (even though the latter has been blocked in Uganda since 2021).
The vast majority of these accounts used stolen images as profile pictures - often social media photos of models, influencers, and actresses from across the world. But none of the usernames used by them appeared to be linked to real individuals in Uganda or Tanzania.
These accounts often posted the same content within minutes of each other. By looking at the dates when they were created, we also found that many had been set up on the very same day.
This suggests that, while they may look like separate accounts, they have been working together.
It is unclear how successful this network may have been in actually shifting people's views of the government, as very few of its posts earned large numbers of likes, comments, or shares.
For all its sophistication, could this network be failing to fulfil its mission then? Not quite, experts say.
""[Their] goal can be to push the message out there - whether or not people engage with it is kind of irrelevant, as long as people have seen it,"" says Tessa Knight, a research associate for the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab who investigates disinformation.
Contacted by the BBC, Meta removed most of the Facebook accounts we identified.
Meta believes that individuals linked to the Government Citizen Interaction Centre (GCIC) - a Ugandan government agency - may have been running several of the accounts it removed.
The company did not share the evidence it said it held to back this assertion. And, as a result, the BBC has not been able to independently verify it.
But, in a statement, the GCIC denied this allegation, saying that agency accounts ""are not operating on Facebook"".
And yet, it is not the first time the agency has been accused of running what Meta describes as ""influence operations"": in 2021, Facebook's parent company took action against hundreds of accounts it said were linked to the GCIC.
Uganda social media ban raises questions over regulation in Africa
X did not reply to our requests for comment and the platform took no action against any of the accounts identified by the BBC's investigation.
Asked whether it recognised any of the accounts on X, the GCIC said: ""we recognise the accounts of our staff whose terms of reference include disseminating factual information about government programmes. We are only aware and responsible for accounts of our staff meant for work.""
The GCIC did not respond to follow-up questions attempting to clarify whether the accounts identified were indeed run by state employees.
Mr Seguya says he is ""not surprised"" by the existence of this network, but he urges whoever is behind it to consider the human cost of their campaign against critics.
""They may not know the negative impacts they are creating on someone's mental health by sending out such threats to people like me and different activists.
""Let them not silence dissent. Dissent is democracy."""

Directed and written by Rose Glass and Weronika Tofilska, and stars Kristen Stewart, Katy O’Brian, Ed Harris, Dave Franco, Jena Malone and Anna Baryshinkov. The film explores the destructive nature of relationships, marked by strong performances and a visually arresting narrative.
Lou (Stewart) meets Jackie (O’Brian) at the gym her father owns and is instantly smitten. Jackie is charming, looks great, and isn’t afraid to confront a man that gets in her space. This is something Lou witnesses first-hand, as Jackie whacks one of the gym patrons in the face when he gets a little too friendly. After their sex-filled rendezvous (yes, they moved that fast), Lou discovers her new girlfriend works at her father Lou Sr.’s (Harris) gun range.

‘Love Lies Bleeding’: Kristen Stewart Lesbian Bodybuilding Crime Romance Wakes Up Sleepy Sundance At Saturday Night Premiere
'Suncoast' Review: Nico Parker, Laura Linney, Woody Harrelson In Heartfelt Semi-Autobiographical Story Colliding With Real Life Events - Sundance Film Festival
Needing a place to stay, Jackie asks if she could stay with Lou until she makes enough money to move on to a bodybuilding competition in Las Vegas. The aspiring body builder discovers her new lover’s family is a broken one. Lou Sr. is the town’s most feared man, while Lou’s brother-in-law, JJ (Franco), and Lou’s sister Beth (Malone) have a marriage so volatile that it becomes the film’s reasoning for why all hell breaks loose.
Filmed amidst the quintessential landscapes of New Mexico, a location that epitomizes the essence of Americana, the film employs the unseen to create an atmosphere rich in suspense. The story offers only fleeting insights into Lou’s history, presenting these revelations as breadcrumbs that infuse the narrative with intrigue and mystery.
This approach is characteristic of Glass’ directorial style, which weaves elements of sporadic horror, creating a sense of unpredictability. The culmination of this technique is a moment of absolute carnage, captured in a rare, stationary shot that contrasts with the film’s otherwise dynamic visual tempo.
When comparing Love Lies Bleeding to Saint Maud, there are similar themes explored here. Jackie is very much like Maud—a woman who lives on the fringes of society, and, is an unreliable narrator obsessed with achieving something far out of reach. Both narratives delve into the theme of extreme devotion, examining how it can consume an individual and propel them towards something undeniably harmful.
However, a key distinction in Love Lies Bleeding is the portrayal of every character as unreliable and unhinged, differing from the more focused perspective in Saint Maud.
With a gritty and rustic aesthetic reminiscent of a neo-western, the film also embraces an ’80s vibe akin to Paul Nicholas’ Chained Heat, yet it steers clear of exploitation. The way the camera captures Jackie is striking, focusing on the stages of her physical transformation and molding this into a visual arc that showcases Jackie’s beauty, her body horror and how she grows into her higher-self.
The directors employ a unique lens to showcase Jackie’s muscular development, offering an intimate and detailed view rarely seen for actresses in Hollywood films. This approach feels like a breath of fresh air, as the director revels in portraying a woman’s strength and physicality in a way that is bold and innovative.
RELATED: Kristen Stewart Says Rose Glass Film ‘Love Lies Bleeding’ Has “A Unique Sexual Fingerprint” – Sundance Studio
Stewart and O’Brian are electric as the toxic, uhaul duo of star-crossed psychos in love. Stewart, having tackled a diverse array of roles, demonstrates her expansive range, leaving no doubt about her acting ability. O’Brian shines as an emerging talent, an actress who embraces and confidently portrays her full authentic self on screen.
In Love Lies Bleeding, Glass takes a snapshot of America. Saturated with guns, marked by bloodshed and characterized by lawlessness. However, when you add in some sexy, campy queers sprinkled in for razzle dazzle, you get a film like this full of thrills and captivating energy.

5WMX509J7G_P4PCOG1MP8D5ZED,Sununu: ‘Everybody should be concerned’ with Trump’s presidential immunity argument,Miranda Nazzaro,"January 22, 2024 at 2:07 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/sununu-everybody-concerned-trump-presidential-170751949.html,"New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) on Sunday expressed his opposition of former President Trump’s argument that a president should have total immunity, saying, “everybody should be concerned” with the former president’s view.
Asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” if he agrees a president should have total immunity, “even for things that cross the line,” Sununu said, “Of course not.”
Sununu was played a clip of Trump’s comments over the weekend at a rally in New Hampshire, where he argued a president should be allowed immunity so “that [the] president can act and do what he feels and what his group of advisors feel is the absolute right thing.”
“The amazing thing about that clip is he was dead serious. He wasn’t even making one of his ridiculous jokes. He was dead serious about that,” Sununu reacted. “And that should give everybody — I don’t care what political party you’re from, whether you’re an extreme conservative or a socialist liberal — everybody should be concerned with that type of mentality going into the White House.”
Sununu has endorsed Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley for president, but earlier this month, he said he would support the eventual nominee, even if it is Trump as a hypothetical convicted felon.
NBC anchor Kristen Welker pointed to Sununu’s pledge of support for the eventual nominee and asked the governor how he could back Trump given his disagreement with the former president’s argument.
“Look, at the end of the day, I think most Republicans are going to get behind the Republican nominee,” Sununu responded. “I’m hoping that it’s obviously Nikki Haley. This is how bad Joe Biden is. Six months ago Trump couldn’t beat Biden. This is how bad Joe Biden is.”
Trump and his legal team have repeatedly argued his actions leading up to and surrounding the Jan. 6 insurrection are protected by presidential immunity. The former president is facing four felony counts in a federal election subversion case over allegations he was involved in a conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and stood at the center of a campaign to block the certification of votes for President Biden on Jan. 6, 2021.
Trump’s legal team has asked a D.C. appeals court to toss the case on the grounds of presidential immunity. Special counsel Jack Smith asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the argument to keep the trial on track to begin in March, but the high court ruled the case should first be considered by the D.C. appeals court.
The appeals court heard the arguments earlier this month and seemed poised to reject the former president’s argument.
Welker pressed Sununu again on how he could support a candidate whom he has said he believed contributed to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.
Sununu repeated an argument he’s used in recent weeks, claiming “no one’s really thinking about the general election,” and instead pushed voters to ensure Trump isn’t elected as the GOP nominee.
“We’re here in New Hampshire in the first nation primary,” he said, adding later that if you want to beat Trump, it “has to happen at the ballot box.”
“Don’t sit on your couch, don’t wait for it to happen. Don’t wait for some external factor or court case to take over. You have to get out and vote, whether you’re undeclared, [or] Republican.”
All eyes are on Sununu’s New Hampshire, which will hold its primary this Tuesday. A polling index maintained by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ shows Trump with a 11.1 point lead over Haley in the Granite State, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails far behind.

It said there had been 178 deaths in the last 24 hours, making it one of the deadliest days in the war so far.
As fighting continued, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rejected creating a Palestinian state.
The White House has said the US and Israel ""clearly see things differently"" when it comes to a two-state solution.
Israel began its offensive following the 7 October attack in which Hamas fighters killed 1,300 people in southern Israel and took more than 240 hostage.
In its first public account of the October assault, published on Sunday, Hamas described it as a ""necessary step"" against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.
Israel's air and ground operation is currently focusing on southern Gaza, where the military are convinced top Hamas commanders are holed up in, or beneath, the city of Khan Younis.
That is where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had discovered another tunnel, some 830m (2,700ft) long and containing booby-traps and blast doors.
The IDF footage showed what appeared to be a tunnel with mattresses and cells inside - it is where Israel believes around 20 Israeli hostages, including children, were held at various points. None were found when the tunnel was discovered, though.
Israeli soldiers have also faced renewed attacks in the north of the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is said to have seized an opening around the town of Jabalia as Israel moved troops and tanks south.
More than three months since the conflict erupted, Israel - whose army far outstrips Hamas's capabilities - is still facing significant resistance across Gaza.
US intelligence agencies reportedly estimate that the Israeli military has killed 20-30% of Hamas fighters, which falls far short of Mr Netanyahu's stated aim of ""completely destroying"" the armed group.
The classified report is also said to have found that Hamas still has enough munitions to continue striking Israel and Israeli forces for months, raising the spectre of a prolonged war in which Israel could get bogged down.
How the dead are counted in Gaza
What Gaza's death toll says about the war
'The unstoppable wars have destroyed our lives'
The apparent slow progress, the fact no top Hamas commander has yet been captured or killed, and the collective trauma over the 130 or so Israeli hostages still missing, is prompting growing anti-government anger in Israel.
Protests are continuing by relatives of those still held by Hamas, calling for Mr Netanyahu to prioritise their release over the potentially impossible aim of destroying Hamas. And a still relatively small anti-war movement is also demonstrating, horrified by the damage wrought on Gaza - one of the most intense and destructive military campaigns in recent history.
Most Israelis have rallied around their flag - but not around their prime minister, who, according to a recent poll, only 15% of the public believe should stay in office once the war ends.
How it does end is the subject of growing disagreement between Mr Netanyahu and Israel's western allies. After speaking to US President Joe Biden for the first time in almost a month, the Israeli prime minister reiterated his rejection of a future Palestinian state.
In a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said Israel must retain ""security control over the entire area west of [River] Jordan"", which also encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank territory.
Mr Netanyahu has been fiercely opposed to a Palestinian state throughout his political career. But by repeatedly asserting it now, an increasingly unpopular prime minister appears to be doubling down on a view that he feels chimes with the majority opinion in a nation too horrified by the attacks to countenance an independent Palestinian state.

'I’m not ready to lose hope': The hostages still in Gaza
His apparent fight for political survival is clashing with exasperated Israeli allies, who hope that the current bloodshed could force both sides into meaningful diplomacy over a sustainable two-state solution.
UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC earlier that Mr Netanyahu's stance was ""disappointing"". The White House has said the US and Israel ""clearly see things differently"".
Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, went further, calling the refusal to accept a Palestinian state ""completely unacceptable"". He added it ""would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security""."

Ron DeSantis dropped out of the 2024 Republican presidential race and endorsed former President Trump two days before the New Hampshire primary.
The Florida governor announced his decision to suspend his campaign in a social media video on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday afternoon.
""If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it,"" DeSantis said in the video. ""But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory.""
""Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,"" said DeSantis, who was a distant third in the single digits in the latest polls in New Hampshire.
THIS 2024 GOP CANDIDATE WAS TARGETED BY WAY MORE ATTACK ADS THAN ANY OTHER HEADING INTO THE PRIMARY ELECTIONS
DeSantis highlighted that he's had ""disagreements"" with Trump but believes that the former president is a better leader than Biden.

""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis continued. ""They watched his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him.""
DeSantis noted that ""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge.""
CHECK OUT THE LATEST POLL NUMBERS IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY
Trump, who along with his allies spent months fiercely attacking DeSantis, told Fox News Digital's Brooke Singman that he was ""very honored to have his endorsement.""
""I look forward to working together with him to beat Joe Biden, who is the worst and most corrupt president in the history of our country,"" Trump said.
And Trump, who for months had used the derogatory nickname ""Ron DeSanctimonious"" on the campaign trail, said he wouldn't be using that nickname going forward.
""No, that name has been officially retired,"" Trump told Fox News Digital.
The Florida governor also took a chance to criticize former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is a former two-term South Carolina governor and the other remaining major contender for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.
TRUMP RUNNING MATE SPECULATION SOARS AS FORMER PRESIDENT CONSOLIDATES SUPPORT
DeSantis said he endorsed Trump ""because we can't go back to the old Republican Guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""
""The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology are over,"" he added.
Haley, speaking at a campaign stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, told the crowd, ""I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race. He’s been a good governor. And we wish him well. Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.""
And in a statement, Haley noted that ""so far, only one state has voted. Half of its votes went to Donald Trump, and half did not. We’re not a country of coronations. Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road. New Hampshire voters will have their say on Tuesday. When I’m president, I will do everything in my power to show them they made the right decision.""
A signal that the end was near came on Saturday night when DeSantis canceled two major Sunday talk show appearances. His campaign said at the time that the interviews were canceled to allow the governor to travel back to New Hampshire from South Carolina, where he was stumping on Saturday.
The DeSantis video was posted on Sunday afternoon, a couple of hours before the governor was scheduled to hold a campaign event in Manchester, New Hampshire. That stop was canceled and there was no word on whether DeSantis would fly to New Hampshire to join Trump ahead of Tuesday's primary.
DeSantis, 45, finished in second place in last week's Iowa caucuses with 20.1% of the vote, but he only narrowly defeated Haley and came in 30 points behind Trump, who achieved a record-breaking and commanding victory in the low-turnout Hawkeye State contest.
DeSantis' departure from the race comes after his campaign went ""all in"" on Iowa, betting that a strong ground game, events, visits to all 99 counties and endorsements from top Iowa Republicans would propel him to a strong showing leading into elections in New Hampshire and South Carolina.
But his distant second-place finish, while it slightly exceeded expectations in the final polls, was seen as a major disappointment, considering all the time and resources he spent in Iowa.
The Democratic National Committee, taking aim at the Florida governor, charged that ""Ron DeSantis pinned his entire campaign’s hopes on the same extreme MAGA agenda that both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are still running on, and now he is the latest member of the GOP to fall in line behind the original MAGA brand.""
DeSantis, who was convincingly re-elected to a second term as Florida governor 14 months ago, was once the clear alternative to Trump in the Republican White House race. Multiple polls showed DeSantis leading Trump early last year before he entered the race, but he faltered out of the gate with a glitch-riddled social media campaign announcement.
The governor was backed by the big-spending aligned super PAC Never Back Down. However, after a series of campaign setbacks over the summer and autumn, and after getting hammered by constant attacks and negative ads from Trump and his allies, DeSantis saw his support in the polls erode.
Dan Eberhart, a top DeSantis donor, bundler and surrogate, told Fox News Digital that ""Ron DeSantis ran into a bump and the bump was named Trump.""
""This wasn’t about money. The campaign insists they had enough money to get to Super Tuesday. I think this was about data and polling and Gov. DeSantis being realistic about whether or not Trump was beatable,"" Eberhart said.
And he added that ""more importantly, I think this was about 2028, and DeSantis doesn’t want [a] 5 to 8% showing in New Hampshire on his record. Let’s face it, he’s the Republican voters' de facto second choice, and he’s Trump voters’ second choice, and so he’s decided to get out and govern Florida.""

MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. The New Hampshire primary is just two days away. Can anyone stop the Trump steamroll towards the Republican nomination? We go now to former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, who is hoping to be the one to stop him. She's on the campaign trail in Derry, New Hampshire. Good morning to you.
NIKKI HALEY: Good morning.
MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, our CBS polling shows that you are the Republican candidate with the best chance at beating Joe Biden in a head-to-head race. And yet, Donald Trump is the party's frontrunner. Why do you think, Ambassador, that the Republican establishment isn't doing more to help you?
NIKKI HALEY: Well, I mean, this is what primaries are all about. This is about the fact that, you know, people get to decide which way they want to go forward. What I have said, as you can either pick more of the same, or you can go forward with the new generational leader. More of the same is, you know, the fact that you've got 70% of Americans don't want to see a Trump-Biden rematch. More of the same as the fact that both of these presidents put us trillions of dollars in debt. And our kids are never going to forgive us for it. More of the same is the fact that we're gonna have two presidential candidates in their 80s. That's not what our kids want. That's not what we should want. You know, more of the same is the fact that we can't be a country in disarray and have a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. We won't survive it. We've got to get a new generational leader. I'm making my case to the people of New Hampshire. New Hampshire sees it for what it is, they know that responsibility, and we're going to try and bring this home in two days.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well 26 Republican senators at this point and all of the House Republican leadership have lined up behind Donald Trump. Why? Are they afraid of him?
NIKKI HALEY: Not surprised at all. And I'll tell you why. You'll see a lot of the South Carolina legislature line up behind him too. And it's because I've never really taken care of elected officials. You know, I've forced South Carolina legislature, they had to show their votes on the record. I made them pass ethics reform. I vetoed half a billion dollars worth of their pet projects. You look at Congress, what have I done? I said I want term limits. I said that I don't think they should get paid if they don't give us a budget on time. I've talked about mental competency tests. I call out elected officials because I think they need to be accountable to the people. I call out Republicans and Democrats when they don't do the right thing. So it's not surprising that that set is going towards Trump because he's going to take care of them. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to take care of the taxpayers. I've always done that my entire career, and I'll keep on doing it.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you win in North Carolina- and excuse me- can you win in South Carolina?
NIKKI HALEY: I won twice as governor.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as you just laid out, the South Carolina establishment is lining up behind Donald Trump. I want to ask you about something--
NIKKI HALEY: -- I mean, I'll remind you I was a tea party governor at the time, so I didn't have the establishment when I ran for governor the first time. I ran against the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, and a very popular congressman and I still won. And so it's about being down on the ground with the people and I plan on doing that again.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Former President Trump on Friday, repeatedly and wrongly said that you were in charge of the January 6 security response at the Capitol, and he said your name four times. I want to play this for our viewers.
DONALD TRUMP: They never report the crowd on January 6, you know, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley. You know, they- did you know, they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything deleted and destroyed all of it. All of it. Because of lots of things like Nikki Haley, is in charge of security.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's unclear what he's talking about as being deleted. But you said yesterday, hearing this made you question Donald Trump's mental fitness. Is that the first time you questioned his mental fitness?
NIKKI HALEY: If you look, recently, there have been multiple things. I mean, he's claimed that Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II. I'm assuming he met World War three. He said that he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama. He says that I'm the one that kept security from Jan- from the Capitol on January 6. I was nowhere near the Capitol on January 6. But Margaret, you don't be surprised if you have someone that's 80 in office, their mental stability is going to continue to decline. That's just human nature. We know that. What I'm saying is, first of all, you're talking about somebody who's only going to be in office four years. Secondly, you're talking about someone who continues to- I mean, look, I don't know if he was confused. I don't know what happened. But it should be enough to send us a warning sign that if you look, Joe Biden, he's very different than he was two years ago. Are we really going to go into a situation where we have wars around the world, and we're trying to prevent war, and we're going to have someone who we can or can't be sure that they're going to get confused?It's a real issue. That's not being disrespectful. It's just a fact.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think Trump's voters care about that? And when you worked in his Cabinet, did you ever question his mental fitness?
NIKKI HALEY: When I worked in his Cabinet, I called him out if he was doing something wrong, I mean, I would show up, I pick up the phone and say ""you can't do this. Instead, you could do X, Y, or Z,"" you know, so I always told him what I thought was in the best interest of the country when I was in his Cabinet. But this is different. I mean, we're seeing he's just not at the same level he was at 2016. I think we're seeing some of that decline. But more than that, what I'll say is, focus on the fact that no matter what it is, chaos follows him. Rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him--
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Does he cause it?
NIKKI HALEY: -- and America's tired. In some cases, he causes it. In some cases, he doesn't. But regardless, he's like a magnet to it. And so what happens is that puts the rest of America in chaos, and people are tired, and they're worried. I mean, kids right now in their 20s, they don't know if they're ever going to be able to afford a home. They don't know how this debt is gonna get paid down. They don't know if they're gonna find a job. You see people living- 60% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. People talk about the economy that Donald Trump had us in, it was good, but he put us $8 trillion in debt in just four years. That's not what you do.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about an ad that you have released that includes video and testimony from the mother of Otto Warmbier, who was an American student from the University of Virginia, who was taken prisoner in North- North Korea and died, as you know, after the Trump administration did bring him home. Pundits say national security does not matter to voters. Why do you think this story is one you need to tell?
NIKKI HALEY: I think this really does show the contrast. So I worked with Cindy and Fred Warmbier. They're amazing people. And I will tell you as a parent, no parent wants to see their child returned to them the way they saw Otto returned. This was a happy, smart kid, he went to North Korea. And I mean, the thugs in North Korea tortured him and returned him back in a state that- that is unconscionable. And the difference is I told Fred and Cindy, speak up, get loud, make sure I will help you, let's partner. We're gonna call North Korea out. I passed the largest set of sanctions against them in a generation by pushing China and Russia to do it. But what did Trump do? Instead, he talked about love letters going back and forth to Kim Jong-Un Cindy would contact me she was so upset. And he went and said, ""Oh, but Kim said that he wasn't aware of any torture that happened to Otto."" All you had to do was look at Otto when he was returned back to his parents. But this goes back to a pattern. I mean, we saw this over and over again. It's not just that he congratulated China's President Xi, a dozen times after China gave us COVID. He congratulated the Chinese Communist Party on their 70th anniversary. We don't congratulate the Communist Chinese party. I remember at the United Nations, I had to sit him down and tell him to stop this bromance with Putin. I mean, you can't have someone who's trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us. Instead, you have to let them know what we expect of them. That's the difference. And when you've got wars all over the world now, and the instability that we had, our goal is to prevent war. And we can't do that by trying to buddy up with them.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about clarifying your position here, because you've spoken about the complexity of the abortion, abortion issue personally for you. And you've said there's no national consensus, so there won't be a federal law. But you've also said if there were one passed, if it were six weeks, it was 15 weeks, or it was restrictions after 20 weeks, which you signed when you were governor, that you'd be okay with that. When we spoke yesterday to Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, she said that you would sign a national abortion ban. Would you?
NIKKI HALEY: You know, it's so interesting, because this is a- you can't say that to the American people because all you're doing is putting fear and judgment in them. Yes, I'm unapologetically pro-life, but I don't judge anyone for being pro-choice. I've said I'm fine with a federal law. But the thing is, in order to get a federal law, you have to have a majority of the House, 60 senators and a signature of the President. Margaret, we haven't had 60 Republican senators in over 100 years. So no Republican president can ban abortions, any more than a Democrat president can ban any state law. What we can do is let's find consensus. I think we can find consensus to ban late-term abortions. I think we can find consensus to encourage adoptions and good quality adoptions. I think we can find consensus that doctors and nurses who don't believe in abortion shouldn't have to perform them. I think we can find consensus that contraception should be accessible, and I think we should find consensus that any woman who has an abortion, no state law should say she's going to jail or getting the death penalty. I will not demonize this issue. It's too personal. We have to start doing that. Democrats use fear and Republicans use judgment. This is too personal of an issue to use fear or judgment and I won't be a part of any of that.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but you're not taking a ban off the table, which allows for Democrats to say that, that you would be on board. Can you say–
NIKKI HALEY:–You are not–
MARGARET BRENNAN: –You will not –
NIKKI HALEY: 60 senators- 60 senators would never approve a ban on abortion. That's a fact. That's a fact. So why put out something that's implying something's going to happen to the American people that is a lie. That's never going to happen with that–
NIKKI HALEY: You're not going to get 60 senators to agree to a ban
(CROSSTALK)
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But you know democrats are using this as a way to motivate voters. Democrats are using this as a way to motivate voters --
NIKKI HALEY: -- Democrats--
MARGARET BRENNAN: –so that they do get the math to add up one day. So if the math does add up--
NIKKI HALEY: -- No --
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- one day, would you sign a ban?
NIKKI HALEY: This is the problem with Democrats. Democrats put fear in the American people. The American people don't need fear. They need confidence. They need security. They need to know that everything's gonna be okay. When it comes to the abortion issue, I will never put fear in the American people. I will tell them the hard truth. The hard truth is 60 senators will never agree to a full ban on abortion. That's a fact; Republicans or Democrats. 60 senators are not going to agree to that. I don't know what 60 senators are going to agree to. Right now they don't even agree to 15 weeks. So we've got a long way to go. Our goal should be how do we save as many babies as we can and support as many moms as we can. I had a roommate in college who was raped. I would never wish on anybody what she went through, wondering if she was pregnant. Everybody has a story. Let's be respectful of that. Stop putting fear into people thinking something's going to happen. That's not going to happen.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, we have to leave it there. Thank you for your time. Face the Nation will be back in one minute with Michigan Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer. Stay with us.

Source: Kyrylo Budanov in an interview with the Financial Times (FT)
Details: When asked about Ukraine’s 2023 counteroffensive failing to achieve its objectives, Budanov said: ""To say that everything is fine is not true. To say that there is a catastrophe is also not true.""
""Although the original plans suggested something different, we kept our promise. This summer, our units repeatedly entered Crimea,"" Budanov said.
When asked about mobilisation, Budanov said ""it is not even conceivable to think that we can do without mobilisation,"" adding that the shortage of manpower was ""palpable"".
Budanov anticipates that Ukraine will continue to be able to contain Putin’s forces and has already proven that Russia’s supposed military might has turned out to be a ""soap bubble"".
North Korea is Russia’s biggest arms supplier at present, Budanov said, with their weapons transfers allowing Russia ""to breathe a little"". ""Without their help, the situation would have been catastrophic,"" he added.
Background:
Ukrainian military officials proposed at a meeting of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief's Staff that an extra 450,000-500,000 people should be mobilised, but the issue is still being worked on, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on 19 December 2023.
On 21 January 2024 President Zelenskyy said that he does not as yet see a need for the General Staff to mobilise 500,000 Ukrainians.

Sarah from Meopham, Kent, was told the twins would wait a year to be seen by a specialist after raising development concerns.
Sarah said she ""had to keep arguing"" and ""pushing back"".
Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust (KCHFT) apologised and said demand for assessments had increased.
Sarah first raised concerns about Astrid and Iris' development with her health visitor, ahead of a scheduled 12-month developmental review after noticing one of the girls would ""drag herself along"" when crawling and had ""a really obvious squint"".
She chased the trust when there was no improvement six months later but was told an assessment would not happen before February 2024 - a year after raising initial concerns.
""It wasn't until I'd messaged the MP and my councillor that my daughters were seen by a paediatrician that then gave them the diagnosis of cerebral palsy,"" Sarah said.
""I was made to feel stupid and that I had to keep on arguing and I had to keep on pushing back.""
Sarah paid privately for the girls to receive treatment whilst waiting for an NHS specialist.
Charities say early assessment and intervention can make a huge difference to children with additional needs.
Karen Parsler from Step and Learn, a donation-led charity in Rochester offering free support and physical therapy sessions for families in Kent, said many families were directed to them for help because of current pressure on the NHS.
""In the past NHS physios and therapists that work at the children's centres wouldn't recommend us but now most of our referrals are via those therapists at the NHS saying: 'Look we can't see you regularly try Step and Learn',"" she said.
KCHFT said in a statement: ""Nationally, demand for community paediatrics assessments has increased. At KCHFT we now receive 100 more referrals each month than we did a year ago. This means families are experiencing long waits. We know how challenging and frustrating this is for parents, carers and our staff.
""We're working hard to improve access to our service and apologise for the delays families are experiencing.""

The governor cancelled appearances on both CNN’s State of the Union and NBC’s Meet the Press on 21 January, CNN’s Jim Acosta reported on Saturday night, spurring questions about the state of his campaign. Less than an hour later, Mr DeSantis’ press secretary released a statement.
“The media hits were canceled due to a scheduling issue and will be rescheduled,” press secretary Bryan Griffin said on X. “The governor will be traveling Sunday morning with the campaign and has public events scheduled Sunday evening through Tuesday in NH.”
However, observers are still speculating this could indicate the end of the DeSantis presidential campaign.
“I don’t know if it’s today, tomorrow, next week or the following week, but obviously the man has run out of steam, out of options, out of money, out of a path,” Ana Navarro, senior political commentator for CNN, said on Saturday.
“It gives him a way of easing back, because he’s got to come back to Florida and be governor,” she later continued.
In conversation with Navarro, former Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera called the cancelled appearances “coveted” slots.
“Everybody wants that, especially before a big primary,” he said.
Meanwhile, Jenna Ellis, an attorney and member of Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign, said the suspension of Mr DeSantis’ campaign – which she has been supporting – “seems imminent.”
Despite cancelling media appearances, Mr DeSantis did add another campaign event to his Sunday evening schedule in New Hampshire, per NBC News, where he’s currently polling in the single digits.
A CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire has the Florida governor standing at 6 per cent, with frontrunner Donald Trump holding 50 per cent and former Governor Nikki Haley at 39 per cent. Meanwhile, a Suffolk University survey from Wednesday had Mr Trump with 16 points over Ms Haley, and Mr DeSantis at just 5 per cent.
If he stays in the single digits come the primary this Tuesday, Mr DeSantis will fall under the 10 per cent minimum required to win delegates in the state’s primary. That could come as a significant blow to his campaign following his second-place victory in Iowa last week.
What remains crystal clear, however, is that Mr Trump remains the front-runner — and his fellow Republican candidates are in a race for second place.
The Independent has contacted Mr DeSantis’ campaign for comment."

On the densely populated island of Java, Merapi unleashed clouds of hot ash and a mixture of rock, and lava that traveled up to 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) down its slopes, said Agus Budi Santoso, the head of Indonesia's Geological Disaster Technology Research and Development Center. A column of hot clouds blasted 100 meters (about 109 yards) into the air as ash blanketed several villages without casualties, he added.
Merapi is the most active out of more than 120 volcanoes across the country. Sunday's eruption is the latest since authorities raised its alert level to the second-highest in November 2020 after sensors picked up increasing activity. Residents living on the slopes were advised to stay 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) away from the crater’s mouth and be aware of possible threats from flowing lava.
In 2010, an eruption killed 347 people and displaced 20,000 villagers.
The 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) mountain is about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Yogyakarta, an ancient center of Javanese culture and the seat of royal dynasties going back centuries. About a quarter million people live within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of the volcano.
Several other active volcanoes also blew up this weekend, prompting authorities to evacuate thousands of residents, said Indonesia’s Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation in a statement released on social media platform X, formerly Twitter. No casualties were reported, it said.
The agency said Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki in East Nusa Tenggara province spewed hot clouds as high as 700 meters (2,300 feet) into the air on Sunday, as more than 6,500 people fled to shelters.
Also on Sunday, Mount Marapi in West Sumatra province erupted again, its third biggest flare-up this month, albeit without discharging lava. About 500 residents living near it were evacuated. Last month, it erupted, killing 23 climbers and injuring several others.
Mount Semeru in East Java province released searing gas clouds and rivers of lava on Saturday, as did Mount Ibu on Halmahera island in North Maluku province which shot a column of hot ashes as high as 1,300 meters (4,265 feet) into the air.
In December 2021, Mount Semeru, the highest volcano on Java island, erupted, leaving 48 people dead and 36 missing.
Indonesia, an archipelago of 270 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity because it sits along the “Ring of Fire,” a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean.

Directed by ""The Tinder Swindler"" filmmakers Felicity Morris and Bernadette Higgins, the January release leads viewers through the couple's ordeal, their efforts to be believed and the ultimate confirmation of their story when a similar crime 40 miles away led to their attacker's capture three months later.
The couple sued the Vallejo Police Department for $2.5 million, but not before enduring months of public scrutiny. Aaron Quinn, Huskins' boyfriend, called police a day after his girlfriend's abduction from his Vallejo home.
MAYO CLINIC DOCTOR'S SUSPICIOUS PURCHASE STRENGTHENS MURDER CASE IN WIFE'S POISONING, PROSECUTORS SAY
His story seemed fantastical. He and Huskins, he said, awoke around 3 a.m. March 23, 2015, to flashing lights and what appeared to be a cadre of intruders wearing wetsuits.
Armed with stun guns, the intruders instructed Huskins to bind Quinn with zip ties. Then, Quinn told police, he was blinded with swim goggles covered in duct tape and affixed with foam earphones.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
A pre-recorded message told him that he would be sedated. If he refused oral drugs, the recording allegedly said, it would be administered intravenously. After his blood pressure was taken, Quinn was dosed with a combination of Nyquil and Diazepam, according to the documentary.
'LAUGHING' SUSPECT IN LSU STUDENT ATTACK INDICTED ON VIDEO RECORDING
When he came to, Quinn was told Huskins would be kidnapped. To ensure her safe return, Quinn relayed to police, the intruders demanded $15,000. They said cameras would be installed to monitor Quinn's movements, and Huskins would be hurt if he left the device's view. Although they said in a press conference that they were treating the case as a kidnapping, KRON4 reported, the Vallejo Police Department suspected Quinn of murdering his girlfriend and fabricating his account. He endured 18 hours of questioning, according to the docuseries.
SEVERED HEADS, HANDS FOUND IN FREEZER OF RECENTLY-SOLD COLORADO HOMEQuinn was immediately questioned about why he didn't contact police sooner after he waited nine hours to call, allegedly concerned about his kidnapper's threats. In interrogation footage taken at the Vallejo Police Department and shown in ""American Nightmare,"" Det. Mathew Mustard grills Quinn on the status of his relationship with Huskins and whether he had been cheating on her. ""I don't think you're being truthful, and I don't think anybody came into your house,"" Mustard told Quinn, saying he would look like a ""monster"" if he waited to come clean.
The FBI administered a lie detector test, during which Quinn repeatedly denied an agent's accusations he had harmed his girlfriend. The agency alleged the polygraph indicated Quinn was being dishonest, but its results were actually inconclusive, ""American Nightmare"" showed.
Meanwhile, Huskins had been stuffed into the trunk of Quinn's car and taken to a property in South Lake Tahoe. There, she was sexually assaulted twice on camera, with her attacker threatening to release the footage if she went to police after her release.
During that time, Quinn received text messages demanding money for her return.
Huskins was released two days later near her childhood home in Huntington Beach. She thought her ordeal was over. Instead, she was accused of an elaborate hoax.
Quinn's ex-fiancee told authorities that she and Quinn had discussed getting back together. With this information, authorities accused Huskins of staging her kidnapping, likening the events to the plot of ""Gone Girl,"" a movie in which a small-town wife stages her own murder to get back at her cheating husband.
SCOTT PETERSON CASE TAKEN UP BY LOS ANGELES INNOCENCE PROJECT, INVESTIGATING CLAIM OF 'ACTUAL INNOCENCE'
In a press conference after Huskins' safe reemergence, a Vallejo Police Department spokesperson publicly accused the couple of a hoax.
""Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins have plundered valuable resources away from our community and taken the focus away from the true victims of our community while instilling fear among our community members,"" Vallejo Lt. Kenny Park said at the time, ABC News reported. ""So, if anything, it is Mr. Quinn and Ms. Huskins that owe this community an apology.""
Huskins told Netflix the department's reaction was baffling.
""It didn’t make any sense to have law enforcement — the people who have the power to investigate and to help — just turn against you. It made it that much more frightening,"" she told a reporter with Tudum, Netflix's companion site.
""It was just layers upon layers, and then finding out what evidence they had at the time that they did not use, they could have saved me. There was just so many layers of betrayal and injustice.""Amid the media circus that followed, Quinn and Huskins told filmmakers they feared losing their jobs as physical therapists in the aftermath. ""You go through something like that, and every moment, every ounce of energy is about, 'How do I live to see another second?' That is all you can think about,"" Huskins told ABC News in footage sampled by the docuseries. ""The last thing that you're thinking about is, 'If I do survive, I need to make sure that I'm believable.'""
Huskins and Quinn told filmmakers Misty Carausu, a rookie detective who solved the case, was their hero. On June 5, 2015, a couple woke in the middle of the night to a near-identical home invasion. An intruder was standing over their bed shining a light on their faces.
While the wife hid in a bathroom and called police, her husband managed to fight off the attacker. But he left crucial evidence behind: zip-ties, duct tape, a glove and a cellphone.
Carausu traced the phone to the stepfather of a man named Matthew Muller, a Harvard-educated immigration attorney and Marine veteran.
After reaching out to police departments in the Bay Area, NBC Bay Area reported, she learned that he had been a suspect in a 2009 Palo Alto home invasion. Also at the scene were a pair of swimming goggles blacked out with duct tape that had a blonde hair attached.
SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER REX HEUERMANN'S LAWYER DEFENDS 'SADISTIC' INTERNET SEARCHES IN GILGO BEACH CASE
At that point, Carausu contacted the FBI. Muller was arrested for the Dublin, California, home invasion June 8.
Evidence in his home, including Quinn's laptop, finally linked him to Huskins' kidnapping. Muller's confession matched Quinn and Huskins' stories perfectly, down to the audio recordings, blacked-out goggles and liquid sedatives.
He pleaded guilty to one count of federal kidnapping in September 2016 and was sentenced to 40 years behind bars. Muller also faced state charges for burglary, robbery, kidnapping and two counts of rape by force.But he was deemed incompetent to stand trial for those charges in November 2020, according to the documentary. Muller allegedly suffered from ""Gulf War illness"" after his military service, and his attorney claimed he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, NBC News reported. To this day, Huskins and Quinn told People, they have no idea why Muller targeted them.
""Like many victims, or many people who have gone through tragedy, you don't get all the answers,"" Quinn told the magazine. ""And that can be a sticking point to recovery. So, for us, we don't rely on finding those answers, but what we have to do is move forward in the unknown and focus on things that matter the most to us, like our family, our kids, our work. Those are sustainable things. And having the answers of why they targeted us doesn't change what we do as far as moving forward.""
The pair married in 2018, released a book on their ordeal in 2021 and welcomed daughters in 2020 and 2022.

And they are personal, indeed.
Her very successful first book, “All the Lost Girls: Confessions of a Southern Daughter,” was followed by several more volumes, chronicling her own life experiences: moving out of the South, teaching, marrying, heartbreak, traveling.
This volume, as the title “Written in the Sky: Lessons of a Southern Daughter” suggests, bookends her first volume.
Several essays are explorations of racial subjects.
More: Thriller is set on small college campus | DON NOBLE
She examines in detail Virginia Durr’s autobiography “Outside the Magic Circle,” the gold standard for a Southern woman’s racial awakening and conversion.
She writes movingly of her experience at the Peace and Justice Memorial, with the descriptions there of grotesque lynchings, and thoughtfully about her own efforts to come to terms with the racial ignorance of her youth and her work over the years to achieve an empathy for the racial injustices of her time.
For me, however, her greater strengths lie in the examinations of her closest relationships: with her immediate family.
There are deeply moving accounts of Foster’s visits home to be with her dying mother and, even more distressing, her dying sister.
Right to the last, the old sibling rivalry shows itself. Do we ever learn?
Foster and her mother quarrel over issues that cannot be resolved between generations. Are young women at least partly responsible for what happens to them if, at 15 years old, they go to a party, dressed, as Mrs. Foster would say, provocatively, get drunk and then are assaulted?
Is violence by people in the George Floyd protests acceptable?
Even in what will be the last conversations with her mother, there is still that perpetual, American gap between the generations. Will we never acknowledge that we are formed, in large part, by the cultural values of our childhood?
In what may be the best essay, “Nowhere,” she revisits her mother’s childhood in a desperately awful mining town.
There, her mother suffered poverty, hunger, even sexual abuse at the hands of her big brother, who should, of course, in a better world, have been protecting her.
Foster’s mother would persevere, however, graduate from college, become the wife of the town physician, and a perfect mother, taking Patricia and her sister, Jean, who herself becomes a doctor, to piano lessons, dance lessons, you name it. Everything — clothes, car, yard, posture, everything, must be perfect.
The Fosters have arrived, but the stresses of being what Foster calls “Below” are replaced by “the incredible fragilities of Above. Instead of the confident ease of middle-class families … my family was circumspect, on guard, alert to every slip in status. Anything could happen! Reversals Disappointments. Ruin.”
The anxiety of the newly arrived middle class in the South has never been better done. Patricia’s mother, invited to a teacher’s house for dinner as a young girl, cleans her plate, not understanding the Southern-lady protocol of leaving something uneaten. “My goodness, someone has an appetite,” the teacher’s mother says.
Don Noble’s newest book is Alabama Noir, a collection of original stories by Winston Groom, Ace Atkins, Carolyn Haines, Brad Watson, and eleven other Alabama authors.

6JPFZG31SJ_XI42C0UDHLMQSOK,New show about legendary lawman Bass Reeves brings attention to Fort Smith museum,Robert Medley,"January 21, 2024 at 7:17 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/show-legendary-lawman-bass-reeves-101726284.html,"From the hills of eastern Oklahoma, the legendary U.S. deputy marshal Bass Reeves rode with a posse into the Indian Territory, what is now Oklahoma.
Setting out from Fort Smith, Arkansas, Bass Reeves — once the slave of a Confederate from Texas in the Civil War — would become a U.S. deputy marshal who is said to have brought back 3,000 fugitives from federal law in the days before Oklahoma was a state.
The legends surrounding Bass Reeves have inspired a western series, a spinoff of the “Yellowstone” series, that has been streaming on Paramount+.
In Fort Smith, in the U.S. Marshals Museum that opened July 1, curator Dave Kennedy continues to research the life of Bass Reeves, whose many myths and legends have even connected him to the inspiration for the Lone Ranger character in western fiction lore.
The $47 million museum is expected to draw 125,000 visitors a year to the Arkansas River Valley with an economic impact of $13 million to $22 million. The timing of the Bass Reeves series is good for the museum where Reeves, a Fort Smith hero, is prominently displayed.
Hollywood and paperback writers are not the only ones who have created Bass Reeves fiction. There is plenty of it found in the family tales and oral history handed down, Kennedy said. He had a call from a woman in Little Rock who said she was certain Bass Reeves had been involved in an incident there. He had not.
Kennedy said deputy marshals often had assignments in the days before paper records were always saved and stored. But many receipts for pay have been located and letters and other history exist in archives in Arkansas.
If the military arrested someone who was held at Fort Reno, a deputy marshal would arrive to escort them to court. Once prisoners could ride in custody on a train, law officers could take trains from a U.S. fort to a courthouse jail in Fort Smith.
“Bass Reeves went all over central Oklahoma at different times,” Kennedy said. “Typically it depends on the warrant they had and whether the person had been arrested by the military. There was a unit of Black soldiers at Fort Gibson who delivered prisoners to Van Buren.""
How far west Bass Reeves rode remains an open question. Debra Kauffman is a full-time volunteer at the Fort Reno Visitors Center and Museum in Canadian County, Oklahoma, about 40 miles west of downtown Oklahoma City on flat prairie. Fort Reno was in the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas when Reeves was a deputy marshal. Whether he was ever at Fort Reno is not known.
Reeves, who escaped from slavery during the Civil War, was the go-to deputy marshal for picking up fugitives in Indian Territory. He could have gone to Fort Sill, then north to Fort Reno, according to at least one western magazine article, and back to Fort Smith. Reeves is said to have killed more than 20 men.
His pistol, a Colt single-action Army service revolver, is in the U.S. Marshals Museum in Fort Smith.
Kauffman said there is little history at Fort Reno about the U.S. Marshals Service and their role in the frontier days of federal law and order. Another frontier lawman was Chris Madsen, a U.S. marshal during the years Reeves was active. Madsen served in the 6th Cavalry and is buried at the Richland Cemetery in Canadian County.
Reeves lived near Van Buren and raised a family there.
His real story is told in the new U.S. Marshals Museum, on the banks of the Arkansas River in Fort Smith, just blocks from the federal courthouse where Reeves was a deputy marshal under the famous hanging judge Judge Isaac Parker. Reeves would work from 1875 to 1907 before Oklahoma became a state and Reeves became a police officer in Muskogee.
Reeves stood 6 feet and 2 inches tall. He had superior aim with a rifle or pistol. He covered hundreds and hundreds of miles in uninhabited, wild land. Stories about him grew wild, too. More are coming in since the streaming western fiction series, said Kennedy, the curator of the Fort Smith museum.
“There are a lot of claims made about Bass,” Kennedy said, noting that since “Lawmen: Bass Reeves,” was released, there has been an uptick in interest in the U.S. Marshals Service.
In the first six months since the Fort Smith museum opened, there were 35,000 visitors from all 50 states and more than a dozen countries, he said.
Recently, Kennedy and local historians, including Caroline Speir from the Fort Smith Museum of History, hosted a talk about Hollywood and western history. Whether all the facts are straight in the TV series is not as important as spreading the word about the life of a real person, a lawman of color, he said.
“Here we are more than 100 years after the passing of Bass Reeves and we are talking about a person of color who was shoved out of the history of the region.”
Robert Medley is a former editor of the Fort Smith Southwest Times Record and current editor of the Piedmont-Surrey Gazette in Canadian County, Oklahoma.

""Students were going to the bathroom for long periods of time and making TikTok,"" Alamance-Burlington School System spokesperson Les Atkins told WFMY, explaining that Southern Alamance Middle School in Graham, North Carolina, resorted to removing bathroom mirrors to eliminate the distraction.
The school system said that on average, students use the restroom between three to four times a day, but that frequency has steadily increased to between seven, eight and nine times a day. Since removing the mirrors, Atkins explained, the school has seen, ""not as many visits to the bathroom, not staying as long, and students are held accountable, and when there’s accountability, you see a great difference.""
Atkins explained the school system is trying to educate students on ""digital citizenship.""

On Thursday, SLCPD officers were following a stolen vehicle in unmarked police vehicles, according to court documents. A helicopter with the Utah Department of Public Safety helped with the pursuit, maintaining a visual of the stolen vehicle from the air. Those inside the helicopter told officers on the ground that the vehicle they were following had stopped and that the occupants were bailing on foot in different directions.
Officers reportedly made contact with Jacobs, a passenger in the vehicle, as she began to run away through an alleyway despite commands to stop.

Mr Marcos arrived at the British rock band Coldplay’s concert on Friday and videos of him attending the show went viral on social media.
Most Filipinos criticised the president and his family for using a helicopter with taxpayers’ money while remaining oblivious to the traffic conditions around metropolitan Manila, a metropolis of 16 overcrowded cities of about 13 million people.
Manila has earned the dubious distinction of being the “worst in the world” for traffic among 387 cities in 55 countries, according to navigation and mapping firm TomTom.
But that did not prevent Mr Marcos from making it to the show and reaching the concert venue, that is approximately 30km north of the capital, Manila. It would have taken concertgoers at least three hours to travel by road.
Addressing the controversy, the Presidential Security Group said in a statement the Philippine Arena, the world’s largest indoor arena, saw an influx of 40,000 concert-goers resulting in “unforeseen traffic complications along the route”.
The traffic situation posed a security threat to Mr Marcos who attended the Friday night concert with his wife, prompting the use of the presidential chopper, it added.

However, residents expressed frustration about the traffic situation in the city and the use of taxpayer funds by Mr Marcos, the son and namesake of the late strongman president, whose rule concluded almost four decades ago through a historic “people power” revolution.
""Using official resources, like the presidential chopper, for personal and non-official activities is generally considered an abuse of power or misuse of government resources,"" Facebook user James Patrick Aristorenas said in a post on Saturday.
“We paid for the use of the chopper, fuel and security, who knows even for the tickets for everyone,” Facebook user Arvine Concepcion said."

Now Bennington Township, which the department has covered for decades, has contracted with another department for fire and emergency medical coverage because of what one official called Hartford's lack of ""prudent fiscal management.""
Bennington Township Trustees unanimously voted Jan. 8 to switch from Hartford's department, which has served Bennington since shortly after the department's 1949 inception, to the Homer Fire Department, Bennington Township Trustee Cindy Powell said in an interview Wednesday.
""Our top priority is making sure that Bennington Township residents have access to 24/7/365 EMS and fire service coverage,"" Powell said. ""Because there was — and still is — no guarantee that Hartford will stay open, the Homer Fire (Department) started providing coverage to Bennington Township on Jan. 11.""
Hartford Township Fiscal Officer Adam Lanthorn said Tuesday the department has money to routine expenses, such as utility bills and insurance, but the salary appropriations run out Jan. 28.
Hartford Township Trustee Tim Debolt said the township is working to ensure the area has fire and EMS protection, but there are no solidified plans for how it pay employee salaries.
In 2023, Lanthorn said the department had a $1.059 million budget, and nearly half of that money came from Bennington Township.
""Obviously, our budget is different than what it would have been had Bennington been in with us on this, but regardless … we have to move forward with what we have and look at it from a way that's going to be fiscally responsible and show that we can be fiscally responsible with the funds that we have coming in while still providing the service,"" Debolt said in a Thursday interview.
Debolt said the township is pulling together an advisory panel with residents to look at potential solutions.
Hartford's department has a full-time chief, three full-time firefighters and about a dozen part-time employees. When asked if the Hartford department would have to lay off staff members or reduce hours, Debolt said said he did not know.
""There are all sorts of possibilities of what we might have to do. We're just trying to find the best solution,"" he said.
Debolt, who was elected to his first term in November, said the the township will need a special meeting before Jan. 28 to decide what happens with the department moving forward. As of Friday afternoon, that special meeting had not been scheduled.
The department, which switched from a volunteer to paid department two years ago, has served Hartford and Bennington townships in Licking County's northwest corner along the lines of Delaware and Knox counties. Last year, days ahead of the Hartford Independent Fair, the fire department only had $2.82 remaining after paying payroll in early August.
Typically, townships don't get the first half of the year's property tax payment until late March. Lanthorn said the Hartford trustees passed a resolution asking the Licking County Auditor's Office provide the tax revenue as early as possible, and he hopes the township can receive it in early March.
Hartford has a 2.5-mil fire and EMS levy on the March 19 primary ballot, but even if it's approved, that money wouldn't be collected until next year.
Debolt said he's more focused on the short term and looking at what the department does Jan. 29, once salary appropriations are exhausted.
""I'm living in the here and now, and we have to deal with what we're looking at now and how … we move forward with what we have now,"" he said.
As a result of Bennington switching to the Homer department, Bennington Township's 8-mil fire levy funds are no longer going to Hartford Township. Bennington residents pay $183.67 annually per $100,000 home value, Powell said. Bennington paid the department $442,728.25 in 2023, in two installments after receiving property taxes from the county in the spring and fall. The second payment, Powell said, was supposed to last the department until March when the first half of 2024 property taxes come in.
Bennington trustees also approved providing up to $20,000 to Hartford to be used solely for fire and EMS salaries for the pay period ending Jan. 28, but it was contingent on the department paying the Jan. 18 payroll, Powell said.
Powell said in late 2022 the Bennington trustees became concerned about how Hartford was using the township's fire and EMS levy funds. She said it was an extremely difficult decision to switch fire and EMS coverage to Homer's department, located in Burlington Township, but it was done because of a ""lack of prudent fiscal management"" by the Hartford department. She said the trustees tried to work with Hartford officials on a solution, but the financial situation continued to deteriorate rapidly.
Powell, a two-term trustee, said the Bennington trustees don't question the dedication and skills of the Hartford Fire personnel, but they needed to ensure their residents had fire and EMS coverage.
Bennington's agreement with Homer is temporary and only goes through March 31. It pays the Homer department $25,000 per month — a total of $62,5000 for the duration of the temporary agreement, Powell said. Bennington is working toward a long-term agreement with Homer and Monroe Township Fire Department for coverage, she said.
As of now, Powell wasn't sure if that longer-term agreement will be for just the rest of 2024 or beyond.
""We're going to have to just look at everything and see where we're at coverage wise,"" she said. ""We're just going to be working with both townships to make sure that Bennington Township residents have the best coverage as possible, based on EMS and fire response times.""
The possibility of increased responses times is one of the main concerns of residents, said Samantha Martin, a two-year resident of Bennington Township. She said the Homer department is 13 minutes from her home while the Hartford station is only five minutes away, and every second is critical during a medical emergency or house fire. While she is sure the Homer firefighters and paramedics are fantastic at their jobs, the station is just too far away for her comfort.
Martin said she was at the Jan. 8 meeting and felt the Bennington trustees weren't listening to concerns about responses times and other issues brought up by her and other residents.
She wants to see Bennington and Hartford officials work together on a solution, possibly a joint fire district where each township could have equal say in how the department operates.
""I just feel like there's a better way, rather than just pulling the plug and we just have to deal with that as residents,"" she said in a Friday interview.

6TWI4IXRDQ_89R918HCKQ60SQW,How plagiarism-detection programs became an unlikely political weapon,Corinne Purtill,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/plagiarism-detection-programs-became-unlikely-110011588.html,"The plagiarism accusations first struck Claudine Gay when a right-wing activist published several examples of unattributed text from the Harvard president's academic writings. Though insufficient attribution wasn't the only controversy swirling around Gay — her response to congressional questions about antisemitism on campus  played a much bigger role — it was the tipping point that forced her resignation this month.
The next volley hit Neri Oxman, a former MIT professor and the wife of hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who had campaigned vigorously for Gay’s ouster. The publication Business Insider reported that several paragraphs and sentences from Oxman’s dissertation appeared to have been lifted from Wikipedia. Oxman apologized for the errors on social media.
In response, Ackman wrote on X that he would be getting into the plagiarism review game as well. Ackman said his review would cover all the published work of all of MIT’s faculty, its president, Sally Kornbluth, and the university’s board members — plus all the work of the staff at Business Insider, and possibly also the work of the faculties at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, the University of Pennsylvania and Dartmouth.
“Vetting every publication from every academic over their career at a huge university like Harvard would take thousands of hours,” said Chris Caren.
He would know. Caren is the chief executive of Oakland-based Turnitin, the world’s largest provider of academic integrity software. The company’s products include Feedback Studio, a program designed for high school and college instructors, and iThenticate, a more rigorous offering favored by academic journal editors.
According to the company, 80% of U.S. college students attend schools that use Turnitin’s software to check student work for plagiarism. So do 50% of U.S. high school students. Nearly all of the leading scholarly journals use the company’s products to check submitted articles for misappropriated language and missing citations, Caren said. (Turnitin’s programs analyze only text, he noted, and won’t catch fudged figures, manipulated images or other data-related chicanery.)
The widespread adoption of plagiarism-detection software in higher learning over the last decade means the prospect of a “plagiarism check” for most college graduates under the age of about 30 isn’t much of a threat. Their essays, papers, theses and dissertations were almost certainly vetted in this way when they handed them in.
But for older academics, subjecting work to the software’s level of scrutiny could well reveal attribution errors — intentional or not — that have never come to light before.
And that’s what a small but highly motivated sector of Turnitin’s customer base is counting on.
“We allow anyone to use them — media organizations, political groups,” Caren said of Turnitin’s products. “If there are other firms that want to look into someone's past, it's the same technology, it's just being used by people we didn't design it for in the first place.”

The National Science Foundation describes plagiarism as ""the appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results or words without giving appropriate credit."" Harvard and MIT define it in similar language in their academic integrity guidelines.
In academia particularly, it can be a devastating charge.
""People get jobs, grants, and a litany of other opportunities based on their research that by default is assumed to be original to them. If it is later found out to not be, it would then be saying that they got these opportunities effectively based on fraud,"" said Christian Moriarty, a professor of ethics and law at St. Petersburg College in Florida.
That's why ""an accusation, unfounded or not, undermines their authority and position,"" he said.
No one has accused Gay or Oxman of stealing data or high-level ideas. But some of their published works appear to contain expository sentences and paragraphs that closely match language in sources available at the time — the type of plagiarism that software can most easily detect.
Gay's accusers highlighted multiple instances of prose that echoed other sources. For instance, two paragraphs in her 1997 doctoral dissertation closely mirrored text in a paper by researchers who were not cited anywhere in the paper. Harvard said Gay requested corrections to some of the works.
In Oxman's case, Business Insider identified 15 nonconsecutive paragraphs in her 2010 dissertation that closely resemble language that appeared in Wikipedia articles at that time. Most are definitions of technical terms and concepts. The publication also found passages in her research papers that echoed other sources.

Neither Christopher Rufo, the activist who first raised allegations against Gay, nor Business Insider disclosed what software they used to identify the problematic text.
Turnitin programs were used to discover that parts of Melania Trump’s 2016 speech at the Republican National Convention matched Michelle Obama’s 2008 remarks to the Democratic National Convention, Caren said.
The CEO said he also believes that the company’s software was used to determine that Germany’s former defense minister, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, had plagiarized in his doctoral dissertation, a massive political scandal in that country that led to the star politician’s downfall in 2011.
Though Feedback Studio is only available to institutions, iThenticate can be licensed by anyone. The program digests the text of a book, research paper or article in minutes and returns a detailed report that flags the percentage of phrases and passages in the document that match those published online and in Turnitin's database of academic journals.
The report has to be checked by a human to weed out legitimate uses of quoted material. Though the process is time-consuming, it’s much faster than an equally thorough review would have taken in a predigital age.
“It's easier to search for plagiarism than ever before,"" said Jonathan Bailey, a copyright and plagiarism consultant in New Orleans. ""The easier something is to do, the more people are likely to do it.”
The idea of using plagiarism accusations as a means to discredit rivals was around long before the invention of plagiarism-checking software, said Sam Bruton, director of the Office of Research Integrity at the University of Southern Mississippi.
“People have always had the ability to raise allegations of scholarly integrity for ulterior motives, be those motives personal (grudges, resentments), political or something different,” Bruton wrote in an email.
He challenged the idea that the spread of the software is primarily responsible for an increase in plagiarism accusations, attributing it instead “to the hyper-politicization that has engulfed so many American institutions.”
But many educators and academics who use such programs in their daily work said that seeing them employed for political ends has been disheartening.
The technology is designed to support instructors and help enforce proper citation guidelines, said Moriarty, who teaches other professors how to use such tools.
“People in the academic integrity field often don’t like it or appreciate it or think it’s appropriate to use academic integrity software as a means to punish for punishment’s sake,” Moriarty said.

Plagiarism-detection software can’t determine how or why language similar to other sources appeared in an author’s work, whether the issue violates an institution’s code of ethics or what the consequences of such an infraction should be.
For now, at least, only humans can do that.
“Human expertise is essential to maintaining the integrity of scholarly and academic work,” said Greer Murphy, director of academic honesty at University of Rochester’s College of Arts, Sciences and Engineering in New York. “But such has always been true — the sophistication of modern technology hasn’t changed things.”

A militant decapitated him and tried to sell his head for $10,000, his father has claimed.
He said his head was found by Israeli forces in an ice cream store's freezer.
The head of an IDF soldier who was killed during Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel was found in an ice cream store's freezer, his father said in an interview on Israel's Channel 14 news station.
Sergeant Adir Tahar, 19, was killed as Hamas militants threw grenades during their assault on Israeli territory, The Times of Israel reported.
He was then beheaded, and his head was taken into the Gaza Strip, his father, David, told Channel 14, per the report.
During an interrogation, a Hamas militant also claimed that he had attempted to sell the head for $10,000, he added. ""That is just insane barbarism.""
In an email to Business Insider, the IDF said it had ""no information that can confirm the report about the selling of the head."" It did not refer to the other aspects of the story.
However, the Israeli Foreign Ministry shared the story in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
According to the post, David Tahar told Channel 14 that he spent two months searching for his son's severed head before it was eventually discovered in a freezer in Gaza.
Tahar's head was found by elite Israeli troops supported by tanks in an ice cream store, per The Times of Israel.
""I did everything I could. It wasn't easy. In the end, I got a body without a head. I insisted very much with the army to see the body. They tried to explain to me that I should not see it,"" David said.
""Half an hour before I buried my child, his body arrived at Mount Herzl, I opened the coffin when I was alone,"" he added. ""He was unrecognizable. I identified him by dog tags and a DNA test and things he had in his pants.""
In the days following the Hamas attacks, unverified reports emerged of other instances of beheadings carried out by the group, including claims that the group had decapitated babies.
The IDF received widespread criticism, alleging it had spread the rumor without evidence.
Responding to the backlash, a spokesperson for the force, Major Nir Dinar, said the IDF would not investigate its claims as it was ""disrespectful for the dead"" to do so.
No Israeli officials have confirmed the story.
""We cannot confirm any numbers. What happened in Kibbutz Kfar Aza is a massacre in which women, children and toddlers, and elderly were brutally butchered in an ISIS way of action,"" the IDF said in a statement to Sky News at the time.
President Joe Biden even mentioned the alleged findings in a speech.
""I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children,"" Biden said.
But the White House later said that the president had not independently verified the claims.
Around 1,200 people were killed in Israel during Hamas' October 7 attacks.
Reports have since emerged of the brutal tactics used by the Palestinian militant group on the day, including horrific stories of widespread sexual violence and mutilation.
Israel responded to the attacks with weeks of deadly airstrikes and a ground invasion of Gaza, leading to the deaths of more than 25,000 Palestinians so far.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the proposal of a Palestinian state once the conflict concludes, saying that ""the war is continuing and it will continue until the end, until we achieve all of its goals.""

However, there are still fields out there where you don't need a ton of experience or even a college degree to get your foot in the door!
Recently, I asked the BuzzFeed Community to tell me about the entry-level jobs that helped set them up for lucrative careers.
Here are 17 of their top answers:
1.""Bank teller. Most bankers — even bank presidents — start as tellers. Starting at this level allows a person to learn the banking business from the ground up. Most of the training is on the job, and if you do well, there will be advancement opportunities.""
""My path started as a teller, promoted to a personal banker, promoted to a credit analyst, and then moved to another bank in a different state and became a loan officer.""
—hlane09
2.""Data entry. Data is everywhere nowadays, but ACCURATE data is EVERYTHING. Get really, really good at keeping things accurate, and in order, and learn how to spot inconsistencies and discrepancies. People who aren't good at these things treat you like you're a wizard, which then leads to great recommendations later on. Those skills can transfer to numerous different fields and industries.""
—t448dac9d3
""The job I always recommend to folks when I'm asked how I got to six figures is data entry/data operations. I've been able to be hired for a variety of jobs dealing in finance, education, HR, security, and telecom. Once you understand how to manipulate data, it doesn't matter what it is or where it's from, all it is is numbers and text. Have a strong base in Excel, learn SQL, and learn to understand database structure, and you have a career that's going to last you years, even with leaps to AI. Companies are cheap and aren't going to invest AI in every part of their business for years to come, so maybe their app uses AI, but not their internal billing software they've had in place since 1998.
You don't need a college degree, and if you do, know it can be in anything. I have an English and film degree, so you don't need to be a math genius. Being logical, organized, and understanding the order of operations will get you far. I recommend having strong ethics, too, because there have been times I have been asked to manipulate data for evil, and telling important people no is my early barometer to getting out and moving on to better, higher-paying jobs.""

3.""I did a year of service with AmeriCorps VISTA, then used a service benefit called non-compete eligibility to get pushed ahead of the crowd for federal hiring. Don't get me wrong, my year of service was tough. AmeriCorps pays a literal poverty wage to their volunteers/members. But I got such good real-world experience that year and made it work. Later, I got hired at a federal agency in a modestly-paid REMOTE job with a boatload of benefits and flexibility. WORTH IT.""

4.""Entry-level jobs in insurance are your ticket to a good career. There's tons of opportunity for growth, they'll pay for your licensing and other industry education, and it's recession and pandemic-proof. It's easy to make an above-average salary, and six figures is within reach for a LOT of people.""
—stepha83
""Many jobs in various aspects of the insurance industry can be very lucrative, and you typically don't need any previous experience. The amount of knowledge that you have to ACQUIRE over time to be successful is objectively immense and takes a great deal of effort, but you don't need previous experience or knowledge to start.""
—yuandre
""I left a 'lucrative' career after 17 years at a prestigious space agency because I was tired of the bureaucracy and BS. I could have gone to work in a similar capacity in the private industry, but I was tired. One of my friends left to start their own business…in insurance! At the time, I thought he was totally crazy. He tried to show me the numbers and how it works. Turns out that he now has two houses, a private jet, and a yacht.
So, when I left my job, I asked how to get started. Two years in, with literally no experience or knowledge in the industry, I'm now making more monthly than what I was after 17 years and with a doctorate!
For those who diss insurance, let me tell you, medicare sales pay well, and you're building long-term residual income and wealth. Those are things I wouldn't have had before with my previous job. Is it tough the first year? Yes. Is it a steep learning curve? Yes. I truly believe I get to help people, and that motivates me to work even harder.""

""I did that job 10 years ago and have a high-level position now, and I am very comfortable.
[In my experience] it's also a good field in terms of the glass ceiling and discrimination — all anyone cares about is numbers. As a woman, I've felt respected, and I've risen through the ranks swiftly. I'm not sure that would have happened if I worked in HR, for example, where your value to the company is more subjective.""

8.""Hosting at a restaurant! Hosting becomes serving, server gets upgraded to trainer, trainer becomes bartender, who becomes assistant general manager, who can potentially get promoted to manager.

""It's definitely possible to work your way up at a restaurant. I’ve seen it.""

9.""I worked at a high-end restaurant as a reservationist. It was just working the phone and assigning tables. It is absolutely possible to make a career in hospitality this way.""
""People who started as reservationists or food runners (those who hand off food from the kitchen to the waiter) have gone on to being the CFO, the general manager, an HR manager, the head chef’s personal assistant.

After a couple of years, I started working for law firms directly, and over time, I moved through the positions of legal assistant, legal secretary, and now paralegal. I don't have a paralegal certificate, but I do have the work experience I've built over that time. It's not 'lucrative' in the sense of rolling in cash, but it's allowed me to support myself solo.""
""In a world where so many adults my age have roommates or have moved back in with their parents, that's something I take personal pride in. I turned 18 during the recession and had years of financial struggle before finding my current career. For that reason, I'll always be appreciative of what I have now, because I remember those times of struggle before.
I'm not rich, but I have a life I couldn't have imagined for myself back then, and I think that's awesome. Legal work was never something I would have seen myself doing previously (I was a theater major), but it's something I've continued to enjoy through the years. As far as a 9–5 goes, I wouldn't look to another field.""

""Hint: It's law school prep courses to get into law school and taking the bar prep course before you even go to law school. Firms hire mostly college and law students, but not always. Plus, they might hire you for a lucrative job after law school. It's worth a look.""
—bravesgirl21
13.""I took a pay cut and left the career I went to school for (early childhood education) to work at a small mail house because I needed an escape from my current job. I knew nothing about the business or how anything worked. I was basically just a body to do manual labor. Lucky for me, no one who worked there cared that much or tried very hard, and I was raised with a good ethic, so it didn't take long for me to get noticed and consistently get moved up. Turns out, I was really good at my job, a quick learner, and actually enjoyed what I was doing (despite basically just sending junk mail). Fast-forward about 3.5 years, and my employer offered me a promotion to production management. I have since doubled what I started at.""

I had zero experience and zero knowledge in property management, but, because it was right before the 2008 bubble burst, it was pretty darn good pay. They never found a primary leasing agent, so I inherited the job.""
""It was one of the harder learning experiences of my life (extremely harsh managers, unbending bosses, and the naivety of thinking that saying 'yes' to the higher-ups would get me far in life — I cried a LOT).
However, because of this summer job, I learned how to be an extrovert. I learned how to make conversation with (actually) anyone. I learned what customer service means and how important a written contract is. As a direct result of that opportunity, I am now one of the highest producing agents in the field in my city. Regardless of how the opportunity arose or how far off-base it seems from what you think you want, give it a try.""

I did not have too much knowledge or experience working with bikes. A few months into the cashier job, I was promoted to a sales associate and moved up to about 30hr/wk. After the annual performance reviews at the end of the year (about 7.5 months after I was initially hired), I was promoted to a department manager position. A year later, I was promoted to the general store manager.""

17.And finally: ""Human Resources is still a career you can get into without a degree. If you can start as an HR assistant or coordinator, all you will need is basic office skills. Go for a large-ish company, though, so that you can get someone to mentor you. Take advantage of opportunities to get certified and further your career.""
""An HR manager or director can easily make a six-figure salary, or at least close to it, depending on your geographic area.""
—patrisiabb13
""While in college, I got a part-time job as an HR assistant with my university and worked there for two years until I graduated. Needless to say, I became really proficient at professional communication, and that has carried through all of my other jobs, to the point where my managers always gush about it in performance reviews, etc.
I also think getting my master's in data analytics is the best career decision I've made so far — I'm not even finished, and I was able to get a job as a data analyst making A LOT more money, and I'm set to become a data scientist making six figures when I graduate next year.""

6YDGKYIW41_93EI741SKLUO5CB,Strike on busy market kills dozens in Russian-held Donetsk,AFP,"January 22, 2024 at 7:12 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/strike-busy-market-kills-25-125842155.html,"Artillery shells struck a suburb of the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine Sunday, killing at least 27 people, including many at a crowded market, Moscow-backed officials said.
Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of a sharp escalation in attacks on civilian areas over the past two months.
Shattered storefronts and broken glass could be seen in videos shared by Russian state media, along with what appeared to be bodies lying on the ground nearby.
Officials said the shelling hit a southwestern suburb of the city called Tekstilshchik, less than 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the frontline.
""Twenty-seven civilians were killed and another 25 people were injured of varying severity, among them two teenagers,"" said Denis Pushilin, head of the region's Russian-controlled administration.
He blamed Ukraine for the attack, calling it a ""horrific"" artillery strike on a civilian area.
Ukrainian shelling of a separate neighbourhood in the city killed one other person, bringing the total number of dead across Donetsk to 28, Pushilin said.
AFP was not able to immediately verify the circumstances of the attack.
- 'People screamed' -
Ukraine did not immediately comment on the strike, but its Tavria army group, which operates in the south of the country denied it was responsible.
""We responsibly declare that forces subordinate to the Tavria military unit did not engage in combat operations in this case,"" it said on Facebook.
""Donetsk is Ukraine! Russia will have to be held accountable for the lives of Ukrainians taken,"" it added.
Ukrainian officials said Russian shelling killed at least two people in Ukrainian-controlled villages west of Donetsk on Sunday.
The market strike was one of the deadliest on Donetsk since Moscow launched full-scale hostilities against Ukraine in February 2022.
Local resident Tatiana said she heard an incoming projectile overhead, and hid under her market stall.
""I saw smoke, people screamed, a woman was crying,"" she told a local media outlet.
""Where is there anything military here? It's just a market,"" another resident named Tatiana told the same outlet.
""This is one of the strongest blows in recent times,"" she added.
Donetsk, occupied by Russia and its proxy forces since 2014, has been repeatedly targeted by what Moscow has called indiscriminate Ukrainian shelling.
Moscow called Sunday's attack a ""barbaric terrorist attack"" that showed the need for its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.
""Security threats and acts of terrorism should not be committed from the territory of Ukraine,"" its foreign ministry said.
Authorities in the region have declared Monday a day of mourning, Pushilin said.
- Gas terminal ablaze -
News of the attack came as Russia reported another blaze on its energy infrastructure, this time at a gas terminal in the Baltic Sea port of Ust-Luga.
Kyiv earlier this week claimed responsibility for two attacks on oil depots in Russia, including one in the same Leningrad region where Ust-Luga is located.
Operator Novatek said there were no victims and that the fire was ""currently localised"" at the site, some 110 kilometres (70 miles) west of St Petersburg near the Estonian border.
The fire was caused by an ""external factor"", it said, without elaborating.
Ukraine, which has targeted Russian oil and gas infrastructure throughout the almost two-year conflict, did not immediately comment on the incident.
""No casualties as a result of a fire at Novatek's terminal in the port of Ust-Luga. Personnel were evacuated,"" Aleksandr Drozdenko, governor of Leningrad Oblast, said.
He shared a photo showing firefighters spraying water on a large fire at the terminal.
The RIA-Novosti news agency reported that a 100-cubic-metre container was ablaze.
The Ust-Luga complex processes natural gas condensate into naphtha, jet fuel and ship fuel components, according to Novatek's website.

6YWU9WIMGL_ECCP3JFCJNEK12V,Prayer ban pupil suing Katharine Birbalsingh accused of stab threat to child,Louisa Clarence-Smith,"January 21, 2024 at 11:52 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/pupil-taking-katharine-birbalsingh-court-145257584.html,"A Muslim pupil taking Katharine Birbalsingh to court over a prayer ban was suspended last year for allegedly threatening to stab another child.
The pupil at Michaela Community School in Wembley, north-west London, has launched a High Court challenge to the school’s prayer ban, which she claims is discriminatory.
Michaela, a free school founded by Ms Birbalsingh in 2014, is one of the top-performing state schools in the country and is rated “outstanding” by Ofsted.
Court papers state that the pupil, who cannot be named, was suspended for five days last year for threatening to stab another pupil.
According to the school’s lawyers, the pupil accepted that she had said to another pupil: “If you tell anyone I will stab you”.
The pupil then refused to say what she had said to the other pupil before making the threat, according to the school.
Court documents referred to a behaviour record for the pupil, known as TTT to protect her anonymity, which stated: “TTT was speaking negatively about the school and her plans to ‘destroy it’.
“She said it would involve fewer people than last time. She then threatened another girl by saying she would stab her if the girl said anything about it.”
Lawyers for the pupil claimed that the exclusion was a “great shock” to the pupil and that her account of events had not been taken into consideration.
A quarter of Michaela’s pupils are from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, last year 82 per cent of its sixth form pupils went to Russell Group universities, including Cambridge, St Andrews and Imperial.
Around half of the 700 pupils at the school are Muslim. The school initiated a prayer ban in March last year after some pupils began praying in the playground. An online petition was launched demanding a prayer room be established.
Teachers then began to receive threats and feared for their safety, according to the secular school. The school was also told of incidents in which Muslim pupils who were not praying faced intimidation from some other Muslim pupils.
Ms Birbalsingh said that the school’s governing body responded by banning prayer in school altogether, which she said “restored calm and order to the school”.
In a statement released on Wednesday, she said: “We have always been clear to parents and pupils when they apply to Michaela that because of our restrictive building combined with our strict ethos that does not allow children to wander around the school unsupervised, we cannot have a prayer room.
“At Michaela, those from all religions make sacrifices so that we can maintain a safe secular community.”
The pupil’s legal challenge is being funded by public money after she secured legal aid. The cost of the dispute is expected to run into the hundreds of thousands of pounds.

6ZCPX8XBGW_03VL935U6O5G2F5,The Legal Question at the Center of the Alec Baldwin Criminal Case,Julia Jacobs,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 2:44 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/legal-center-alec-baldwin-criminal-153342056.html,"Now that a grand jury has indicted Alec Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter for the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the film “Rust” in New Mexico in 2021, the contours of the looming legal battle are coming into focus.
If the case reaches trial, the challenge prosecutors face will be convincing a jury that Baldwin was guilty of either the negligent use of a firearm or of acting with “total disregard or indifference for the safety of others” — even though investigators found he was told on the day of the shooting that the gun he was rehearsing with contained no live rounds, and even though the film set was not supposed to have any live ammunition at all.
The challenge Baldwin’s defense team faces will be to explain why the gun fired. Baldwin has maintained all along that he did not pull the trigger that day as he rehearsed a scene in which he draws a revolver, saying that the gun discharged after he pulled the hammer back and released it. A forensic report commissioned by the prosecution determined that he must have pulled the trigger for the gun to go off, a finding that contributed to its decision to revive the criminal case against Baldwin.
Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times
Legal experts were divided on the merits of reviving the case, noting that traditional gun safety rules — such as never pointing a functional gun toward someone — do not always apply on film sets, and that investigators found he had been assured by the film’s safety crew that the gun did not contain live ammunition.
“The notion that you never point a gun at someone would sort of undo Westerns for the past 100 years,” said Nancy Gertner, a retired federal judge.
The outcome of the case at trial — the State of New Mexico vs. Alexander (Alec) Rae Baldwin — would hinge on how jurors view two key questions: Should Baldwin have known of the danger involved in his actions that day? And, using a term of art in criminal law, did he act with a “willful disregard for the safety of others”?
The grand jury indictment required that at least eight out of 12 jurors found probable cause that Baldwin committed a crime. The standard at trial is much higher: A jury must determine, unanimously, that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
“I think it’s an uphill battle,” said Steve Aarons, a veteran defense lawyer in New Mexico. “There is no reason for live rounds to be there. It’s a little different than other situations where you have a firearm and you assume any bullet that is there would be a live round.”
There is a complex web of factors that would quite likely come up at trial, including the condition of the gun, which broke during FBI testing, and Baldwin’s responsibility as a producer on the film.
But the prosecutors will probably take the straightforward position that anyone who agrees to handle a gun is responsible for what happens next, said Joshua Kastenberg, a criminal law professor at the University of New Mexico and a former prosecutor.
“You could make the argument that regardless of the condition of the weapon, there was an independent duty of every person that was going to put their hands on that weapon that day to ask and make sure that it was either safe or unloaded,” he said, though he said that proving that kind of argument to a jury is often challenging.
After the grand jury indicted Baldwin on Friday, his lawyers — who have called the revived prosecution “misguided” — said that they looked forward to their day in court. Kari T. Morrissey, one of the special prosecutors handling the case, declined to elaborate on the case that was presented to the grand jury.
It was the second time Baldwin found himself facing a criminal charge in connection with the shooting. In an earlier case that was dropped in April, prosecutors had accused him of “extremely reckless acts” in the shooting. In a statement of probable cause last year they had accused him of getting insufficient firearms training, of failing to deal with safety complaints on set in his capacity as one of the film’s producers, of “putting his finger on the trigger of a real firearm when a replica or rubber gun should have been used” and of pointing the firearm at the film’s cinematographer and director.
Baldwin has maintained all along that he was not responsible for the tragedy, noting that someone else had put live ammunition in the gun and that the cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, had been directing where he pointed the gun. “I know in my heart that I’m not responsible for what happened to her,” Baldwin told a detective following the shooting.
The new case, said Marc A. Grano, a lawyer and former prosecutor in New Mexico, will most likely become a back-and-forth over what is “standard practice” in the film and TV industry, a battle that may include conflicting opinions and examples.
After the original criminal case was brought against Baldwin last year, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the union representing film and TV actors, opposed the prosecutors’ contention that actors were responsible for ensuring that the guns they were handed on set were safe to handle, saying, “an actor’s job is not to be a firearms or weapons expert.”
The most widely used written protocols around gun use on sets are outlined in documents called Safety Bulletins No. 1 and No. 2, which were created by a team of representatives from the unions and the major studios, and which will most likely be used as evidence in court.
The fatal shooting of Hutchins prompted the first revisions to those safety guidelines in two decades. The new guidelines, published in December, are longer and more detailed than the old ones, and stress that safety meetings should include instructions on how to distinguish between blank ammunition, which have gunpowder but not projectiles, and dummy rounds, which are inert and cannot be fired.
As before, they make it clear that live ammunition is not supposed to be used on sets. “Live ammunition,” the bulletin says, “is never to be used on set nor brought onto any work location, including any studio lot, stage or location” except in rare cases if it meets specific exceptions.

70QDPI84V2_WAFVBFDYXX5W3K0,Aryan Nations would not qualify as ‘domestic terrorism’ under this new Idaho bill,Ian Max Stevenson,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/aryan-nations-not-qualify-domestic-110000349.html,"Idaho lawmakers have introduced bills that civil rights organizations say weaken state laws aimed at combating homegrown, organized violence and extremist groups.
The two bills would remove Idaho’s ban on private armed militias and institute a definition of “domestic terrorism” that excludes most American groups conducting organized violence.
Senate Bill 1220, from Senate Majority Leader Kelly Anthon, R-Burley, would add a definition for “domestic terrorism” but would require such activities to be “done in cooperation with any foreign terrorist organization,” according to the bill. The legislation would also add a similar requirement for the definition of “terrorism.”
Anthon told lawmakers that his motivation for introducing the bill, which has failed to pass in three prior years, is to prevent Americans “exercising their rights” from being labeled as domestic terrorists.
Anthon noted a controversy in 2021, when the National School Boards Association sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking him to look into threats and intimidation of school board members. Threats against local elected officials rose in prevalence amid fierce debates about school curricula and COVID-19 policies. The association said at the time that some of the threats could be classified as domestic terrorism, and the U.S. attorney general later issued a memorandum that federal law enforcement would investigate criminal behavior directed at school staff members.
Anthon said the bill would prevent federal authorities from telling a local sheriff that a person who has not been charged or gone to trial is a domestic terrorist, and “you need to go round him up.” Anthon did not provide examples of Americans being labeled domestic terrorists and arrested without cause, but told the Idaho Statesman “you don’t have to be put in prison to have your life ruined by a label of domestic terrorism.”
“I think there have been policy decisions, particularly on the part of the federal government, that threaten our rights as American citizens,” Anthon told a legislative committee.
Amy Marshak, legal director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law, said that the altered definition of domestic terrorism flips the federal definition “entirely on its head.”
While federal law can punish people for providing “material support” to a foreign terrorist organization, there is no comparable crime for domestic terrorism. But federal law nonetheless defines domestic terrorism, and the term can be used to increase the sentence of a person convicted of a related crime.
The federal definition of “domestic terrorism” includes acts that are “dangerous to human life” and appear to “intimidate or coerce a civilian population,” “influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion,” “affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping” and occur primarily within the U.S.
Homegrown extremist groups could still potentially be penalized under Idaho’s Terrorist Control Act for “conspiring” to injure or threaten other citizens, Marshak said. But the proposed changes would make organized violence from groups like the Ku Klux Klan or the neo-Nazi group Aryan Nations, which was based out of North Idaho, subject to the statute’s lowest penalties — up to 10 years in prison versus up to life in prison — because they would no longer meet the definition of “domestic terrorism.” Only if the violence were in coordination with a foreign extremist group would the law’s harshest penalties apply.
“It would really fundamentally alter that law” and “turn it into the opposite definition from what it is generally understood as,” she said. In doing so, it would restrict “the prohibitions on dangerous, violent behavior that have been prohibited in Idaho for a long time now.”
The bill would also rescind a provision in the law aimed at combating “civil disorder” through organized violence that has been a part of Idaho law since the 1980s. Twenty-six states have laws on the books that prohibit such “civil disorder,” which the Anti-Defamation League, an organization founded in the early 1900s to combat antisemitism, pushed for to combat extremist violence. Idaho passed its own law in the late 1980s, when state officials were hoping to restrict the Aryan Nations. A splinter group later assassinated a Jewish radio host in Denver and bombed a synagogue.
“It’s stunning to me that we’re 40 years away and our memory is so short,” Stephen Paolini, the ADL’s associate regional director for the Pacific Northwest, told the Statesman. “This statute was designed to address groups like the Aryan Nations.” He added that the ADL has tracked a rise in extremist violence in recent years.
He said the altered definition would not only be inconsistent with federal law but also other law enforcement entities nationwide, which acknowledge terrorism grown in the U.S.
“You’re really just saying there is only one kind of terrorism, and it’s foreign terrorism,” he said.
Anthon specified that, in cases where extremist organizations like white supremacist groups commit organized violence, other state laws already criminalize that behavior.
Paolini argued that terrorism statutes are designed to bring additional penalties to bear on efforts to dismantle the government, or to terrorize minority groups, which the law change would undo.
Republican lawmakers Friday voted to recommend the bill’s passage and moved it to the Senate floor. Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, opposed the recommendation, while Senate Minority Leader James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, supported it “with some reluctance.”
At the same committee meeting, Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Viola, introduced a bill to repeal Idaho’s prohibition on private militias.
The law forbids a “body of men” outside of the government from associating “together as a military company or organization, or parade in public with firearms in any city or town of this state,” but the law is currently not enforced, according to previous Statesman reporting.
Foreman, who introduced a similar bill last year that failed, said he thinks the law infringes on Americans’ constitutional rights to bear arms and peacefully assemble.
“Freedom of assembly is a right that is not predicated on the citizens’ agreement to refrain from carrying firearms,” he said.
“If we try to limit constitutional rights for anybody … to enhance safety, we take the first step down the road where someday none of us will have constitutional rights,” Foreman said.
Senate Pro Tem Chuck Winder, R-Boise, said he wants to explore ways of implementing an “enhanced crime” when gun-toting bands intimidate groups of peaceful protesters.
Ruchti said he thinks that First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly can be threatened by guns and therefore can conflict with the Second Amendment.
“That’s what concerns me, is we’re somehow equating them,” he said. “We’re somehow saying that they can be used simultaneously when I don’t think that’s accurate. I just don’t think they mix well.”
Wintrow was the lone no vote on introducing the bill to the Senate.
Paolini, of the ADL, said his organization also had serious concerns about repealing the militia prohibition and pointed to an instance in 2022 when members of a far-right organization called the Patriot Front were arrested after descending on a Pride parade, many with shields and shin guards, according to The Lewiston Tribune. Some of those arrested have been convicted of conspiracy to riot.
“When groups are acting that way, particularly when they have these kinds of long-term, violent movements behind them, it really runs the risk of creating conditions for really serious violence in our communities,” he said."

If you want to skip our discussion on the statistics related to the Muslim American community, you can go directly to the 5 States with the Highest Muslim Population in the US.
Islam ranks as the third-largest religion in the United States, following Christianity and Judaism. According to the latest studies, there are about 4.45 million Muslims in the country, accounting for approximately 1% of the total population. Muslim population in the US has been on the rise for more than a decade due to high fertility rates and migration of Muslims into the country. Consequently, the number of mosques has more than doubled during the last two decades. The Muslim population in the US increased significantly during the twentieth century. About 1.7 million Muslims became legal permanent residents of the US within a span of just over two decades from 1991 to 2012. About 72% of American Muslims are immigrants or a part of the ""second generation."" They are also America’s youngest religious community, with approximately a quarter aged between 18 and 24 years. Muslim Americans make up one of the most racially diverse religious communities in the country, with 25% blacks, 24% whites, 18% Asians, 18% Arabs, 7% mixed races, and 5% Hispanics. However, the majority of Muslims are immigrants, with 58% being born outside the USA. The Muslim population is also substantially dispersed in the country, with Virginia and Arizona being amongst the states with the highest Muslim population in the US. A study by the Pew Research Center forecasts that the number of Muslims in the US will reach 8.1 million or 2.1% of the total population by 2050, making Islam the second largest religion in the country. You can also check out the 25 Countries where Muslim Population will Increase the Most by 2050 here.
Despite being a minority, Muslims in the United States are finding success within society and are more optimistic, as per a survey by the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding (ISPU). Muslims in America have made a significant contribution to small businesses, which are crucial for the US economy. About 8% of Muslims have their own business and employ 8 other people, on average, which amounts to about 1.37 billion jobs. The number of Muslim-owned businesses has reached 96,000 in New York City and 36,000 in Michigan. Various databases show that American Muslim-owned businesses are primarily concentrated in New York, New Jersey, California, Illinois, Florida, and Michigan, with fewer such businesses in Alabama, Texas, or Tennessee. These Muslim entrepreneurs serve both the domestic and global “halal” economy with their products. The global halal market is huge, with Muslims spending $2 trillion on halal products in 2019 alone.  These products include halal food, modest fashion, media, and recreation, as well as halal pharmaceuticals, Muslim-friendly tourism, halal cosmetics, and Islamic finance. Notable businesses owned by Muslim Americans include Muzz (a Muslim matchmaking app), Launchgood (a crowdfunding platform for Muslim Entrepreneurship), and Splashgear (an apparel company providing modest watersports gear for Muslim women).
The rising Muslim population has also led to an increase in demand for Shariah-compliant stocks. These stocks are from businesses that conduct their activities in accordance with Shariah rules and refrain from gaining exposure to sectors like alcohol, tobacco, and gambling. As per the Islamic Finance Development Report 2021 by Refinitiv, the cumulative value of Islamic financial assets stood at $3.37 trillion by the end of 2020. This marked an increase from $2.96 trillion in the preceding year and from $2.2 trillion in 2015. Furthermore, the year 2021 observed a record launch of over 900 Islamic exchange-traded funds (ETFs) globally and attracted more than $1 trillion in net inflows. Some of the popular halal dividend stocks to buy include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT).
Here’s what Appleseed Fund said about Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:
“During the most recent quarter, Appleseed Fund added three new equity holdings: Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Stanley Black & Decker (SWK), and Synovus Financial (SNV). Medtronic is the world’s largest device manufacturer, and it holds the number one or number two market share in most of its product segments. Medtronic’s business is heavily weighted towards complicated in-patient procedures, which are typically quite profitable. Industry dynamics are quite attractive with an aging global population and the growth of improved healthcare in emerging markets; furthermore, most of its segments are highly concentrated with just 2-3 players that split each segment’s market share, affording the key participants with significant economies of scale and pricing power. The Company has been recently addressing several temporary headwinds including a strong dollar, inflation, a delayed recovery in surgical volumes from the coronavirus pandemic, and supply chain issues. Once these issues reach the rearview mirror, the Company’s growth and margin expansion plans should transform into reality.”

In recent years, there has been rapid growth in the Muslim population within Arizona due to immigration and conversion. The Muslim community living in Arizona is quite diverse, with residents having roots in countries from South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. Muslims in Arizona have also become more involved in community activities and politics in the past decade.  The growth of the Muslim population in the state has led to the establishment of various mosques and Islamic centers, including the Islamic Community Center of Phoenix (ICCP) and Tempe Mosque.
Percentage of Muslim Population: 1.9%
Total Muslim Population: 131,749
In Massachusetts, most Muslims live in the Greater Boston Area, where you can find various mosques, Islamic schools, and community organizations. Prominent Mosques and Muslim community centers in Massachusetts include The Islamic Center of New England (ICNE), The Islamic Society of Greater Worcester (ISGW), and The Muslim American Community Center of Lexington (MACCL). These organizations not only provide places of worship for Muslims in the area but also impart Islamic Education and host social events for the community. Massachusetts is in the eighth position on our list of the states with the highest Muslim population in the US.

With roots in various countries such as Bosnia, Somalia, and Iraq, the Muslims of Minnesota contribute to the state’s rich cultural diversity. The community includes Muslims from not only different cultures and backgrounds but different sects as well. Hence, there are many mosques and community centers in Minnesota catering to diverse cultural needs. Among these are the Dar Al-Hijrah Mosque in Minneapolis, the Islamic Community Center of Minnesota (ICCM), and MAS Minnesota.
Percentage of Muslim Population: 2%
Total Muslim Population: 169,371
The number of Muslims in Virginia rose during the 20th century, particularly after the immigration from Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1990s. With the growth of the Muslim community of Virginia, several mosques and Muslim cultural centers were built throughout the state. The proximity of Virginia to Washington, D.C. has attracted many Muslim immigrants to it. Reputed mosques and cultural centers of Virginia include Dar Al-Noor Islamic Community Center in Manassas, All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) in Sterling, and Islamic Society of Greater Richmond (ISGR).
The rising Muslim population in the US has also led to an increase in demand for popular halal dividend stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT).

7BJUUR9ZNG_SYH23U4R1QFOPND,Mark Lane: Start your engines! County Council wants ATVs in state forest,Mark Lane,"January 22, 2024 at 1:00 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/mark-lane-start-engines-county-160015464.html,"The easiest way for local government to make a potentially controversial decision is to do it without notice. Better: Do it without notice in the last minutes of a long meeting. Better still: Do it without notice in the last minutes of the last meeting of the year as the holidays approach. Which was how the Volusia County Council decided to advocate for opening Tiger Bay State Forest to all-terrain vehicles.
Enjoy your Christmas gift, tree-huggers!
Councilman Danny Robins, District 3, was particularly contemptuous when later, at the first meeting of the year, environmental advocates complained about being left in the dark. “We vote on things that aren’t on the agenda possibly all the time,” he said.
Which is true. It’s an arrogant practice that erodes public trust every time it happens. It shouldn’t be the norm, but it happens all the time.
The last time the County Council wanted to turn the state forest into an ATV track, it also did so without putting anything on the agenda. In 2019, the council took a surprise vote to support ATV traffic in the protected area. The backlash was immediate, and the council reversed itself.
Previously, when this issue came up in 2013, the council had made the mistake of telling people it would vote on the matter. That prompted 27 people to show up to debate the measure. This went on for hours before the council voted it down.
Another way to get around public outcry over a policy change is to go over the heads of local government. That’s what happened in 2015 when ATV supporters persuaded then-state Rep. Dwayne Taylor to introduce a local bill in the Florida Legislature that would have set aside up to 10% of the forest for ATVs.
But because of objections by the Florida Forest Service and local environmentalists, the late Sen. Dorothy Hukill said she would not introduce a Senate companion bill. That effectively killed the measure.
Political memory in Florida is goldfish-bowl short, so perhaps current council members did not realize they were jumping into a long-running hot issue.

Previously: Volusia's call to open roads to ATVs at Tiger Bay kicks up controversy
Forest managers have continually warned of serious environmental harm, increased maintenance costs, and conflicts with other trail users if the forest allowed ATVs. Parks, forests and conservation areas that allow ATVs constantly contend with ATVs roaring off established trails and tearing up vegetation. Hikers, mountain bike riders, hunters, anglers, birders and horse riders complain of noise, pollution, trail damage, and ATV riders pushing them off their customary trails.
Although Robins pointed to Big Cypress National Preserve as a place that successfully allows ATVs, the practice is controversial there as well. It’s been the subject of persistent complaints about habitat destruction as well as multiple lawsuits.
Tiger Bay is a lightly staffed state forest where it would be difficult to police ATV activity with the result that rogue ATVers could turn the place into a high-decibel sand pit.
I don't know why local politicians are so eager to privilege people gunning their motors in protected areas over those who like to walk and ride horses in them. This isn’t about extreme environmentalists wanting to close the area to humans; it’s about the best way to manage the forest to preserve it for future non-destructive public enjoyment.
The council needs to reconsider this issue, and when they do so, they should allow the public to know what it’s doing beforehand. And it should take a minute to listen to the professionals responsible for managing the forest. The Forest Service opposed opening the area to ATVs in 2013, 2015 and 2019 and reiterated that opposition this time around.
Fortunately, it is up to the state, not the County Council, to allow ATVs in the forest. But even if the county’s letter in support doesn’t decide anything in the long run, its lack of concern for the environmental consequences and its attempt to blindside environmentalists should concern voters.

7BXWIOWKUR_F3QAGNHVXPGFGDU,The inventor of the market's most famous recession indicator is confident the inverted yield curve is accurately calling a slowdown in 2024,Phil Rosen,"January 21, 2024 at 10:17 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inventor-markets-most-famous-recession-011701631.html,"An inverted yield curve has preceded every recession since 1969.
The inventor of the famed indicator said it is accurately predicting a downturn this year.
When the yield curve inverted in November 2022, he said it was a false signal.
Wall Street has ramped up its soft-landing calls for 2024, but a renowned economic expert who popularized the most famous recession indicator in markets says to expect a downturn this year.
Campbell Harvey is a Canadian economist and researcher at Duke University whose work showed that, for decades, an inverted yield curve — that is, when short-term Treasury yields exceed the yield on longer-term government bonds — has preceded as US recession.
Dating back to 1968, the indicator's predictive power is eight for eight, with zero false signals. Harvey told host Jack Farley on the Forward Guidance podcast Thursday that given that yields inverted in the fall of 2022, this suggests a recession will happen in the first or second quarter of this year.
He had predicted previously that the indicator may turn out to be wrong this time, given the strength in the labor market and other positive economic data. However, he's reversed that outlook.
""I had some credibility in saying 'my model could be wrong' because it's my model,"" Harvey said. ""Essentially I was saying it might be possible to dodge a recession, but this was really contingent on the Fed standing down — and this is one year ago — so standing down and not hiking rates any further. And that is not what happened.""
The Federal Reserve hiked rates 11 times in the 2022-2023 cycle, spiking its benchmark rate from near 0% to a range of 5.25%-5.50%.
""As a result, I've kind of revised my opinion,"" he continued. ""Given the circumstances, I think it is likely we do see much slower growth in 2024.""
He said the inverted yield curve, in one sense, is a self-fulfilling prophecy as it signals to companies and investors that a slowdown is looming, which then alters spending and business behavior and ultimately leads to less activity.
""It makes the yield curve causal,"" Harvey said. ""This causality channel is much different than in the past.""
And the inversion itself also isn't the final call on a recession, as experts have noted that it is actually when the curve de-inverts and long-term yields again exceed those of short-term bonds that signals a downturn has arrived.
Given its perfect track record, Harvey noted that the indicator is currently allowing firms to make smarter decisions in the current landscape and operate with more caution. Unlike the global financial crisis in 2008, he said companies are more strategic and managing risk, so he's hopeful that there won't be severe layoffs coming.
""Indeed it could come to the point where the indicator could come to the point where the indicator just loses its ability to forecast,"" he said, ""but I don't think we're there yet.""

7G1SRUSOD5_PC2CIYNY1C7EFGQ,Ron DeSantis drops out of GOP presidential primary,Jenna Moon,"January 22, 2024 at 5:11 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-desantis-drops-gop-presidential-201157620.html,"Insights from New York Magazine, Bloomberg, and Semafor
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the U.S. Republican presidential primary on Sunday and endorsed former President Donald Trump two days before GOP voters in New Hampshire go to the polls.
“Nobody worked harder, and we left it all out on the field,” DeSantis said in a video announcing his exit from the race. He said he didn’t “have a clear path to victory.”
The Florida governor’s second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses did little for him in New Hampshire, where tracking polls showed him stuck in the single digits. “He’s closer to zero than he is to me,” former South Caronina governor Nikki Haley told reporters at a Thursday campaign stop.
The final DeSantis stops in New Hampshire were in small venues, where political tourists and college students often got prime seats. Before a Friday night rally in Nashua, the perennial candidate Vermin Supreme climbed on a stage set up for DeSantis, leading a half-amused cheers from the crowd for “free ponies” and “zombie power.”
“I’m the ghost of Bootgates past!” said the candidate, who campaigns with an upside-down boot on his head. DeSantis told audiences that he would out-work both Haley and Trump, taking dozens of questions and pointing out that neither rival was being so open with New Hampshire voters.
“Trump’s running for his issues, Haley’s running for her issues — I’m running for your issues and your family’s issues,” DeSantis said, a line he’d developed in Iowa after Haley was endorsed by Americans for Prosperity and her super PAC got a check from Democratic donor Reid Hoffman.
Signs began emerging in December that DeSantis didn’t have a future in the election, and there was a quick turnaround in support for his candidacy. Never Back Down, a super PAC supporting the Florida governor, started losing staffers in November. The super PAC handled many parts of DeSantis’s campaign — but in managing so much, it may have done the candidate a disservice, Semafor’s David Weigel noted. “One reason is subjective, though it’s an opinion shared by plenty of operatives: Its ads haven’t been very good,” he wrote.
As Never Back Down’s leadership became consumed by in-fighting, donors and campaign staff began to feel skeptical about DeSantis’s chances in the primary, Bloomberg reported in December. Campaign “operatives privately say Never Back Down has spent money irresponsibly,” Bloomberg noted, while the super PAC viewed DeSantis’s Florida campaign staff “as a group of novices, who have no national political experience.”
DeSantis struggled to gain a foothold in his native Florida, and the polling gap between the governor and Trump continued to widen throughout his campaign. The state represented something of a turf war between Trump and DeSantis, and local government leaders rallied their support behind Trump. Among the issues DeSantis faced was upending the cult of personality which follows the former president, Jonathan Chait argued for New York Magazine. While Chait believed it was likely that DeSantis would be the favorite to win the primary, that changed after it became clear that Trump’s sway over voters would not so easily transfer to DeSantis.
People who initially rallied behind the governor were “disappointed and demoralized,” one source told Politico in July, adding they expected other supporters would bail on the campaign if its trajectory didn’t turn around. DeSantis shied away from attacking other candidates with the same vigor they showed him, and refused to engage with the mainstream media, election watchers noted to Politico. “More than anything,” the governor needed to “focus on defining himself,” one analyst said."
7GG0IJ5SH9_3I468S2HGMXM8RM,A Look At The Fair Value Of Kotra Industries Berhad (KLSE:KOTRA),editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 9:11 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-kotra-industries-001103743.html,"Kotra Industries Berhad's estimated fair value is RM5.00 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
Current share price of RM4.80 suggests Kotra Industries Berhad is potentially trading close to its fair value
The average premium for Kotra Industries Berhad's competitorsis currently 36%
Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Kotra Industries Berhad (KLSE:KOTRA) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.
Check out our latest analysis for Kotra Industries Berhad
We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Seeing as no analyst estimates of free cash flow are available to us, we have extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the company's last reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = RM311m
After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (3.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.0%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = RM54m× (1 + 3.6%) ÷ (9.0%– 3.6%) = RM1.0b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= RM1.0b÷ ( 1 + 9.0%)10= RM431m
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is RM742m. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of RM4.8, the company appears about fair value at a 4.0% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Kotra Industries Berhad as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Strength
Currently debt free.
Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.
Weakness
Earnings declined over the past year.
Opportunity
Annual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the Malaysian market.
Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.
Threat
Dividends are not covered by cash flow.
Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

The national bakery and cafe chain has been hit with its third lawsuit connected to Charged Lemonade. The first two were prompted by the deaths of 21-year-old Sarah Katz in 2022 and 46-year-old Dennis Brown in 2023. According to a report by NBC News, both had health conditions that required them to avoid caffeine and energy drinks, but an attorney for the families claimed the company presented the lemonade in a way that made it look harmless. Now, yet another lawsuit has been filed, this one by a Rhode Island woman who claims she experienced health issues after consuming the beverage.
According to 28-year-old Lauren Skerritt, the lemonade left her with ""permanent cardiac injuries."" Per the filing, Skerritt was an athlete who didn't have health problems before drinking 2.5 servings of the lemonade last April. After consuming the beverage, she had palpitations and dizziness. Skerritt went to the emergency room and discovered she had atrial fibrillation, also known as AFib. Characterized by a fast and irregular heart rhythm, the condition raises the risk of having a stroke, heart failure, and other difficulties. In Skerritt's case, a series of symptoms has allegedly persisted, including an irregularly rapid heartbeat, brain fog, and weakness.

Although the company appears to have lowered the caffeine content in its Charged Lemonades to a maximum of 236 milligrams of caffeine following the controversy, at the time of all three incidents, the sip featured up to 390 milligrams per large, 30-ounce serving. That's the equivalent of about six shots of espresso, which contains around 64 milligrams of caffeine per ounce (per the USDA), or nearly five cans of Red Bull, which contain 80 milligrams of caffeine per 8.4-ounce can.
The Food and Drug Administration has indicated that many ""healthy adults"" might drink as much as 400 milligrams of caffeine without suffering negative side effects. Legal filings allege that part of the lemonade's danger lies in the fact that Panera advertised its Charged Lemonade as containing ""as much caffeine as [its] dark roast coffee."" However, a 30-ounce cup of Panera's dark roast iced coffee contains 137 milligrams less caffeine than a large order of the Charged Lemonade did at the time. The lemonade was also available as a self-serve option alongside less caffeinated beverages.
Panera's Charged Lemonades now sit behind the counter to be served by employees, and the company issued a disclaimer stating that the items are ""not recommended for children, people sensitive to caffeine, pregnant or nursing women."" It also advises consumers to drink the beverages in moderation.

7JGP0WSDBP_CMTKWP1Y219B2L1,Comedy's Truthiness Problem,Peter Suderman,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·11 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/comedys-truthiness-problem-110058825.html,"In October 2005, Stephen Colbert invented a new word: truthiness.
In a short monologue for The Colbert Report, a satirical show where the comedian played a caricature of a conservative blowhard cable news anchor, he took issue with an approach to news that relied on facts and credible sources. ""I don't trust books,"" Colbert said. ""They're all fact, no heart. And that's exactly what's pulling our country apart today."" Truthiness emanated from feeling rather than hard evidence, affirming beliefs backed by strong emotions.
This was during the George W. Bush administration, in the post-9/11 era, so inevitably Colbert brought up the war in Iraq. ""Maybe there are a few missing pieces to the rationale for war. But doesn't taking Saddam out feel like the right thing? Right here,"" he said, pointing to his belly, ""right here in the gut. Because that's where the truth comes from—the gut."" In closing, Colbert promised to maintain a posture of truthiness as he conveyed the news to his viewers. ""Anyone can read the news to you,"" he said, deadpan. ""I promise to feel the news at you.""
Truthiness entered the popular lexicon. Today, multiple dictionaries include the word. The general concept, sometimes but not always attached to the word, has become a prominent and recurring criticism of right-wing politics and journalism. Broadly speaking, the argument was that the Republican Party and the American right consistently ignored fact-based rigor when such rigor would prove inconvenient. As political discussion migrated to social media, the critique followed, with Democrats increasingly prone to warning about misinformation and disinformation online.
Colbert transitioned to a new role as a conventional late-night talk-show host, playing himself rather than a comic caricature. But he continued to emphasize that the right wing was prone to exaggerations, telling omissions, conspiracy theories, and outright falsehoods. In early 2022, he released a fictional Spotify playlist for vaccine misinformation, in response to what he said were harmful inaccuracies spread on the service by popular podcaster Joe Rogan. A gag ad for the playlist that aired on his late night show pronounced: ""We hit shuffle on your understanding of basic facts."" Lol.
***
One wonders what Colbert feels, in his gut, about Hasan Minhaj.
Like Colbert, Minhaj is a comedian by trade—he has two Netflix specials to his credit. And like Colbert, Minhaj often wields his comedy to political ends. Minhaj is Indian-American, and his stand-up specials tell personal stories of racism and mistreatment. He frequently criticizes former President Donald Trump and the post-9/11 domestic security apparatus.
From 2018 through 2020, Minhaj hosted Patriot Act, a left-leaning news-and-comedy Netflix series. Patriot Act was reminiscent of The Daily Show, Comedy Central's longrunning pseudo-newscast, which from 1997 through 2005 featured Colbert as a ""correspondent."" After Daily Show host Trevor Noah announced in late 2022 he was leaving the show, Minhaj was widely reported as a top contender for the slot.
The Daily Show is a comedy program, with jokes and snark and play-acted absurdities. But it is also a current affairs program designed to inform its viewers. During the peak of its cultural influence—in the mid-'00s, when it was hosted by Jon Stewart—pundits occasionally grumbled that too many young people were getting their news from Stewart.
The show faded in relevance after Stewart left, but it spawned several imitators, including HBO's Last Week Tonight, hosted by John Oliver (another Daily Show alum), and even another Jon Stewart series, The Problem with Jon Stewart, on the Apple TV+ streaming service (recently canceled). Liberal comics weren't just mocking the news. They were delivering it and explaining it, with clarity and moral forcefulness.
Minhaj seemed to fit into this tradition. So it was notable that when Clare Malone profiled him for The New Yorker in September, she reported that she could not verify multiple stories that Minhaj had told during his stand-up specials. Invariably, these were personal stories designed to make a political point, generally about state or personal mistreatment of people like Minhaj.
One story from the Netflix specials revolves around a man who became close with Minhaj, his family, and their mosque in 2002. The man, dubbed ""Brother Eric,"" was white; he claimed to be a Muslim convert. After insinuating himself into their lives, Minhaj said, Brother Eric tried to coax some of the young men at the mosque into talking about jihad.
Minhaj recounts believing that Eric was a law enforcement informant; as a sort of gag, Minhaj says he told Brother Eric that he hoped to get a pilot's license. This resulted in a visit from the police, as Minhaj told it, who knocked his head into the hood of a police car. Years later, Minhaj says his family watched a news account in which a man resembling Brother Eric was revealed to be an FBI informant. The young Minhaj, it seems, had seen through the ruse.
Almost none of this is true. There was a man resembling Brother Eric who acted as an FBI informant. But as Malone reported, he was in prison in 2002 and didn't begin working with the feds until 2006. He did no work in the area Minhaj's story was said to have taken place.
In other words, the time, the place, and specifics of Minhaj's personal experience—his eyewitness account, leading to a supposed violent encounter with police—were totally fabricated.
In another anecdote from the special, Minhaj recalls receiving an envelope of white powder at his home. In Minhaj's telling, the suspicious white powder came into contact with his young daughter, who was rushed to the hospital.
But Malone found no police account that matched this event. In an interview with Minhaj, the comedian ""admitted that his daughter had never been exposed to a white powder, and that she hadn't been hospitalized."" Instead, he'd received a powder in the mail and joked to his wife it might have been anthrax.
Minhaj, confronted with reported evidence that many of his stories have been false or heavily exaggerated, defended his work. ""Every story in my style is built around a seed of truth,"" he told Malone. ""My comedy Arnold Palmer is seventy percent emotional truth—this happened—and then thirty percent hyperbole, exaggeration, fiction.""
Emotional truth. Put another way, Minhaj's argument was that his stories didn't need to be actually true because they felt true. Minhaj was defending truthiness as good and righteous, so long as it was in service of the proper sort of political narrative. He wasn't just reporting the news to you; he was feeling the news at you.
***
Malone's profile chronicled other purported gaps in Minhaj's stories. In one anecdote, Minhaj recounts being rejected by a prom date. She was white, he was not, and although she initially accepted his invitation, Minhaj says that at the moment he arrived at her home to pick her up, she backed out in humiliating fashion: There was another boy at her door placing a corsage. In the special, Minhaj says the reason she backed out was because her parents didn't want her taking photos with a person of color.
After Malone interviewed the woman from the story, whose name has not been made public, she reported a different version of the events. She told Malone the rejection happened, but not on prom night; it occurred days prior. ""Minhaj acknowledged that this was correct,"" Malone wrote, ""but he said that the two of them had long carried different understandings of her rejection."" In the following sentence, she quotes him saying that as a ""brown kid"" in California, he'd been conditioned to ""just take it.""
""The 'emotional truth' of the story he told onstage was resonant and justified the fabrication of details,"" Malone wrote. According to the reporter, the woman also said she'd been invited to a performance of a stand-up routine in which Minhaj told the prom night story. ""She had initially interpreted the invitation as an attempt to rekindle an old friendship, but she now believes the move was meant to humiliate her.""
Weeks after Malone's story appeared, the comedian released a video response. The video runs a little more than 20 minutes, and in it Minhaj claims Malone excised important portions of his quotes and distorted their meaning.
In it, Minhaj argues that the New Yorker story was ""needlessly misleading."" The largest portion of his response is focused on the prom night story. He shows emails between himself and the woman in the story appearing to show that she requested an invite to his performance. He also takes issue with Malone's use of the ""different understandings of her rejection"" quote, arguing that Malone's presentation lacked context and that it implied he had made up the racial motivation for the rejection. He delivers a fuller version of the quote that more clearly makes his point: that the woman didn't understand how much he'd been hurt by the incident.
The video then addresses the Brother Eric and anthrax stories. In both cases, he admits the stories didn't happen the way he told them onstage. Although he says he had interactions with undercover law enforcement, ""it didn't go down exactly like this, so I understand why people are upset.""
Introducing the anthrax story, he recounts some details from the comedy special, then says, ""This, as you know, is not how it went down."" He apologized for embellishing the stories, but he defends his embellishments as necessary to spotlight some larger truth. Over the course of the video, he argues that his falsehoods (though he does not use that word) were necessary to make his stories clearer, more accessible, more relatable to his audience.
Was there a bit of truthiness in The New Yorker's exposé? Or was Minhaj's defense itself an exercise in obfuscation?
A Slate review of Minhaj's defense concluded that ""almost everything the New Yorker article alleges appears to line up with Minhaj's version of the facts, except for some of the details of the prom date story."" After Minhaj posted his video, Malone tweeted: ""Hasan Minhaj confirms in this video that he selectively presents information and embellishes to make a point: exactly what we reported."" The New Yorker stood by the story.
***
One might argue that comedy specials do not have a journalistic responsibility to hew to the truth. Minhaj has indicated that he draws a line between his stand-up work and his more journalistic output on Patriot Act.
Certainly, Minhaj is far from the first comedian to exaggerate, embellish, or outright lie for laughs. Indeed, there is a long and noble tradition of lying for laughter. If a silly story makes you guffaw in amusement, there is no need for it to be true.
But Minhaj's stand-up fabrications weren't just jokes. In some cases they weren't even jokes at all, and weren't presented as tall tales: They were presented as clear-eyed truths about American prejudice. In that New Yorker story, Minhaj explicitly defended the use of falsehoods to make a point more powerful. ""The punch line,"" he told Malone, ""is worth the fictionalized premise."" In his defense video, he says he ""made artistic choices to express myself and drive home larger issues affecting me and my community.""
Moreover, although Patriot Act had a research department with fact checkers, Minhaj reportedly found them frustrating. ""In one instance,"" Malone wrote, ""Minhaj grew frustrated that fact-checking was stymying the creative flow during a final rewrite, and a pair of female researchers were asked to leave the writers' room.""
Minhaj's work on Patriot Act was what made him a potential successor to Stewart and Noah on The Daily Show. But in late October, online news outlet Puck reported that although Minhaj had nearly closed a deal to take the reins at The Daily Show, he would not be getting the gig.
When Stewart left The Daily Show in 2015, he used his final monologue to issue a warning about the world of news and commentary. ""Bullshit is everywhere,"" he said. ""There is very little in life that has not been, in some ways, infused with bullshit."" While some minor exaggeration was innocuous and even necessary to function socially, he said, viewers needed to be on the lookout for ""the more pernicious bullshit. Your premeditated, institutional bullshit, designed to obscure and distract. Designed by who? The bullshitocracy.""
He had some good news, though. ""Bullshitters have gotten pretty lazy,"" Stewart said. ""And their work is easily detected.""

On Tuesday, she intends to back former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to send a clear message to both parties.
“We need to have some new ideas and a new, younger generation coming in,” Brown, an undeclared voter, said as she clutched a Haley 2024 yard sign freshly autographed by the candidate. “Haley is energized. I think she can do a lot for our country.”
Brown is a voter stuck in the middle, one of thousands of undeclared and independent residents who make up a plurality of the Granite State’s electorate and a critical part of Haley’s coalition. Her chances in New Hampshire – and by extension, the fate of her campaign – likely hinge on how many independents vote for her in the state’s primary Tuesday.
As of Friday, 344,335 voters in New Hampshire were registered as undeclared, making up nearly 40% of the electorate.
Haley’s campaign is targeting Republicans and undeclared voters from the suburbs to the seacoast, advisers said, particularly in precincts where Trump underperformed other Republicans, such as Gov. Chris Sununu. Though former President Donald Trump won the 2016 New Hampshire GOP primary, he lost the state in the general election in both 2016 and 2020.
A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley is backed by a majority – 58% – of registered undeclared voters, but the former president has the support of 67% of registered Republicans.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who ended his campaign on Sunday afternoon, was backed by just 6% of New Hampshire GOP voters in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would have needed to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
A win in New Hampshire could offer Haley’s campaign the momentum, and donor money, necessary to compete in South Carolina on February 24 and the Super Tuesday states voting on March 5.
A loss, however, might hasten the speed at which the Republican Party coalesces around Trump.
Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who ended his own presidential bid in November, became the latest former candidate to endorse Trump at a rally in Concord on Friday. Haley dismissed the endorsement, saying in a statement that Trump was lining up “Washington insiders” despite vowing to drain the swamp.
“But the fellas are gonna do what the fellas are gonna do,” Haley said.
As Trump campaigns in New Hampshire, the former president is trying to keep Republicans in line – and out of reach for Haley.
“Nikki Haley in particular is counting on the Democrats and liberals to infiltrate your Republican primary,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Portsmouth on Wednesday.
His rallying cry is false. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the Republican primary, and the deadline for registering as a Republican or undeclared voter was October. Undeclared voters have the option to choose either a Democratic or Republican primary ballot on Election Day.
Greg Moore, a senior adviser for AFP Action, the political network backed by conservative billionaire Charles Koch that has thrown its resources behind Haley, said Friday that the group’s data shows the former governor’s base includes conservative voters. AFP Action, which endorsed Haley in November, has contacted more than 210,000 people in New Hampshire, Moore said.
“I think some of the narrative is that it’s all moderates for Haley and all conservatives for Trump,” Moore said. “I know that’s not true.”
What the former president may not know is that Haley’s rallies and town hall meetings in New Hampshire last week were filled with voters like Susan Rice of Rochester, who twice voted for Trump.
Rice, who owns a yarn business in New Hampshire and Maine, was invited to the White House in 2018 during the Trump administration for an event to showcase small-business leaders. She said she believed it was time for the country to move on.
“I’m a staunch Republican and I have been my entire life,” Rice said. “I think it’s time to have a woman as a president. I like her foreign policies and I like the fact that she has a good understanding of our southern border and what she wants to do for that.”
She said she was exhausted by Trump and excited by Haley’s potential to rebuild the Republican Party.
“I don’t necessarily worry about the court cases,” Rice said. “But it’s the baggage, and honestly, sometimes what comes out of his mouth and – how do I put this diplomatically – the name-calling, the putting other people down.”
Michael Lewis, a Hollis resident, said he supported the way Trump approached the economy, the border and America’s relationship with NATO, but he couldn’t vote for a presidential candidate “whose age is past life expectancy.”
He also expressed doubts that Trump will still be eligible to run for president in the general election.
“I think the sequence is there’s campaigning, then there’s the [Republican National] Convention, then there’s going to be the conviction of Donald Trump,” Lewis said. “There’s going to have to be an alternative. I think she’s the answer.”
Still, while some former Trump voters are open, even eager, to vote for Haley, the former president’s base in New Hampshire remains strong.
“MAGA is not going to be with her,” Trump told Fox News on Thursday.
That was the sentiment at the Saddle Up Saloon in Kingston on Friday afternoon, where GOP Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio rallied a few dozen Trump supporters. In interviews, attendees mentioned several criticisms Haley’s rivals have leveled against her foreign policy views and her conservatism.
Sylvia, a Nashua voter at the event who declined to give her last name, said she would sit out the general election if Trump made Haley his running mate.
“She’s a RINO, she’s a war monger,” she said, using the acronym for “Republican in name only.” “I’m not for her at all.”
Bill Jackson, an 86-year-old from Hampton who plans to vote for Trump, said he believed Haley has support only among elitists and echoed the former president’s comments about Democratic crossover votes.
“She’s pro-war. She’s also pro-immigration, illegal immigration,” he said. “I mean, she said we’ve got to treat these people as equals. No, we don’t, they’re illegally coming into this country.”
Trump’s campaign and allied super PACs have tried to paint Haley as weak on border security. Haley has responded by saying securing the border would be a top priority of her administration. She has characterized herself as a conservative and said her advocacy for a strong US foreign policy is meant to prevent war.
On the trail, Haley has expanded on the pitch she started making on the night of the Iowa caucuses – that she is the best chance voters have of preventing both Trump and President Joe Biden from winning a second term. She has highlighted polls that show her beating Biden in a general election by a wider margin than the GOP front-runner, and argued that she would help Republicans down ballot win House, Senate and gubernatorial races.
A Marist poll released Friday found Haley running near-even with Biden, 47% to 44%, in a New Hampshire general election matchup, while Trump trailed Biden by 7 points.
Haley has also sought to draw comparisons between Trump and Biden, from their ages to the amount of government spending they approved in office, and said both presidents come with “baggage.”
Her revamped stump speech also pushes back more aggressively against the Trump campaign’s characterization of parts of her record, including her position that the retirement age needs to be raised for people in their 20s and 30s. In a recent ad, Trump’s campaign incorrectly claimed Haley wants to limit Social Security for current beneficiaries.
Haley noted that Trump supported raising the Social Security age to 70. Trump supported raising the Social Security age in his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” but wavered on whether to cut entitlements since running for president in 2016, CNN’s KFile reported last year.
“If he’s going to lie about me, we’re going to tell the truth about him,” Haley said in Hollis on Thursday. “You’re going to see a lot of things said, but at the end of the day it’s the drama, and vengeance, and the vindictiveness that we want to get out of the way.”
The message resonated with Nancy Protzmann, an undeclared voter who attended the Hollis event and said she’s long been looking for a candidate to back against Trump. As she left the venue, she said she plans to request a Republican ballot and vote for Haley.
“I will do anything in my power to make sure that Trump does not become our next president,” Protzmann said. “But I liked what she said – and I don’t want Biden either.”
Asked whether her decision was intended to be more of an affirmative vote for Haley or a roadblock for Trump, she said ideally both.
“I hope it will be a launching pad for her, because I do think she would be a good president,” Protzmann said. “And I certainly hope it will help block him.”

7KV4VURFAZ_UJ26XRQ0WWZNWUF,Blaming Israel is an outrageous inversion of reality,Telegraph View,"January 21, 2024 at 3:00 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/blaming-israel-outrageous-inversion-reality-060000168.html,"As the Chief Rabbi writes in his Comment piece today, truth is often the first casualty in conflict. Sadly, when the world’s only Jewish state finds itself at war, Israel is too often also the first to be blamed. So it has proved in the current struggle between Israel and Hamas.
Now, in the latest topsy-turvy framing, Israel is being accused of standing in the way of Palestinian statehood.
Yet the indiscriminate savagery of October 7, which the Hamas leadership has vowed to repeat again and again, made clear what the terror group thinks about living alongside the region’s Jews. Its founding charter declares Palestine an “Islamic land”, rejects peace deals and says that Islam will obliterate Israel. Similarly, the Houthis in Yemen, currently celebrated by anti-war protesters for their attacks on Red Sea shipping, chant “Death to Israel!” – and mean it. Behind both groups stands the implacable anti-Semitism of the Islamic Republic of Iran, a state on the verge of nuclear capability which is dedicated to wiping both Israel and its inhabitants from the map.
Even the so-called peace marchers, who are eager to denounce Israel week after week, do so under banners reading “From the River to the Sea”, a call for Israel’s erasure.
A two-state solution remains the obvious and ultimate answer to the tragedy of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. Yet for more than seventy years, every offer to make a deal of this kind has been rejected by the Palestinians’ representatives. It is not Israel that is intransigent, but Palestinian elites and their misguided Western supporters. Even the PLO, seen by some as a more tractable partner than Hamas, was founded on an eliminationist agenda. It refuses to condemn Hamas’s massacre, and the Palestinian Authority continues to pay bonuses to the families of “martyrs”.
The recent breakthrough of the Abraham Accords, which saw a number of Arab states belatedly accepting Israel’s right to exist, brought fresh hope. October 7 sought to bury that hope, and was launched by fanatics who refuse to accept any terms short of Israel’s annihilation. It is the fault of Hamas, and their Iranian paymasters, that peaceful coexistence is now further off than ever.
The path to mutual peace cannot be reached without defeating Hamas. Blaming Israel is an outrageous inversion of reality.

7MFI7WMX7C_J3MHCP57HQXQ2AH,Robert Jenrick refuses to rule out running for leadership,Charles Hymas,"January 22, 2024 at 6:25 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/robert-jenrick-refuses-rule-running-212551427.html,"Robert Jenrick has refused to rule out running for the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The former immigration minister said there was a path to victory for The Tory party in this year’s general election but it would require the “toughest possible” approach to immigration.
Mr Jenrick spearheaded last week’s rebellion by Tory MPs over Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda Bill by tabling amendments to toughen it up.
He and 10 other rebel Tory MPs who were the only backbenchers to vote against the Bill’s third reading, are being called in on Monday by Simon Hart, the party’s chief whip, to explain their actions.
It comes as the Lords could vote on Monday to back a motion demanding that the Government delays the ratification of its Rwanda treaty until it can show that the country is safe for asylum seekers.
Asked on The Camilla Tominey Show on GB News on Sunday whether he would stand to be Tory leader, Mr Jenrick said: “Well, look, I’m not ruling it out. But that’s not my intention here. What I really want to do is make and hopefully win this central argument for the Conservative Party’s future.
“What I am trying to do is to make an argument and part of that is around illegal migration. I think that for too long, too few politicians have gone and argued that we need to take the most robust action.
“And so if I can help the Conservative Party by making that argument very strongly, then I will do it because I think there is a path to victory at the next General Election. But it goes through taking the strongest possible approach on migration.”
Mr Jenrick’s amendments would have prevented individual migrants from mounting legal challenges against deportation and blocked injunctions by Strasbourg judges to stop flights but, with both the Government and Labour opposing, failed despite being backed by 60 Tory rebels.
The Bill, itself, was passed by 320 votes to 276 after just 11 Tories voted against the Third Reading. Most rebels backed off voting against it amid warnings it would become a confidence issue and could topple Mr Sunak.
In the aftermath, only one MP – Dame Andrea Jenkyns – has publicly admitted to submitting a no-confidence letter to Sir Graham Brady, the backbench 1922 Committee chairman, although it is claimed there may be as many as 29 who have done so.
Mr Jenrick said: “I chose to vote against the Bill because I felt that it’s a weak Bill that ultimately won’t work. And we will have to see now if in August there are still small boats crossing the Channel, then it will be shown that my argument was right, the Government’s was wrong.
“But I hope, of course, that the Prime Minister is successful because I want to see the small boats stop. I think this is doing immense damage. Think of the hotels, the billions of pounds wasted, the people who are dying in the Channel, the people smugglers are feasting on this appalling trade.
“I want to see the small boats stop. I believe that the way to do that is through the most robust action, and that view is formed having travelled around the world, having seen that the only countries in the world that have fixed this problem. Australia and Greece in recent years chose to take the hardest path.
“That’s what I was proposing. The Prime Minister ultimately wanted to do it in a different way.”
On Sunday Grant Shapps, the Defence Secretary, acknowledged that the Rwanda deportation plan was the only way to achieve Mr Sunak’s pledge to stop the boats rather than simply reducing numbers.
“It’s time to, you know, stop the boats and essentially send the planes, because there isn’t another way again to solve this, and I just have to say, I appeal to Keir Starmer and Labour to stop frustrating and blocking Conservative efforts to stop these boats from coming,” he said.

7O1ZJMT862_CGXO74LWL37AR4E,Abandoning nuclear weapons and internal rebellions: Senior Ukrainian official explains when talks with Russia are possible,Ukrainska Pravda,"January 21, 2024 at 6:27 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/abandoning-nuclear-weapons-internal-rebellions-212707656.html,"Mykhailo Podoliak, adviser to the head of the Ukrainian President's Office, believes that Ukraine may negotiate with Russia if the latter suffers a tactical defeat on the battlefield, voluntarily gives up nuclear weapons and experiences internal riots.
Source: Podoliak during the national joint 24/7 newscast
Details: Answering the question about possible preconditions for negotiations, Podoliak stressed that Russia is only ready to negotiate on ultimatum positions and seeks the absolute destruction of Ukraine. The official believes that unless Russia has suffered significant tactical defeats on the battlefield, it will use any truce to prepare for the next stage of the war.
Quote: ""If the negotiations start at a time when Russia has suffered certain tactical defeats, the processes mentioned by Mr Danilov [Oleksii Danilov, Secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council - ed.] take place, and we see certain social tensions, certain internal riots – then yes, of course, negotiations are possible. And at the same time, to say talks are possible and Russia should voluntarily give up nuclear weapons. This is similarly possible only when Russia suffers a global defeat..
What is a global defeat? The Russian Federation will no longer be able to dominate not only Europe but the international political process in general; it will not have the resources to do so and will not be able to use its veto power, for example, in the UN Security Council, and will not have the support of a range of other totalitarian states, as it will be seen as a country that has lost the war. Then conditions on nuclear weapons, on the number of nuclear weapons carriers, including missiles of a specific range, on transboundary buffer zones, etc., are possible.
But this will only be possible if three processes take place: the first is Russia's tactical defeat in Ukraine; the second is the sanctions' effective operation, when European companies finally leave the Russian markets; and the third component is when based on all this, the processes we saw in the summer of 2023 when Prigozhin [Yevgeny Prigozhin, the deceased Chief of the Wagner Private Military Company – ed.] marched on Moscow through Rostov and Voronezh, will begin in Russia, and after that we will see a significant internal social conflict in Russia.""

7OAYMQ87VZ_QSU4YGFOE2UWOFS,Pro-life health care workers urge pro-family policies as major medical institutions push abortion,"Thomas Phippen, Aubrie Spady","January 21, 2024 at 6:00 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/pro-life-health-care-workers-090059570.html,"Pro-life advocates may have faced political setbacks across the country since Roe v. Wade was overturned, effectively granting states the ability to regulate abortion.
As thousands gathered in the snow Friday on the National Mall ahead of the march around the Capitol to the Supreme Court, many called for a continued expansion of the pro-life cause to include policies and programs to help mothers and families, not just work on legal battles.
""It's important that we not just combat the harm of abortion that it's causing our patients, but also recognize why women are oftentimes seeking abortion and do something about that,"" Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), told Fox News Digital on the sidelines of the March for Life Friday.
But some pro-life activists in the health profession told Fox News Digital they see other wins since the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson overturned nearly 50 years of Roe precedent. Doctors and medical professionals are rejecting messages from advocates for abortion.
PRO-LIFE DEMONSTRATORS BRAVE DC SNOW FOR 2024 MARCH FOR LIFE
""We definitely have seen a growth in our membership in the last two years, especially right after Dobbs. We had a huge increase in membership,"" Francis said.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
AAPLOG's medical student and resident fellowships increased from about 200 to around 400 since the 2022 Dobbs decision, and total membership increased from 7,000 to around 7,500. In the past decade, the group tripled in total membership.
Some new members join AAPLOG due to feeling left behind by the pro-choice stances of the major medical institutions, according to Francis.
""What they're realizing now is that we are under active attack, I would say ... not just from pro-abortion advocates, but from our major certifying bodies,"" Francis said.
""Many of them are seeing the veil has been lifted, I think, on the true position of some of our major medical associations.""
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), according to Francis, has acted inconsistently with many OB/GYNs' beliefs about providing quality health care.
In August 2023, ACOG Interim President Christopher Zahn wrote in a letter to The Washington Post expressing the belief abortion access should not be limited.
""Abortion is safe. It improves and saves lives, and it must be available without restrictions, without limitations and without barriers — just as any other critical part of health care,"" Zahn wrote.
PRO-LIFE GROUPS HAMMER ‘TWISTED ATTEMPT’ BY DEMOCRATIC AGS TO ‘HINDER’ PREGNANCY CENTERS FROM HELPING WOMEN
""I think that many physicians are seeing now how radical that position is,"" said Francis. ""Maybe they're not exactly in the same position I am on abortion, but they recognize that there should at the very least be some limitation, and there should be safeguards put into place for women's safety and to ensure that they're in good care. We really are seeing a lot of physicians and other medical professionals wake up to what's been going on in our profession for quite some time.""
ACOG last year released a fact sheet that dismissed as misinformation some pro-life terms — particularly the claims that abortion defenders want abortion to be legal to the point of birth.
""'[A]bortion up until birth' or ‘abortion after birth’ are examples of derogatory language used by opponents of abortion access that is not based in facts. Neither is accurate, and neither uses clinically appropriate language,"" ACOG's website states.
ACOG also says abortion later in pregnancy is rare and indicates that ""something has gone terribly wrong regarding the patient’s health or the pregnancy.""
Viewing abortion as something involving a single patient, according to Francis, is one of the issues driving medical practitioners to question the major health groups that insist abortion is health care.
PRO-LIFE VOTERS REVEAL HOW THEY REALLY FEEL ABOUT TRUMP'S STANCE ON ABORTION
""We know that induced abortion is not health care. It ends the life of one of our patients, and it significantly harms our other patients,"" said Francis.
""This abortion fight is it's not just Planned Parenthood clinics and the pregnancy centers, it is in health care today,"" said Chris Faddis, president of Solidarity HealthShare.
""The health care system is pushing people more and more towards early fetal testing, so they can push people to abortions and their children into, you know, Planned Parenthood for regular female care, so they can get them on birth control and a board of patients and those things,"" Faddis said.
AHEAD OF MARCH FOR LIFE, MISSISSIPPI UNVEILS MOBILE APP TO HELP PREGNANT MOMS
Concerned Women for America President Penny Nance told Fox News Digital a priority for the pro-life movement must be expanding ways for struggling pregnant women and mothers to get assistance, be it public or private.
""We know the No. 1 reason a woman chooses abortion is that she isn't supported,"" said Nance.
One proposal is a national clearinghouse where a pregnant woman can search her zip code for resources near her — not just medical, but financial assistance, help with bills and food or employment. The idea is similar to a program in Mississippi that launched in the past year to collect public assistance and nonprofits into one searchable database.
March for Life has also been a political advocacy group, and in light of recent setbacks at the ballot box for abortion issues, pro-lifers have urged pro-life politicians not to avoid the issue, but to put Democrats on the defensive.
""They need to point out the extreme, radical nature of what [Democrats] will do if they get into office and have the majorities in the House, Senate and the White House. It'll be abortion until birth. In debates, when facing down your Democratic opponent, make him or her defend that,"" said Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J.

Several wooden buildings went up in flames on Main Street at the Pullman City amusement park in Eging am See, in Bavaria, police said on Sunday.
The cause of the early morning fire was not immediately known.
About 200 people, including around 180 overnight guests, were able to escape to safety.
Pullman City, which fashions itself on the horseback-riding cowboys of the 19th-century American West, covers around 200,000 square metres in Eging am See.
Firefighters battled the flames for hours on the park's Main Street, which features a replica saloon, steakhouse and a music hall.
By midday Sunday only the skeletons of some of the buildings remained as smoke continued to rise from the rubble.
A police spokeswoman said one park employee was slightly injured in the shoulder while trying to extinguish the blaze, and a firefighter was injured in the leg.
""The fire was discovered by employees at around 6 am,"" said a police spokeswoman. ""They tried to put it out with a fire extinguisher. But that didn't work.""
According to the website, a free admission family day had been planned on Sunday featuring magic and light shows. Pony rides were also supposed to be on offer, among other activities.
""I could cry for an hour. But that doesn't help. We now have to look forward,"" the theme park's managing director, Claus Six, told dpa.
The employees who noticed the fire reacted with presence of mind and brought the guests to safety, he said.
Hundreds of thousands of people visit Pullman City every year. The park opened in 1997 and employs 500 permanent and freelance staff members."

“I’ll be old some day, 80 years old, thinking about what a special time in my life it was. Thinking of all the people who helped get me there made it special.”
Burke, a 2013 Tigard High graduate, became Miss Oregon on her sixth attempt in 2023. The lesson learned: “Have some grit and gumption, and you never know how things play out in life.”
Burke attended Portland State University (studying public health) and works as operations manager for Sen. Jeff Merkley in Portland. It’s a job that keeps her busy, but she has dedicated much of the past six years to being part of the Miss Oregon and Miss America programs.

(AP) — A school board in southern Pennsylvania has voted to reinstate the district’s old mascot logo portraying a Native American fighter, despite criticism that it’s outdated and culturally insensitive.
The Southern York County School District voted 7-2 on Thursday to bring back the logo, which had been retired in April 2021 by a previous board that also chose to keep the name of the Susquehannock High School teams as the “Warriors.”
The vote followed a lengthy debate including a nearly two-hour public comment session and an hourlong presentation by the Native American Guardian’s Association (NAGA), a nonprofit organization that lobbies against the removal of Native American mascots.
Several parents spoke against reinstating the logo, saying the board was lacking in humanity and should be focused on education. Some students also said the logo debate has heightened racial bullying.
Supporters of the logo cited the district’s history and said many students and parents favor it but are afraid of being called racists.
The school board has five new members who were elected last November after running with the old mascot on their campaign materials, changing the majority stance on the logo issue.

Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) blasted the Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Sunday for allowing South Carolina to be the first primary instead of New Hampshire.
“Well, what we’re seeing on the ground in New Hampshire right now is the passion and commitment to democracy that is one of the hallmarks of our state,” Hassan said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
“So even though the DNC made a terrible decision, we see strong energy for a write-in Joe Biden campaign, because Joe Biden has done what independent voters in New Hampshire have asked, which is worked across the aisle to deliver important bipartisan results to the people of our country,” she added.
The DNC reshuffled its 2024 primary calendar to make South Carolina the first-in-the-nation primary, which will be followed by New Hampshire and Nevada. President Biden will not appear on the New Hampshire ballot under the DNC’s guidance, but a coalition of voters have launched a write-in campaign for the sitting president to ensure he still wins the state.
The New Hampshire Democratic primary will not ultimately affect the numbers needed for the Democratic nomination because it violates the DNC’s rules. Democratic challengers Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) and author Marianne Williamson will appear on the ballot, but they are still polling significantly behind Biden.
Hassan emphasized that there is “huge energy” for a write-in campaign for Biden despite the DNC’s decision.
“So, at the end of the day, that’s what the choice is and that’s what New Hampshire Democrats know, and that’s why we’re seeing really good energy on the ground for a write-in campaign,” Hassan said.

The number killed now stands at 25,105 and the number of injured at more than 62,680, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said.
Within 24 hours, 178 people had been killed in Israeli ground and air attacks on the coastal strip. The figures make no distinction between civilians and fighters.
Around 70% of those killed in Gaza are women and children, the ministry said.
The figures cannot be independently verified.
The war was triggered when around 1,200 people were killed by militants from Hamas and other extremist Palestinian organizations on October 7 in southern Israel.
Israel is vowing to keep fighting in Gaza until Hamas is completely crushed - but that goal could be a long way off.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that, according to an estimate by the US intelligence services, Israel has so far only succeeded in killing 20% to 30% of Hamas fighters in Gaza.
Washington believes that Hamas still has enough ammunition to continue attacking Israel and Israeli troops in Gaza for months to come, the report said.
According to US estimates, Hamas had between 25,000 and 30,000 fighters before the war, not including thousands of police officers.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has categorically ruled out the release of Israeli hostages on the terms of the Islamist Hamas.
In a video message published on Sunday, the Israeli leader said that he was working ""around the clock"" to free the more than 130 hostages still held by Hamas.
""But let's be clear: I reject in the strongest possible terms the terms of surrender of the Hamas monsters,"" he added.
""Hamas is demanding, in exchange for the release of our hostages, the end of the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of the murders and rapists of the Nukhba [Hamas forces] and leaving Hamas in place,"" Netanyahu explained.
""Were we to agree to this – our soldiers would have fallen in vain. Were we to agree to this – we would not be able to ensure the security of our citizens. We would be unable to safely restore the evacuees to their homes and the next October 7 would be only a question of time.""
""I am not prepared to accept such a mortal blow to the security of Israel; therefore, we will not agree to this,"" Netanyahu added.
Thousands of people demonstrated in Israel on Saturday against Netanyahu's governmemnt.
Participants at a rally in Tel Aviv demanded an immediate end to the war in Gaza in order to free the more than 100 hostages still held by Hamas.
""Stop the fighting, pay the price!"" Israeli media quoted one of the speakers, whose cousin is among the hostages, as saying.
Following an initial exchange of 105 hostages for 240 Palestinian prisoners at the end of November, Hamas has said it won't release the remaining hostages abducted from southern Israel on October 7 until Israel's military withdraws from the Gaza Strip.
The Israel Defense Forces said on Sunday it had killed dozens of terrorists and found a large quantity of weapons during various operations in the Gaza Strip over the previous day.
At least two people were killed in southern Lebanon on Sunday in an attack by what was suspected to be an Israeli drone.
Security sources in Beirut told dpa that the object hit a vehicle in the village of Kafra, near the Israeli border.
According to the Lebanese television station Al-Arabija, those killed were members of the Shiite militant group Hezbollah. One of those killed is said to have been the bodyguard of a senior Hezbollah leader, who may have been the target of the attack.
The Israeli military did not initially comment on the incident."
7ZLQDBXMCL_M8HSOI6W6NA9MOL,"I'm in my 30s, and 2 of my closest friends are in their 80s. Here's what I've learned from our age-gap friendships.",Kate Oczypok,"January 21, 2024 at 8:53 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/im-30s-2-closest-friends-115301336.html,"When my husband and I moved to Rockville, Maryland, we started going to a new church.
One evening, I met two ushers named Art and Jack.
I've been friends with them for nine years now.
Throughout the nearly 20 years I lived in the Washington, DC area, I attended about five different churches, eager to find one that was a good fit for me. When my now-husband and I moved to the Rockville, Maryland area in 2013, I found a church within walking distance, which was important to me, as I didn't have a car. I crossed my fingers that it would be the missing puzzle piece to my life and provide the faith community I'd been searching for.
Lo and behold, all it took was two 80-somethings to welcome me warmly into their community and get me involved. Despite our age-gap, we've become great friends, and our friendship has only deepened in the last nine years. Here are some important life lessons I learned from them.
One Saturday evening Mass, I smiled at an older man who ushered every week. He'd always smiled at me as he walked to the back of the church to grab the baskets for the weekly collection. To my surprise, he walked to my pew and whispered that one of the usual ushers wasn't available and asked if I could help take up the collection with him and another older man who usually helped him.
Typically, ushers are usually men. Women are also welcome to usher, but traditionally, most churches tend to attract men in their 70s and 80s for the volunteer job. I immediately agreed to help him, surprised he approached me to ask for help rather than the older men sitting near me. Later, I learned that the usher, whose name was Art, thought I had a warm smile and seemed friendly. I thought the same thing about him!
I was happy to learn that despite growing up in The Silent Generation, when Masses had very distinct traditions and rules, those born at that time may be more forward-thinking than I thought.
The whole young-at-heart cliché is actually quite true. Ever since that evening I helped usher, I ended up becoming a regular at 5 p.m. Saturday Masses. I became close to Art, as well as the other man who helped that night, who was named Jack.
Jack, who was also in his 80s, was the head of a thriving auto empire. I admired how humble he was. He had money, but you'd never know it. Along with a couple I met who was in their 70s, Art and Jack would watch out for me and always make sure I got home safely, offering rides to and from church.
Though I'm in my 30s, I often still feel like a teenager when I put on the music I listened to decades ago, like the Spice Girls and Britney Spears. It was refreshing to me to learn that Art also stayed connected to his interests from childhood. He had an elaborate model train village in the crawl space in his basement that he had been adding to for decades. He wore a train conductor hat when he showed off the space, getting the same twinkle in his eye that he probably had when he was a child in the late 1930s and early 1940s.
The same goes for Jack. He was a pilot in his earlier years, and on rides home from church he would tell me tales about how he would fly to his home in Florida. He owned four planes since the '60s, and at the time, kept a flying license. While a corporate pilot would fly the plane, Jack still rode in the cockpit, as giddy as a 20-something.
Both Jack and Art taught me that no matter how old you may be, you always feel young at heart. By continuing the hobbies and interests they loved in their youth, they have managed to stay active, happy seniors.
Finally, meeting Jack and Art reminded me of three simple life lessons: be kind, be humble, and keep the faith. That simple act of kindness Art showed me that Saturday evening resulted in eight years at that church before my husband and I moved.
Jack's modesty about his accomplishments showed me that no matter how much money or how many honors or awards you may have, treating people the way you want to be treated is so much more important. You'd never know Jack was a millionaire. To me, he just was the octogenarian friend I got to know on rides home from church.
Both Art and Jack have also taught me to stay hopeful. Art lost two wives over the course of his life, but he stayed hopeful, not only in love (he has been with a female companion since the death of his second wife) but in his religion, too. They showed me how in life how essential it is to have faith in something, whether it's family, friends, love, or your chosen religion.

""We’ve seen a tremendous increase, actually, throughout the county,"" Martin County Sheriff’s Office Lt. Michael Dougherty told local media last week. ""You’ll have vagrants squatting on the boat, it falling apart, there have been several instances where the boats have come loose and ran into the docks.""
The Martin County Sheriff’s Office says it has long dealt with derelict boats left to rot along the Florida coast, but now, authorities say homeless individuals are increasingly taking up residence on the boats. The county is situated along Florida’s southeastern coast and includes cities such as Jupiter Island and Jensen Beach.
Authorities cite cost of living issues for the increase of squatters and homeless people moving onto the boats. Derelict boats are defined as vessels found in waterways with at least two violations, which can range from having not motor to leaking fuel. Dumping derelict boats is a state crime that could lead to jail time or fines.
FLORIDA POLICE DISMANTLE SQUATTERS' BOOBY-TRAPPED 'METH ISLAND'
County commissioners recently amended an ordinance that gives more power to law enforcement and the harbormaster to remove such boats. Boats ruled derelict can now be tagged by authorities, who then contact the boat’s owner, NBC Miami reported. If no action is taken in 21 days, authorities can dispose of the boat - which comes at a big cost for taxpayers.

""It can be anywhere from $6,000 and upwards,"" Dougherty told the outlet. ""Astronomical amounts of money.""
The boats and squatters have also had negative impacts on businesses that rely on showing tourists Florida’s waterways and beaches.

""This time of year is our busiest … with the snowbirds making their way down,""Giles Murphy, who owns Stuart Angler Bait & Tackle, told WPTV. ""A lot of them are seeing these derelict boats and being like, 'What's up with these boats?' It's a real eyesore. The attraction of our waters to anglers to get out there and fish, and tourists and stuff, I mean, we need to keep it looking good.""
In addition to the derelict boats, the sheriff’s office has recently been dealing with abandoned boats that appear to have transported migrants to the U.S.
Florida, similar to other states across the nation, has been dealing with repeated instances of squatters moving into abandoned homes or forging documents to make it appear they own a home.
SQUATTER SPOTTED CRUISING IN HOMEOWNER'S CAR AFTER SETTING UP GAME ROOM
Roughly 160 miles up the coast from Martin County, squatters took over an area located near the Dunlawton Bridge in Port Orange, dubbed by social media commenters as ""Meth Island."" Squatters built makeshift wooden structures, including an elaborate four-story tree house, and other huts made out of what appeared to be old lumber and tree branches.
They also installed a trampoline and appeared to be in the middle of constructing a pool on the island, footage of the scene published by authorities showed. To deter visitors, the squatters even allegedly outfitted the island with booby traps.

832NTP1S3B_OEEVM0MQ7V2H9BL,The Legal Question at the Center of the Alec Baldwin Criminal Case,Julia Jacobs,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 12:44 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/legal-center-alec-baldwin-criminal-153342056.html,"Now that a grand jury has indicted Alec Baldwin on a charge of involuntary manslaughter for the fatal shooting of a cinematographer on the set of the film “Rust” in New Mexico in 2021, the contours of the looming legal battle are coming into focus.
If the case reaches trial, the challenge prosecutors face will be convincing a jury that Baldwin was guilty of either the negligent use of a firearm or of acting with “total disregard or indifference for the safety of others” — even though investigators found he was told on the day of the shooting that the gun he was rehearsing with contained no live rounds, and even though the film set was not supposed to have any live ammunition at all.
The challenge Baldwin’s defense team faces will be to explain why the gun fired. Baldwin has maintained all along that he did not pull the trigger that day as he rehearsed a scene in which he draws a revolver, saying that the gun discharged after he pulled the hammer back and released it. A forensic report commissioned by the prosecution determined that he must have pulled the trigger for the gun to go off, a finding that contributed to its decision to revive the criminal case against Baldwin.

Legal experts were divided on the merits of reviving the case, noting that traditional gun safety rules — such as never pointing a functional gun toward someone — do not always apply on film sets, and that investigators found he had been assured by the film’s safety crew that the gun did not contain live ammunition.
“The notion that you never point a gun at someone would sort of undo Westerns for the past 100 years,” said Nancy Gertner, a retired federal judge.
The outcome of the case at trial — the State of New Mexico vs. Alexander (Alec) Rae Baldwin — would hinge on how jurors view two key questions: Should Baldwin have known of the danger involved in his actions that day? And, using a term of art in criminal law, did he act with a “willful disregard for the safety of others”?
The grand jury indictment required that at least eight out of 12 jurors found probable cause that Baldwin committed a crime. The standard at trial is much higher: A jury must determine, unanimously, that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
“I think it’s an uphill battle,” said Steve Aarons, a veteran defense lawyer in New Mexico. “There is no reason for live rounds to be there. It’s a little different than other situations where you have a firearm and you assume any bullet that is there would be a live round.”
There is a complex web of factors that would quite likely come up at trial, including the condition of the gun, which broke during FBI testing, and Baldwin’s responsibility as a producer on the film.
But the prosecutors will probably take the straightforward position that anyone who agrees to handle a gun is responsible for what happens next, said Joshua Kastenberg, a criminal law professor at the University of New Mexico and a former prosecutor.
“You could make the argument that regardless of the condition of the weapon, there was an independent duty of every person that was going to put their hands on that weapon that day to ask and make sure that it was either safe or unloaded,” he said, though he said that proving that kind of argument to a jury is often challenging.
After the grand jury indicted Baldwin on Friday, his lawyers — who have called the revived prosecution “misguided” — said that they looked forward to their day in court. Kari T. Morrissey, one of the special prosecutors handling the case, declined to elaborate on the case that was presented to the grand jury.
It was the second time Baldwin found himself facing a criminal charge in connection with the shooting. In an earlier case that was dropped in April, prosecutors had accused him of “extremely reckless acts” in the shooting. In a statement of probable cause last year they had accused him of getting insufficient firearms training, of failing to deal with safety complaints on set in his capacity as one of the film’s producers, of “putting his finger on the trigger of a real firearm when a replica or rubber gun should have been used” and of pointing the firearm at the film’s cinematographer and director.
Baldwin has maintained all along that he was not responsible for the tragedy, noting that someone else had put live ammunition in the gun and that the cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, had been directing where he pointed the gun. “I know in my heart that I’m not responsible for what happened to her,” Baldwin told a detective following the shooting.
The new case, said Marc A. Grano, a lawyer and former prosecutor in New Mexico, will most likely become a back-and-forth over what is “standard practice” in the film and TV industry, a battle that may include conflicting opinions and examples.
After the original criminal case was brought against Baldwin last year, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the union representing film and TV actors, opposed the prosecutors’ contention that actors were responsible for ensuring that the guns they were handed on set were safe to handle, saying, “an actor’s job is not to be a firearms or weapons expert.”
The most widely used written protocols around gun use on sets are outlined in documents called Safety Bulletins No. 1 and No. 2, which were created by a team of representatives from the unions and the major studios, and which will most likely be used as evidence in court.
The fatal shooting of Hutchins prompted the first revisions to those safety guidelines in two decades. The new guidelines, published in December, are longer and more detailed than the old ones, and stress that safety meetings should include instructions on how to distinguish between blank ammunition, which have gunpowder but not projectiles, and dummy rounds, which are inert and cannot be fired.
As before, they make it clear that live ammunition is not supposed to be used on sets. “Live ammunition,” the bulletin says, “is never to be used on set nor brought onto any work location, including any studio lot, stage or location” except in rare cases if it meets specific exceptions.

89S57U3JQP_6ZV6WHLJET0N80K,Home Secretary pushed to end jobs for migrants scheme by former cabinet ministers,Charles Hymas,"January 22, 2024 at 5:30 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/home-secretary-pushed-end-jobs-203023477.html,"James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, will face demands on Monday to scrap the right of asylum seekers, including Channel migrants, to work.
Two former Cabinet ministers and the New Conservatives group of MPs are calling for an end to the scheme under which asylum seekers can work in shortage occupation sectors including care, construction and agriculture if they have been waiting for their claims to be processed for more than a year.
They say it is providing a “pull factor” to encourage migrants to come to the UK, while also undercutting British workers as they are paid 80 per cent of the going rate.
It follows the disclosure by The Telegraph on Saturday that nearly 16,000 asylum seekers, including those who crossed the Channel in small boats, have been allowed to work in a single year, according to data obtained under Freedom of Information (FoI) laws.
David Davis, a former Brexit secretary and a former shadow home secretary, said: “It converts illegal migration - the worst sort of migration - into the second worst, which is migration that undercuts the pay of workers.
“It acts as an incentive for people to come here illegally. It’s clear that at least some of the individuals will send money home. That is as strong a telegraph for others to do the same as anything that I can think of.”
Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, said he believed the policy was wrong.
“I don’t agree that asylum seekers should work,” he said.
“There is a very long-standing policy that dates back to the Labour government in 2005 to allow people who’ve been here for years to work in certain occupations where there are supposedly shortages, but it just creates a pull factor to the UK.
“And almost everyone who comes here is either an economic migrant or a sort of asylum shopper, because they’re coming from safe countries like France and choosing to come to the UK because they think life is better here or a softer touch. And so I don’t think that’s the right approach.”
The New Conservatives group of about 20 MPs is writing to Mr Cleverly on Monday asking how the Home Office can justify such a “pull factor” for illegal migration and whether asylum seekers taking up jobs affects the likelihood of their asylum claim being successful.
“We cannot solve the significant problems associated with irregular migration unless we deter people from crossing to the UK illegally, and this is the opposite of a deterrent,” said Miriam Cates, co-chair of the group.
The FoI data show that 19,231 migrants applied for work permits in 2022 and 15,706 applications were granted. That represented nearly one-third of all the 51,000 asylum seekers in the one-year backlog of claims in 2022. Fewer than 5,000 were waiting more than a year in 2016.
The scheme allowing asylum seekers to take jobs after a year is a legacy of an EU law from 2005, which reversed a measure introduced by Sir Tony Blair in 2002 barring illegal migrants from any right to work.
The then-Labour leader instituted the crackdown to tackle a migration crisis similar to that being faced by the current Government.
Some ministers and immigration advisers have argued that the Government should consider going further in the opposite direction and follow some other European countries that allow asylum seekers to work after six months.
They have cited the potential economic benefits in boosting growth and savings from migrants no longer receiving state benefits and free accommodation and instead paying income tax on their earnings.
Peter Walsh, a senior researcher with the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said he was surprised at the numbers granted, but suggested it could be linked to the widening of the shortage occupation list to include care workers, where there was acute demand for staff.
He said there were economic benefits in that it would reduce the cost of accommodation and asylum support as well as generating money for the Exchequer via taxes. “There are psychological positives because it is not very good for people to be out of the labour market,” he said.
“The longer people are out of the labour market, the harder it is for them to get back into the labour market. There is also another practical advantage that if you allow people to work legally, they are less likely to work illegally. It is potentially protecting against that.”
Government sources claimed there was no evidence that the prospect of working in a shortage occupation after a year in the UK was a “pull factor”.
They said in the past year the Government had cleared the “legacy” backlog of asylum cases pre-dating June 2022, apart from 4,500 “complex” applications, which would have reduced the number eligible to work.
A Home Office source also noted that the scheme had been introduced under Labour, but tightened by the coalition government, under Lord Cameron, to limit it to shortage occupations.
A Home Office spokesperson said: “Allowing individuals who have an asylum claim outstanding for more than a year to apply for jobs limited to the Shortage Occupation List strikes the balance between protecting taxpayer money and ensuring people are not incentivised to come to the UK illegally.
“Once employed the individual may have their taxpayer support withdrawn, whilst boosting the economy by addressing skills shortages.”

Ron DeSantis instead spent Saturday 900 miles away in South Carolina, laying the groundwork for his presidential campaign’s last stand.
“I’m asking for your support as we get into this primary next month,” DeSantis told supporters at a Florence restaurant. “I’ll be a candidate that will be able to bring our party together up and down the ballot, just like I did in Florida. I will always be a candidate that you can be proud of. As president, I will get the job done.”
In a marker of the confusion surrounding his unclear path forward, DeSantis’ campaign late Saturday was still scrambling to figure out which state their candidate would appear in on Sunday. The scheduling fluctuations resulted in DeSantis abruptly canceling plans to appear Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.” His campaign quickly chimed in publicly to end speculation about his political future to note that DeSantis will appear in New Hampshire on Sunday.
Yet, even as he soldiers on, DeSantis increasingly sounds like a candidate wrestling with his relevancy. In the days following his distant second-place finish in Iowa, DeSantis has lashed out at Fox News, bemoaned the money spent against him, blamed cold weather and “very low” enthusiasm for his performance, trivialized the sway of the Hawkeye State Republicans who endorsed him, conceded former President Donald Trump’s edge going forward, admitted his media strategy failed, and for the first time suggested what it would take for him to end his White House bid.
“As long as I’m in the hunt, that tells me that I’m seeing a pathway,” he said Friday night. “The minute I don’t, then I’m not just going to do this just for my health.”
His public journey through the seven stages of grief comes as his Republican rivals have all but dismissed his candidacy as an afterthought.
Trump recently predicted on his social media site that DeSantis “will SOON be out of money and dropping out of the race for President.” Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she was “no longer focused on” DeSantis after Iowa.
“He’s closer to zero than he is to me,” she said. “He’s invisible in New Hampshire. He’s invisible in South Carolina. We’re focused on Trump. That’s the key.”
DeSantis, though, is intensely focused on Haley in South Carolina, where she served as governor from 2011 to 2017. In appearances around the Palmetto State this week, DeSantis has contended she’s not conservative enough for the state and has asked the audience to list her accomplishments. He has asserted no one can.
Fourth-grade teacher Regina Wasiluk took issue with that suggestion. She showed up to DeSantis’ Lexington event to defend Haley’s record on education when he once again queried his crowd.
After a brief exchange, DeSantis shut her down.
“This isn’t your show, ma’am,” he said.
Wasiluk said after the experience she wouldn’t vote for DeSantis if he’s the GOP nominee.
“I was very upset that I didn’t bring my phone so that I can share it with other people who feel the same way that I do,” she said.
South Carolina’s February 24 primary is still more than a month away and comes after the Nevada caucuses. But coming just nine days before Super Tuesday, when the race expands into a national contest, the state typically turns into “the graveyard of a lot of campaigns and the booster rocket to at least one,” said the state’s GOP chairman, Drew McKissick.
“This is your last chance to be able to focus on one state at a time,” McKissick said. “After that, you’ve got to be on the air and on the ground in half a dozen to a dozen states at one time. That’s cost prohibitive, time prohibitive and manpower prohibitive.”
Still, DeSantis’ campaign is not setting expectations for a win here or even a second-place finish. Instead, it appears singularly focused on playing spoiler to Haley on her home turf. The theory behind the strategy is Haley would drop out if she can’t manage a strong performance in the state she once led, though she has given no indication that is the case. The Florida governor is moving much of his campaign here to carry out that mission.
DeSantis himself is not setting expectations, either. He told reporters Saturday, “I’m not a political pundit,” when asked his end goal in South Carolina and whether there’s a district he thinks he can win.
“We’re here. You saw the folks. We get great reception,” DeSantis said, referencing a large crowd at the Myrtle Beach event. “As this thing turns, you know, we’re gonna be in a good situation.”
But DeSantis has stopped short of the scorched-earth offensive it may take to damage Haley. His remarks across three stops Saturday largely touched on familiar themes – his accomplishments in Florida, the scourges of a “woke” culture and the urgency to change course as a country – none of which moved the needle for him in Iowa and New Hampshire.
One attendee in Myrtle Beach asked DeSantis why he hasn’t gained traction from Republicans in 2024 given his track record in Florida – a sign of the skepticism from voters that accompanies worsening odds.
“I got to break through a lot of clutter out there in ways that other candidates don’t,” DeSantis contended. “There’s other candidates that get elevated, and I got to break through the clutter.”
Unclear is how much firepower DeSantis will have to “break through the clutter.” DeSantis’ campaign and supporting super PACs have not aired an ad outside of Iowa since mid-November, and the Hawkeye State did not deliver the result for him that could have led to a fundraising bonanza.
Meanwhile, Haley’s campaign is preparing to launch a $4 million media buy in South Carolina beginning the day of the New Hampshire primary, her campaign manager, Betsy Ankney, told reporters Saturday. Americans for Prosperity Action, which is supporting Haley, also has about $2.3 million booked in the state, according to AdImpact.
Also missing since getting thrashed in Iowa is the swagger of the candidate who once cosplayed as a “Top Gun” pilot to drive home the point he will “never back down from a fight.” DeSantis appeared tired touring his third state this week while keeping up a schedule badly battered by winter storms. Asked by a voter Saturday in Myrtle Beach whom he’d pick as a running mate, DeSantis listlessly batted away the question with a blunt assessment of his standing in the GOP race.
“It’s presumptuous,” he said. “I’ve got eight delegates. Trump’s got 20. You gotta get there.”
A visit to South Carolina four days before New Hampshire votes would seem to necessitate punting on the Granite State – where Trump and Haley are in a heated fight and he is at risk of not reaching the 10% vote threshold needed to earn delegates in the state. Yet, as DeSantis arrived in South Carolina, he published an op-ed in the New Hampshire Journal in which he urged voters to support him.
“Support me in the coming New Hampshire primary,” he wrote, “and I will embody the live free or die spirit as your next president.”

On Saturday, the Kids for Peace, a global nonprofit based in Carlsbad, held a rally to unveil a new sign that will go along Interstate 5. And the rain did not dampen the spirit.
Elementary kids from Carlsbad schools led a pep rally to inspire friends and family to take part in the Great Kindness Challenge. The challenge features a 50-item checklist with kind acts for the students to complete this week, starting January 22.
Rain this weekend? That shouldn’t stop you from attending these events
Organizers told FOX 5 that all 15 Carlsbad schools are participating. The Carlsbad High School cheerleaders joined in the event’s celebration. Additionally, the Kids for Peace students painted the “KINDNESS MATTERS” landmark. The landmark will be placed outside the Carlsbad Strawberry Fields for drivers along the I-5 to witness.
The event also held landmark stations with arts and crafts.
“I’ve always loved helping people, it’s always been in me just to be nice to everybody, because I’ve been in everybody’s shoes a lot,” said Rishi Reddi, a Kids for Peace sixth grader.
“Kindness is not just a nicety, it’s a necessity, and its something that has to be taught, it has to be intentional, it has to be made a priority. And that’s what we are doing — kindness. We are really giving them the opportunity to practice it and make it a daily habit so that’s how they approach every situation going forward in life,” said Jill McManital, founder and executive director for Kids for Peace.
Museum Month: Museums are half-off in February in San Diego, Tijuana, and Baja California
More than 40,000 schools worldwide will partake in the Kindness Challenge. The students will be from all 50 states and 115 countries.

8ECJ2ZS9ZM_MM8Y2VX5DLHWODF,Ayodhya: Temple to open at India’s religious fault-line,"Yogita Limaye - BBC News, in Ayodhya, India","January 22, 2024 at 4:26 PM·11 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ayodhya-temple-open-india-religious-015009521.html,"Santosh Dubey says he has no regrets he helped tear down the mosque.
""It was religious work and I was put on this Earth to complete the task,"" he says. ""There is no crime or sin in it.""
Mr Dubey, a ""kar sevak"" (religious worker), was one of tens of thousands of Hindu men who demolished the 16th Century Babri Masjid in the Indian holy city of Ayodhya on 6 December 1992.
It was one of independent India's darkest days. The disputed site sits on one of its biggest religious fault-lines - thousands were killed in the violence that broke out.
More than 30 years later, where the mosque once stood a grand temple to Lord Ram, one of Hinduism's most revered deities, is about to be opened by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. That's controversial in a country with a secular constitution, but especially so because of the divisive history of the site.
Monday's ceremony is being seen as the informal start of his campaign for re-election this year, wooing India's Hindu majority. Across the country, millions of Hindus are gearing up to celebrate the day like a big festival, while employees of Mr Modi's federal government have been given a half day.
Sitting in his crumbling home, in a narrow alley in the city, paint and plaster peeling off its walls, Mr Dubey says he's proud of what he achieved.
""If we had not done what we did then the temple could never have been built,"" he says. ""Religious sentiments are greater than the constitution. I am extremely happy now. I had taken a pledge that I would not repair my home until Lord Ram got his.""
But for Muslims, who make up India's biggest minority, the day will evoke fear and painful memories. Some will send their children out of the city, fearing tensions might be stoked when the streets fill with Hindu devotees from around the country.
""We have been betrayed once, so we feel fear,"" says Mohammad Shahid. ""Many outsiders will come into Ayodhya and it's when outsiders come that there's trouble.""
6 December 1992 was a defining moment in India's history. It was also a pivotal event in the political rise of the Hindu right-wing that's now seeking a third consecutive term in power.
Many Hindus believe Muslim emperor Babur destroyed a temple that stood at the birthplace of Lord Ram and built a mosque over it more than 500 years ago.
Santosh Dubey and dozens of others have faced charges and spent time in jail over the years, but no-one has been convicted for demolishing the mosque.
He doesn't agree that what he did was against the law.
""Those who say that it was not Hindu to destroy the mosque are idiots. They are heretics, leftists, extremists and terrorists.
""We did not go to another country to destroy their places of worship, but if they destroyed ours, then it is right that we get them back.""
Muslims regularly offered prayers in the mosque until 1949, when idols of Lord Ram were placed in it, allegedly by Hindu priests. The gates of the mosque were then closed by a court order. In 1986, they were re-opened, many believe at the behest of the Congress party, then in power, in a rumoured attempt to woo the Hindu majority.
Then in 1990, the Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - then just a small political party with little electoral success - spearheaded a mass campaign for a Hindu temple at the site. The campaign would later be seen as one of the key moments which transformed BJP into the virtually unbeatable political giant it is today, which now has Mr Modi at its head.
That year, tens of thousands of kar sevaks congregated in Ayodhya. When they started moving towards the disputed site, police fired at them, killing dozens. ""Those bullets fuelled our anger,"" Santosh Dubey says. He was injured in the shooting.
Two years later, kar sevaks gathered in Ayodhya again.
""The people who were guarding the disputed structure fled when they saw a huge crowd walking towards them with swords and hammers. We had practised everything earlier. We climbed on the domes and brought it down within a few hours.""
Mr Dubey shows us a black and white photo that appeared in a newspaper of a group of men brandishing their weapons with raised arms, wide smiles on their faces. He says it was taken before the mosque was razed.
""We were happy, because we knew what was going to happen that day,"" he says, pointing to himself in the photo.
For Ayodhya's Muslims it was a day of terror.
Transforming a flashpoint holy city into the ‘Hindu Vatican’
The complex history of India's Ayodhya holy site
""Hundreds of thousands of men were all over Ayodhya. They had sticks, swords and tridents. Our house was surrounded by them,"" says Anwari Begum, now 65.
""We ran from our homes. I ran with my six-month-old baby and small children. My husband was running behind us. When I turned, I saw that he had been caught by some men. We had to keep running for our lives.""
The next day she found out her husband Mohammad Amin had been killed, one of at least 17 Muslims who died in shocking violence in Ayodhya that day.
""An eyewitness told us that he had been caught, his arms and legs were chopped off, he was dumped into a sack and taken away. We never found his body,"" she says breaking down.
When she returned to her home, she found it had been burnt to the ground. It would take time, but over the years the family would manage to rebuild a small, two-room home on the same site.
""My husband used to take care of our family. I was left alone with six small children. We got some money from the government but it was not enough. My life was destroyed by that day,"" she says.
In the violence that swept across India after the mosque was torn down, nearly 2,000 people were killed. More than 900 died in the financial capital, Mumbai, alone, roughly two-thirds of them were Muslims. There were killings in other cities including Jaipur, Bhopal, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.
In Ayodhya, Mohammad Shahid's father Mohammad Sabir was also killed brutally.
""They beat him and then they poured oil on both him and my uncle and set them on fire. We found their bodies,"" he says. ""The country wants to forget what happened. But Muslims can never forget. It was a black day for us.""
The family had a business supplying wooden carvings to temples in Ayodhya. The workshop was razed to the ground, and Mr Shahid was forced to become a rickshaw driver to earn a living.
Like Mr Shahid, Anwari Begum wants her son Sohrab, who's in his 30s, to leave for his safety around the inauguration.
""I'm not scared, but I am nervous,"" he told the BBC. ""It's being said that 70,000 to 100,000 people are coming. The atmosphere could become charged, that's why Muslims are thinking of leaving. But I won't go. I don't think anything will happen.""
In Ayodhya, the temple site is abuzz with cranes and diggers sending dust into the air ahead of the inauguration. Thousands of workers in hard hats dot the area.
It's costing $217m (£170m) to build the temple, funded from private donations, the temple trust says. The makeover of the city is being done by the government, estimated to cost more than $3bn.
Amid the construction, hundreds and hundreds of proud worshippers stream in to get a glimpse of the idols, with rituals for their consecration in the new temple already under way.
Poonam Ohri, 40, had tears of joy rolling down her cheeks. ""Our dream has come true because of Modi and the BJP government. I am overwhelmed.""
Badri Narayan, an elderly farmer who had travelled hundreds of miles, said his happiness knew no bounds.
""When I visited before, Lord Ram's idol was in a makeshift tent. It was getting wet in the rain. Tears started falling from my eyes seeing that,"" he told the BBC. ""And now he has been released because of Modi.""
Prime Minister Modi has asked people not to come to Ayodhya on 22 January and to light a lamp in their homes. But he's also said everyone can visit from the next day.
And it is those days following the official ceremony which worry some in the Muslim community.
""If the government reached out to us and gave assurances that nothing will happen, that would prevent people from leaving, but so far they haven't done that,"" said Azam Qadri, a Muslim community leader.
Sohrab says ""political leaders should have come to us and said what happened to you was wrong - they should have showed compassion, but they have not"".
As for the new temple that's being opened, he says: ""We feel happy they are building their temple, but we are also sad because it was built after destroying a mosque.""
Mohammad Shahid says Hindus have the right to build the temple after the Supreme Court gave them the site. ""We did not accept that decision happily, but what can we do,"" he says.
After years in the courts, the disputed site was handed over to Hindus by a Supreme Court judgment in 2019, despite the judges also finding that the mosque's demolition had been illegal. The ruling relied on archaeological evidence which showed that features of the foundations of the mosque ""are suggestive of a Hindu religious origin"".
It also said that evidence placed on the record proved that there was Hindu faith and belief that the site was the birthplace of Ram.
It was not proved that a temple had been destroyed to build the mosque.
The court also ordered a separate plot be given to Muslims to construct a mosque. It's 15 miles from Ayodhya, overgrown and empty.
It is simply too far away, says Mr Qadri: ""If the government had given it as much attention by building roads and ring roads as it's doing for the temple, then work would have started there too.""
Prime Minister Modi and the BJP are expected to sweep the general election later this year following the inauguration of the temple.
Many accuse him and his party of violating the constitution, of turning a religious event into a state-sponsored one.
But the BJP's local MP, Lallu Singh, saw no reason why Mr Modi shouldn't attend.
""If the prime minister is Hindu, why should he not visit the biggest centre of Hindu faith? What should stop him? Lord Ram is representative of the culture of this country,"" he told the BBC.
""The culture of the majority dominates the country, so it is 100% right that the PM do the opening. This does not mean we are discriminating on the basis of religion.""
There is also controversy around moving the idols into an unfinished temple, with some Hindu religious leaders accusing the government of prioritising electoral gains over the sanctity of Hindu rituals.
""I don't want to comment on what our religious leaders say. But the sanctum sanctorum where the idol will sit is complete. More worshippers will be able to come with ease now, that's why we are opening it,"" the MP says.
Back in 1992, the BJP's senior leaders expressed regret over the demolition of the mosque and said it should never have happened. How does Lallu Singh feel about it now?
""I believe what happened was right,"" he says.
Most Muslims and Hindus the BBC spoke to don't think longer-term there will be more hostilities in Ayodhya.
But some see Ayodhya as just the start - disputes and court cases are already ongoing over mosques in the cities of Mathura and Varanasi, referred to many by its ancient name Kashi.
""We had to wait for 450 years to get the birthplace of Lord Ram. I hope Kashi and Mathura will be ours soon too,"" says Aakash Jadhav, a 21-year-old Hindu devotee."

A statement Friday from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Central District of California said Steven Robert Sablan, 62, of Cleburne, Texas, admitted in a plea agreement that he sexually assaulted the victim while driving her from Texas to California.
The girl was rescued July 9 in Long Beach, south of Los Angeles, after a passerby called 911 to report seeing her hold up the piece of paper with the handwritten desperate plea for help.
Sablan, who has been in federal custody since July 2023, pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping, prosecutors said.
His attorney to not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday.
In July, Sablan was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of kidnapping and transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.
An FBI agent wrote in an affidavit supporting the criminal complaint that the girl was walking down a street in San Antonio on July 6 when Sablan drove up, raised a black handgun and told her, “If you don’t get in the car with me, I am going to hurt you.”
A sentencing hearing was set for Oct. 25. Sablan will face a mandatory minimum of 20 years in federal prison and a maximum sentence of life.

Reported overdoses of semaglutide products such as Ozempic and Wegovy more than doubled between 2022 and 2023, according to America’s Poison Centers in Virginia.
""U.S. Poison Centers have documented 3,316 exposures to products containing semaglutide through Dec. 31, 2023, more than two times the number of cases reported in 2022,"" Dr. Kait Brown, clinical managing director of America’s Poison Centers, told Fox News Digital via email.
OZEMPIC AND WEGOVY COULD LEAD TO MUSCLE LOSS, EXPERTS SAY, BUT PREVENTION IS POSSIBLE
""These cases include exposures to prescription semaglutide, compounded semaglutide and counterfeit semaglutide,"" he said.
""Most of these cases are associated with accidental therapeutic errors in adults.""
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
Semaglutide medications are intended to be given in a low dose and increased slowly over a four-week period, according to Dr. Seth Kipnis, director of bariatric and robotic surgery at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune, New Jersey.
""If people jump right to the high dose, they will have more initial negative side effects,"" he told Fox News Digital.
In some cases, people who overdose may be getting the medication from a source other than a local doctor or taking someone else's prescribed medication, the doctor noted.
People with a semaglutide prescription should follow the manufacturer’s and prescribing physician's instructions, Kipnis advised.
""The dose is weekly,"" he said. ""If it is taken daily, it is too much.""
Dr. Maryann Amirshahi, co-medical director of the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C., confirmed that there has been a large overall increase in semaglutide overdoses reported to poison centers nationally.
""In addition, I have noticed a similar increase at my individual center,"" Amirshahi, who is also professor of emergency medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, told Fox News Digital.
The doctor attributes the increase to several factors, chiefly the ""huge increase"" in semaglutide prescribing.
OZEMPIC AND WEGOVY WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS COULD HELP REDUCE ALCOHOL USE DISORDER SYMPTOMS, STUDY SUGGESTS
""Secondarily, it is available in several different forms, which can cause confusion,"" Amirshahi noted.
""Ozempic is a dial-up pen with multiple doses — while Wegovy is a single-dose pen.""
Another source of confusion is that many people are using compounded products.
""Compounded versions have their own unique risks when it comes to a potential overdose, especially when they’re dispensed in multi-dose vials,"" noted Alyssa Billingsley, PharmD, Missouri-based director of pharmacy content at GoodRx.
""These injections are often dispensed in vials, so there’s a greater opportunity for dosing errors since you’re measuring out your specific dose with a syringe,"" she warned.
""In some cases, the vial may contain as much as 10 times the amount of semaglutide as a single-use injection pen.""
The most commonly reported overdose symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness and diarrhea, Brown noted.
""Some people have reported hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), which can be life-threatening,"" she said.
Symptoms of low blood sugar include confusion, tremor, lightheadedness and palpitations, according to Amirshahi.
""Semaglutide slows stomach emptying, which can lead to nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain,"" she said.
In some cases, the stomach becomes almost paralyzed, a condition called gastroparesis, which can lead to dehydration, abnormal electrolytes and kidney damage, said Amirshahi.
OZEMPIC, OTHER WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS MAY STRENGTHEN NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS, EXPERTS SAY: HEALTH GOAL 'BOOST'
Another potential effect of semaglutide overdose is inflammation of the pancreas.
""Symptoms of pancreatitis are very similar and can include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dehydration,"" Amirshahi noted.
These signs and symptoms can also occur among patients taking normal doses of the medication as well as in overdoses, she added.
While any drug overdose can be serious, experts noted that taking too much semaglutide is rarely fatal.
""Semaglutide is generally well-tolerated in overdose compared to other diabetes medications,"" Amirshahi said.
However, for people who develop gastroparesis or pancreatitis, potential complications can include dehydration and kidney damage.
""While low blood sugar is rare with semaglutide overdose, if it is not detected and treated early, it can lead to seizures,"" Amirshahi added.
Kipnis noted that in terms of adverse effects, ""anything is possible when an FDA-approved drug is taken inappropriately.""
Anyone who is taking a prescribed semaglutide should have a primary care physician or medical provider to provide close follow-up support, especially in the first several weeks as the dose increases, Kipnis advised.
Although there is no specific antidote for a semaglutide overdose, the primary course of action is to treat the abdominal symptoms with nausea and pain medications, correct electrolytes, and give fluids for dehydration, said Amirshahi.
""We also treat the low blood sugar by giving glucose or dextrose,"" she said. ""The care is really supportive until the effects of the medication wear off.""
In some cases, it may be possible to manage symptoms at home after consulting with a health care professional, but other situations may require immediate medical attention, Billingsley noted.

""For example, severe vomiting can result in serious dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, which can be dangerous if left untreated,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Severe cases of hypoglycemia can also be life-threatening.""
To prevent an overdose, Billingsley said to make sure you feel comfortable and confident using the injection pen and selecting your specific dose.
""Understand how often you should be injecting your dose, and consider using alarms, medication reminder apps, or other tools to help keep you on track,"" she recommended. ""Your pharmacist can be a helpful resource if any questions come up.""
For emergency assistance, call Poison Help at 1.800.222.1222 to speak with a poison expert or visit PoisonHelp.org for support and resources.
When contacted by Fox News Digital regarding the potential for overdoses, Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, provided a statement.
""Novo Nordisk is the only company in the U.S. with FDA-approved products containing semaglutide, identified under the trade names Wegovy, Ozempic and RYBELSUS, and should only be prescribed after a close consultation between a health care provider and a patient and should only be taken under the supervision of a health care provider,"" the company said.
It added, ""Novo Nordisk stands behind the safety and efficacy of our FDA-approved semaglutide medicines when used as indicated and when taken under the care of a licensed health care professional.""

8KD5QZR6CA_BP5EQ53POXH1Q2K,Transforming my beloved family home into a jewel | Holly Christensen,Holly Christensen,"January 21, 2024 at 8:03 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/transforming-beloved-family-home-jewel-110347074.html,"I met Herman Dreisbach in February of 2003 when he was 88 years old. His wife of 60 years had died the previous February, and he was selling his house to move to Atlanta, where his son and daughter-in-law lived.
Once a tall man, Mr. Dreisbach's upper back and neck stooped forward from osteoporosis; his slow gait belied muscles that had weakened with age and bones that ached.
Each of the three times I visited his house, the final time with the home inspector, I had small children with me. Unperturbed by youngsters touring his tidy home, Mr. Dreisbach comfortably chatted with them.
The last time we met, Mr. Dreisbach took my hand in both of his, and with tears in his eyes, he told me: ""I hope you'll be as happy in this house as we were."" He died nine months later.
I've now owned what we call Dreisbach House for over 20 years. My first three children spent the bulk of their childhoods in the home, and my fourth son was born there. Then, for several years, I lived with the father of my youngest two children in his home and rented out Dreisbach House.
No tenant kept the house as clean as I did. But I soon learned that messes can be cleaned and damages repaired. Still, my heart hurt when tenants were not gentle with the house.
Little expense was spared when a maternal uncle of Mr. Dreisbach built the house in 1909. The exterior walls of the home are two layers of brick, which is why to this day none of the stairs or floors creak. Like a manufactured cave, all that brick keeps the house, which has hot water heat and no air conditioning, remarkably cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
The Arts and Crafts interior includes quarter-sawn oak columns and panels, a fireplace with decorative tiles from a renowned turn-of-the-century manufacturer, multiple pocket doors and two original light fixtures. And because the home remained in one fastidious family for 94 years, it is in remarkable shape.
Dreisbach House shares a driveway with its next-door neighbor to the south. In 2014, I bought that house, too.
For more than 60 years, it belonged to Claire and Gloria Cressler. Claire had been a widower for three years when I first met him. Years later, he would die in my arms.
In 2020, I moved into what we call Cressler House. I decided to stop renting Dreisbach House when my most recent tenants moved out. I owe less than $8,000 on the mortgage and, like its first owner, that puts me in a position to remodel the home without sparing many expenses.
Now, a new thread will be added to the warp and weft of my byline throughout my years as a Beacon Journal columnist − the process of transforming my beloved family home, the Dreisbach House, into a jewel. These columns will include design choices and the progress of projects, but also the histories of the people who previously lived here, as well as my family's history in these homes.
I was hired in October of 2016 to write a parenting/family column for the Akron Beacon Journal. At the time, my eldest child was in college and my fifth (and youngest) child was in preschool. Those first years, I wrote mostly on parenting.
Letters from readers often compared me to syndicated parenting columnist John Rosemond. Older readers regularly complimented me on how similarly to Rosemond's approach I parented, while younger readers wrote to say they admired how differently my parenting advice was to that of Rosemond's. Go figure.
Throughout my time at the Beacon, I have often written columns that were pointedly political. In 2017, I explained why I, a mother of a child with Down syndrome, was opposed to the Down syndrome abortion ban passed by the Ohio legislature and signed by the governor. Just before that column ran, the Beacon's editor told me I'd get a lot of negative emails over it, but also that he knew I could handle it.
I've gotten far worse emails since, particularly when I've written anything involving race. I know I've done something right when I've provoked the ire of bigots who take the time to let me know what they think − though rarely about what I've written. No, bigots like to deride me as a person and, almost always, what I look like.
Three of my children are now adults. The first two have multiple college degrees and full-blown careers. One is getting married later this year. My relationship with them all is understandably different than it was over seven years ago, and yet, two of my adult sons still call me almost every day.
As a result, the content of my columns has expanded to topics facing our community, which often are issues that directly affect families.
To best accommodate this array of storylines and opinions, my column has a new, and more appropriate, home in the print edition's community section. Here, I can have columns that are political, others that are personal, and some that are the ins and outs of a major project.
I hope you'll enjoy reading future columns as much as I will writing them.

Austin Police said the suspect, who was shot by officers, was in custody. Police said the relationship between the suspect and victims was currently unknown.
APD Interim Chief Robin Henderson shared details of the incident Sunday. Henderson said Austin 911 received a call for emergency medical services around 12:29 a.m. to a home on Uttimer Lane.
The caller said he was stabbed in the stomach and was bleeding. The caller also said a man was holding a knife with a woman victim inside the home.
At 12:33 a.m., the first APD officer was assigned to the call. At 12:36 a.m., three APD officers in marked units arrived at the scene. The officers gathered information from a group of people outside the home, including a person with stab wounds who pointed officers toward the door.
Henderson said officers heard screaming inside the home as they approached the door and forced entry through the front door.
At 12:37 a.m., officers entered the door and found a man suspect with a knife holding a woman with stab wounds.
“To protect the life of that victim, officers discharged their department-approved firearms, striking the male suspect,” Henderson said.
The first injured woman was taken out of the home. Officers also found three unharmed children in the home. They were safely taken outside.
A second woman with stab wounds was found on the floor of a bedroom. Henderson said officers attempted life-saving measures, but the woman died.
The two people who were stabbed are in stable condition at a local hospital, Henderson said.
Henderson said no officers were injured. Three officers discharged firearms and had four years, more than five years and eight months of service, respectively. They will be placed on administrative duty.
The incident was captured on body cameras, and the video will be released within 10 business days, per APD policy.
APD will conduct a criminal investigation by the APD special investigations unit with the Travis County District Attorney’s office and an administrative investigation by the APD Internal Affairs Unit with the Office of Police Oversight.
People with information can call the APD Special Investigations Unit at 512-974-6840 or the Capital Area Crimestoppers at 512-472-8477.

8S9K0BK0B6_0XP29REBS6H060A,Pleasing Signs As A Number Of Insiders Buy Luca Mining Stock,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 9:24 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pleasing-signs-number-insiders-buy-122452165.html,"Usually, when one insider buys stock, it might not be a monumental event. But when multiple insiders are buying like they did in the case of Luca Mining Corp. (CVE:LUCA), that sends out a positive message to the company's shareholders.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.
View our latest analysis for Luca Mining
The insider Ralph Shearing made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for CA$300k worth of shares at a price of CA$0.35 each. That means that even when the share price was higher than CA$0.29 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.
While Luca Mining insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!
Luca Mining is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.
Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Our information indicates that Luca Mining insiders own about CA$390k worth of shares. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. We might be missing something but that seems like very low insider ownership.
It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Luca Mining shares in the last quarter. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. While we have no worries about the insider transactions, we'd be more comfortable if they owned more Luca Mining stock. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Luca Mining you should be aware of, and 1 of these is concerning.
If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.
For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.

The man was said to have dark hair and an accent not local to the area.
He asked her to get into the car, but when she refused he got out and tried to drag her in.
Dyfed-Powys Police said the woman escaped to a nearby house.
A spokesman said: ""She was not harmed but is understandably shaken by the incident.""
The force added that its investigation had established the car drove along Hendre Road from Tan Y Graig Road.

The competition was launched to promote global water conservation.
Kathleen Murray said she relies on ""nature's lawn mowers,"" like wallabies, kangaroos, and echidnas.
Not everyone would consider it a compliment, but an Australian woman is thrilled after an international panel gave her the ""World's Ugliest Lawn"" award.
Officials from the Swedish island of Gotland launched the competition to ""save water by changing the norm of green lawns,"" according to a press release from the island. Judges included Gotland officials and individuals from Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, and the US.
""That's the genius of this competition. It uses humor to shine a light on such a serious subject,"" the press release said. ""It awards those willing to proudly proclaim that theirs is the lawn which deserves disgusted glances from neighbors – and a round of applause from around the globe.""
As a prize, the Swedish competition awarded Kathleen Murray of Tasmania with a ""Proud owner of The World's Ugliest Lawn"" t-shirt. The press release noted that all contestants had ""a lot of ugliness to be proud of"" in their dry yards.
""Kathleen Murray's lawn boasts deep, dry divots created by three wild bandicoots (small marsupials endemic to Australia) and not one dust-covered decimeter is wasted on watering. For that, the planet, and its dwindling stockpiles of life-giving liquid, thanks you, Kathleen,"" the press release said.
Murray, a 53-year-old mother of four, told The Washington Post she meant to start landscaping her yard, but eventually, she just gave up, allowing local burrowers and grazers — such as wallabies, kangaroos, echidnas, and bandicoots — to be ""nature's lawn mowers.""
""They don't think my backyard is ugly,"" Murray told the Post. ""They think it's beautiful.""

""To say that everything is fine is not true,” Budanov said, responding to assessments that the counter-offensive fell short of its objectives.
“To say that there is a catastrophe is also not true. Although the original plans suggested something different, we kept our promise. This summer, our units repeatedly entered Crimea.""
Ukraine will be able to keep Russian dictator Vladimir Putin at bay and has already proved that “the whole legend of [Russia’s] power is a soap bubble,” Budanov said.
Thanks to weapons from North Korea, Russia was able to ""breathe a little,"" and without this help ""the situation would have been catastrophic"" for Moscow, he said.

Budanov also commented on mobilization in Ukraine, saying that it is hard to imagine that it is possible to continue the war effort without recruiting additional people.
""The shortage [of manpower] is palpable,"" he said.
The Ukrainian counter-offensive, announced in spring 2023 alongside the formation of a Western tank coalition and the delivery of Western-style tanks, faced various setbacks.
The Defense Ministry declared the transition to offensive operations in early June 2023, reporting success in the Zaporizhzhya sector.
Western media then stated that Ukraine had begun a counter-offensive, reporting attacks by the AFU on the frontlines in the southeastern part of the country, as well as ""significant"" equipment losses.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed on June 10 the start of the counter-offensive.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) successfully liberated several villages on the border of Zaporizhzhya and Donetsk oblasts in June. The Defense Ministry reported that Ukrainian troops were engaged in a preparatory formative operation, saying that the main offensive was yet to come.

Western media publications later began to suggest that the AFU's progress was lagging, a situation that can partly be attributed to extensively reinforced Russian defense lines. President Zelenskyy acknowledged that the counter-offensive was falling short of its desired pace.
In late June, Western media began to note that Ukraine had begun to change tactics after failures in the first stage. The Washington Post later said that Commander-in-Chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi abandoned the original plan after four days.
Ukraine has been disappointed that some of its allies seem to have underestimated the scale of the battlefield and the strength of Russian defenses, possibly causing them to deliver military aid more slowly and hindering the counter-offensive’s progress, said Bloomberg.
President Zelenskyy has nevertheless asserted that Ukraine ""remains strong"" and emphasized that Ukraine achieved a number of remarkable successes in the Black Sea and in Russia-occupied Crimea.

AMHERST, NH (NEXSTAR) – In New Hampshire, Nikki Haley has hosted events across the state to meet local residents. Events like these could potentially increase her chances of getting ahead in the polls.
On Friday, January 19, the former South Carolina governor joined voters in Amherst, New Hampshire for some casual conversation and pictures. This event was hosted at Mary Ann’s Diner and was one of many Haley held across the state to engage with voters on a personal level.
Michelle Rogers, a supporter of Haley, appreciated the connection she felt she was able to form with the politician.
“She goes around. She talks to you as a person. She doesn’t talk to you as much as she’s 25,000 levels above you. She talks to you very genuine,” Rogers said.
Other residents, like Al Lacey, were happy to be able to meet the potential Presidential nominee.
“I was just excited that she was going to be here. You know, a buddy of mine called me and told me and we only live two minutes down the road. So, I said, let’s go over. Me and my wife came, and I like her. I think she’s very nice,” Lacey commented.
On Friday, polls indicated that Haley was still trailing former President Donald Trump by 17 points. Many of the Haley supporters were former Trump voters who say they are supporting the former governor over the former president.
“She is truthful. She is knowledgeable. She does not lie. She is truthful!” Rogers expressed.
Other candidates, like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Trump, are only holding rallies in New Hampshire leading up to primary day. However, Haley’s decision to meet face-to-face with voters in a casual setting made many supporters at the event feel comfortable with her and made them see her as a real person, not just a politician.
“I think it’s really good to see that they’re just human, normal people, right?” said a member of the Casalegno and Haslam families, “And to bring it back to real life level, especially for the kids to see that and what a better way than in a place where you’re eating lunch.”
These personal interactions with voters could be what Haley needs to secure a win this Tuesday.

MANCHESTER, N.H. (NEXSTAR) – Over the past week in New Hampshire, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley said she plans to support service members, veterans, and their families by expanding Veteran Affair’s healthcare, as well as implementing telehealth into treatment plans to make it more accessible.
In addition, she addressed the high rate of homelessness among veterans, and the need to support them after they return home.
“We’ve made progress with the VA, I get my healthcare from them. But, I think she’s right that if we had more conversations things would get better,” said Roy Hunter, 54, a U.S Army veteran.
Paul Gonsalves is a Naval veteran who originally was a Chris Christie supporter, but switched his vote to Haley after the former New Jersey governor suspended his campaign.
During Haley’s visit to a local diner that afternoon, he was able to speak one-one-one with the former ambassador about military families and their needs.
“We were talking about military families and I asked about how her husband was doing and military spouses – my wife did it for about 30 years,” Gonsalves said. “As far as I’m concerned, the spouses are the real heroes, they’re the ones who hold down the fort.”
Haley has been vocal about her role as a military spouse on several occasions during her time in New Hampshire.
“When you have a loved one deployed, it’s your lone prayer that they just come back home to you safely,” Haley said.
For Gonsalves, Haley’s personal experience having a loved one in the military was impactful, but her pledge to solve veteran’s homelessness was a key factor as well.
“We have a lot of veterans who are on the street that are homeless, and that’s inexcusable,” Gonsalves said. “What they’ve done for their country, we should feel ashamed to have them living like that.”
“The number one question we have to ask ourselves is what our responsibility is as citizens.”

But for some, the passenger rail hurtling northbound and southbound through Brevard County crossings at upwards of 90 mph is also a symbol of something more dangerous. Five local fatalities since Brightline's debut between Orlando and Miami last September have prompted concerns about safety, and the three most recent deaths, in two crashes just two days apart at the same crossing, have put some in the community on edge.
Caleb Hortner fishes at the Crane Creek park often. It's a place of respite where he brings his grandson to chance upon a snook or, if they're lucky, a redfish. A longtime resident of the county, he sees Brightline as a way to push transportation forward. But like many, he has concerns about the safety of the passenger rail system. ""I know it's something that can be good, but right now I'm a little worried,"" Hortner said from the water's edge, less than a mile from where the latest deaths took place.
More: Melbourne police investigate second fatal Brightline train collision in three days
Along with fishing in the area, he takes regular constitutionals along Strawbridge Avenue, often crossing the rails that have proven fatal since Brightline's inception.
Brightline has made efforts to increase safety, including the installation of ""quad gates"" or raised medians at crossings in Brevard where trains pass at speeds of more than 79 mph, encompassing 40 of the 50 crossings Brightline trains pass within Brevard, according Katie Mitzner, director of public affairs at Brightline.
The quad gates ― also known as four-quadrant gates ― span all the lanes of traffic in each direction, rather than only the traffic lanes a vehicle would approach the tracks from. These measures act as safeguards against motorists trying to maneuver around the crossings when the gates are down and the train is approaching.
Those gates were not present at the intersections where recent crashes took place because Brightline was not going over 79 mph through those areas. And according to initial police reports, in the Jan. 10 and Jan. 12 crashes, drivers attempted to drive around the barrier gates blocking the crossing, attempts that proved fatal.
More: 4 fatal Brightline crashes happened in Melbourne, with 2 in 3 days. Here's what we know
""The community is sort of shocked that this could happen. Obviously people going around the gates is unacceptable but people in the city still want something done,"" Melbourne Mayor Paul Alfrey said.
Alfrey said he and other city leaders had a meeting scheduled with Brightline in order to discuss possible solutions going forward.
Whether that could look like improved gates, more driver awareness, slower trains, or other solutions, he couldn't say. The topic will come up for discussion at the Melbourne City Council meeting Tuesday.
On Friday, members of the Brightline Safety and Security team handed out train crossing safety information on New Haven Avenue in downtown Melbourne. Police officers and Florida East Coast Railway Society members were part of the informational effort.
In the city of Cocoa, councilwoman Lorraine Koss said certain things may need to be done to ameliorate the crashes and ensure Brightline's arrival is a positive for the community.
""Brightline is here to stay,"" Koss said.
""I think it can be a good thing for all of this but there’s definitely adapting to be done. It’s a wakeup call. We have to shift into high gear with education and awareness. What we’ve already done isn’t reaching folks.”

Koss said she and others on Cocoa City Council have been in talks with Brightline on what, if any, measures can be taken, whether it's education and awareness, improved mechanisms at crossings or some other option.
""We need to do a concerted education effort. I spoke to Brightline earlier this week. I know they are looking into other measures to make it even more prohibitive to enter the tracks,"" Koss said. Alfrey, like Koss, said he hopes Brightline listens to the concerns of people in Melbourne and Brevard County on what can be done.
Brevard County Commissioner Rob Feltner, whose Commission District 4 includes a section of Melbourne where Brightline trains go through, said he would like to see installation of more safety features at rail crossings, including having both the quad gates and raised medians at crossings, rather than only one or the other.
Feltner said he is seeking to have discussions between Brevard County and city of Melbourne officials about ways to improve the safety at crossings, and how to pay for them.
Additionally, Feltner said the county plans to have a representative of the Space Coast Transportation Planning Organization make a presentation about the issue at an upcoming County Commission meeting.
Although the issue of drivers circumventing safety measures can't necessarily be fixed overnight, some have concerns that the problem is the result of larger issues.
Melbourne resident Bonnie Ida said she recently witnessed a malfunctioning gate arm at Aurora Road, where two pedestrians, one on Oct. 19 and on Christmas Eve, were struck and killed by Brightline trains.
In Ida's case, the arm began to go up and down even after a train had finished passing, and after a long wait behind the arm, drivers including her decided to turn around rather than take their chances.
""I have been in situations in the past when cars proceeded around a stuck crossing gate, and I thought how tempting it might be that day if the wait got long enough for people who needed to proceed,"" Ida said.
Right now, Horton said, ""it's just something I'm being extra careful about.""
""I've always been wary of train tracks but now, especially when I've got my grandson with me, we take an extra second or two before crossing,"" he said.
Jake McMurphy takes his car for servicing near where the Jan. 12 collision came to a stop. In that case, the train dragged an SUV around a quarter-mile before the train was able to complete braking.
He said it's ""terrifying"" to think about, but he's not worried for himself or his family. ""I wouldn't try to go around the gates. No way. I don't know what people are thinking,"" McMurphy said.
Still, he voiced concerns.
""I do think maybe they should do something,"" he said.
""I'm not sure what they can do but there's gotta be something.""

The First Minister wrote to the UK Labour leader, inviting him to his Bute House residence in Edinburgh so “we can establish a working relationship in the interests of the people we represent”.
Among the issues he said he wanted to discuss with Sir Keir were the UK rejoining the EU’s single market and the SNP’s “democratic mandate for a referendum on independence, which should be respected”.
Mr Yousaf made the invitation as he attempted to persuade independence supporters they could vote SNP in this year’s general election and still get a Labour government at Westminster.
With polls showing the SNP is on course to lose more than 20 seats to Labour, he argued that Sir Keir’s party was so far ahead in the polls that it did not need Scotland to triumph.
But Labour has pointed out that in 2019 the party suffered its worst election defeat since 1935 and needs a swing larger than that achieved by Tony Blair to win power.
Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, attacked the SNP’s “completely chaotic messaging” on voting in the upcoming election and argued that the polls would narrow.
In an effort to woo independence supporters disillusioned with the SNP, he denied that a Labour victory in Scotland in the election would kill off Scottish separation.
Mr Sarwar said there was a “raging debate around the country” on independence that would continue but argued he wanted to show nationalists that “we can make Scotland work within a devolved settlement”.
Mr Yousaf told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg that accepting his invitation for talks “would be the grown-up and responsible thing” for the Labour leader to do.
The First Minister said: “It will hardly be a surprise that when I speak to Keir Starmer… I will advocate for a second independence referendum.”
Mr Yousaf complained that his party’s “mandate has been ignored over the years”, adding: “I hope [Sir Keir] will take a respectful approach to listening to Scotland’s voice.”
The SNP winning the most seats in Scotland at the general election will “send a really strong message to Westminster that Scotland will not be ignored”, he argued.
In his letter to Sir Keir, he said he also wished to discuss removing the two-child benefit cap and helping deliver Labour’s £28 billion Green Prosperity Plan. He argued: “UK membership of at least the European single market has to be back on the agenda.”
Mr Yousaf concluded: “We may have political differences, but I do not think these should prevent us being able to work together, now and after the next UK general election.”
Mr Sarwar told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show the election was not about independence, adding: “I’ve been really clear that I’m not going to turn my back, close my eyes, or shut my ears to any voter in the country, whether they voted yes or no.”
Asked whether his party would use a Labour win to “endorse the Union”, Mr Sarwar said: “No, because I want to persuade people that we can make Scotland work within a devolved settlement.”
Meanwhile, one of Scotland’s most eminent businessmen said the SNP had been in power “too long” and argued Scotland having six income tax bands from April compared to England’s three was “ridiculous”.
Sir Tom Hunter told Ms Kuenssberg that the SNP Government “believes they know best, but the facts are not with them”.
He said business leaders in Scotland “don’t believe this Government has their back and that is a very bad situation”.

Evidence at the scene and witness statements showed that a Ford F150 was driving eastbound on Flamingo Road approaching the intersection behind a moped.
The crash occurred when the Ford failed to slow down when approaching the intersection and crashed into the back of the moped. The 66-year-old moped rider was thrown from the moped and the Ford continued east on Flamingo Road, police said.
The moped rider was pronounced dead at the scene.
Detectives canvassed the area and located a truck the matched the description of the vehicle. The truck was determined to be the one from the crash and the driver, identified as 68-year-old Kenneth Frank, was taken into custody.
Frank faces charges of reckless driving resulting in death and failure to stop at the scene of an accident, records show. Frank is scheduled to appear in court Sunday.
Police said the driver did not show any signs of impairment.
This death marks the 11th traffic-related fatality in LVMPD’s jurisdiction for 2024.

9BNHJ5LURA_KJJW7ZXPKPTS6G2,Eisenberg sells 'dream' film as Sasquatch saga prompts Sundance walkouts,Andrew MARSZAL,"January 22, 2024 at 4:19 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/eisenberg-sells-dream-film-sasquatch-191943230.html,"Jesse Eisenberg sold his whip-smart road trip movie to Disney for a reported $10 million Sunday -- as his second film at the Sundance festival, a bizarre scatological tale about Sasquatches, caused audience walkouts.
It has been a busy weekend at the Utah-based indie movie fest for the actor, best known for his Oscar-nominated portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network,"" but who is increasingly turning his hand to directing.
""A Real Pain"" is Eisenberg's second feature as director, and the first in which he also stars -- alongside Kieran Culkin, who is fresh off his Emmy win last weekend for ""Succession.""
The heartfelt comedy about two American cousins visiting Poland to honor their late grandmother who survived the Holocaust was inspired by Eisenberg's own Polish family's backstory.
""I think if I wrote something that was not (personal), I don't think I would feel anything for it, and it probably wouldn't be as good,"" Eisenberg told AFP.
""Or maybe I'd be happier and I wouldn't feel nervous about everything! I don't know.""
Less than 24 hours after its well-received premiere, ""A Real Pain"" was bought by Disney-owned Searchlight, in the festival's biggest deal so far, and will hit theaters later this year.
Eisenberg and Culkin star as wildly different cousins who are brought back together by the trip.
Eisenberg's David is happily married and successful while Culkin's Benji is unemployed and drifting.
Yet David is nervous and aloof while Benji's blunt, outspoken charisma endears him to everyone around them.
""I connected with the character immediately, which almost never happens,"" said Culkin.
""I think it's happened three times ever, in my life,"" including his beloved role as Roman Roy in ""Succession,"" he added.
The pair join a guided tour of Polish Jewish sites -- a luxurious, all-inclusive trip which jars against the harrowing ancestral trauma they are confronted with on a visit to a Nazi concentration camp.
The movie's producers, who include Emma Stone, negotiated extensively to get rare filming access to the Majdanek camp.
Eisenberg said a trip he took to Poland in 2008 had raised questions like ""What if I lived here? What if the war didn't happen? What if history didn't change so drastically and I was here... what would I be doing?""
Shooting at locations ""where my family is from, places that I find really beautiful in Poland... the movie is like my dream come true,"" he said.
- 'Endure' -
Presumably less personal was Eisenberg's other Sundance film, ""Sasquatch Sunset,"" in which he and Riley Keough don hirsute full-body costumes and makeup to play two members of a family of Bigfoots.
The 90-minute movie has no dialogue, and mainly consists of the ape-like creatures mating, masturbating, excreting and -- on occasion -- dying in gory circumstances.
At a press screening attended by AFP, at least a dozen audience members walked out within the first half hour.
""Your ability to laugh, appreciate or endure 'Sasquatch Sunset' will depend on your tolerance for slapstick humor,"" noted a Hollywood Reporter review of the film, also produced by Eisenberg.
The Daily Beast said the ""litany"" of ""ghastly bodily functions, fluids, and feral flamboyance"" was too long to list.
Sundance runs until January 28.

Passing hikers noticed the woman's dog stuck on a steep slope, barking.
Rescuers saved the dog, then launched a search for its missing owner.
Rescuers in Honolulu saved a 35-year-old woman who had fallen roughly 170 feet down the side of a mountain thanks to her dog, who barked incessantly and alerted passersby.
The Honolulu Fire Department said in a statement that a group of hikers called 911 on January 15 to report a barking dog on a steep mountain slope, who was apparently without a handler. A rescuer rappelled some 20 feet down the slope and airlifted the dog to safety — but the pilot noticed an object roughly 70 feet below where the dog has been found.
The same rescuer rappelled down to the object and discovered that it was a bag filled with personal items.
The fire department said rescuers noticed the dog's collar had its owner's name and phone number — but when they called the number, no one answered. They said the Honolulu Police Department performed a wellness check at the owner's address, but found no one home.
Ultimately, rescuers realized the dog's owner had parked her car at the trailhead and they launched ""an extensive and coordinated search by air and ground"" for the missing owner.
Rescuers located the woman shortly after, and found her underneath some ""thick foliage"" roughly 100 feet below the spot where her bag was found. Rescuers put her on a stretcher and airlifted her off the mountain and brought her to the hospital.
The woman's condition remains unclear.

9D5AJN1FF2_AY7HKZHWO6SOQRV,'Skeletons in the closet?' UK govt bashes opposition leader Starmer,Peter HUTCHISON,"January 21, 2024 at 11:57 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/skeletons-closet-uk-govt-bashes-025743684.html,"Britain's ruling Conservatives are stepping up personal attacks on opposition Labour leader and former prominent lawyer Keir Starmer, who is tipped to become prime minister after the next general election.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Tories and sympathetic right-leaning newspapers are targeting Starmer's record as a leading human rights lawyer and public prosecutor in a bid to haul back support from his centre-left party.
Political scientists view the broadsides as an increasingly desperate tactic by a government that is running out of ideas and probably in its death throes, after 14 years in power.
""Are you a terrorist in need of legal advice? Better call Keir,"" read a mocked-up poster published by the Conservatives this week on X, the social media site formerly called Twitter.
""When @RishiSunak sees a group chanting jihad on our streets, he bans them. Keir Starmer invoices them,"" the party added in an adjacent comment.
The dig related to advice that Starmer gave the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir in 2008, when the organisation challenged a ban on its activities in Germany.
The government in London this week declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a ""terrorist"" organisation and banned it from operating in the UK.
Sunak said during the weekly prime minister's questions in the House of Commons on Wednesday that the now-proscribed group had once been ""a client"" of Starmer's.
""If Keir Starmer wasn't leader of the opposition, he'd be representing a lot of these people still today,"" Sunak's press secretary told reporters afterwards.
A Labour spokesman stressed that Starmer did not formally represent Hizb ut-Tahrir, and shortly afterwards became the chief state prosecutor in England and Wales.
""The nature of being a lawyer is that you represent and give advice to a whole range of clients, including people that you don't agree with,"" he added.
The brickbats fit a pattern. Britain's Tory-supporting press recently reported that Starmer had represented an Irish Republican Army member and hate preacher Abu Qatada.
Labour and legal experts reiterate that Starmer would have been obliged to do so under the ""cab rank rule"", which ensures that everyone receives legal representation whoever they are.
- 'No smoking gun' -
The personal slights also tie into Britain's so-called culture wars, with 43-year-old Sunak -- a privately educated former investment banker -- fond of accusing Starmer, 61, of being a ""lefty lawyer"".
Starmer defended a number of salient causes as a human rights barrister, including defending trades unions and anti-McDonald's activists.
He also worked to ensure police in Northern Ireland complied with human rights legislation.
In 2008, Starmer was appointed director of public prosecutions for England and Wales at the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), a role he held until 2013.
He oversaw the prosecution of lawmakers for abusing their expenses, journalists for phone hacking and young rioters involved in 2011 unrest across England, earning a knighthood, giving him the title ""Sir Keir"", in 2015.
The privately wealthy Sunak has accused Starmer, the son of a toolmaker and a nurse who ran a donkey sanctuary, of being ""soft on crime, soft on criminals"", and has dubbed him ""Sir Softie"".
Starmer told an ITV documentary this week that ""of course"" there will have been mistakes committed during his tenure leading the CPS.
""But there'll be no smoking gun, no skeletons in the closet,"" he insisted.
A YouGov poll released this week found Labour 27 points ahead of the Conservatives, before the election, the date of which Sunak is yet to announce.
The survey put the ruling party on only 20-percent support, suggesting it is heading for a landslide defeat.
The Tories have presided over a crippling cost-of-living crisis in recent months, record waiting lists for hospital treatment and served up five prime ministers since the 2016 Brexit vote.
""The cupboard is bare, isn't it?"" Robert Ford, a political scientist at Manchester University, said of the motivation for the personal attacks.
""They haven't got much to run on.""
Tim Bale, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, does not think the barbs will land with voters.
""The personal stuff is unlikely to trump the bread and butter issues that are killing this government, most obviously the state of the economy and the National Health Service,"" he told AFP.

9HIG5V6315_F3824SW7U2Z9X7A,Watch: Trump is not ‘mentally fit’ says Haley after he confuses her with Nancy Pelosi,Rozina Sabur,"January 21, 2024 at 10:47 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/watch-trump-not-mentally-fit-134709247.html,"Nikki Haley never seems to be far from Donald Trump’s thoughts.
Fresh off a landslide win in Iowa, the former president hopes to cement his hold on the Republican nomination contest in New Hampshire, which votes next, and only Ms Haley stands in the way.
“I don’t even talk about DeSanctus - whatever happened to him?” Mr Trump told a rally in Concord, using his nickname for Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who is polling a distant third in the state.
But he had plenty to say about Ms Haley. His former UN ambassador, he said, wasn’t “tough enough”, “smart enough”, or “respected enough” to be the commander-in-chief.
“She’s down very low [in polls]. We’ll finish it off. This could end it,” he said ahead of Tuesday’s election in the Granite State.
Mr Trump is not wrong. The result could determine the trajectory of the Republican primary contest.
If Mr Trump, 77, repeats the large margin of victory he secured in the Iowa caucuses last week, it is likely to be game over for Ms Haley, 52, and Mr DeSantis, 45.
But Ms Haley’s bet on New Hampshire has put her head-to-head with Mr Trump, and in contention to win the state.
To power her to victory she is relying on a broad voter coalition, made up of Republicans who have tired of Mr Trump, and independents, who are able to vote in the state’s open primary.
In a state where the motto is “live free or die”, non-party affiliated voters make up almost two fifths of the electorate.
They may play an even more pivotal role this year because there is no real contest on the Democratic side.
Aware of the threat, Mr Trump has already laid the foundation to claim foul play.
He has claimed Democrats could “infiltrate” the race, although the deadline to switch party registration was in October.
Mr Trump appears to be so unsettled by his 52-year-old rival he even uses her name seemingly unintentionally as he went on his tirade on Friday night in Concord.
As he discussed the lack of security at the Jan 6, 2021 Capitol riots, he seemed to criticise Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat Speaker of the House of Representatives at the time, but used Nikki Haley’s name.
He said: “By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6, you know, Nikki Haley. Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, you know, they – did you know they destroyed all the information and all of the evidence.
“Because of lots of things, like Nikki Haley is in charge of security. We offered 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guard. So whatever they want, they turned it down.”
Like the apparition of a pantomime villain, the crowd booed, on cue, at the mention of the former South Carolina governor’s name.
But some looked confused. Ms Haley had not been near the Capitol at the time, nor had she been in elected office, much less responsible for the security of the Capitol.
Ms Haley lost no time in highlighting the gaffe, and pressing her advantage.
“They’re saying he got confused,” Ms Haley told her own supporters in Keene, western New Hampshire, the next morning.
“I’m not saying anything derogatory,” she continued, “but when you’re dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do this.”
Ms Haley’s willingness to hit Mr Trump with personal attacks is testament to the make-or-break stage of her campaign.
Mr Trump, too, has ramped up the rhetoric in recent days, nicknaming Ms Haley “Nimbra”, in what has been criticised as a dog whistle reference to her given name, Nimarata.
He has even given oxygen to a false “birther” conspiracy that Ms Haley is not eligible to become a US president on account of her Indian heritage.
Steven Cheung, Mr Trump’s campaign spokesman, has dismissed allegations of racism as “faux outrage”.
Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign’s press secretary, told The Telegraph they were “very confident that he remains in a strong position to win”.
“It’s just too bad that Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis don’t realise that they have no practical pathway to the nomination,” she said, adding: “If they want to keep staying in this race, we will fight them until they’re out.”
Ms Haley has been undeterred, criss-crossing the state’s snowy, rugged terrain, promising to shake every hand and answer any question.
“It’s the Haley and Trump show all week,” said New Hampshire-based strategist Jim Merrill, who held senior roles in campaigns of George W Bush, Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio.
He said: “It’s one of the last opportunities for voters to send the message that they want to make a change from Donald Trump and I think Nikki Haley has positioned herself to be in striking distance”.
New Hampshire’s electorate, Mr Merrill added, poses a “challenge” for Mr Trump. It is wealthier, has more university-educated voters, and favours candidates who have broader appeal.
But he cautions against viewing New Hampshire’s large independent constituency as a given advantage for Ms Haley.
“This is not a monolithic voting bloc,” he said, describing it as a healthy mix of conservatives, libertarians and progressives.
Added to which, Ms Haley must still contend with Mr Trump’s unshakeable grip over the Republican grassroots.
Hundreds of his supporters waited patiently in a snow-covered car park for over an hour to see the former president in Concord on Friday night.
Some wore red “MAGA” woolly hats or scarves to shield them from the bitterly cold winds as temperatures fell to -7C. Others had brought camp chairs in anticipation of the lengthy queues.
They included Jack Lianos, a 17-year-old student, who hopes to cast his first vote for Mr Trump in November’s general election, by which time he will be 18.
“I love Trump’s foreign policy,” he said, a key voting issue for him. “He’s not dumping money on other nations. I think that American money should stay in America.”
Like Jack, it was 40-year-old sales worker Geoff’s first Trump rally. A self-described libertarian conservative, he wasn’t an early convert to Mr Trump. But he was won over by the “peace and prosperity” he saw as the hallmark of the former president’s first term.
“I was managing a multi-million dollar company at the time and our best years were the Trump years,” he said. He’s ready, as he puts it, for “another go round with Trump”.
When he bounded onto stage, Mr Trump lost no time reminding them of their mission for Tuesday: turning out “in record numbers”.
“Margins are important,” he told them. “Not because of the people we’re running against... [but] because this could end it.”
He added: “And then we can focus on Biden.”

“If you can select a Republican ballot on Tuesday, we urge you to select Nikki Haley as your next president. New Hampshire is ready for a change,” the op-ed from Union Leader said. “America is ready for a change. The world is ready for a change. We want a better option than we have had for the past eight years, and Nikki Haley is that option.”
The op-ed, published Sunday, described the two most recent presidents without naming them directly as “dinosaurs” who “had their shot and nature selected them for extinction.”
“The dinosaurs from the last two administrations have indeed had their shot and Nikki Haley is the fireball from the heavens to wipe them out,” the op-ed wrote.
“Putting forward a rematch of the last election means putting an octogenarian in the White House and putting a less-than-capable vice president in the on-deck circle,” the op-ed continued. “Haley has not been shy with the fact that she has at least a quarter-century age advantage on those candidates and she has a good point. Nikki Haley is in her prime and selflessly willing to give that prime to the country her parents chose to raise their family in.”
The op-ed argued voting for Haley is a vote for a candidate, rather than just against President Biden and former President Trump, both of whom maintain comfortable leads in their respective party races.
The op-ed did not name GOP rivals Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or Trump, who holds a 11.1 point lead over Haley in New Hampshire, according to a polling index maintained by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ. While notable, Trump’s lead in recent weeks was narrowed as Haley climbed in the polls in the Granite State. DeSantis has support in the single digits, the polling index showed. DeSantis announced Sunday that he was dropping out of the race.
Trump easily won the Iowa caucuses last week, beating DeSantis by nearly 30 points while Haley came in third, close behind the Florida governor.
“New Hampshire can prove that the independent-minded voters of the Granite State will not be told the election is a done deal,” the op-ed wrote. “New Hampshire can prove that nothing is inevitable and send Nikki Haley home to South Carolina with a head of steam and nothing weighing her down as she sets her sights on defeating the ‘inevitable,’ but very vulnerable, Democratic nominee,” the piece continued, making a likely reference to Biden.
The Union Leader, based in Manchester, N.H., also did not endorse Trump in the previous two election cycles. In the 2016 Republican primary, it endorsed former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, but later retracted the endorsement after Christie dropped out. In the 2016 general election, the paper endorsed libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, choosing a non-Republican nominee for the first time in 100 years.
The Union Leader endorsed Biden’s White House run in 2020, calling Trump at the time “100 percent wrong for America.”

9NUBCKAO63_D7NSGZ2GGLAYMV1,"Week 3 in the Kentucky legislature: A budget proposal, the 'Safer Kentucky Act' and more","Rebecca Grapevine and Lucas Aulbach, Louisville Courier Journal","January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/week-3-kentucky-legislature-budget-110043706.html,"FRANKFORT – As snow fell across the commonwealth, legislators at the Kentucky Capitol turned up the heat, debating controversial measures in committees and introducing a key budget proposal that could shape state spending for the next two years.
The Safer Kentucky Act, a key Republican priority, advanced after a contentious hearing, and House Republicans introduced a budget proposal to counter Gov. Andy Beshear's. Meanwhile, senators seemed a bit more focused on fun as the upper chamber unanimously passed a bill expanding the number of riverboats where people can drink.
Here's a breakdown of what happened during the third week of the session. The House and Senate are scheduled to gavel back in at 4 p.m., Monday.
House Bill 5, the ""Safer Kentucky Act,"" is moving forward to the House floor. But not without significant debate.
The bill, put forward last week by Rep. Jared Bauman and other Louisville-area Republicans, advanced through the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday following a contentious two-hour debate.
Families of Kentuckians killed in violent crimes in recent years spoke in favor of some of the 72-page bill's provisions, including relatives of Madelynn Troutt (a teen killed in a car crash involving someone released from jail due to a payment by a charitable bail organization), Jake Luxemburger (a 10-year-old killed in a car crash involving a man fleeing police) and Caleb Conley (a Kentucky State Police trooper shot and killed in a traffic stop).
Opponents, though, argued the bill would put more people behind bars without focusing on rehabilitative services while also criminalizing poverty (the legislation would allow local governments to ban outdoor camping outside of designated locations) and placing unfair restrictions on charitable bail funds.
HB 5, with 52 co-sponsors, passed through committee on a 13-5 vote. Its next stop is the House floor.
""One-time"" was the refrain around the Capitol as House Republicans described the budget proposal they introduced last week. House GOP leaders aim to spend about $1.7 billion of the state's estimated $3.7 billion rainy day fund — but that spending will be for one-time only expenses.
Their approach differs from Beshear's proposal rolled out in December, which foregoes dipping into the rainy day fund and instead focuses on amping up education and other spending over the long term. Beshear was critical of the GOP's plan Thursday, calling it regressive and missing key funding components.
GOP House leaders split their budget into two bills: House Bill 1 focused on, aptly enough, one-time expenditures from the rainy day fund, and House Bill 6, focused on recurring expenditures.
How the House budget proposal differs from Beshear's plan:
Beshear's budget includes increases in the state's per-pupil education funding formula as well as across-the-board 11% pay raises for school employees through an increase in SEEK funding. The GOP version also includes increases in per-pupil education funding but foregoes across-the-board raises in favor of encouraging school districts to use additional funds for raises at the levels they see fit.
The GOP version increases state funding of school transportation to 90% of costs by fiscal year 2026, the second year of the budget, while Beshear's proposal would fully fund school transportation.
Beshear's budget proposal includes $172 million each year for universal pre-K, while the GOP version foregoes universal pre-K, which House leaders have said is a non-starter.
The Senate unanimously passed a measure from Sen. Gex Williams, R-Verona, to increase the number of riverboats that can serve bourbon. If Senate Bill 62 passes, riverboats with as few as 40 passengers, rather than boats with 100 passengers, will be eligible to sell alcohol.
The Kentucky locks reopening has allowed smaller boats on the Kentucky River, Williams said, and if the bill passes, riverboats can sell alcohol on bourbon tours up and down the river. Specifically, Frankfort's The Bourbon Belle, owned by Kentucky River Tours, will be able to sell alcohol on board during its river cruises, many of which ferry travelers to local distilleries.
The lack of affordable housing — and what state and local governments can do about it — is shaping up to be a hot topic in this year's General Assembly.
Republican-controlled committees in both chambers approved bills last week that will limit local governments’ ability to prohibit discrimination against low-income renters relying on Section 8 housing vouchers. Louisville and Lexington leaders pushed back, saying local lawmakers know their communities best and should be able to pass anti-discrimination ordinances unhindered by the state legislature.
Louisville's lack of affordable housing is well documented and plans to improve the city's stock is a key goal of Mayor Craig Greenberg. He's pledged to build 15,000 units during his first term in office.
A separate provision in the Safer Kentucky Act that outlaws camping in public spaces has drawn the ire of advocates for the state's unhoused population.
Here's a look at some other notable measures and moments this week in Frankfort:
House and Senate members spoke out Thursday after viewing footage Wednesday provided by the Israeli government of the attacks by Hamas in Israel last October, with both chambers putting forward resolutions expressing support for Israel.
Rep. Kim Moser, R-Taylor Mill, filed House Bill 10 Wednesday in an effort to cut into the state's maternal death rate. The legislation, with 17 co-sponsors, would expand insurance access for pregnant people and allow more access to services offered by Kentucky's Health Access Nurturing Development.
Rep. Nick Wilson, R-Williamsburg, blamed an ""inadvertent change"" made during the filing process after he put forward a bill that would have struck first cousins from relationships barred by the state's incest law. He later refiled the legislation as House Bill 289, which would add language to Kentucky's law barring sexual intercourse between family members to include “sexual contact.""
And finally, Sen. Whitney Westerfield, R-Crofton, said it's a good thing he isn't planning to run for another term, as he'll be pretty busy in the near future. He and his wife Amanda are expecting triplets this summer.

The evaluation came from data from the U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey collected from Oct. 18-30, 2023 and presented in a new report on health and wellness website HelpAdvisor.com.
The only states with higher weekly grocery costs are California ($297.72), Nevada ($294.76) and Mississippi (290.64). Alaska and Hawaii were excluded from the report.
The state with the lowest food cost is Wisconsin, which comes in at $221.46 a week.
When it comes to ranking individual cities for grocery prices, the data crunched and presented on HealthAdvisor.com lists Seattle as the sixth most-expensive city in the country, ahead of New York City, Dallas and Chicago.
Weekly expenses in Seattle come in at $289.23 a week, or more than $1156.92 for the average household every month.
The cities with higher average weekly grocery costs are Miami ($327.89), Houston ($302.65), Riverside, California, ($300.50), San Francisco ($298.44) and Los Angeles ($295.33).
The U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey looked at data measuring the average amount of money households spent on food prepared and eaten at home. It did not take into account meals eaten at restaurants or other venues.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says the Consumer Price Index for food prepared and eaten at home was up 1.7% in November, in a year-over-year average.
Ferguson takes on grocery chain merger over potential higher prices
This recent analysis comes on the heels of Washington filing a lawsuit to block the proposed merger of the two largest grocery store chains operating in the state: Kroger, which owns Fred Meyer and QFC, and Albertsons, which owns Safeway.
“If Kroger and Albertson’s merge, they will – simply put – dwarf the competition,” Ferguson said. “Shoppers will have fewer choices and less competition, and that results in higher prices.”
And Ferguson said the companies, themselves, know it.
“During our investigation, we reviewed hundreds of thousands of records. We uncovered internal chats – between corporate executives and other employees,” Ferguson said. “After rumors of a proposed merger surfaced, a vice president of marketing with Albertsons wrote – and I’m quoting – ‘You’re basically creating a monopoly in grocery, with the merger.’ It makes no sense.”
In a statement to KIRO Newsradio, the companies said, “We are disappointed in Attorney General Ferguson’s premature decision to file a lawsuit while the merger is still under regulatory review.”

Fox News Digital obtained photos and videos of pets in Colony Ridge, Texas, from animal advocacy group Boots on the Ground that were reportedly abandoned by migrants, including some that appear severely neglected or injured.
Scores of animals have been abandoned at the U.S.-Mexico border as illegal immigrants flood into the country in record-breaking numbers.
Immigrants who are apprehended by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are often forced to leave their animals behind because animals are not allowed inside federal processing centers.
AS HISTORIC NUMBERS OF MIGRANTS CROSS THE BORDER, THEIR DOGS ARE OFTEN ABANDONED ALONG THE WAY
Chase Scott, spokesperson for Big Dog Ranch Rescue (BDRR), a dog rescue group, told Fox News Digital the ""number of abandoned dogs along the border is in the thousands,"" and the Biden administration is ""doing virtually nothing"" to address the situation.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
Scott said BDRR ""can lead this effort"" but needs ""donations or help from FEMA to address this issue."" He called on FEMA to provide ""a dozen spay [and] neuter vans to stop the overpopulation"" and ""transport and medical supplies,"" so they ""can heal and rescue the dogs and get them into loving homes.""
""We need to act now before this becomes completely out of control,"" Scott said.
""Colony Ridge is a huge migrant shanty town with starving dogs trying to eat chickens and livestock, so the migrants shoot them and attack them with machetes. The local communities are heartbroken and overwhelmed. They are turning into a Third World [country] with roaming packs of dogs.""
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT POPULATION SOARS UNDER BIDEN: GOVERNMENT DATA
Scott said BDRR is heading to McAllen, Texas, this weekend on a rescue mission for the abandoned dogs after having gone to the Texas border city of Eagle Pass last year.
Scott said the dogs in McAllen, Texas, ""are being fed"" by the National Guard, ""but with the cold fronts, the situation is dire,"" and BDRR will be rescuing the dogs there first.
After McAllen, Scott said BDRR will head ""into the primary area with the largest issue,"" adding ""ground zero is Colony Ridge.""
BORDER NUMBERS FOR DECEMBER BREAK MONTHLY RECORD, AS BIDEN TALKS AMNESTY WITH MEXICO
Bianca Gracia, president of Latinos for America and Latinos for Trump, told Fox News Digital what ""is happening at Colony Ridge with the abandoned and abused dogs who are voiceless is a tragedy caused by elected officials' open border policies.
""We are asking America to step up and help us rescue these voiceless furry friends from a life they did not choose.""
Animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) told Fox News Digital it has received reports that it's not just dogs and cats being abandoned. Animals like guinea pigs have been left too.
WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES
Catie Cryar, spokesperson for PETA, told Fox News Digital that abandonment ""is awful — no matter which side of the border it occurs on.""
""PETA has received reports that animals as varied as guinea pigs and small dogs have actually been brought in by people entering the U.S. from Mexico, but we know that the border processing facilities don’t allow it,"" Cryar said.
""We have also heard of an informal network of people on the Mexican side who are looking after animals who have been denied entry,"" she added. ""Many animals are a cherished, integral part of the family and, just like children, should not be separated from that family.
""PETA is calling on the Biden administration to allow animals into the U.S. if they are vaccinated or can be quarantined.""
The White House referred Fox News Digital to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) when asked for comment.
""CBP follows CDC guidance with respect to the admission of dogs and other pets into the country,"" a spokesperson for CBP said. ""If the pet’s owner is an inadmissible noncitizen in DHS custody and an animal’s owner does not transfer possession to family or friends, U.S. Customs and Border Protection works with local officials from animal health services, such as a local humane shelter, to see if there can be placement for the animal while its owner remains in custody.""
Fox News Digital also reached out to FEMA and the National Guard for comment.
MAYORKAS TELLS BORDER PATROL AGENTS THAT ‘ABOVE 85%’ OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS RELEASED INTO US: SOURCES
The shocking photos and footage obtained by Fox News Digital show the harsh reality faced by the dogs and other animals abandoned by their owners as they enter the U.S. at the southern border.
The footage depicts abandoned animals in the migrant community of Colony Ridge, Texas, a collection of subdivisions outside Houston.
Colony Ridge is a controversial locale, having made headlines after being sued by the federal government for allegedly hooking Latino buyers up with seller-financed mortgages to set them up for defaulting on their loans.
Colony Ridge CEO John Harris told Fox News Digital in a statement that ""Colony Ridge has done everything conceivably possible to rid the problem of stray dogs and cats and animals throughout the area.
""We have donated consistently $20,000 a year to help solve the problem to the local group that kind of helps spay and neuter and house these animals,"" Harris said. ""So, we are doing our part without question.""
Harris noted that Liberty County, which houses Colony Ridge, is a ""rural area"" that doesn't have an animal control group, and that if one goes ""anywhere in a rural county in America, and especially here in Texas, you're going to have stray dogs and cats and other animals.""
""That's just a fact,"" Harris said. ""But we are doing everything we possibly can to curb the problem.""
Harris also said ""90%"" of Colony Ridge residents ""come from Harris County,"" 40 miles to the south.
""The animal issue is not an immigrant issue. It's an issue that stems from bad owners who need to understand how to care for their animals,"" Harris said. ""We are providing that education and going above and beyond what is needed to help resolve this problem.""
The Community Property Owners Association of Colony Ridge told Fox News Digital that This is Houston, a nonprofit organization, has been assisting in the new development since 2021 due to Liberty County not having animal control services.

It marked the 80th anniversary of the code-breaking computer's invention.
The device's existence was largely kept secret until the early 2000s.
British intelligence has released ""rare and never-before-seen images"" of the World War II era ""Colossus"" code-breaking computer.
GCHQ, the UK's intelligence, security and cyber agency, said in a press release that the new photos were released to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the computer's invention.
Colossus, which was shrouded in secrecy until the early 2000s, was designed by engineer Tommy Flowers to decipher coded messages between some of Nazi Germany's most senior officers.
It played a key role in helping the Allies win World War II. It provided critical intelligence that German leader Adolf Hitler had been duped into believing the Allies would invade occupied France via Pas-de-Calais rather than Normandy, where they would carry out the famous and pivotal D-Day landings on June 6, 1944 — codenamed Operation Overlord.
The huge machine was at the cutting edge of technology for its time, contained 2,500 valves, and was a precursor to the computer age.
GCHQ said the images shed ""new light on the genesis and workings of Colossus, which was over two meters tall and considered by many to be the first-ever digital computer.""
Soldiers from the Women's Royal Naval Service (Wrens) were recruited to the large teams of operators and technicians needed to run and maintain Colossus' spy operation against Nazi Germany.
Bill Marshall, a former GCHQ engineer who worked on the computer during the 1960s, said he had to sign the ""Official Secrets Act"" and ""was told very little"" about the machine he was working on, per GCHQ.
""What the machine was actually doing was not for me to know,"" he added. ""It wasn't until much later that I found out that the several of the systems and detailed design information were supposedly destroyed at the end of WWII.""
Andrew Herbert, a computer scientist who has served as the chairman of Microsoft Research and is the chairman of trustees at The National Museum of Computing, said: ""Colossus was perhaps the most important of the wartime code breaking machines because it enabled the Allies to read strategic messages passing between the main German headquarters across Europe.""
Housed at the UK's code-breaking center, Bletchley Park, 10 Colossus computers helped 550 people decrypt ""63 million characters of high-grade German communications"" by the end of World War II, according to The National Museum of Computing.

North Korea and Russia have pledged to establish a “new multi-polarised international order” and are undertaking “deep strategic communication” on various regional and international issues, the North Korean foreign ministry said on Sunday, according to state media KCNA.
It comes as Mr Putin and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov met visiting North Korean foreign minister Choe Son Hui, in the first North Korean high-profile visit after leader Kim Jong-un travelled to the far-eastern Russian port of Vladivostok in September last year.
Mr Kim had invited the Russian leader to Pyongyang who accepted the invitation to visit at an unconfirmed date.
“President Putin expressed deep thanks once again for the invitation of President of the State Affairs Kim Jong Un to visit Pyongyang at a convenient time and expressed his willingness to visit the DPRK at an early date,” KCNA reported referring to North Korea with its official name.
The prospect of a Russia-North Korea alliance in arms and military cooperation has raised concerns among Western countries and their allies in the Korean peninsula. This is particularly worrisome as Moscow enters its second year of the war in Ukraine and expresses a keen interest in fostering relations with adversaries of the United States.
The White House has raised concerns that North Korea could be providing Russia with munitions to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine, possibly in exchange for badly needed economic aid and military assistance to help upgrade Mr Kim’s forces.
Both Pyongyang and Russia have denied accusations by Washington and Seoul about North Korean arms transfers to Russia amid their deepening ties.
Analysts say the rekindling of the partnership that has roots going back to the Soviet era may tip the scales, altering the dynamics in two volatile regions, both in Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula.
Russia expressed “deep thanks” to North Korea for its “full support” to its war in Ukraine, the foreign ministry of North Korea said.
It said Ms Choe and the Russian officials expressed ""serious concern"" over the United States’ expanding military cooperation with its Asian allies that they blamed for worsening tensions in the region and threatening North Korea’s sovereignty and security interests.
Tensions in the Korean peninsula have reached tipping points after North Korea said it will no longer pursue reconciliation with South Korea and is moving to formally describe it as a “primary foe” in its constitution.
Pyongyang states that this action is in retaliation to US interference in the region, with the armies of Washington, South Korea, and Japan intensifying their joint military exercises — exercises that Mr Kim portrays as invasion rehearsals.
South Korea on Thursday urged the UN Security Council ""to break the silence"" over North Korea’s escalating missile tests and threats.
It was after North Korea on Friday said it conducted a test of a purported nuclear-capable underwater attack drone in response to a combined naval exercise by the US, South Korea and Japan last week.
North Korea described Mr Putin as the “closest friend” and said their friendly relations have “entered the course of a new comprehensive development”."

Symonenko fled to Russia in March 2022 and became a deputy head of an international alliance of communist parties, according to Ukrainian investigators.
He appeared at a pro-Russian forum in Minsk in 2022 and supported the invasion of Ukraine.
He's charged with using the media to call for overthrowing the government and justifying Russia's aggression.  He faces up to five years for the first charge and from five to eight years for the second.
The Communist Party of Ukraine was founded in 1993, claiming to be the rightful successor to the communist party of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.
Ukraine's security services have reported that the party supported Russian proxies in Donbas after the 2014 invasion. It was banned in 2015.
Symonenko tried to run in the 2019 presidential election but was prohibited.

The Duchess, 64, underwent a single mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery last summer.
But when she had further reconstruction surgery last month, medics removed several moles, one of which was found to be a malignant melanoma.
Despite the double health shock, the “resilient” Duchess is said to be in good spirits and determined to plough on.
She is undergoing further tests to check that the cancer was caught in the early stages and has not spread to other parts of her body.
The news comes as the King prepares to undergo treatment for an enlarged prostate and the Princess of Wales recovers from major abdominal surgery.
A spokesman for the Duchess said: “Following her diagnosis with an early form of breast cancer this summer, Sarah, Duchess of York has now been diagnosed with malignant melanoma.
“Her dermatologist asked that several moles were removed and analysed at the same time as the Duchess was undergoing reconstructive surgery following her mastectomy, and one of these has been identified as cancerous.”
The Duchess received the diagnosis just days after Christmas. Since then, she has spent time recuperating at the MAYRLIFE clinic, a medical spa in Austria.
The clinic, which is nestled on the shores of Lake Altaussee, offers various health programmes and attracts wealthy A-list stars.
Major Ronald Ferguson, the Duchess’s father, had been diagnosed with skin cancer just months before his death in March 2003 and had planned to undergo chemotherapy. He also had prostate cancer although he died of a heart attack.
Four years earlier, in October 1999, Carolyn Cotterell, the Duchess’s closest friend and flatmate, died from skin cancer.
Princess Beatrice, the Duchess’s eldest daughter, is patron of the British Skin Foundation and has worked with skin cancer patients.
The Duchess’s spokesman said: “She is undergoing further investigations to ensure that this has been caught in the early stages. Clearly, another diagnosis so soon after treatment for breast cancer has been distressing but the Duchess remains in good spirits.
“The Duchess wants to thank the entire medical team which has supported her, particularly her dermatologist whose vigilance ensured the illness was detected when it was.
“She believes her experience underlines the importance of checking the size, shape, colour and texture and emergence of new moles that can be a sign of melanoma.”
The spokesman told The Telegraph that the Duchess was “very resilient” and determined to carry on, despite everything that had been thrown at her.
She is being treated by Dr Andrew Furness, consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, and Catherine Borysiewicz, consultant dermatologist at the King Edward VII Hospital in London.
The cancer news comes as the Duchess has enjoyed something of a public comeback in recent months, having won plaudits for speaking openly about her breast cancer diagnosis and encouraging other women to get themselves checked.
The Duchess admitted during an appearance on ITV’s Loose Women in November that she still sometimes woke in a panic during the night believing that she might develop cancer somewhere else.
“I’m getting over that but it’s only been a few months since I’ve had the operation, so I’m just beginning to sit up straight,” she said of her original surgery.
“Your mind goes into, ‘Oh my god I’ve got to have a mastectomy, and you look it up and it’s all so terrifying and this is what’s going to happen and then I’m not going to see my grandchildren grow up.’ That’s what goes through your head … it’s that feeling of demise.”
That month, she is also said to have impressed ITV bosses after co-hosting and guest-editing an episode of This Morning.
The Duchess appeared on the daytime show as an agony aunt, telling viewers she was there to answer any questions about “love and relationships and having hard times”.
Speaking to two callers during the segment, she suggested they reignite their spark by spicing things up in the bedroom with some “lovely saucy underwear”.
Last month, she was permitted to join the Royal family on the traditional Christmas Day walk to church at Sandringham.
It was the first time in more than 30 years that the Duchess had been allowed to join the high-profile outing and was considered a clear sign that she had been welcomed back into the fold by the King.
The monarch, 75, is said to appreciate the loyalty she has shown to her ex-husband, the Duke of York, with whom she still lives at Royal Lodge in Windsor.
She continued to champion him throughout the fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal as he faced a civil lawsuit from victim Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexual assault, and was stripped of his honorary military titles and patronages.

PORTSMOUTH/KEENE, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Tom Mita, a 45-year-old non-profit worker in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, is not registered with a political party. That makes him the perfect target for Nikki Haley, who needs independent voters for a chance to prevail in this pivotal primary state.
Mita is thinking about voting for Haley, he told a pair of door knockers who were canvassing on behalf of the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations outside his suburban home on Saturday, but he isn't completely sold on her candidacy.
He wants Haley, who has so far spared Donald Trump from some lines of attack, to go after him more aggressively. He considers Trump a threat to democracy for trying to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden. If Haley pulls her punches, he may vote in the Democratic primary instead.
""It's really about stopping Trump,"" said Mita, standing outside his door, hands stuffed in his pockets, on a 19-degree Fahrenheit day. ""Best scenario would be if she comes out and says that she won't endorse Trump for president.""
Voters like Mita, who are unaffiliated with either major party, will be crucial to Haley if she is to pull off an upset and beat Trump in New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Tuesday. She likely needs a victory here or a very close second to survive, following her third place finish behind Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis last week in Iowa.
Voters untied to either party are the state's most important bloc. They account for 343,000 of all registered voters, eclipsing both the number of registered Republicans and Democrats, according to data from the secretary of state.
Unaffiliated voters are allowed to participate in the primary of their choice. About 30% are effectively Republicans, 35% align with Democrats, and 35% are truly independent, estimates Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center and a political science professor.
Given Trump's stranglehold on the Republican base, Haley will need to secure the support of 70% to 75% of unaffiliated voters in order to win the state, he said.
""That's never happened before,"" said Smith. ""That's a really tall order.""
While Haley has closed the gap with Trump in New Hampshire, the former president retains a comfortable lead of 14 percentage points according to an average of polls compiled by website FiveThirtyEight.
SUPER PAC BOOST
Trump has in recent days sought to portray Haley's gains in state polls as improper because they reflect growing support among independents. He has also falsely claimed registered Democrats would be allowed to vote in the Republican primary.
Chris Ager, chair of the state Republican party, noted that Trump himself benefited from the backing of independent voters when he won New Hampshire in 2016, reviving his campaign after a loss in Iowa. Ager thinks Trump will win but gives Haley an outside shot.
""Nikki Haley could win New Hampshire,"" he told a media roundtable hosted by Bloomberg in Manchester on Saturday. ""The undecideds can break very late.""
Haley's bid could be boosted by a super PAC formed to persuade right-leaning independents in New Hampshire to support her. The group, Independents Moving the Needle, has been airing a number of supportive ads on local television.
One of the committee's founders, Jonathan Bush, told Reuters the group is trying to appeal to “rational Americans” who want to move on from Trump and Biden.
“We’re excited at the traction,” said Bush, a cousin of former President George W. Bush who helped launch the effort after seeing Haley speak in person. Bush e-mailed his contact list and set up an online fundraiser for Haley that netted more than $1 million, he said.
Independent voters, Bush said, are the fastest way for Haley to “get in the ring” against Trump and make it a two-candidate race.
At campaign stops on Saturday, Haley spoke of her appeal to a wide swath of voters, referring to a new Marist College poll that showed her beating Biden in New Hampshire by three percentage points while Trump would lose by seven points.
Angelika Fretzen, 54, an independent voter from Peterborough, New Hampshire, was sold on the pitch. ""She’s a great alternative to Donald Trump,"" Fretzen said after attending a rally on Saturday. “I think it’s time for a new generation, and I think a lot of independents of my age group feel that way.""
Carrying out the door knocking was Americans for Prosperity Action, a super PAC mainly funded by billionaire Charles Koch. Of the eight interactions with voters observed by Reuters on Saturday, the canvassers engaged with four Republicans, three independents and one person who did not disclose his affiliation.
Mita and another independent said they were leaning toward Haley while the third plans to vote for Trump. The Republicans were split between Trump and Haley, two to two.
One Republican, Chris Jay, gave a reason for considering Haley that meshed with Mita's rationale. Jay, a 57-year-old lumber broker, said he wanted Haley to go after Trump more.
""I think Trump needs to be put in his place a little bit,"" he said.

A3ESKT26KG_BV4QVXUFWUAGV01,Rare Roman armour inspired by gladiators reconstructed from tiny fragments,Michael Searles,"January 22, 2024 at 4:41 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/rare-roman-armour-inspired-gladiators-194142208.html,"An “incredibly rare” piece of a Roman soldier’s armour inspired by gladiators has been reconstructed from more than a hundred ancient fragments.
The 1,800-year-old shattered brass arm guard is just the third - and most intact - to be found from the entire Roman Empire.
Similar guards were commonly employed as arm protection by gladiators fighting in the amphitheatre, but experts say it was “unusual” for it to be used by the Roman military.
The ancient piece of armour is set to be displayed in its entirety for the first time when it goes on loan from the National Museums Scotland to the British Museum in London next month for a Roman army exhibition.
The arm guard dates back to between 100 to 200 AD, and while they were typically made of iron, the brass on this particular piece denoted the senior ranking of the soldier to whom it belonged.
Richard Abdy, curator of Roman and Iron Age coins at the British Museum, said: “The flexible arm guard is an iconic piece of equipment for Roman gladiators, so it is unusual to see it as a sword arm protection for Roman soldiers too.
“Its display, posed with classic legionary segmental body armour, is stunning. The latter is also possibly derived from gladiator kit and we even think that the training regime for the amphitheatre originally inspired combat training of the professionalising Roman army.
“The image of Roman soldiers and gladiators appropriately unite in one artefact - two characteristic strands of the dark side of Roman civilisation that have long fascinated public imagination.”
Experts spent weeks reconstructing the arm guard from fragments discovered at the Trimontium fort site near Melrose, Scottish Borders, in 1906.
The pieces have been in National Museums Scotland’s collection for more than a century, with the upper section previously on display for 25 years.
Now that all fragments have been reassembled, the arm guard will go on permanent display in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh after the British Museum exhibition ends.
Fraser Hunter, principal curator of prehistoric and roman archaeology at National Museums Scotland, said: “This is an incredibly rare object, and it’s great that this exhibition gave us the opportunity to rebuild it.
“The transformation is striking. Now that it’s been reconstructed, you can picture the legionary who once wore it.
“It was both protection and status symbol - brass was expensive and would have gleamed like gold on his sword arm.
“It offers a vivid connection to this important period when Scotland sat on the Roman Empire’s northern frontier.”
Bethan Bryan, assistant artefact conservator at National Museums Scotland, said: “It’s been a privilege to work on such an extraordinary piece of Scotland’s history.
“Approaching this ancient jigsaw puzzle required careful consideration and it was important to make sure we could display the piece in a manner as near as possible to how it would have looked 2,000 years ago.

A7LQ1HTQ69_D0BX6E6IOMJ8Q5R,Is British American Tobacco's 9.5% Dividend Yield Too Good to Be True?,"Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool","January 22, 2024 at 2:23 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/british-american-tobaccos-9-5-172300014.html,"There was a time when tobacco stocks were among the best investments you could own. For example, Altria (NYSE: MO), which for much of its history also owned what is now Philip Morris (NYSE: PM), was the best-performing stock on the market over a nearly 50-year period, according to Wharton professor Jeremy Siegel.
However, over the last decade, that's changed. Shares of tobacco companies like those two and British American Tobacco (NYSE: BTI) have succumbed to pressure from declining cigarette sales, an inability to find a breakthrough next-gen product, and slowing growth in revenue and profits. As you can see from the chart below, British American Tobacco stock is down sharply over the last decade, and Philip Morris and Altria have only posted modest gains. Even on a total return basis, all three have underperformed the S&P 500.
Despite those headwinds, which have also included massive write-downs for things like Altria's minority stake in JUUL and British American Tobacco's U.S. cigarette portfolio, income investors still like the tobacco sector for its generous dividend yields.
At its current share price, British American Tobacco offers investors a dividend yield of 9.5%, making it one of the highest-yielding stocks on the market. However, a high yield alone doesn't make a stock a buy, as the chart above helps illustrate. So is British American Tobacco a dividend stock worth buying, or is it a yield trap?
British American Tobacco stunned investors last month by taking a $31 billion impairment charge, which the company said was consistent with its vision to ""Build a Smokeless World"" and the nature of the headwinds in the U.S. cigarette industry. It said the write-off was primarily related to its acquired U.S. combustibles brands, which include Camel, Newport, and other brands that came to BAT in its $49 billion purchase of Reynolds American in 2017.
That update also reflects the reality that demand for cigarettes continues to decline. British American Tobacco hasn't delivered its full 2023 results yet, but the company said it expects to report 3% to 5% constant-currency revenue growth for the year, with tobacco sales volume falling  by 3%. It also guided for adjusted earnings-per-share growth in the mid-single-digit percentages on a constant-currency basis.
Like peers Altria and Philip Morris, BAT has struggled to find a winner in the next-gen heated products category, and the company lost market share last year. Revenue from new categories was up 29% in the first half of the year to 1.66 billion pounds. Cigarette volume, meanwhile, was down 4.7% on an organic basis in the first half, and constant-currency revenue in the category was up 0.2% to 10.8 billion pounds.
Looking ahead, the company is guiding for low-single-digit revenue and adjusted operating profit growth in 2024, and is targeting an improvement to 3% to 5% revenue growth and mid-single-digit percentage adjusted operating profit growth.
British American Tobacco's dividend is well funded, as the company had a dividend payout ratio of 76% based on cash flow and just 61% on an accounting basis. That should reassure investors that BAT can continue to fund its dividend even in a slow-growth environment.
However, in a best-case scenario based on the company's guidance, British American Tobacco's business is only expected to generate modest top- and bottom-line growth, and the risk for further challenges is clear, as there are still significant regulatory risks in new products and the potential for taxes and other restrictions to increase on cigarettes.
The stock is cheap and the dividend looks safe, but the upside potential of the stock is limited. Dividend investors looking solely for yield might want to consider BAT, but there are still a lot of risks in the tobacco sector that can lead to share price depreciation in the coming years.

AGEGGFBPT8_Q3KRELSOVVZT32B,"Census change complicates racial profiling data in Massachusetts, presents opportunity","Jeannette Hinkle, Cape Cod Times","January 21, 2024 at 7:03 PM·12 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/census-change-complicates-racial-profiling-100301569.html,"Hispanic is widely considered an ethnicity, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin. It’s a multi-faceted and even shifting identity that can be held by Americans of all races.
But the Massachusetts traffic citation — the source of statewide data used in court proceedings and public policy research on racial profiling — doesn’t have a field for officers to mark both a driver’s race and ethnicity. For more than two decades, the citation has only included a field labeled “race.”
Hispanic is one of six categories from which officers are instructed to choose when filling in the driver race field on the ticket. One police training manual defines “Hispanic” similarly to the Census.
Still, several experts and advocates said that even if Hispanic is one of the options given to officers filling out tickets, the lack of a separate ethnicity field contributes to the erasure of Hispanic drivers from traffic stop data by increasing the likelihood officers will mark them as white — whether by mistake, because of inadequate training or intentionally.
Hispanic and Latino people make up 13.1% of the Massachusetts population, according to the 2020 U.S. Census, second only to people who identify as white.
A USA TODAY Network investigation by the Cape Cod Times, Worcester Telegram & Gazette and USA TODAY revealed that in nearly 60 communities, police marked the majority of men with Hispanic surnames as white on citations issued from 2014 to 2020. Experts said the practice skews studies of racial disparities in traffic enforcement by inflating the number of white drivers cited and deflating the number of drivers of color cited.
The data is used by researchers probing inequities in traffic enforcement, the most common police-public interaction, and is also the foundation of legal defenses involving allegations of racial profiling. The state public safety agency, led by Secretary Terrence Reidy, has yet to respond to the USA TODAY Network findings.
District Court Chief Justice Stacey Fortes, citing the need for traffic stop data in profiling probes and the state’s new data equity law, said in a statement to the Times that the court is now considering the addition of a separate ethnicity box to the state’s citation.
But the categories used by Massachusetts police to collect driver demographics since 2000 might soon become close to the national standard.
The U.S. Census Bureau has proposed asking about Americans' race and ethnicity in one question, rather than in two separate questions, a change that would result in the nation adopting similar categories to those now used by Massachusetts police when ticketing drivers.
""Number one, they (Massachusetts) should collect all stops. Number two, every department in the state should do an annual audit, not for nefarious reasons, but just to know what the hell is going on.”
Alexis Piquero former director of the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics
The looming federal change, which isn’t final but seems likely, according to government officials, might make it more complicated for the state to address the miscoding of Hispanic drivers in state traffic stop data. It's a problem that experts including Alexis Piquero, a former director of the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, said underlines the need to audit traffic stop data collected by police.
Piquero, now a University of Miami professor of sociology and criminology, said the Census proposal presents a unique occasion for Massachusetts to overhaul its traffic stop data collection systems, most of which don’t track driver demographics on stops that end with verbal warnings — an estimated 40% of all stops — let alone other data points experts say give necessary context to traffic stops.
“Number one, they should collect all stops,” Piquero said of Massachusetts police departments. “Number two, every department in the state should do an annual audit, not for nefarious reasons, but just to know what the hell is going on.”
Proposed changes to the U.S. Census would essentially add “Hispanic or Latino” as a possible answer to a question about respondents’ race or ethnicity, rather than race alone, bringing Census categories closer in line with those already used by Massachusetts officers ticketing drivers.
The proposal, which is subject to change, would ask Census respondents to identify as White, Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Middle Eastern or North African, or Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.
""The proposal for a combined race/ethnicity question encourages the self-identification of race and/or ethnicity, and multiple responses are permitted,"" Rachel Marks, Chief of Racial Statistics for the Census Bureau, said in a statement.
Under the new Census proposal, a respondent could check Black and Hispanic, for example.
That’s not an option for Massachusetts police filling out traffic tickets, who must pick one category denoting their perception of the driver's race.
The proposed Census changes are intended to better reflect the way the country’s Hispanic and Latino residents see themselves today, Piquero said.
The federal Office of Management and Budget, which sets the categories used by the Census, cited research showing that a combined race and ethnicity question results in more complete and accurate data, and many researchers agree a single question about race and ethnicity will lead to a better count of the nation’s Latino residents.
When asked about Hispanic origin separately from race, a significant number of 2020 Census respondents who identified as Hispanic or Latino chose “some other race” on the race question or left it blank because they did not see themselves as white or Black, for example.
People who identify as Hispanic or Latino made up 19% of the U.S. population in 2020, according to the Pew Research Center.
Lorna Rivera, Director of the University of Massachusetts Boston’s Mauricio Gastón Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy, is concerned the wording on the combined question will lead to an undercount of the nation’s Afro-Latinos, who she noted experience some of the state’s worst disparities in areas including health and housing.
“Having the question be ‘what is your race or ethnicity’ is going to undercount the number of Black Latinos, and this is a very serious problem,” Rivera said.
Both Rivera and Piquero think the Census should ultimately move toward questions that better allow people to describe themselves, but for now, the federal government seems likely to adopt the changes as proposed.
The Office of Management and Budget is on track to finalize the plan by summer 2024, according to an agency official. New race and ethnicity categories would likely begin appearing on government forms soon after, though full implementation could take years.
Piquero, echoing other researchers who said consistency among datasets is key, recommended the state traffic citation mirror the Census, and change when it changes.
Adding an ethnicity box to denote a driver’s Hispanic or Latino origin now, and then changing the citation again to match the new Census categories once implemented would show “how percentages change or don’t change,” he said.
“In my mind, this is a really good opportunity for Massachusetts to do something very quick, very simple,” Piquero said. “Because even if the Census makes a decision, it may be still years down the road before everything gets changed on the forms.”
A change in demographic categories available to officers filling out traffic tickets would also be a good occasion for Massachusetts to provide statewide officer training that could reduce the number of Hispanic drivers being wrongly coded as white, he said.
“If they're miscoding for non-nefarious reasons, then this is a way to correct it,” said Piquero, who co-chaired a federal interagency working group that authored a 2023 report about transparency in law enforcement data commissioned by President Joe Biden while leading the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
The USA TODAY Network analysis of traffic citations showed the practice has a significant effect on traffic stop data, especially in some communities.
In Holyoke, for example, police citation data indicates about a quarter of stops of the city’s adult male residents from 2014 to 2020 were of Hispanic men. If those with Hispanic last names had been identified as Hispanic instead of white, their share of stops would have risen threefold to nearly three-quarters.
Piquero said that training should be followed by regular audits of officers’ traffic stop data. That type of supervision would help police chiefs identify officers who miscode drivers as well as officers who stop drivers of color disproportionately, and allow supervisors to provide timely supplementary guidance, training, or, if necessary, discipline.
Few Massachusetts departments would be able to conduct those types of audits because the demographics of the estimated 40% of drivers given verbal warnings remain largely unavailable even for internal review. Driver data is collected only for stops that end with a citation or written warning.
Though police chief association leaders lobbied state lawmakers against requiring municipal police to track all stops in 2019, some chiefs say collecting a complete dataset is necessary.
Both the Massachusetts State Police and Boston Police Department already track data on all stops because of internal policies, as all police in neighboring Connecticut have for more than a decade.
“It doesn't matter what the outcome is, whether it's a verbal warning or a citation or written warning or a criminal complaint, the data should be collected,” Northampton Police Chief Jody Kasper said during a phone interview last year.
Without tracking stops ending in verbal warnings, any analysis of traffic stop disparities is seriously flawed, experts including Piquero said.
“The fact that (verbal warnings) are not even coded is just mind-boggling in this day and age,” he said. “How you would not want to have an understanding of what police do is mind-boggling.”
The U.S. Department of Justice, which is investigating the Worcester Police Department, criticized the Minneapolis Police Department for failing to supervise officers’ traffic stops in its June 2023 investigatory report, which found “stark racial disparities (in traffic stops) that violate the law” and “yielded few gains to public safety.”
“Without clear, complete, consistent documentation, supervisors cannot meaningfully review police actions,” federal investigators wrote in their report on Minneapolis. “The result is that supervisors cannot identify and address trends or problematic conduct, such as unlawful or improper stops, racial profiling, harassment, theft, and sexual misconduct.”
Authority to require the collection of data on all traffic stops lies with the state Legislature, but the authority to alter the Massachusetts traffic citation lies jointly with the Registrar of Motor Vehicles and the Administrative Justice of the District Court, according to state spokespeople from multiple agencies.
Motor Vehicles Registrar Colleen Ogilvie declined to comment on whether she would support adding a driver ethnicity field to the state’s traffic citation, according to Registry of Motor Vehicles spokesperson Jacquelyn Goddard.
“While current law does not require the collection of data concerning ethnicity on the Massachusetts Uniform Citation … the Chief Justice of the District Court appreciates the importance of this information to help inform possible patterns of racial and ethnic disparities during traffic stops.”
Jennifer Donahue, Trial Court Spokesperson
But District Court Chief Justice Stacey Fortes, acknowledging the need for demographic traffic stop data to probe racial inequities on the road, is considering the addition, Trial Court spokesperson Jennifer Donahue told the Times in a statement.
“While current law does not require the collection of data concerning ethnicity on the Massachusetts Uniform Citation … the Chief Justice of the District Court appreciates the importance of this information to help inform possible patterns of racial and ethnic disparities during traffic stops,” Donahue said in the statement.
“The Chief Justice of the District Court is committed to beginning a dialogue with the leadership of the Registry of Motor Vehicles and other Executive Branch agencies, which are subject to the recent provisions of the Data Equity legislation, about how to best use the Massachusetts Uniform Citation to collect ethnicity data,” the statement concluded.
In August, Gov. Maura Healey signed “data equity” legislation that requires state agencies already collecting figures on race or ethnicity to capture much more detailed demographic data than is currently recorded.
But it is unclear how the law would apply to the state’s traffic citation, which is filled out by officers instructed to use their best judgment when recording driver demographics on the ticket — a method of data collection maligned by many Massachusetts police chiefs who would prefer drivers self-identify to the RMV when getting or renewing a license.
In response to the data equity law, the Executive Office for Administration and Finance is now reviewing existing data collection processes across state government, including data collection processes related to traffic tickets, according to an agency spokesperson.
The next step in implementing Massachusetts' data equity legislation is for the agency to issue draft regulations by Jan. 1, 2025. The agency will then hold a public hearing to gather comments from the public. The law is scheduled to go into effect the following year, after which the Executive Office for Administration and Finance will hold annual public hearings on implementation.
Piquero said the looming Census change offers a chance for Massachusetts to overhaul its stop data collection and analysis practices — not only to bring the state in line with others including Connecticut, but to become a national leader in a foundational area of policing where most advances are made at the state level.
USA TODAY Network’s reporting about the erasure of Hispanic drivers from traffic stop data illuminated a problem that Piquero said he has no doubt is happening nationwide.
But without federal guidelines about traffic stop data collection — guidelines Piquero thinks are overdue — ferreting out and fixing traffic stop data problems such as widespread miscoding of Hispanic drivers as white will remain a state-by-state project.
Given the current condition of its traffic stop data, Massachusetts has work to do, Piquero said.
“Massachusetts leads in so many really good ways,” he said. “Here's a chance where you can now be once again leading an effort where people will say, ‘Look at what Massachusetts is doing. Let's take a plane, let's go to Logan, let's find out what they're doing and let's take it back to our community because we trust what they're doing and we trust why they are doing it.’”

Speaking at a meeting in Brussels, the chair of Nato's military committee of national chiefs, Admiral Rob Bauer, said: ""We have to realise it’s not a given that we are in peace. And that’s why we [Nato forces] are preparing for a conflict with Russia.
“But the discussion is much wider. It is also the industrial base and also the people that have to understand they play a role... the realisation that not everything is plannable and not everything is going to be hunky dory in the next 20 years.”
He added: “We need to be readier across the whole spectrum. You have to have a system in place to find more people if it comes to war, whether it does or not. Then you talk mobilisation, reservists or conscription.
“You need to be able to fall back on an industrial base that is able to produce weapons and ammunition fast enough to be able to continue a conflict if you are in it.”
Germany’s defence minister Boris Pistorius told news outlet Der Tagesspiegel that the country's experts were looking at a 5-8 year period in which they could see the possibility of Russia attacking a Nato country.
""We hear threats from the Kremlin almost every day... so we have to take into account that Vladimir Putin might even attack a Nato country one day,"" Pistorius said, stressing that the threat was not expected now. ""Our experts expect a period of five to eight years in which this could be possible.""
His comments came as the Russia-Ukraine conflict marked its 695th day, and as Russian forces said they had taken control of the Vesele settlement in the eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine.
""Not only has their counteroffensive failed, but the initiative is entirely in the hands of the Russian Armed Forces,"" Russia's president Vladimir Putin said this week, despite Ukraine ramping up air strikes in the region.
""If this continues, Ukraine's statehood could be dealt an irreparable, very serious blow,""

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a political and military alliance of 30 countries.
Nato was set up in 1949 to protect members against the Soviet Union, with 12 nations initially signing up to the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington DC.
These countries were the US, Canada, the UK, Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Portugal.
Nato's stated political objectives are to ""promote democratic values"", ""enable members to consult and cooperate on defence and security-related issues"", and to ""prevent conflict"".
The organisation says it ""is committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes"", but if diplomacy fails it will use its military power ""to undertake crisis-management operations"".
The collective defence clause of Nato's founding treaty – Article 5 of the Washington Treaty – is a provision that means an attack against one member is considered an attack against all of them.
This is a fundamental part of Nato and why it says it is a defensive alliance.
Nato says military operations are carried out under Article 5 or a United Nations mandate, alone or in co-operation with other countries and international organisations.
Last month, in direct response to the conflict in Ukraine, Nato said: ""Allies are committed to deploying robust and combat-ready forces on the Alliance’s eastern flank. The eight battlegroups demonstrate the strength of the transatlantic bond and the Alliance’s solidarity, determination and ability to respond to any aggression.
""Many activities undertaken by Allies nationally also contribute to increased Allied activity in the eastern part of the Alliance. In response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Allies have sent additional ships, planes and troops to NATO territory in eastern Europe, further reinforcing the Alliance’s deterrence and defence posture.""
Crucially, Ukraine is not a member of Nato and therefore the alliance is not treaty-bound to defend it, while US president Joe Biden has said he will not send American or allied troops to fight Russia in Ukraine.
However, Kyiv is a close partner and was promised eventual membership of the alliance. The 30-member Nato works with Ukraine to modernise its armed forces.
Sweden has applied to join Nato along with Finland – which shares a border with Russia – with Nato hoping the expansion will boost its eastern Europe defences. However, alliance members Hungary and Turkey are currently blocking the accession.
1949: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK, the US.
1952: Greece, Turkey
1955: Germany
1982: Spain
1999: Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland
2004: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia
2009: Albania, Croatia
2017: Montenegro
2020: North Macedonia
Since the Cold War ended, Nato has expanded eastwards by taking in 14 new countries, including the states of the former Warsaw Pact and the three Baltic nations that were once in the Soviet Union.
Russia sees this as a threatening encroachment towards its borders and continues to say it was a betrayal of Western promises at the start of the 1990s – something Nato denies.
Ukraine is not a Nato member but has a promise dating from 2008 that it will eventually get to join.
Since toppling a pro-Russian president in 2014, Ukraine has become closer politically to the West, staged joint military exercises with Nato and taken delivery of weapons.
Kyiv and Washington saw these as legitimate moves to bolster Ukraine's defence after Russia seized the Crimea region in 2014 and provided backing to separatists in eastern Ukraine.
Putin believes Ukraine's growing ties with the alliance could make it a launchpad for Nato missiles targeted at Russia.
He said Russia needs to lay down ""red lines"" to prevent that.
Last month, Putin said Nato troops on the ground fighting the Russian army would be ""a very dangerous step that could lead to a global catastrophe"".
In a recent address, Putin also said: ""In Nato documents, our country is officially and directly declared the main threat to North Atlantic security. And Ukraine will serve as a forward springboard for the strike.""
But his demands that Ukraine drop its long-term goal of joining the Atlantic military alliance have been repeatedly rebuffed by Kyiv and Nato states."

The funding being released is from the supplemental budget the Legislature passed and Gov. Maura Healey signed in December. It included $15 million for municipalities that had damage or emergency response expenses from extreme weather over the last year, Healy’s administration said. The remaining $5 million will be distributed in the spring to help cities and towns hurt by September storms, it said.
The administration will also boost funding for the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness program and the additional $7 million will help communities plan, design and build nature-based solutions to inland flooding, Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll said.
“We’re proud to be delivering the first round of these funds to 37 cities and towns to relieve some of the burden they’ve been facing, and we’re also going to increase support for municipalities in their efforts to reduce the risk of flooding in their communities through the MVP,” Healy said in a statement.

AHZ98WFJJ5_IG6DB3ZUHO1TCYP,Upscale voters are embracing Nikki Haley in New Hampshire. Can they carry her to a primary win?,"Karissa Waddick and Francesca Chambers, USA TODAY","Updated January 22, 2024 at 7:10 AM·8 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/upscale-voters-embracing-nikki-haley-101028172.html,"BRETTON WOODS, N.H. – Rudy Glocker strolled into the Omni Mount Washington Resort on a mission to see former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, as snow blanketed the luxury hotel’s red tin roof.
Glocker, a 54-year-old entrepreneur, had seen Haley once before at an event over the summer near his company, Burgeon Outdoor’s, a Lincoln, New Hampshire store that specializes in outdoor apparel. Her foreign policy expertise and leadership style impressed Glocker, a former Goldman Sachs executive.
Ahead of the Granite State’s first-in-the-nation primary, he wanted to be sure he was backing the right candidate.
“She has a vision,” said Glocker, a Harvard Business School graduate, who said the former South Carolina governor's approach evoked the problem-solving ability of a business owner. “She expresses a desire to understand the issue, understand what drives it and to take action that will hopefully help solve the problem.”
Glocker is a part of a key demographic that Haley is counting on to overtake former President Donald Trump in Tuesday's primary: highly educated and fiscally conservative professionals.
The departure on Sunday of Ron DeSantis left Haley and Trump locked in a two-person race in which the former president is the heavy favorite.
Though Trump has held a commanding lead in the GOP field throughout the primary campaign, Haley began seeing momentum for her candidacy in New Hampshire last fall as she crisscrossed the state answering voters' questions at town halls.
Upscale voters are an important part of her coalition there. New Hampshire is a relatively wealthy state that boasts proximity to the Boston area along with scenic mountains and coastal areas. Its median household income of roughly $90,000 is more than $10,000 higher than the national average, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
A USA TODAY/Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll in early January found that New Hampshire residents earning more than $100,000 a year were more likely than other voters to support Haley. She performs her best among highly educated voters who earned either college or advanced degrees.
While combative rhetoric is a staple of Trump's speeches and also featured heavily in DeSantis's campaign appearances, Haley has a more measured style. The former South Carolina governor and former UN ambassador puts a strong emphasis on explaining her policy proposals, from the economy to the border to foreign policy. That appears to be part of her appeal to college educated voters.
“Much of primary politics is identity politics. When all the candidates have an R or a D next to their name, voters' choices often rely on intangible factors,” Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said.
For Gail Myers, 69, that was exactly the case after meeting Haley at the Bretton Woods event Tuesday.
""I felt like I was her long-lost sister,"" said Myers, who formerly owned her own drapery business.
Myers and her husband, the former president and CEO of A.I.M. Mutual Insurance Companies, drove an hour and half from their home in Wakefield in the lakes region for the event. A friend who served in the South Carolina State Senate told them Haley was ""the real deal."" Haley's brief 20- minute address in the hotel's ballroom had Myers hooked.
""Everything that she had to say was right on target. That was all my feelings,"" Myers said. ""I'm definitely voting for her.""
Haley has courted supporters like Myers by hosting campaign stops at 4-star hotels in coastal and mountain vacation havens frequented by the wealthy, such as the Omni Mount Washington Resort in Bretton Woods, Portsmouth’s Wentworth by the Sea and the Inn on Main near Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro.
In wintertime, travelers from New York and Massachusetts flock to resorts like Bretton Woods to ski down the White Mountains renowned peaks and cozy up by the fire in the lodges. During the summer, they line the streets of quaint downtowns near the seacoast, bumping shoulders with locals as they wait for dinner reservations at chic restaurants.
New Hampshire also has rural voters of more modest means and blue-collar voters. Working class voters are a base of support for Trump both in New Hampshire and across the country. The USA TODAY/Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll found the former president performing well among those with a high school degree or some college.
If Haley is to do well against Trump, she'll need to overperform in the white-collar communities where she has spent much of her time, such as Portsmouth and Hollis.
""More than anywhere else in New Hampshire on Tuesday, I'm paying attention to those bedroom communities – suburban communities in the southern tier of the state that make up the outer ring of metropolitan Boston,"" Scala said.
Haley has an important supporter in New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu.
Sununu is one of the most popular governors in the country and is himself among the state’s elite. His family owns and operates a ski resort in northern New Hampshire that he helped run before he was elected in 2017. As governor, Sununu has championed a platform of fiscal responsibility and traditional conservative policies, such as business tax cuts.
His electoral success rate in the state is nearly unmatched – he won four races before announcing last year that he would not seek another term. Sununu chalks his victories up to retail politics and says that’s how Haley can pull ahead in the state, too.
“National strategies don't work in New Hampshire. You've got to be really genuine. You've got to connect with folks,” he said in an interview. “That's the fundamental rule.”
Greg Moore, state director of Americans for Prosperity, an arm of the conservative Koch-backed group that endorsed Haley last November, noted that Sununu has a higher favorability than Trump with wealthy suburban voters.
For instance, in the 2020 general presidential election, Trump lost the once-Republican stronghold of Bedford, a suburb of Manchester, to President Joe Biden. In the same election, Sununu carried the town by more than 70%.
“If Nikki Haley is smart, she's listening to him, as he sort of gives her advice as to how to position herself with those types of communities,” Moore said. “Fundamentally, I think that's an area where she can really clean up.”
Linda Wells, 65, is among the voters in the state who were turned off by Trump but is drawn to Haley's message. A former business analyst for Fidelity Investments, Wells said she is looking for a candidate who is ""cool, calm, collected, logical and future-focused.”
“I don't want Trump again. I'm tired of the drama,” the Wolfeboro resident said after attending a November town hall for Haley. Just down the road, multimillion dollar mansions, including one owned by Sen. Mitt Romney, surrounded one of the state's premiere summer destinations – Lake Winnipesaukee.
Wells, an independent voter, has donated to Haley’s campaign and is considering whether to volunteer for her on Election Day.
“I want somebody fresh and new that will spend her time and energy tackling the issues,” Wells said.
Haley's business background and popularity with donors drew attacks from other Republicans, including DeSantis and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. Both sought to paint the former UN ambassador as beholden to Wall Street.
Haley sat on the board of Boeing after leaving the Trump administration. In 2020, she stepped down over the company’s pursuit of a federal bailout during the pandemic. She’s held several other board positions and has made millions from speaking engagements, private consulting and stock market holdings since leaving office, according to her financial disclosure forms.
But in New Hampshire, voters such as Glocker say they don’t see her business ties as a liability.
Instead, they look at her professional pedigree, international background and time as a governor as a trifecta for a presidential candidate. In fact, one of the experiences Glocker said he valued most in Haley, a former accountant, was her time working as a bookkeeper for her family’s South Carolina dress store.
“When I first met her, we talked about the challenges of running a small business,” the former Goldman Sachs vice president said, recalling when Haley came into his store after her event over the summer.
The pair talked like colleagues about the metrics behind the business – sales growth, profit margins, overhead costs – and Glocker said it gave him faith both in Haley’s financial policy plans and her ability to dig into the granular and big picture as president.
“As a small business owner, one of the things is everybody at your firm looks to you for leadership and how to handle a situation,” Glocker said. “I think being honest and blunt, those types of things, is important. And I think Nikki Haley has some of those characteristics.”

Furthermore, you'd generally like to see the share price rise faster than the market. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Smartsheet Inc. (NYSE:SMAR) share price is up 64% in the last five years, that's less than the market return. Looking at the last year alone, the stock is up 8.1%.
Although Smartsheet has shed US$296m from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns.
View our latest analysis for Smartsheet
Given that Smartsheet didn't make a profit in the last twelve months, we'll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Generally speaking, companies without profits are expected to grow revenue every year, and at a good clip. That's because fast revenue growth can be easily extrapolated to forecast profits, often of considerable size.
For the last half decade, Smartsheet can boast revenue growth at a rate of 33% per year. Even measured against other revenue-focussed companies, that's a good result. While long-term shareholders have made money, the 10% per year gain over five years fall short of the market return. You could argue the market is still pretty skeptical, given the growing revenues. It could be that the stock was previously over-priced - but if you're looking for underappreciated growth stocks, these numbers indicate that there might be an opportunity here.
You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).
We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. You can see what analysts are predicting for Smartsheet in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.
Smartsheet shareholders gained a total return of 8.1% during the year. But that was short of the market average. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 10% over five years. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Smartsheet .

Ambulances rushed to the site near a Lebanese army checkpoint, according to residents.
Security sources said that two Hezbollah terrorists had been killed in a direct hit. Their ranks were not revealed, though local media reported that one of those killed was from the VIP and Leaders Protection Unit.
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia has been trading fire across Lebanon’s southern border with Israeli forces in support of Palestinian ally Hamas.
It has marked the deadliest confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah since they went to war in 2006.
Tens of thousands of people on both sides of the frontier have fled, and the fighting has raised concern of an even wider conflict.
Thank you for following our live coverage. The key developments were:
At least two people were killed and several others injured in a suspected Israeli drone strike on Sunday that targeted a car in southern Lebanon, security sources said.
The United States is taking the attack by Iran-backed militants on a base hosting US forces in Iraq over the weekend “extremely seriously,” the White House said.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister said there can be no normalisation of ties with Israel without resolving the Palestinian issue.
Hamas has said its October 7 attack on Israel was a “necessary step” against Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.
The UK said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opposition to Palestinian sovereignty is “disappointing”.
Royal Navy missiles that have been used to shoot down Houthi drones in the Red Sea will be upgraded.
Around 9,000 demonstrators marched through Brussels on Sunday calling for an end of Israel’s fierce bombardment and fighting in Gaza, in a pro-Palestinian protest that ended in the EU district.
The march came a day before EU foreign ministers will meet their Israeli, Palestinian, Egyptian, Saudi and Jordanian counterparts in a string of meetings to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza and the plight of Palestinian civilians.
Participants in the peaceful “Justice for Palestine” demonstration, whose size was estimated by Brussels police, yelled out “stop genocide”, “Israel: terrorist” and “free Gaza”.
Some of the bereaved families whose loved ones were killed in a Hamas rampage at the Nova music festival joined an Israeli Jewish nature project group on Sunday for a special tree-planting event at the site.
Around 1,000 people planted about 200 seedlings in the scorched earth of the Re’im parking lot where thousands of young people were partying in the dawn hours of Oct 7 when armed Palestinian infiltrators swept in.
According to police, 364 people were shot, bludgeoned or burned to death at the Nova festival in a stretch of tree-dotted brush near Kibbutz Reim. Another 40 people were taken hostage by Hamas back to the Gaza Strip, 5 km (2 miles) away, police said.
“I still can’t believe that we are planting a tree instead of hugging our child,” Ela Bahat, whose son Dror was killed at the festival, told Reuters.
“We buried him four days after on October 11, and this was the first day of the rest of our lives. I really hope that in any way, that from upstairs they will bring some peace to earth.”
The United States is taking the attack by Iran-backed militants on a base hosting US forces in Iraq over the weekend “extremely seriously,” the White House said Sunday.
“Multiple ballistic missiles and rockets” were fired by Iranian-backed militants at Al-Assad Airbase in western Iraq late Saturday, the US military said, leading to one Iraqi and possible American casualties.
“It was a very serious attack, using a capability of ballistic missiles that posed a genuine threat,” White House Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer said Sunday, reported by AFP.
“We are going to respond... to establish deterrence in these situations, and to hold these groups accountable that continue to attack us,” Finer added during his appearance on ABC’s This Week.
“You can be assured that we are taking this extremely seriously.”
Most of the projectiles fired at the base were intercepted by air defence systems, Finer and the Pentagon said.
Since mid-October, there have been dozens of attacks on the approximately 2,500 US troops in Iraq and the around 900 in Syria, deployed there with other coalition forces to fight jihadists of the Islamic State group.
Most incidents, including Saturday’s attack, have been claimed by “Islamic Resistance in Iraq,” a loose alliance of Iran-linked armed groups that oppose US support for Israel in the Gaza conflict.
Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister said there can be no normalisation of ties with Israel without resolving the Palestinian issue.
Asked if there could be no normal ties without a path to a credible and irreversible Palestinian state, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told CNN: “That’s the only way we’re going to get the benefit. So, yes, because we need stability and only stability will come through the resolving the Palestinian issue.”
About 1,000 people from Gaza have been treated in a French field hospital aboard a ship off the coast of Egypt, its captain told Reuters news agency, providing care for some as health infrastructure in the war-devastated enclave collapses.
The Dixmude, a French helicopter carrier, has been docked in the Egyptian port of al-Arish, 50 km (30 miles) west of the Gaza Strip, since November. The vessel is equipped with wards, operating theatres and 70 medical staff.
Nearly 120 injured people have been hospitalised on board, while hundreds more have been seen for outpatient consultations, including follow-ups on injuries and psychiatric issues, said Captain Alexandre Blonce, calling it an “unprecedented mission”.
Gazans have struggled to get medical care at home as tens of thousands have been wounded, with most of Gaza’s 36 hospitals no longer functioning, and those remaining operating at far over capacity, the World Health Organization says.
Hamas has said its October 7 attack on Israel was a “necessary step” against Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.
Publishing a 16-page report on the attacks, the group also said that “some faults happened... due to the rapid collapse of the Israeli security and military system, and the chaos caused along the border areas with Gaza”.
The document, reported by news agency AFP, was the group’s first public report released in English and Arabic justifying the attacks when they broke through Gaza’s militarised border. Their attacks resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians.
Hamas said on Sunday that the attacks were “a necessary step and a normal response to confront all Israeli conspiracies against the Palestinian people”.
The militants seized about 250 hostages during the attack. Israel says around 132 remain in Gaza, of whom at least 27 captives are believed to have been killed.
Israel’s bombardment and ground offensive have since killed at least 25,105 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Hamas also urged “the immediate halt of the Israeli aggression on Gaza, the crimes and ethnic cleansing committed against the entire Gaza population” and rejected any international and Israeli efforts to decide Gaza’s post-war future.
“We stress that the Palestinian people have the capacity to decide their future and to arrange their internal affairs,” the statement said, adding that “no party in the world” had the right to decide on their behalf.
One of those killed in the suspected drone strike in southern Lebanon was a Hezbollah terrorist from the VIP and Leaders Protection Unit, according to local media.
Five more people are understood to be injured, with four being treated in hospital.
The UK said on Sunday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opposition to Palestinian sovereignty is “disappointing”.
“I think it’s disappointing actually, to hear that from the Israeli prime minister,” said Defence Secretary Grant Shapps.
His comments came after Netanyahu doubled down on his refusal of a Palestinian state. According to a spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister, he claimed in a call with Joe Biden that Israel’s security needs left no space for a sovereign Palestinian state.
“In his conversation with President Biden, prime minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that, after Hamas is destroyed, Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty,” a statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office said.
Mr Shapps told BBC One’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg that a two-state solution was the only option.
“Palestinians deserve a sovereign state, Israel deserves to have the full ability to defend itself, its own security,” he said. “Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don’t see that there is another solution.”
Two Hezbollah fighters were killed on Sunday in a direct hit by an Israeli drone on their vehicle in southern Lebanon, security sources said.
Their ranks were not revealed following the latest Israeli strike in southern Lebanon near the border with Israel that has targeted dozens of Hezbollah fighters in the area, security sources said.
At least two people were killed and several others injured in a suspected Israeli drone strike on Sunday that targeted a car in southern Lebanon, security sources said.
Ambulances rushed to the site near a Lebanese army checkpoint, and it was not clear who was targeted in the strike, residents and security sources said.
Humza Yousaf has accused political leaders of viewing Palestinian blood as “cheap” as he criticised a lack of support for citizens in Gaza.
The Scottish First Minister has been outspoken in his calls for a ceasefire and more aid to the region amid the ongoing conflict with Israeli forces.
He has regularly shared updates on his own family’s situation, after his mother and father-in-law were trapped in Gaza while visiting family. They spent several weeks there with limited supplies before fleeing through the Rafah crossing into Egypt.
His brother Mohammed, an emergency doctor, and his elderly grandmother remain in war-torn Gaza.
Speaking on BBC One’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Yousaf was asked if he believed people placed a “different value” on the lives of Muslims and Palestinians.
He replied: “Without a shadow of a doubt. You take to anybody who is Palestinian, people in the Muslim community, they feel that the Palestinian blood is very cheap.”
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has denounced Israel for the “heartbreaking” deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and called it unacceptable to resist statehood for the Palestinian people.
“Israel’s military operations have spread mass destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as secretary-general,” Mr Guterres said at the opening of a summit of the G77+China in the Ugandan capital Kampala.
“This is heartbreaking and utterly unacceptable. The Middle East is a tinder-box, we must do all we can to prevent conflict from igniting across the region.”
Israel’s cabinet on Sunday approved a plan for frozen Palestinian tax funds to be held by a third-party country, and reserved the right to decide when the money will be transferred to the Palestinian Authority.
Under interim peace accords, Israel’s finance ministry collects tax on behalf of the Palestinians and makes monthly transfers to the Palestinian Authority, which has limited self rule in the occupied West Bank, but there have been constant wrangles over the arrangement.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cabinet decision was supported by Norway and the United States, which will be a guarantor that the framework holds.
Royal Navy missiles that have been used to shoot down Houthi drones in the Red Sea will be upgraded, the Government has said.
Britain’s Ministry of Defence says it will spend 405 million pounds to upgrade the Sea Viper Air Defence system which has been used to shoot down hostile drones over the Red Sea.
“As the situation in the Middle East worsens, it is vital that we adapt to keep the UK, our allies and partners safe,” UK Defense Minister Grant Shapps said.
Upgraded missiles will feature a new warhead, while a software update will enable the system to counter ballistic missile threats.
Yemen’s Houthis, backed by Iran, have been attacking ships in the Red Sea since November, purportedly in support of Gaza. This month, the US and British naval forces reacted by shooting down their drones and missiles.

Israeli security forces have killed 20-30 percent of Hamas’s terrorists in the Gaza Strip, US intelligence agencies estimate, reported by the Wall Street Journal.
The toll falls short of Israel’s goal of destroying the group, and the US believes the terror group still has enough munitions to continue fighting Israeli forces for a number of months.
Last week, the IDF said that more than 9,000 Hamas operatives and members of other terror groups have been killed by the IDF in the Gaza Strip since the beginning of the war, in addition to some 1,000 inside Israel on October 7.
In 2021, a senior IDF commander said that Hamas was believed to have around 30,000 fighters.
Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said he believes there is no other solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict apart from a two-state solution.
He told BBC One’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: “Palestinians deserve a sovereign state, Israel deserves to have the full ability to defend itself, its own security.
“Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don’t see that there is another solution.
“Now, you’ll get a lot of different views within the Israeli government, of course, it is a rainbow coalition.
“So we very much distinguish between the views of individuals and our overall support for Israel as a country.”
Police clashed with pro-Palestine demonstrators protesting the presence of Israeli exhibitors at an international jewellery exhibition in Vicenza on Saturday.
Hundreds of protestors had attended a planned march to oppose Israel’s inclusion at the Vicenzaoro fair, one of the biggest industry events in the gold and jewellery world.
Footage of the unrest shows protestors firing smoke bombs and flares as the two groups police rammed against each other.
Lines of officers wearing blue hard hats and carrying shields appeared to be trying to push the group back.
Sirens could also be heard as a water cannon was fired at the crowd, with demonstrators attempting to take cover from the blast behind their signs.
In other clips, police officers could be seen dragging a protester away and hitting him with a baton.

A total of 25,105 Palestinians have been killed and 62,681 have been injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza since Oct. 7, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Sunday.
Some 178 Palestinians were killed and 293 injured in the past 24 hours, the ministry added.
Israel’s military said on Sunday that its soldiers had killed 15 Palestinian gunmen during fighting in the northern Gaza Strip.
In the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, where Israel has been increasing pressure on Hamas in recent weeks, the military said that snipers, backed by air support, had “eliminated a number of terrorists.”

ALJQ7TKOCU_8S1Y3TKZC3VHL2A,Rep. Dean Phillips Refuses To Rule Out Third-Party Run,Daniel Marans,"January 22, 2024 at 6:13 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/rep-dean-phillips-refuses-rule-211352187.html,"HAMPTON, N.H. ― Speaking to voters in a restaurant in New Hampshire’s seacoast on Sunday, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, once again refused to rule out the possibility of mounting a third-party bid under the banner of the centrist group, No Labels.
Asked about the idea by a member of the audience at his meet-and-greet event, Phillips responded by citing the possibility of circumstances in which it was the surest route to prevent former President Donald Trump from winning again. “I will do anything it takes as long as the data supports it to defeat the most dangerous man in the world,” he said.
A day earlier, Phillips told voters in Nashua something similar, saying that he would consider the idea only if Trump and President Joe Biden were headed for a rematch in which Biden is “almost certain to lose.”
On Sunday though, he also said that the prospect of the Democratic National Committee using heavy-handed tactics to prevent fair competition in the presidential primary might also be a factor.
“I am a committed lifelong Democrat that believes deeply that I should pursue the process that is in place that is afforded to people who are willing to do so. And I intend to take it all the way through the convention,” he said. “But I am seeing the DNC employ practices that are not just anti-democratic, but I think despicable and dangerous and maybe even illegal. So if they are going to deny the opportunity to have a competition, I will keep going.”
Earlier on in the Q&A session, Phillips cited the case of the DNC asking the New Hampshire Democratic Party to instruct registered Democrats in the state that the primary is “meaningless.” New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella (R) responded by issuing the national party body a cease-and-desist letter, claiming that the request “constitutes an attempt to prevent or deter New Hampshire voters” from participating in the primary.
Biden will not be on the ballot in New Hampshire because the DNC, at his behest, took away the state’s first-in-the-nation status in an effort to bring more racial diversity to the early nominating contests. New Hampshire’s Republican-controlled legislature refused to move the date of its primaries though, allowing Phillips to run without Biden on the ballot. Biden’s loyalists are instead running a well-funded campaign to get Democrats to write Biden in as a show of strength against Phillips, whose central tenet for running is that polling shows Biden losing against Trump.
A recent poll showed Phillips trailing Biden 58% to 28% in the Democratic primary, though the poll did not account for the relative difficulty of remembering to write Biden in.
Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), seen here campaigning in Nashua on Saturday, is hoping to take advantage of President Joe Biden's absence from the ballot in New Hampshire.
Phillips has strong ties to No Labels as a member of the group’s moderate, bipartisan bloc in Congress, the Problem Solvers Caucus.
Democrats across the spectrum, including the moderate group Third Way, have gone on the warpath against No Labels’ threat of a third-party candidacy on the grounds that it would threaten Biden’s shot at the White House. These critics argue that a moderate compromise candidate of some kind would invariably take more votes from Biden than from Trump, who enjoys a loyal following and currently attracts little support from moderate voters.
No Labels is struggling mightily to obtain ballot access in all 50 states, but last week it asked the Department of Justice to investigate efforts by Democrats to interfere with its efforts to get on the ballot. Also last week, the group’s founding chairman, former Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), dangled the possibility of nominating former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as their presidential candidate if she falls short in her bid for the Republican nomination. Haley’s campaign immediately dismissed the idea by saying that she has “no interest in No Labels.”
Phillips defended the group by noting that it only plans to run its own presidential ticket if Biden and Trump are the two major parties’ respective presidential nominees.
“If you vote for me and we start this thing with a huge shocker, we won’t have to worry about third-party candidates, because you know what? No Labels is only going to activate if it is a Biden and Trump matchup. So vote for me, let’s end [the] conversation about it!” he said, eliciting applause from the crowd of more than 50 people who assembled to see him.

Our coverage started in 2022, when Channel 2 investigative reporter Ashli Lincoln spoke with an Atlanta woman whose home’s deed was stolen and then her house was torn down.
In November, Lincoln reported that Linda Willis’ home was targeted due to its prime real estate location in the Old Fourth Ward near the end of 2021.
Now, a South Fulton state lawmaker is introducing legislation that could make it harder for someone to steal a home in court.
To do so, Rep. Mandisha Thomas’ bill would require people to use photo identification when buying or selling real estate, including when recording or modifying deeds for a home or other property.
[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]
The proposed change comes after Channel 2 Action News reported on how Willis home was taken in Fulton County court.
While not referenced in the legislation, the challenges Linda Willis faces were tied to a lack of photo ID proving someone was related to her when allegedly stealing her home right out from under her, then having it bulldozed.
Linda Willis’ home used to be in the heart of the Old Fourth Ward on Ralph McGill Boulevard.
She previously told Channel 2 Action News that a woman named Cencera Willis had hired a crew to demolish the home in November 2021.

However, as previously reported, the problem, according to Linda Willis, is that she never put her home up for sale and had no idea who Cencera Willis was.
Lincoln obtained documents from the Fulton County Probate Court showed Cencera Willis filed to be the administrator over Linda Willis’ property in 2021, appointing her deceased mother who just so happened to have the same first and last name as Linda Willis.
Records from Fulton County Superior Court show in April 2021, Cencera conveyed the property by acquiring an administrator’s deed.
Probate court documents showed Cencera Willis’ signature on the administrator’s deed paperwork.
That’s when the Cencera had a crew come to destroy the house and clear the lot, even though Linda Willis still lived there.
Cencera didn’t have to prove being a relative of Linda Willis with her photo ID. Instead, the court took her at her word that she was the right person. Linda Willis lost her home as a result.
During previous coverage, Channel 2 Action News and Lincoln tried to get a comment from Cencera Willis but she didn’t respond.
Now, Thomas’ legislation, House Bill 888, could close the gap in the process and require photo ID to prove relation when trying to change who controls a deed, or other documents related to real property and real estate.
Under her proposal, HB 888 would allow the clerk of court to require someone presenting a deed or other document to produce a government-issued photo ID to continue the process.
Records provided for this step would be available to the clerks’ office but would not be available for public inspection or copying, due to current Georgia public records laws, the legislation says.
Additionally, should HB 888 pass, it would allow the Georgia Superior Court Clerks’ Cooperative Authority to adopt rules to implement the new requirements, meaning they could potentially set rules and other regulations for deed transactions and other real estate processes.
Currently, the legislation is still going through committee reads in the Georgia House of Representatives.

Designated as one of the fastest growing school districts in Texas, Frenship ISD now serves more than 11,500 students at 15 campuses that span across the Wolfforth and Lubbock communities, according to a news release from Frenship. The opening of the ninth elementary and second high school will help accommodate rising student enrollment and alleviate crowding the district's campuses. Currently, Frenship serves nearly 5,300 elementary students and approximately 3,300 high school students. The two new schools were approved as part of a $300 million bond package in 2020.

ARAPM9CZKV_Q1W3VTTTZYLLFI6,Texas gov transforms immigration from a border issue to a backyard one. Dems aren't happy.,"Lauren Villagran, Deborah Barfield Berry, Trevor Hughes and Terry Collins, USA TODAY","Updated January 23, 2024 at 3:13 AM·11 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/texas-gov-transforms-immigration-border-100459476.html,"DENVER – When elementary school teacher Kristine Wussow began hearing about migrants being bused to her city by Texas with no support, she rushed to collect donations.
On a recent day in January, Wussow, 50, and other volunteers handed out clothing, cookies and homemade baked ziti to Venezuelan migrants staying at a hotel-turned-shelter on the city’s east side.
Her heart broke, she said, seeing families living in tents in the cold. But she also worried whether the local generosity would dry up.
“When I reached out to my neighborhood, people poured out help. But if these folks were living in our actual neighborhood? I can see how that would be different,"" she said. ""One woman who lives here in this neighborhood, she told us her neighbors are angry. They don’t want to help.""
While Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, promote hard-line border policies in stump speeches and news conferences, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has effectively exported the border – and all the problems that come with it – to America's backyards.
Americans who once watched humanitarian crises with pity or disdain from afar now are seeing it close up.
More than half of Americans in a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll this month said they support the idea of sending troops to the southern border and ordering the mass deportation of illegal immigrants. Only 43% said they opposed both, and 4% were undecided.
Abbott's controversial migrant busing program crossed a threshold this month: Operation Lone Star has bused more than 100,000 migrants from the Texas border to Washington, New York, Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
Democratic leaders of the cities Abbott has targeted are pushing back against what they say are his “cruel” tactics. But they’re also complaining about too many immigrants arriving in their communities.
Last Sunday, Illinois Gov. JB Prizker took out a full-page ad in the Austin-American Statesman pleading for Abbott to temporarily halt the migrant busing, noting the cold weather blanketing the nation.
""This is not sustainable,"" Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said a few days earlier, noting that his city was now spending 10% of its annual budget on emergency housing and other migrant services.
""Gov. Abbott has made it clear he wants to destabilize cities, sending thousands of migrants and asylum seekers here,"" said New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who recently sued the bus companies that have been delivering migrants to his city's doorstep.
Meanwhile, the buses have kept coming.
""You can applaud Abbott for having won the narrative war,"" said Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. ""He opened these salvos and he has had the last word. But he doesn’t deserve a standing ovation. He is doing it for politics.""
Abbott contends Texas is engaging in a ""historic border security effort"" and shouldn't bear the full cost of assisting migrants, even as the state spends millions of dollars on the busing program. His press office didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.
To make his point, he has pushed the bar for hard-line tactics at the border to extremes and has made Texas the go-to state for Republicans hoping to burnish their border security credentials in an election year. Abbott recently told a conservative talk radio host that Texas is ""using every tool"" from building border barriers to enacting a state law making it a crime to cross the Texas-Mexico border illegally.
""The only thing that we're not doing is we're not shooting people who come across the border, because, of course, the Biden administration would charge us with murder,"" Abbott told the host. The three-term Republican governor later said no one should misconstrue his remarks to mean that migrants trying to cross the Rio Grande should be shot.

This month, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., held a news conference in Eagle Pass, Texas, flanked by more than 60 Republican members of Congress.
Out-of-state sheriffs have been loaning their deputies to patrol Texas border counties. The governors of at least 14 states – including those crucial to the 2024 presidential election such as Florida, Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina – have sent Texas their personnel and resources or deployed their own National Guard troops to Texas.
Federal and Texas officials are locked in a legal dispute about who has jurisdiction over border territories and how much leeway the state has to deter migrants. The federal government went to court last summer to stop the state from placing buoys in the Rio Grande, and the two have been legally sparring ever since.
In the latest disagreement, federal officials accused the state of blocking its access to a park where it had set up a staging area to search for migrants, which contributed to the deaths this month of a woman and two children who drowned while trying to cross the river.
Domingo Garcia was in Washington, D.C., for a meeting in September 2022 when he got a call that two buses chartered by Texas had left dozens of migrants near the home of Vice President Kamala Harris.
He and his staff at the League of United Latin American Citizens, the nation's oldest and largest Latino civil rights organization, rushed to the neighborhood to find more than 100 men, women and children huddled on the sidewalk, disoriented. They had no food, no money.
“It was such a cruel political act,"" said Garcia, president of the organization. At the time, Abbott said he deliberately orchestrated the drop-off to provoke a response from the administration and pledged to continue sending buses ""until President Biden and Border Czar Harris step up and do their jobs to secure the border.""
Texas border communities were then struggling to shelter thousands of Venezuelan migrants who − unlike many other migrant groups with ties to friends and family − were arriving without resources or a sponsor in the U.S.
Border nonprofits have traditionally helped move migrants to cities across the U.S. by organizing directly with churches and shelters – without creating humanitarian disasters.
But the governor’s decision early on to deliver buses to the Fox News headquarters in New York and to the Harris residence in Washington drew criticism for political grandstanding, as did his unwillingness to give a heads-up about the arrivals to the mayors of the Democrat-led cities he targeted.
In Denver, where officials say they've received 2½ times the number of migrants per capita overall than any other receiving city, the mayor projects spending 10% of the entire annual budget aiding migrants this year.
About 36,000 migrants have arrived in Denver over the past year; Abbott's Operation Lone Star transported about 15,700 of them, according to Texas data.
Juan Carlo Pioltelli, 32, arrived from El Paso, Texas, in December with his partner and their daughter and lived in an illegal encampment for a week.
“When you come here, you want the American dream,” said Pioltelli, a Peruvian migrant who said he was uncertain who paid for their 600-mile bus trip.“The guards in Texas told me that you can go to Denver and it would be good, but when we got here it was different,” he said, shivering in the below-freezing air. “All these people, all we want is to work.”
In order to work, though, the migrants must receive federal permits.
Pioltelli and his family came without work permission or the contacts other more established immigrant groups have historically relied on to get jobs.
Denver city officials earlier this month evicted about 300 migrants living in an unsanctioned tent city near downtown. But on the same day they relocated those migrants to more adequate shelter, another 300 arrived on buses from the border.
""If they arrive and are here for three months or six months or two years and can never work, we're going to need endless amounts of federal support for those individuals,"" Johnston said. And not only do they not want that, we don't want that. They just want to support themselves.""
Federal officials have been trying to speed the process of granting work authorization to migrants, who sometimes have to wait up to five years for a hearing to determine whether they can remain in the United States. Late last year, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services reported it had granted about 5,000 temporary work authorizations in about four months.
Lacking money and resources, many of the migrants have been living in illegal, unsanitary tent cities like the one Pioltelli lived in for a week.
Johnston called for the nation's 100 largest cities to develop a system to accept, process and assist migrants similar to the comprehensive federal system used for refugees from Syria and Somalia.
New York City has had the most enduring public fight with Abbott over the state's migrant busing operation.
With the densest population in the U.S. and overseeing the largest number of migrants bused by Texas, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said he’s proud that New Yorkers have done their best to provide for migrants despite receiving little support from the federal government.
But, Levine, a Democrat, said New York has placed more than 68,000 in some sort of shelter, including 20,000 Manhattan hotel rooms.
“You know the saying, ‘As New York goes, so goes the country,'” Levine said. “But we are fending for ourselves as more migrants are arriving and staying in shelters than leaving. This is going to weigh heavily on voters' minds.”
Rafael Collazo, executive director of the UnidosUS Action Fund, a Latino advocacy group, said Democrats need to counter narratives that immigrants are a cause of the nation’s economic and cultural problems.
“It only becomes a winning issue for a right-wing agenda if we allow that and their rhetoric goes unchecked,” Collazo said.
He said Democrats and advocates aren’t pushing aggressively enough to accuse Abbott of using people as political pawns.
“Some of the shenanigans are working for them in the moment as it relates to dealing with their real hardcore MAGA base,’’ Collazo said. “But it's still a very open question if it'll work for them in a general election.”
Meanwhile, Collazo said, local organizations providing support to migrants are frustrated because they don’t have enough resources.
“This is work that they’re built to do,"" he said, but they are feeling the same strain as local governments.
Collazo said it’s incumbent upon Democrats “to have the courage to be honest with the American people and say the source of your economic stress is not undocumented refugees that are seeking asylum.’’
The country's population would shrink in 2024 if it weren't for immigration, according to the Census Bureau. Economists say population growth is essential to grow the economy and shore up a labor market that has nearly 9 million reported job openings, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Many immigrants rights were established during the civil rights era, when leaders tried to establish a more fair and less racist immigration system, said U.S. Rep. Greg Casar, a Democrat from Texas. Those need to be improved now, but the country shouldn't go back to the days of scapegoating immigrants, he said.
“It's the oldest trick in the book to essentially blame our problems on the poor or the sick or those folks that are fleeing violence or those people that don't have a right to vote,’’ Casar said.
Casar said Abbott's approach, which he compared to that of George Wallace, a former Alabama governor and 1960s segregationist, could spark a backlash in an increasingly diverse Texas.
""I think by trying to play to his mostly anti-immigrant base, I think Greg Abbott will still continue to accelerate political problems for himself.’’
Two years after the dropoff ""stunt"" at the Harris residence in Washington, Garcia, from the League of United Latin American Citizens, said Abbott's tactics still stand out.
He said he hadn’t seen such ploys in his 50 years of civil rights work, particularly where a politician would “use refugees, Christians as political piñatas to be bashed and used and thrown away like what we're seeing with this group of Republican leaders.”
“You would think that somebody at their church would tell them, ‘'This is not what Jesus would do,’"" he said.
Garcia complained that both sides have fallen short on addressing the problem, saying Democrats need to establish a legalization process.
“The campaign team and the administration have kind of been asleep at the wheel as the humanitarian immigration crisis has continued to build over the course of the last year,’’ he said. “And unfortunately, the Republicans have turned a humanitarian crisis into an opportunity for fearmongering, scapegoating and creating a whole presidential campaign over the fear of the other.’’
Wussow, the Denver school teacher, said she worries the influx of migrants, and the challenges they're placing on local services, could harden the hearts of independent voters who now cannot avoid seeing the problem firsthand.
“I’m going to be optimistic and hope that people will see these are all humans with needs, and hope for the best.""

The aircraft landed safely Thursday night “after experiencing an engine malfunction soon after departure,"" a spokesperson for Atlas Air said in a statement Friday. “The crew followed all standard procedures and safely returned to MIA.""
The airplane was “shooting sparks"" as it flew overhead, said Melanie Adaros, who was out for a walk with her mother and was about to turn into her home, when she heard and saw an approaching plane.
“There’s always planes flying overhead, but they’re little planes,” she said. “But this didn’t sound like a little plane. It sounded very low, so I turned ... You always see a plane going up or going down. This one was just at a steady level and it was shooting sparks. It was very surreal.”
She recorded it with her phone, wondering ""is it falling? Is it going to explode?” she said. “It seemed to do a big, wide, swerving turn” in the direction of Miami International Airport, she said.
The Boeing 747 was on its way to Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in Puerto Rico when the crew reported an engine failure, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement Friday. Atlas Air Flight 95 then returned safely to Miami International Airport, the agency said.
Atlas will conduct an inspection to determine the cause, the spokesperson said.
Nearly 1,100 flights canceled Friday: Here's what you're owed.
Unverified videos on social media platform X showed flames shooting out of the wing of a plane near the airport while in flight.
Atlas Air hauls everything from machinery to perishable food and pharmaceuticals, and also provides charter services for passengers, according to its website. The company's parent firm, Atlas Air Worldwide, recently announced that it planned to move its headquarters from Purchase, New York, to White Plains, New York, this month.
Adaros, who lives near Miami Executive Airport about 15 miles southwest of Miami, said she shared her video with that airport, which confirmed a few minutes later that it had landed safely at Miami International.

U.S. officials have for at least a month analyzed information on the Houthis’ planning for the stepped-up attacks, including their attempts to procure additional weapons needed to launch missiles at freighters, according to a readout of the intelligence obtained by POLITICO and a U.S. official familiar with the matter.
The intelligence also indicated that the group may try to attack Western forces in the region. Yet it is not clear if the recent strikes by the U.S. in Yemen have shifted the Houthis’ planning for those types of attacks.
The developments come days after President Joe Biden acknowledged that U.S.-led strikes against the group have failed to stop attacks from the militants on commercial shipping, while also vowing to continue hitting sites in Yemen to sap the Houthis’ capabilities and break their will.
Navy SEALs intercepted one weapons shipment bound for the Houthis this month in a daring nighttime raid, seizing a small boat carrying Iranian-made cruise and ballistic missile components. The mission came at a high cost: two Navy SEALs went missing while attempting to board the boat. The military called off its search for them on Sunday.
Iran has long supported the Houthis — one of a network of proxy groups across the Middle East, along with Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah — with weapons, training and funding. Fresh weapons from Iran could replace the ones the Houthis have lost in the half-dozen rounds of U.S. and allied strikes since they began on Jan. 11.
The shipments are a sign that Tehran is playing a direct role in fueling the crisis in the Red Sea, according to the U.S. official and a DOD official. They, along with others, were granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive national security issue.
The Central Intelligence Agency declined to comment.
The Houthis have framed their attacks on international shipping as a show of support for Gaza and as a way to pressure Israel to stop its bombing campaign targeting Hamas militants.
Additional attacks by the Houthis threaten to draw the U.S. even deeper into the widening Middle East conflict — something Biden has actively tried to avoid during his time in office. Biden has said the U.S. and Iran, which has long engaged in a shadow war with Israel, do not want to directly fight each other. But more Houthi strikes, especially possible attacks on Western troops, would also bring Washington and Tehran closer to a direct conflict.
Some experts believe Iran’s weapons shipments and its broader support for the Houthis is an attempt to exploit the current regional turmoil to evict U.S. troops from the Middle East.
“In addition to escalating against America in Iraq and Syria via militia groups to put pressure on America to end Israel's war against Hamas, Iran also has a more localized logic at play,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “It is trying to create a cycle of violence that leads to the eviction of U.S. forces from the region, beginning with Iraq.”
Stopping future weapons transfers is critical for the administration as it continues to carry out strikes against the group in Yemen to degrade its ability to launch further attacks on vessels navigating the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
But intercepting Iranian weapons as they’re being shipped to Yemen is exceedingly difficult. Commando operations like the one this month are complex, involving special operators in combat boats, snipers, drones and helicopters for overwatch, as well as Navy SEALs, said a second DOD official.
“This is our specialty, really being able to operate in the maritime clandestinely, going after difficult targets with some stealth,” the second DOD official said.
For now, the Biden administration insists that it is not at war with the Houthis, despite more than a week of near daily strikes on the group’s positions in Yemen.
“We don't seek war. We don't think that we are at war. We don't want to see a regional war,” Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters on Thursday. “What we are doing with our partners is self-defense.”
The intent of the strikes — both the multinational, pre-planned strikes on Jan. 11 and the smaller-scale U.S. attacks on anti-ship missiles being prepared for launch last week — is to erode the Houthis’ will and ability to launch further attacks, U.S. officials said.
“We are taking things off the table for them,” said a second U.S. official. “The capabilities that they had on Thursday morning last week, they don’t have those anymore.”
“That’s the calculus: is this going to continue to be worth it to them?”
Iran’s support for its proxies is fueling attacks on U.S. forces and others elsewhere in the region. As of Friday, Iran-backed militia groups had attacked U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria 140 times since October, according to the Pentagon. The attacks have typically been small-scale, using a combination of drones and rockets and causing little damage to infrastructure. But on Saturday, militants in Western Iraq launched a major attack on al Asad airbase, injuring a number of U.S. personnel.
Initially after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Iran refrained from getting directly involved in the conflict. But Tehran has become bolder in recent days, launching missiles toward Iraq, Syria and Pakistan. In the latest sign that Iran is getting drawn more deeply in the conflict, Tehran accused Israel on Saturday of launching an airstrike that killed four Iranian military advisers, including the chief of intelligence in Syria for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in Damascus, Syria.
The impact of Iran’s “malign support” on the region is often underappreciated, said the first DOD official.
“It’s a persistent effort from Iran that is underestimated,” the official said.
Still, officials and experts maintain that Iran does not seek open war with the West. It’s significant that neither Iran nor Lebanese Hezbollah, a more sophisticated militant group than the Houthis also funded by Tehran, has gotten more involved in the fight in Gaza, said retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, the head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East until 2022.
Tehran’s three objectives are: preservation of the regime, destruction of Israel, and ending the U.S. presence in the region, McKenzie said.
“Based on that, they do not seek large-scale war with the United States because they know the regime would be threatened by it,” he said.
Ultimately, U.S. officials are hoping Iran will decide the Houthi attacks are no longer worth the economic cost to the region, the second U.S. official said.
“The calculation that they have to make is that they are impacting trade in their own region, commercial companies,” the official said. “Goods, services that flow to the region are being impacted by what the Houthis are doing. So at what point are countries in the region already saying enough is enough?”"
B00BVW33CX_AJ1D38FJQULUT0M,This Is The Very First Thing You Should Do When You Walk Into A Hotel Room,Am I Doing It Wrong?,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 5:37 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/very-first-thing-walk-hotel-131730873.html,"There are few things as heavenly as climbing into a warm, plush hotel bed after a long day of traveling.
However, before you order room service and dive into a “Law & Order: SVU” rerun or immediately conk out, there’s one thing you should always do. Actually, it’s the first thing you should do as soon as you walk into your room:
Check for bed bugs.
“I have two really good friends who have gotten bed bugs in New York [hotels] before,” HuffPost Senior Editor Caroline Bologna told us — Raj Punjabi and Noah Michelson, co-hosts of HuffPost’s “Am I Doing It Wrong?” podcast.
The tiny critters, which feed on human blood while we’re sleeping, are “about the size of an apple seed” and “big enough to be easily seen, but often hide in cracks in furniture, floors, or walls,” according to a NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene guide to stopping bed bugs in hotels. The insects often hitch a ride into a hotel room in a guest’s suitcase or on their clothes and then continue to thrive there by snacking on new, unsuspecting travelers.
Paris made headlines last year when scores of hotels were reportedly infested with bed bugs, but the city of light definitely isn’t the only one facing this problem. In fact, a 2017 study found that eight out of 10 hotels had dealt with the pests during the previous year.
“It doesn’t matter how nice the hotel is ― they’re not attracted to grime,” Bologna noted. Bed bugs are attracted to “warmth, blood and carbon dioxide” — all of which are amply provided by humans, so no matter how well-rated or luxurious a hotel might be, it could still be a haven for them.
If you don’t want to end up being a bed bug’s next meal — or potentially bringing them home with you in your luggage — spend your first 30 seconds in your room doing a sweep of any area where they might be lurking.
“They like upholstery — just look at the sheets,” Bologna explained. “Just peel back one of the corners of the bed, look at the seams of the mattress... just check. Check anything upholstered. Look at the headboard. Look at the chairs. If you don’t see anything, you’re probably totally fine.”
However, if you’re still worried, there are a few more steps you can take.
“People who are really cautious — like my friends who have had bed bugs — put their suitcase in the bathtub... just not on upholstery,” she said, so if there are any bed bugs in the room, they won’t get into it. “Most hotel rooms are carpeted, so just don’t have your bag on carpeting.”
You can also attempt to bed-bug proof the fabric luggage stand in the room.
“Some people travel with plastic trash bags,” Bologna said. “You put the plastic around it and then put your suitcase on it, because bed bugs don’t really hang out on plastic.”
If you do find bed bugs in the room, alert the hotel management immediately.
“If you decide you don’t want to leave the hotel but you want to switch rooms, don’t move to an adjacent room because that would be likely to have the same problem,” Bologna warned.
We also chatted about the best way to score an upgrade, the dirtiest parts of hotel rooms and hacks for cleaning them, and many more hotel secrets:

Fox News’s Bret Baier asked Trump in an interview that aired Sunday why he mocked Haley’s birth name on social media last week by repeatedly calling her “Nimbra.” Trump said that he gives nicknames to many people, suggesting that it is a useful strategy for him while he is on the campaign trail.
“I do that with a lot of people, like Hutchinson. I mean, he was polling at zero for about one year, and I called him rather than Asa, I called him Ada Hutchinson, and it just felt good to me. And with her, it’s just something that came. It’s a little bit of a takeoff on her name. You know, her name, wherever she may come from,” Trump said.
Haley, the daughter of immigrants from India, was born in South Carolina as Nimarata Nikki Randhawa. She has always gone by her middle name, “Nikki.” Last week, Trump took to Truth Social to call her “Nimbra” numerous times while on the attack against her.
“Some people say I’m very good at that, but, uh, I can’t get into too many because many of those people that I named like that are Republicans, and we don’t want to bring that up, but, uh, no, it’s just, uh, it’s a takeoff. I have fun with it. And sometimes, to tell you the truth, it’s a very effective tool,” Trump told Baier, speaking of giving people nicknames.
In response to Trump’s latest insults, Haley said the former president uses nicknames because he is “insecure.” She also added that Trump feels “threatened” by her just days before the GOP primary in New Hampshire, where Haley has been gaining on Trump in recent weeks.
Trump dismissed Haley’s comments that he was threatened by her in his interview with Baier, which aired on “Fox News Sunday” and “MediaBuzz” on Sunday.
“You know, you’re talking like, oh, gee, we’re concerned with her. I’m not concerned with her at all. I think we’re going to win very big here. We won extremely big in Iowa,” he said.
Trump has an 11 point lead over Haley in New Hampshire with about 47 percent of support, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ polling averages. Haley follows with about 36 percent of support, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails with nearly 6 percent.

Few stocks offer as long and successful of a track record as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). The company was founded in 1886 and has weathered lots of storms since then, growing into one of the biggest healthcare giants in the world.
Johnson & Johnson will report its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results on Jan. 23 and is expected to post revenue of close to $84 billion. The company is highly profitable with sustained earnings growth. J&J also sits atop a hefty cash stockpile of around $23.5 billion.
Retirees have long viewed the stock as a great source of income -- and for good reason. Johnson & Johnson is a Dividend King with 61 consecutive years of dividend increases. Its dividend yield currently stands a little under 3%.
Like all drugmakers, J&J will face patent expirations for key products from time to time. However, the company invests heavily in research and development (nearly $15.6 billion over the last 12 months) to ensure that it has new products to fuel sustained growth. This is without question the kind of stock you can comfortably buy and hold for decades.
Lowe's Companies (NYSE: LOW) stands out as another well-run company that has survived and thrived for more than a century. It started in 1921 as a small hardware store in North Carolina. Today, Lowe's ranks as the second-largest home improvement retailer.
The company hasn't reported its 2023 sales yet, but they are expected to be in the ballpark of $86 billion. Its net profit margin is a respectable 8.5%. Lowe's offers a level of financial stability that should be reassuring to retirees.
Like Johnson & Johnson, Lowe's is a Dividend King. The company has increased its dividend for 51 consecutive years. Over the last 10 years, its dividend has grown by more than 6 times, with a current yield of 2%.
Sure, Lowe's can face challenges when consumers reduce their spending. However, the long-term prospects for the home improvement industry remain strong.
You might say that Walmart (NYSE: WMT) is the baby of the group. The company was founded in Arkansas in 1962. However, this baby has grown to become the largest retailer in the world.
The low end of Walmart's guidance for full-year sales for fiscal year 2024 is $641 billion. Although the discount retailer's profit margin is low, such a high level of revenue translates to huge profits.
Walmart's dividend yield of 1.4% isn't anything to get excited about, however, you expect the dividend to grow quite a bit over time. The company joined the Dividend Kings in 2023 with its 50th consecutive year of dividend increases. Over the last five years, Walmart has grown its dividend by nearly 68%.
Shoppers will always look for low prices. Walmart's scale gives it a big competitive advantage in giving customers what they want. The company has also positioned itself to compete effectively in the e-commerce market. Like Johnson & Johnson and Lowe's, Walmart appears to be one of the safest stocks around for retirees to buy and hold.

B6574RFFZG_1R8R69Q25289GY7,Institutional investors have a lot riding on KPJ Healthcare Berhad (KLSE:KPJ) with 43% ownership,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 11:18 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-lot-riding-kpj-021821791.html,"Significantly high institutional ownership implies KPJ Healthcare Berhad's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions
53% of the business is held by the top 3 shareholders
Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company
To get a sense of who is truly in control of KPJ Healthcare Berhad (KLSE:KPJ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 43% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.
Last week’s 4.0% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. One-year return to shareholders is currently 65% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.
Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of KPJ Healthcare Berhad, beginning with the chart below.
Check out our latest analysis for KPJ Healthcare Berhad
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
KPJ Healthcare Berhad already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of KPJ Healthcare Berhad, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
Hedge funds don't have many shares in KPJ Healthcare Berhad. The company's largest shareholder is Johor Corporation, with ownership of 38%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.4% and 6.7% of the stock.
To make our study more interesting, we found that the top 3 shareholders have a majority ownership in the company, meaning that they are powerful enough to influence the decisions of the company.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own some shares in KPJ Healthcare Berhad. The insiders have a meaningful stake worth RM71m. Most would see this as a real positive. If you would like to explore the question of insider alignment, you can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
We can see that Private Companies own 38%, of the shares on issue. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for KPJ Healthcare Berhad  (of which 1 is a bit unpleasant!) you should know about.
But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

BI3BLB3RHC_S2IDU57L263CRXG,1 Top Dividend Stock That Gives Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway More Than $700 Million in Passive Income Annually,"Neil Patel, The Motley Fool","January 21, 2024 at 7:01 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-top-dividend-stock-gives-100100644.html,"Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is undoubtedly one of the most powerful, well-recognized consumer brands in the world. And this is precisely why Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate headed by Warren Buffett, has owned shares in the company since 1988.
The Oracle of Omaha certainly likes Coca-Cola's durability as a business. And that helps explain why the beverage stock currently makes up under 7% of Berkshire's equities portfolio. It's the fourth-largest holding behind Apple, Bank of America, and American Express.
Perhaps the most important reason Buffett still loves Coca-Cola is because of the huge amounts of passive income that it spits out. Let's take a closer look.
Berkshire currently owns 400 million shares of Coca-Cola. This means that on an annualized basis, Warren Buffett's company generates $736 million in dividend income from the beverage giant. That is a huge passive income stream that likely explains why Buffett isn't exiting the position.
Coca-Cola has long focused on returning capital to shareholders through these payouts, which now sit at $0.46 per share each quarter. The business has raised dividends in 61 straight years, easily making it one of the best companies in this regard.
It's not difficult to find reasons to appreciate Coca-Cola's business. For starters, this is an incredibly profitable enterprise. In the last 10 years, the company's operating margin averaged a stellar 25.9%. And through the first nine months of 2023, Coca-Cola generated $7.9 billion of free cash flow, which directly helps to fund dividend payments.
And as noted, the company has one of the strongest brands around. This helps it maintain top consumer mindshare across the world, reducing the chances of Coca-Cola ever being disrupted from the position it has in the industry.
This has created a scenario in which the company can flex its pricing power, which might be the characteristic Buffett appreciates the most. In the most recent quarter, Coca-Cola's net revenue increased by 8% year over year, driven primarily by pricing increases. This proves that consumers aren't going to switch to competing brands to save some money.
That adds to the stability of this company to continue producing healthy financial results no matter what the macroeconomic environment looks like. The fact that Coca-Cola is a mature, stable operation means there is really no chance that the dividend is ever in trouble of being eliminated. Moreover, the business is in a position to keep raising the payouts in the decades ahead.
Just because Warren Buffett, arguably the greatest investor ever, has a sizable stake in Coca-Cola doesn't automatically mean that you should too, even if the valuation is below the stock's trailing-five-year average. As of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.3.
But before rushing to buy the stock, consider Coca-Cola's growth potential. In the last 10 years, from Q3 2013 to Q3 2023, sales were flat. To be clear, this is a low-growth business, which might turn off some investors. Consequently, the valuation might be too steep, given that Coca-Cola is a very mature enterprise.
Additionally, just look at the stock's track record. In the last five years, if we include dividends, Coca-Cola has returned 50% to shareholders. By simply buying an S&P 500 index fund, you would have achieved a 102% gain during the same time frame. I don't think there's any reason to believe this kind of underperformance of the benchmark won't be the case going forward.
While Coca-Cola gives Buffett a huge passive income stream, I don't think it's a smart stock to buy right now for long-term investors.

BKIMXM8RHC_EIV6KCYFXSMSF6X,"OPINION: The NC insurance rate system is different, but it works",Mike Causey,"January 21, 2024 at 7:04 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/opinion-nc-insurance-rate-system-100449612.html,"There’s been a lot of talk lately about North Carolina’s insurance rates and how they’re set, especially since the insurance companies have asked for an average 42.2 percent increase in homeowners’ insurance rates.
North Carolina is unique in how it sets insurance rates for the most common types of consumer insurance, including homeowners’ and automobile insurance policies. The General Assembly, decades ago, chose not to have individual companies file with the Department of Insurance their own rates for these common types of insurance.
Instead, lawmakers opted to set up the N.C. Rate Bureau, which is not a part of the Department of Insurance, to represent the interests of all insurance companies writing such common types of policies in the state, with the Rate Bureau collectively filing proposed rates based on information from its members. The Rate Bureau’s filings are then subject to the Commissioner’s review.
Some have advocated for change in the Rate Bureau system, suggesting that making such a change could result in lower insurance premiums for North Carolinians. For example, a majority of states permit homeowners and automobile insurers to file new rates with the insurance regulators and then begin charging those new rates immediately, without the regulators’ prior approval.
More: Sticker shock: NC's insurance companies want to raise rates for coastal homeowners by 99%
I’m always looking for ways to make things better, to help North Carolina consumers get value for their insurance premium dollar. I just want to make sure any modifications to the way insurance rates are set accomplishes at least these two things:
1. Provides a fair premium for North Carolina consumers.
2. Provides a robust insurance market so North Carolinians can have choices of insurance products.
I believe that our current Rate Bureau system achieves these goals and provides better protection for consumers than those states where insurers can simply file and use their new rates without prior approval. As set out in our state law, once the Department of Insurance receives the filing from the Rate Bureau, the process of reviewing the request and making an eventual decision on the filing begins.
The Department sends out a news release statewide announcing the Rate Bureau’s filing and informing residents how they can comment on the proposal. This allows consumers to email comments or send them through the Postal Service. In the case of homeowners’ rate requests, there is also an in-person public hearing which, in recent years, has included a Webex option for consumers to participate virtually.
Within 50 days of the filing, the Commissioner must decide to either allow the Rate Bureau’s proposed increases to take effect, or to reject them and set a hearing date on proposed rates. Thus far, I have rejected the Rate Bureau’s homeowners’ insurance rate increase filing every time.
In the meantime, my team of actuaries, lawyers, accountants and other insurance experts pore over thousands of pages of data provided by the Rate Bureau to see what increases may be justified and what increases are not justified.
Once we get a clear understanding of the data, we can then enter negotiations with the Rate Bureau and work to settle on a rate that is significantly lower than the proposed increase. However, if no negotiation is possible, I will proceed with the scheduled hearing, where the department’s experts and attorneys argue before a hearing officer for rates lower than those the Rate Bureau has requested.
While I like to avoid protracted legal proceedings if I can, I won’t hesitate to hold a hearing if that’s necessary to make sure consumers get a fair price.
Mike Causey is North Carolina Commissioner of Insurance.

BLJ5XZ814V_ZWVBQJIB0C8H7XX,Here's Why We Think Sim Leisure Group (Catalist:URR) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 9:58 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-sim-leisure-005816560.html,"It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.
Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Sim Leisure Group (Catalist:URR). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.
Check out our latest analysis for Sim Leisure Group
In business, profits are a key measure of success; and share prices tend to reflect earnings per share (EPS) performance. Which is why EPS growth is looked upon so favourably. It's an outstanding feat for Sim Leisure Group to have grown EPS from RM0.022 to RM0.14 in just one year. When you see earnings grow that quickly, it often means good things ahead for the company. But the key is discerning whether something profound has changed, or if this is a just a one-off boost.
Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. On the one hand, Sim Leisure Group's EBIT margins fell over the last year, but on the other hand, revenue grew. So it seems the future may hold further growth, especially if EBIT margins can remain steady.
In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.
Sim Leisure Group isn't a huge company, given its market capitalisation of S$88m. That makes it extra important to check on its balance sheet strength.
Many consider high insider ownership to be a strong sign of alignment between the leaders of a company and the ordinary shareholders. So as you can imagine, the fact that Sim Leisure Group insiders own a significant number of shares certainly is appealing. In fact, they own 59% of the company, so they will share in the same delights and challenges experienced by the ordinary shareholders. This should be seen as a good thing, as it means insiders have a personal interest in delivering the best outcomes for shareholders. In terms of absolute value, insiders have RM52m invested in the business, at the current share price. That should be more than enough to keep them focussed on creating shareholder value!
Sim Leisure Group's earnings per share growth have been climbing higher at an appreciable rate. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. At times fast EPS growth is a sign the business has reached an inflection point, so there's a potential opportunity to be had here. Based on the sum of its parts, we definitely think its worth watching Sim Leisure Group very closely. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted  2 warning signs for Sim Leisure Group  you should know about.
Although Sim Leisure Group certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with insider buying, then check out this handpicked selection of Singaporean companies that not only boast of strong growth but have also seen recent insider buying..

BM94PJLKKG_5VI7PTRHS67NGF9,Salem doesn't have a Burgerville. Why is that?,"Capi Lynn, Salem Statesman Journal","January 21, 2024 at 9:03 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/salem-doesnt-burgerville-why-120343669.html,"This is part of an on-going series answering ""Why is that?"" questions about Salem and the Mid-Valley.
The question: Why doesn’t Salem have a Burgerville? We have the answer. But first, a little history.
The background: Burgerville is a family-owned fast-food chain in Oregon and southwest Washington.
The late George Propstra was the founder after taking over his father's creamery business in 1956. The butter and egg business had evolved into an ice cream company, then expanded to offering cheese sandwiches at a restaurant.
The first Burgerville opened in 1961 in Vancouver, Washington. It featured hamburgers garnished with a secret sauce, fries and beverages, with walk-up service only.
The secret sauce reportedly was whipped up the night before the first restaurant opened, after Propstra and a friend decided the hamburgers were a bit dry. As the story goes, they threw together a few ingredients, and the secret sauce was born.
The regional burger chain steadily grew to more than three-dozen locations — all within a 90-mile radius of its Vancouver headquarters — while banking on serving fresh food made with local ingredients.
Like some other chains, it developed a cult-like following, not necessarily because of its burgers.
The Burgerville faithful still eulogize its shakes, rosemary fries and halibut fish and chips. The restaurant continues to capitalize on local flavors and produce, such as shakes made from Willamette Valley berries and onion rings made with Walla Walla sweet onions.
Some of its menu items are available only in season, adding to its allure.
People who move away from the Pacific Northwest often complain how much they miss Burgerville, and it is one of their first stops when they return for a visit. The company once used that for an advertising campaign, with Propstra reading letters from actual customers.
As iconic as Burgerville is in Oregon and Washington, it was and still is unfamiliar to most of the country. A small venue at Portland International Airport since 2014 may have helped spread the word.
The company has often turned its limited market into a positive, from its “inconveniently located” campaign to its billboards on the edge of Burgerville territory warning drivers they would be passing the last Burgerville for more than 24,000 miles.
Innovative advertising has been a staple of the chain. One of its best-known ads in the earlier days showed Propstra whacking a frozen hamburger patty against a semi-truck, scoffing at national food chains for importing frozen meat from out of state.
Burgerville is proud to have served locally raised Pacific Northwest beef since Day 1.
One advertisement that even the most loyal of followers may never have seen was for its breakfast line, illustrating the need to eat breakfast by showing President Ronald Reagan dozing off. The company pulled it after the negative backlash.
The Burgerville territory today covers 39 locations, spanning north to Centralia, Washington, south to Corvallis, east to The Dalles, and west to Monmouth.
Salem once had a Burgerville and did for 14 years.
The restaurant was at 1717 Hawthorne Ave. NE, on the northwest corner of Hawthorne and Market Street NE before the widening of Interstate 5 at that interchange.
That area looks a lot different today, so it is difficult to pinpoint its exact location. The company built a $100,000 building, according to city permits published in the Statesman Journal, in the vicinity of where the former Newport Bay restaurant was and where Bag o’ Crab is now.
The Salem Burgerville opened Dec. 6, 1977, immediately endearing itself to the community. The following spring, it sponsored a Parrish Little League team, which it did every year.
The restaurant became a go-to spot for locals and a fun stop for visiting families on their way to or from the Oregon State Fair. Children loved the train inside, where they could sit and eat their burgers and fries.
Location, though, would ultimately become its downfall.
The Salem Burgerville was a casualty of the I-5 widening project — from four lanes to six — in the early 1990s.
Officials armed with the state’s right-of-way mandate swept through the Market interchange area and swallowed about 40 commercial properties. Denny’s and Trachsel Buick were among other businesses forced to close or relocate.
Burgerville was in the middle of expansion plans in 1990, hoping to double in size within the next five years. It had 33 locations at the time.
The company president told the Statesman Journal for a business profile published May 27, 1990, that officials wanted to build more Burgervilles in Salem, although there were no immediate plans.
The article included how officials also wanted to remodel the Hawthorne restaurant into the new Burgerville prototype but had delayed the project while waiting to hear if the outlet would be closed by planned expansion of the Market Street interchange.
In less than two years, it had its answer. The Salem Burgerville closed in late January 1992.
Residents have been hankering for it ever since.
A 2011 online survey about downtown prompted this response from a Statesman Journal reader: “Why doesn’t the city put the money and effort into getting a Burgerville into Salem instead of wasting it on their fantasies of airlines in Salem? …”
The absence of Burgerville has long been a sore subject among many, with lengthy comment threads showing up every couple of years on Reddit and on the Facebook page, “You Know You’re From Salem, Oregon When …”
There is even a “Bring Burgerville Back to Salem!” petition on the website ipetitions.com. Comments show it dates to at least 2014. Only 84 people have signed it, with the most recent posted on Sept. 26, 2023.
Rumors about Burgerville’s decision not to rebuild or open in another location in the state capital have varied over the years. Several versions include chain management having a falling out with the city and vowing never to open in Salem again.
The city would not have been involved in the eminent domain process. The Oregon Department of Transportation would have been, and its right-of-way acquisition files were not readily available for this report.
Current company officials told the Statesman Journal there is no truth to Burgerville vowing to never return to Salem.
Some speculation has festered since the newspaper’s 2015 coverage announcing Burgerville would be opening a location in Corvallis at a former Wendy’s location. A Burgerville official at that time provided this explanation about leaving Salem:
""Market Street was widened and they condemned us and chased us out of there. What they actually did was stage construction equipment on the former Burgerville site. When it came back together they wouldn't sell that property back to us. That restaurant never did real well. It was just OK. So we weren't in a big hurry to replace it.""
Company officials today say the location was not struggling nor surpassing sales expectations.
Salem-area residents have two Burgerville options within a short driving distance, Albany and Monmouth. The Albany location opened in around 1973 and Monmouth in around 1984.
Burgerville pursued a location at Keizer Station at least twice, once early in the development and again later. It is not clear why those potential plans never panned out.
But there is good news for Burgerville fans. The company is again exploring local options.
There has been chatter for more than a year about Burgerville being interested in the former Sonic Drive-In locations, one on Lancaster Drive SE and one on River Road N in Keizer.
Burgerville officials would not confirm or deny, but they did say the company has missed being in Salem, is looking forward to returning, and is pursuing many locations in and around Salem.
An expansion announcement is expected soon, as early as next week.

BPK45WD92Q_L0RN1ZJZYX7N5YM,We're Not Worried About Altius Renewable Royalties' (TSE:ARR) Cash Burn,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 11:34 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/were-not-worried-altius-renewable-143448429.html,"There's no doubt that money can be made by owning shares of unprofitable businesses. For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. Having said that, unprofitable companies are risky because they could potentially burn through all their cash and become distressed.
Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Altius Renewable Royalties (TSE:ARR) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. In this article, we define cash burn as its annual (negative) free cash flow, which is the amount of money a company spends each year to fund its growth. We'll start by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves in order to calculate its cash runway.
View our latest analysis for Altius Renewable Royalties
A cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. In September 2023, Altius Renewable Royalties had US$38m in cash, and was debt-free. Importantly, its cash burn was US$1.4m over the trailing twelve months. That means it had a cash runway of very many years as of September 2023. Importantly, though, analysts think that Altius Renewable Royalties will reach cashflow breakeven before then. In that case, it may never reach the end of its cash runway. The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years.
Altius Renewable Royalties didn't record any revenue over the last year, indicating that it's an early stage company still developing its business. So while we can't look to sales to understand growth, we can look at how the cash burn is changing to understand how expenditure is trending over time. Even though it doesn't get us excited, the 32% reduction in cash burn year on year does suggest the company can continue operating for quite some time. While the past is always worth studying, it is the future that matters most of all. For that reason, it makes a lot of sense to take a look at our analyst forecasts for the company.
While Altius Renewable Royalties is showing a solid reduction in its cash burn, it's still worth considering how easily it could raise more cash, even just to fuel faster growth. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash and fund growth. By looking at a company's cash burn relative to its market capitalisation, we gain insight on how much shareholders would be diluted if the company needed to raise enough cash to cover another year's cash burn.
Altius Renewable Royalties' cash burn of US$1.4m is about 0.8% of its US$178m market capitalisation. That means it could easily issue a few shares to fund more growth, and might well be in a position to borrow cheaply.
As you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about Altius Renewable Royalties' cash burn. In particular, we think its cash runway stands out as evidence that the company is well on top of its spending. Its cash burn reduction wasn't quite as good, but was still rather encouraging! One real positive is that analysts are forecasting that the company will reach breakeven. After considering a range of factors in this article, we're pretty relaxed about its cash burn, since the company seems to be in a good position to continue to fund its growth. On another note, we conducted an in-depth investigation of the company, and identified 2 warning signs for Altius Renewable Royalties (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.
Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies, and this list of stocks growth stocks (according to analyst forecasts)

The protests follow the recent revelation of a meeting at which senior Alternative for Germany, or AfD, politicians and members of the main opposition Christian Democrats discussed a “re-migration” scheme that echoed Nazi policies of the 1930s.
A demonstration in Munich on Sunday drew more than 100,000 people, according to local police; organizers estimated the turnout at over 250,000. In Cologne an estimated 70,000 people took part, and a large crowd gathered in front of Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, in Berlin.
Protesters in Berlin waved European Union flags and rainbow banners. Some were holding placards with slogans saying “Germany remains colorful,” “Voting AfD is so 1933” or “Ban the AfD.”
The protests followed turnout of more than 250,000 on Saturday, including Frankfurt and Hanover, where more than 70,000 people amassed. More than 50,000 people in Hamburg joined a protest on Friday.

Discussions at the meeting in November, which was exposed by investigative journalists, included a proposal for mass deportations of asylum seekers, other foreigners with the right to reside in Germany, and German nationals whom the participants deemed insufficiently “assimilated.”
“Right-wing extremists are attacking our democracy. They want to destroy our social cohesion,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in his weekly video podcast on Friday. “At a secret conference, these extremists discussed how they could kick millions of people out of our country.”
Scholz called on all citizens to take a stand and defend Germany’s open and pluralistic society against the threat of right-wing extremism.
The AfD has risen from the fringes of German politics to be second in national opinion polls, while support for Scholz’s three-party coalition has sagged. Scholz’s Social Democratic party lost 2 percentage points of public support in a weekly poll published by Bild on Sunday with AfD party holding steady at 22%. The right-wing party is projected to win three regional elections in eastern Germany in September.
The growing appeal of AfD has been driven by years of high energy and food costs, a jump in new arrivals of asylum seekers, and infighting among Scholz’s coalition.
Following the report about the deportation plans, though, a growing number of business executives have expressed concern about the rise of the far-right and warned against the threat it poses to Germany as an open society and attractive location to do business.

Scholz’s government has opted for a two-pronged approach to tackle the migration challenge by speeding up deportation of rejected asylum seekers and facilitating the integration of those allowed to stay.
Parliament last week approved legislation which gives local authorities more powers to arrest and deport undocumented migrants. At the same time, the coalition parties passed a law that makes it easier for foreigners to become German citizens, or obtain dual citizenship.

Shattered shop fronts and bodies lying in the snow could be seen in videos posted on Telegram.
Denis Pushilin, the Kremlin-appointed head of the occupied region of Donestsk, said Ukrainian artillery shells hit the market on Sunday morning and that 20 people had also been wounded.
“Information continues to be received about the consequences of the monstrous shelling of a busy market,” he said.
Ukrainian officials did not immediately comment, and The Telegraph was not able to verify the nature of the attack.
Donetsk resident Tatiana said she heard an incoming projectile overhead, and hid under her market stall.
“I saw smoke, people screamed, a woman was crying,” she told a local media outlet.
“Where is there anything military here? It’s just a market,” another resident named Tatiana told the same outlet. “This is one of the strongest blows in recent times,” she said.
Moscow called it a “barbaric terrorist attack” that showed the need for its “special military operation” in Ukraine.
The toll marks one of the deadliest attacks on the city since the outbreak of war in 2022. Moscow uses Donetsk as a logistics centre and staging post for its forces fighting on nearby frontlines.  Over the weekend, the Russian army claimed to have captured two small villages as it continues to go on the offensive.
Pro-Russian officials regularly claim attacks by Ukrainian forces. Earlier in January, officials in the Russian city of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine said a Ukrainian missile strike killed 25 people, mainly women and children shopping ahead of the Orthodox Christmas. This was denied by Ukrainian officials.
Ukraine appears to have intensified attacks on Russian targets, although Ukrainian commanders have always denied targeting civilians.
Also on Sunday, Russian officials said at least two Ukrainian drones had hit a gas field in the port of Ust-Luga on the Gulf of Finland, causing a massive explosion.
Novatek, the operator of the gas field, said the fire was caused by an “external factor” and had resulted in no injuries.

BQL4GDBUQE_R8WQ157MM7J38BT,Multiculturalism is becoming a Trojan horse for Islamist domination,Nick Timothy,"January 22, 2024 at 6:00 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/multiculturalism-becoming-trojan-horse-islamist-210000256.html,"The best school in the country, measured by the progress made by its pupils, is not what many would expect. It does not select by ability or by postcode. It serves a deprived community in Wembley, London. It is unapologetically strict and rigorous in its teaching.
Michaela, founded by Katharine Birbalsingh, is loathed by many on the Left, who despise its methods and resent its success. But the news that a pupil is suing the school over restrictions on ritual prayer has shocked many on the Right. “How could this happen?” ask immigration liberals and advocates of multiculturalism, with a naivety that is difficult to believe.
The answer is plain. In many respects, and compared to other countries, Britain has succeeded in managing its newly multiracial identity. But in other obvious and very visible ways, it is failing. There is widespread self-segregation along ethnic and religious lines in British towns and cities. In many schools, segregation is more pronounced than in the communities they serve.
Meanwhile, backed by ideological academics and lawyers, and encouraged or appeased by politicians and public bodies, activists peddling grievance harry individuals and organisations to win favour, special treatment and institutional power.
They can do so thanks to the structures, laws and norms we ourselves have created. And the Michaela example is a case in point.
The school is a sort of Singapore of the British education system. Just as Lee Kuan Yew concluded that his multiracial city state could only maintain peace through uncompromisingly tough justice, so Birbalsingh ensures her pupils are treated equally under a tough school disciplinary policy. Everyone eats vegetarian meals to avoid religious segregation at lunchtimes. There is no prayer room for any religion.
Birbalsingh says she asks pupils from all backgrounds to make sacrifices so all can live in harmony. “Our school must be a place,” she explains, “where children of all races and religions buy into something they all share and is bigger than ourselves: our country.”
But this vision is rejected by activists and their facilitators, who demand exceptionalism, not equality.
It is no longer enough, in their worldview, to treat people equally. They argue we must treat people differently, in order to respect their beliefs and achieve equality not of opportunity but of outcome.
Some go further still: they are more interested in turning invented hierarchies of oppression upside down – which is why so many of them tolerate discrimination against whites and Jews.
At Michaela, half its 700 pupils are Muslim. When around 30 started public prayer rituals in the shared playground, the governing body intervened. Birbalsingh explains that the decision was taken “against a backdrop of events including violence, intimidation and appalling racial harassment of our teachers”. Staff received death threats and were told the school would be bombed.
Now, an unnamed pupil is suing Michaela, backed by over £100,000 in legal aid, and likely much more to come. The student had already been in trouble after being accused of intimidating other Muslim pupils who did not fast during Ramadan, and was suspended last year for allegedly threatening to stab another child (which the pupil denied).
They are supported by a law firm in receipt of huge sums in public funding. They have instructed a barrister from Matrix Chambers, the legal practice specialising in human rights co-founded by Cherie Blair.
Even though the school policy applies to all faiths, the Matrix argument is that it is a de facto Muslim prayer ban, because Islamic prayer is ritualised and not internal. Christian children, they say, are still allowed to pray personally and quietly.
This all appears to come from the extremist playbook. As Ed Husain explains in The Islamist, the “total Islamization of the public space at college (open prayers, Islamist posters, women in hijab)” is an expression of power and intimidation – of staff, other pupils and other Muslims. At Michaela, when the playground prayers began, more aggressive behaviour followed. A girl was pressured to wear a hijab. Another left the choir because she was told music was haram. Others were pressured to pray in public.
It is no coincidence that MEND, described by the Shawcross review of Prevent as having a “well-established track record of working alongside extremists”, and the Muslim Council of Britain, subject to a “no-engagement” policy by ministers over extremism concerns, have both campaigned for school spaces to be given over to Muslim prayer sessions.
This all matters, because our failure is shaping the kind of society we are fast becoming. This case ought to be a wake-up call, but it is not an isolated example. In east London, Barclay Primary School has police officers stationed on-site after receiving threats following the headteacher’s decision to prohibit political symbols, including the Palestinian flag.
Another east London school, St Stephen’s, was intimidated into dropping its ban on primary-age children wearing the hijab. There were Islamist protests against sex education outside schools in Birmingham, and the Trojan horse plot, when activists attempted to take over state schools and impose a hardline Islamic ethos.
There is the Batley teacher, still in hiding after showing a depiction of Muhammed in a religious education class, and the kangaroo court held in a Wakefield mosque after a boy lightly scuffed a copy of the Quran.
Extremists are turning our schools – and other public institutions – into a battleground. But instead of confronting them, the authorities are appeasing and encouraging them.
Our laws, especially equality and human rights laws, allow extremists and activists to play the state and society like a fiddle, while workplaces and public services have succumbed to political correctness and American critical race theory.
Instead of letting ideologues destroy them, we need to build more institutions like Michaela – resilient, unifying, and focused entirely on excellence. In Wembley and elsewhere, this is the choice we face. It could not be more serious.

BT1D70Y83X_V63PLXPOGRB0C4Z,Rick Scott’s pitch to Florida Hispanics: Kitchen table issues with a side of Latin America,Rafael Bernal,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/rick-scott-pitch-florida-hispanics-110000908.html,"Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) says Hispanic voters have the same concerns as the general population, with added focus on conditions in Central and South America.
“[Hispanics] generally care about the same thing as everybody else. But they also do care about democracy and freedom in Latin America. So while they care about jobs, they care about education, they care about law enforcement, they also care about that,” Scott told The Hill.
That view is central to Scott’s reelection campaign approach in Florida, a state where a quarter of the population is Hispanic.
“In my campaigns, if I’m gonna run an ad, I generally run an ad in English and in Spanish. If I’m doing events, I’m doing events, like in the Panhandle and I’m also at same time doing events in Miami. Or if I’m in Tampa, I might do an event with the Chamber [of Commerce], then also do it with the Hispanic Chamber,” he said.
“So I’ve always reached out to everybody, because I represent everybody.”
That approach stands in contrast to mainstream thinking in national Hispanic-focused campaigns, where apples-to-apples bilingual outreach is slowly being replaced by tailor-made messages for individual cultural subsets.
Scott’s more traditional approach in part responds to the large number of different Hispanic groups in Florida.
“Hispanics in the way it works in Florida — we have Cubans, Venezuelans, Colombians, Puerto Ricans, Nicaraguans — they’re all different communities but it’s a good melting pot, but I reach out to each one of them and I do things with every group. I just never — I never stopped talking to them,” said Scott.
His confident approach — he has won three straight statewide elections — also relies on his constituent services, which in 2022 were awarded the Congressional Management Foundation’s Democracy Award.
“I’m running on my record and so, you know, the I’m very — I’m very comfortable that I’m going to continue to do my job and you know, my constituent services team won for the best constituent service team in the country,” said Scott.
But Scott’s statewide wins have not been by large margins: In 2010 he won the governorship by about 1.2 percentage points, he was reelected in 2014 by a single percentage point margin and he won his Senate seat in 2018 against then-incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D) by less than two-tenths of a percentage point — about a 10,000 vote difference out of more than 8 million votes cast.
And Scott, along with Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), is the closest thing Republicans have to a vulnerable incumbent in 2024. Both senators’ races are ranked as “likely Republican” by the Cook Political report, as opposed to the “solid Republican” rankings of the other nine GOP-held seats up for renewal.
Scott is also facing a GOP primary opponent, Keith Gross, who pledged to spend copiously to unseat the incumbent, though as of September Gross had spent just under a million dollars compared to Scott’s $12 million already spent in the 2024 cycle.
Throughout his political career, Scott has successfully fended off attacks on the source of his fortune, a 2003 settlement after a complex fraud case involving the company he ran, Columbia/HCA, once the country’s largest health care company.
Those attacks have continued in the GOP primary, and from challengers across the aisle, including Democratic front-runner former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (Fla.), who called the events leading to the settlement “the largest Medicare fraud ever committed in the history of this country.”
Mucarsel-Powell, who was born in Ecuador, is playing full-court press on Hispanic media in Florida, doing nearly daily Spanish-language interviews on influential radio stations in an attempt to outflank Scott through cultural competence and Spanish-language fluency.
“The problem she has it’s not the language she speaks, it’s her positions,” said Scott.
Attack lines in the general election — likely to be between Scott and Mucarsel-Powell — are forming along predictable fronts.
“She runs around with people that are anti-police; I don’t know Hispanics that are anti-police. She basically is, you know, she runs around with people that are anti-Israel. In my experience with Hispanics, they’re not anti-Israel. You know, she basically is a socialist. My experience with Hispanics is they’re not socialists,” said Scott.
Mucarsel-Powell, meanwhile, is attacking Scott as a political extremist for his support of former President Trump, whom she equates to authoritarian strongmen in Latin America.
“It’s nice that Rick Scott is suddenly pretending to care about Latino families in Florida. But hardworking Floridians already know Rick Scott is a fraud who has advocated to raise taxes on the middle class, sided with dangerous insurrectionists, and written the plan to sunset Social Security and Medicare. Rick Scott is a threat to opportunities in this country and democracy at home and abroad,” said Lauren Chou, a spokeswoman for Mucarsel-Powell’s campaign.
Both candidates converge, however, in the importance that Florida Hispanics put in their representatives understanding Western Hemisphere politics.
“With Cubans, I mean, they care about the freedom and democracy in Cuba, generally, or Venezuelans, they care about what [President Nicolás] Maduro is doing or the Nicaraguans, they care about what [President Daniel] Ortega is doing, or if they’re Colombians, they care about what [President Gustavo] Petro is doing or you know, if they’re Argentines, they care about what [President Javier] Milei is doing,” said Scott.
Though U.S. citizens of Latin American and Caribbean origin are a powerful voting group, particularly in South Florida, Puerto Ricans in central Florida have changed the state’s political dynamics.
Puerto Ricans are statutory U.S. citizens if they’re born in the territory, so even recent arrivals from the island are eligible to vote. In 2019 Florida became the state with the largest Puerto Rican diaspora, now more than a million strong.
Like Hispanics with non-U.S. national origins, Scott is pitching kitchen table issues to Puerto Ricans, but he’s also diverging — with caveats — from the Republican Party mainstream on an issue that polls particularly well with Florida’s Puerto Rican community: statehood.
“First off, what they want to do is they want to take care of their families. No. 2, their futures, their kids, so they care about education. And the other thing is they want to have a low crime rate.”
“It’s important to talk about the issues and work with the issues that impact Puerto Ricans and, and acknowledge, I think — I think Puerto Rico eventually will be a state. I think they have to get their fiscal house in order and whether everybody agrees with me here, I’m one vote.”

We extend our sincere appreciation for his many years of service to Carroll County and send our heartfelt prayers to his family,” said Carroll County Commissioner Board President Kenny Kiler in a statement.

He was a former dairy farmer in Carroll County.
“My wife and I were working seven days a week, possibly 14 hours a day. The last year on the dairy farm, I made $3,200. It is not much incentive to continue when you work that hard and there is very little fruit for your labor,” Mr. Haines said in a 2005 Capital Gazette article. “It was an excellent decision for me. I have had a very successful business.”
In 1972 he became the owner, broker and appraiser at Haines Realty, a Westminster business. He was elected to the Maryland Senate in 1990 and took office in 1991.
“Larry was a classic Carroll County gentleman,” said state Senator Justin Ready of Manchester. “He was dignified. You’d see him dressed in a nice suit and a power tie. He carried himself with style.”
“I know from my family’s personal experience that he gave constituent service,” said Sen. Ready. “He stressed Carroll County values — hard work, ingenuity and the entrepreneurial spirit. He was very sensitive to people who were trying to turn their lives around. He supported nonprofits working in this field and looked out for people overcoming addiction.”
“He was a strong champion for agriculture and he was supportive of the Carroll County Agricultural Center and the Farm Museum,” said Sen. Ready.
“Larry embodied the community spirit of Carroll County,” said Joseph Getty, who followed Mr. Haines in the Senate.
“He was dedicated to doing right for the people of Carroll County. He had the background — a dairy farmer who had the experience of owning a small business. He loved to serve his people.
“As a young legislator, he was a mentor to me. I learned from his legislative knowledge and strategy for getting bills passed in the General Assembly,” said Mr. Getty, the former chief judge of what is now the Maryland Supreme Court.
Susan Krebs, a former member of the House of Delegates during his time in Annapolis, said, “He served his community in a conservative manner, consistent with what he ran on. His priorities were always his faith, his family and his farm community.
“He spoke in a calm and confident manner. He was cool and collected. He was not a flamboyant politician. He acted like a statesman,” said Ms. Krebs.
A 2002 Sun story described Mr. Haines’ annual summertime picnic fundraiser: “The Carroll County Republican, whose crop of thick white hair makes him a standout in any setting, was equally at ease chatting with straight-laced politicians and leather-clad bikers.”
The article noted his political stature: “Haines’ political strength remains firmly grounded in his home county. And his picnic is Carroll’s grandest political event — a reminder of his place as the most secure, recognizable and popular Republican in a county where the party holds every state and county elected office.”
He said about running in 2002, “I have an opponent, and I take that seriously.”
In 2005, a year after the state Senate changed its prayer rules to accommodate legislators who objected to references to Jesus from the rostrum, Mr. Haines proposed a bill to guarantee the right of lawmakers and others to make reference to specific religious figures before a government body is called to order, The Sun reported.
Mr. Haines said he believed rules requiring ecumenical prayer violate the First Amendment and that Christians had been prevented from expressing their religious beliefs.
“It seems like Christianity is no longer tolerated. We’re censured when in prayers we mention the deity we serve,” he said in 2002.
He was a member of the Maryland Association of Realtors, a past president of Carroll County Association of Realtors and a member of the American Association of Certified Appraisers.
He belonged to Gideons International, the Fellowship of Christian Farmers and was a past vice chair of the church council at Church of the Open Door in Westminster, where he was a member.
In the General Assembly, he served on the Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee, among other posts and was a past chair of the Carroll County Delegation.
He left office in 2011.
Survivors include his wife of 63 years, Jane Marie Armfield Haines; three sons, Garry A. Haines and Kevin E. Haines, both of Westminster, and Levi T. Haines, of Hanover, Pennsylvania; brother Donald Haines, of Woodbine; nine grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. His son, Matthew Keith Haines, died in 2020. A granddaughter, Mabel Ruth Haines, also predeceased him.
Services were held Saturday at his church."

State TV said the shooting happened when the soldier arrived at a barracks dormitory and opened fire on the resting soldiers. It said the motive wasn't immediately clear and the suspect, who wasn't identified, was at large. No other details were released.
The report said the attack took place in Kerman some 830 kilometers (515 miles), southeast of the capital Tehran.
Kerman was the scene of two deadly explosions earlier this month that killed 94 people and wounded hundreds of others during an anniversary ceremony for the death of an Iranian general killed in a 2020 U.S. drone strike in Iraq. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility.
Similar shootings at military bases have been occasionally reported in Iran. In 2022, a soldier killed another soldier and three policemen at a roadside police station in the country's south.

C2BOVX2A04_HL2NJBUKXF1R5X3,‘Tortuguita vive’: campaigners across US hail anti-Cop City activist killed by police,Timothy Pratt in Atlanta,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·7 min read",20230121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/tortuguita-vive-campaigners-across-us-110025800.html,"At a gathering Thursday, the mother of an activist killed by police had a clear message on the first anniversary of their death: “I have news for you. Manuel is alive. Tortuguita vive!”
It was a message of celebration for the life of Manuel Paez Terán, also known as “Tortuguita”, that was being made in Atlanta and more than 30 cities across the US, a sign of the slain activist’s enduring impact on several movements, observers said.
Police killed Tortuguita 18 January of last year while the activist was sleeping in a forested public park south-east of Atlanta, in protest against the building of a police and fire department training center nearby known as “Cop City”. It was the first such incident in US history.
On Thursday, there were vigils, panels, film screenings, church services and altars built under trees at sunset, in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Minneapolis, Tucson and other cities. Many of the events were billed as “Day of the Forest Defender”.

Paez Terán’s mother, Belkis Terán, came from Panama to speak at two ceremonies in Atlanta. “I know there are more people celebrating in many places. We are celebrating his life,” she said.
Atlanta mourners repeatedly referred to those who could not be there due to the chilling effect of felony Rico, or conspiracy, charges leveled against 61 people in connection with opposition to the training center. The case is historic for the sheer number of activists accused of belonging to a criminal conspiracy. The movement is motivated by concerns about police use of force and consolidation of power, and protection of forests in an era of climate change, among other issues.
The number and range of events dedicated to remembering Tortuguita on Thursday suggest that the activist, who was 26, has “become a symbol not only for the fight against Cop City, but in the fight against police violence in general, and for the environmental movement”, said Dan Berger, a historian of social movements.
Tortuguita was one of less than two dozen activists camped last year in Intrenchment Creek Park, about a mile from the City of Atlanta-owned Cop City site, as part of an attempt to defend the forest from the training center project and from plans to turn over part of the park to a private developer.
The number of “forest defenders” had been greatly reduced in the weeks before the January raid carried out by local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, due in part to a previous raid in December, and to the winter weather. Georgia state troopers came upon Tortuguita’s tent and wound up shooting at least 14 bullets, leaving 57 gunshot wounds and killing Paez Terán almost instantly, according to government and private autopsies.
The state subsequently claimed that the activist fired a gun, and concluded in early October that the Georgia state troopers who killed Tortuguita were not at fault. The troopers were not wearing body cameras, but officers from other agencies who were nearby did record sounds and images. Only some of those videos have been released, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation refuses to release the others and the rest of their investigative file, claiming the file must remain closed while the Rico case proceeds.
Meanwhile, the movement against Cop City has continued, now in its fourth year, and has included such efforts as gathering more than 100,000 signatures on a petition to let Atlanta voters decide if they want at least $67m in taxpayer funds spent on the project. The city has refrained from counting and validating the signatures due to an ongoing court case. Historic numbers of residents have attended Atlanta city council meetings in opposition to the project, with one drawing nearly a thousand. There have also been ongoing acts of vandalism against construction equipment and companies linked to the training center.
On Thursday morning at Park Ave Baptist Church, the Rev Keyanna Jones, one of several Black preachers involved in the movement, began events in Atlanta by reminding mourners “we come here with heavy hearts – but we have hope, because the person we are here to honor had hope”.
A message was read from Victor Puertas, an Indigenous, Peruvian-born activist now facing Rico charges who is being held in Stewart detention center, an immigration prison in Georgia. “I just want to say Tortuguita is alive,” the statement read.
Another was read from a defendant who wrote that she was “more than a thousand miles away, unable to return to Georgia – one of many defendants isolated from the community by court order”. Still, she continued, “[e]ven though many of us can’t be here today to grieve, we still carry Tortuguita with us, in our hearts”.
A woman who had driven about 90 miles from Macon stood up to tell the 60 or so gathered: “Everyone here is so brave.” She spoke about her granddaughter, who was inspired by Tortuguita to became a street medic, something the activist had done. The woman’s granddaughter is now also one of one of the 61 indicted; her bond conditions also prohibited her from attending the event.

Later, around sunset, a larger crowd assembled around a pair of pine trees in a park near the forest where Tortuguita was killed. Mourners placed photos, candles, flowers and drawings at the base of the large trunks, an altar for the moment.
A musician named Matt Rivers sang an anthem he had written with the chorus: “For every tree that’s felled, there’s a cop that’s going to hell / For every martyr slain so grows the flame.”
In lower Manhattan’s historic Tompkins Square Park, mourners made their altar at the foot an elm tree, “a survivor and endangered species around which many movements have gathered”, wrote one person online.
People in Atlanta recalled how Paez Terán served as a self-appointed ambassador to the forest, welcoming many who showed up there throughout 2022, as word of the ongoing protest spread. Tortuguita, who used they as a pronoun, transmitted optimism and joy. Once, a fellow forest defender remembered, Tortuguita came upon a tree that police had knocked down to destroy a tree house. “Now I have materials to build another tree house,” they said.
Other US environmental activists have been killed before, noted Will Potter, the author of Green Is the New Red, a book about the federal government’s legal campaigns against animal rights and environmental groups such as Earth First! and the Animal Liberation Front, in the 1990s and 2000s.
He mentioned David Nathan “Gypsy” Chain, part of Earth First!, who died in 1998 after a logger felled a tree on him. In the case of Tortuguita, he said, the difference has been the “media exposure, helping create a sustained momentum and organizing around Cop City to memorialize Tortuguita – to remember what they stood for, and what’s at stake, really”.
Belkis Terán spoke several times on Thursday of another aspect of Tortuguita’s legacy she hopes to create – the “Tortuguita Healing Center”, a place for “forest defenders” worldwide she plans on building in Panama, where she lives. She recently received a $30,000 donation toward buying the forested land where the center will be located.
“This would be unprecedented” in the environmental movement, Potter said. “We have seen over and over the toll defending forests takes on activists due to state repression, and this could make a big difference”.
At the end of the Atlanta vigil, a statement was read from Vienna, Tortuguita’s girlfriend. She wrote how complex Tortuguita was, both angry and silly, social and withdrawn – and how “the state wishes to vilify Tort, making them into the monster of a violent extremist that justifies their assassination and shows ‘proof’ of our anti-state tendencies”.
“Tort was my second love after the forest itself”, she continued. “They were everything and nothing that has been said”."

Source: Digi24, a Romanian news outlet, citing a letter by the Agricultural Alliance, an umbrella body for several farmers’ associations
Details: The letter related to the upcoming meeting of EU agriculture and fisheries ministers is addressed to President Klaus Iohannis, Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu and Agriculture and Rural Development Minister Florin Barbu.
The farmers want a solution at the EU level to ensure the ""survival of European farmers"".
They propose to create a system that will ensure that the destination of agricultural products from Ukraine is determined before they enter the EU (for import, transit, etc.), the goods are weighed, the data is entered into an electronic system and ""made available to all interested parties"" – all in order to ensure that each shipment goes exactly where it is intended. Romanian farmers want such a system to be put in place by 30 April 2024.
The association also wants to introduce import caps for agricultural products based on annual or quarterly averages for 2021-2022.
Romanian farmers are also demanding that Brussels be notified and that ""safeguards"" be automatically applied at the national level if violations of the rules by owners of agricultural imports or their carriers are detected in any of the EU member states.
Background:
Polish farmers are also expected to hold a major protest over imports from Ukraine on 24 January.
On 20 January, the movement of freight traffic through the Halmeu-Diakove checkpoint resumed after the border on the Romanian side had been unblocked. This checkpoint was the last one to be blocked. The Siret-Porubne checkpoint was also unblocked on 20 January. The blocking of the Vicovu de Sus – Krasnoilsk crossing point stopped on 19 January.
On 16 January, reports emerged that the Romanian Agriculture Ministry and representatives of major agricultural organisations had reached an agreement on 15 January that satisfied several demands of farmers who had been protesting for six days and blocking the border with Ukraine.

The first-term Democrat posted her decision online Friday, faulting the board for veering into foreign policy in which its members have no legal authority or expertise. She said the debate over the resolution left the city “angrier, more divided and less safe.”
“Their exercise was never about bringing people together,” Breed wrote in a statement. “It was about choosing a side.”
A divided board approved the resolution earlier this month, which also condemned Hamas as well as the Israeli government and urged the Biden administration to press for the release of all hostages and delivery of humanitarian aid. Cease-fire advocates in the audience erupted into cheers and chants of “Free Palestine.”
Breed earlier criticized the supervisors, saying ""the process at the board only inflamed division and hurt.”
San Francisco joined dozens of other U.S. cities in approving a resolution that has no legal weight but reflects pressure on local governments to speak up on the Israel-Hamas war, now in its fourth month following a deadly Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militants.
Breed said she mostly refrains from commenting on nonbinding resolutions from the board, but in this case she made an exception. Her decision came in the run-up to the March 5 primary election, in which she is telling voters she is making progress against homelessness, public drug use and property crime in a city that has seen a spate of unwelcome publicity about vacant downtown offices and stratospheric housing prices.
Reaction to the ongoing Israeli military action in Gaza is shaking campaigns from the White House to City Halls. A poll by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in early November found 40% of the U.S. public believed Israel’s response in Gaza had gone too far.
Breed lamented the suffering in Gaza and the loss of life on both sides. But she chastised activists who jeered when a man spoke of family members killed in the Hamas attack, and she wrote that a Jewish city employee was surrounded by protesters in a restroom.
Breed wrote that “abject antisemitism” had apparently become acceptable to a subset of activists.
“The antisemitism in our city is real and dangerous,” she wrote, adding that vetoing the resolution likely would lead to more divisive hearings and “fan even more antisemitic acts.”
Breed said she had spoken to numerous Jewish residents “who tell me they don't feel safe in their own city. ... They are fearful of the growing acts of vandalism and intimidation.”
Supervisor Dean Preston, who introduced the cease-fire resolution, told the San Francisco Chronicle he was happy that the mayor did not veto the resolution, which is now final.
Lara Kiswani, executive director of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center, an organization that has planned protests calling for a cease-fire in Gaza, told the newspaper that Breed's statement amplified “dangerous, racist, well-worn anti-Arab tropes that seem to completely disregard our community.”"

Winter snow storms have continued to bring dangerous conditions to swaths of the U.S. over the weekend, after a barrage of extreme weather already left some Americans with no water or power.
Storms and icy conditions over the past few weeks have proved fatal, with at least 67 weather-related deaths reported across the U.S., per the Associated Press.
In Oregon, where the governor declared an emergency on Thursday, the treacherous wintry conditions killed at least 10 people. The victims include a pregnant woman, her boyfriend, and her brother, who were electrocuted while trying to get away on slick concrete from a power line that fell on their car. A neighbor saved the couple’s nine-month-old baby, with both miraculously escaping unscathed, the AP reported.
The National Weather Service issued multiple extreme winter weather warnings across the country. While this weekend’s arctic outbreak was not expected to be as cold as the previous one, the agency predicted Sunday morning would start with a “deep freeze engulfing much of the eastern two-thirds of the country” with sub-freezing temperatures reaching as far south as central Texas and northern Florida and sub-zero temperatures across the northern Midwest.
An ice storm warning was in place in Oregon until 4 p.m. Sunday. The number of customers in the state without power—which had stood at more than 31,000 midday Saturday—had dropped to under 9,000 by Sunday mid-morning, according to PowerOutage.us.
Freezing rain and sleet were expected to hit Oklahoma and Kansas Sunday evening and then move into the Midwest on Monday, the National Weather Service said.
Most of the South, normally used to mild winters, experienced a freeze alert over Saturday night. In Alabama, some residents were marooned at home all week as ice coated roadways, making them impassable.
In Tennessee, at least 25 people died because of the weather as of Sunday, authorities told the AP. Frozen pipes burst and significantly dropped water pressure in Memphis, leading to Memphis Light, Gas and Water issuing a boil notice to customers as a precaution.
Temperatures are expected to warm up in the middle of the country throughout Sunday, with the arctic blast shifting eastward and to the mid-Atlantic region by Monday, the National Weather Service said.

CK52WINRRT_KTB0TOIQXWP8TLZ,Is Kim Jong Un Really Planning an Attack This Time?,Choe Sang-Hun,"January 22, 2024 at 1:57 AM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/kim-jong-un-really-planning-165729036.html,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired hundreds of artillery shells in waters near South Korean border islands on Jan. 5. Last week, it said it no longer regarded the South as inhabited by “fellow countrymen” but as a “hostile state” it would subjugate through a nuclear war. On Friday, it said it had tested an underwater nuclear drone to help repel U.S. Navy fleets.
That new drumbeat of threats, while the United States and its allies have been preoccupied with the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, has set foreign officials and analysts wondering whether the North’s leader, Kim Jong Un, has moved beyond posturing and is planning to assert more military force.
Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times
For decades, a central part of the North Korean playbook has been to stage carefully measured and timed military provocations — some aimed at tightening internal discipline, others at demanding attention from its neighbors and the United States, or all of that at once.
But to several close watchers of North Korea, the latest round of signals from Kim feels different. Some are taking it as a clue that the North has become disillusioned with seeking diplomatic engagement with the West, and a few are raising the possibility that the country could be planning a sudden assault on South Korea.
Two veteran analysts of North Korea — former State Department official Robert Carlin and nuclear scientist Siegfried Hecker — sounded an alarm this past week in an article for the U.S.-based website 38 North, asserting that Kim was done with mere threats. “Kim Jong Un has made a strategic decision to go to war,” they wrote.
Analysts broadly agree that North Korea has been shifting its posture in recent years, compelled by an accumulation of both internal problems, including a moribund economy and food and oil shortages, and frustrations in its external diplomacy, like Kim’s failure to win an end to international sanctions through direct diplomacy with former President Donald Trump. And most agree that the North’s recent closeness with Russia, including supplying artillery shells and missiles for use in Russia’s war in Ukraine, will be a game-changer in some way.
But there is still stark disagreement over where Kim’s new tack might be leading.
Many say that Kim’s ultimate goal remains not a war with South Korea, a treaty ally of the United States, but Washington’s acceptance of his country as a nuclear power by prompting arms-reduction talks.
“The North Koreans won’t start a war unless they decide to become suicidal; they know too well that they cannot win the war,” said Park Won-gon, a North Korea expert at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “But they would love their enemies to believe that they could, because that could lead to engagement and possible concessions, like the easing of sanctions.”
Analysts in China, North Korea’s most vital ally, were also deeply skeptical that Kim would go to war unless the North were attacked. Professor Shi Yinhong, at Renmin University in Beijing, asserted that the North’s leadership, not being irrational, ultimately acted out of self-preservation — and that starting a war would work against that goal.
Others noted that the North could assert itself militarily, including through smaller conventional strikes and bolder weapons testing, without necessarily triggering a deadly response.
“There are many rungs of the escalation ladder that North Korea can climb short of all-out war,” said Victor Cha, a Korea expert at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Kim is not that confident in his capabilities to deter U.S. reaction if he were to do something rash.”
If Kim wants to climb that ladder, recent history suggests that this might be the time.
North Korea has liked to unsettle its enemies at their most sensitive political moments, and both the United States and South Korea are holding elections this year. The North launched a long-range rocket in late 2012, between the U.S. and South Korean presidential elections. It conducted a nuclear test shortly before the inauguration of a South Korean leader in 2013. In 2016, it conducted another nuclear test two months before the U.S. presidential election.
North Korea could also attempt provocations in the coming weeks to try to help liberals who favor inter-Korean negotiations win parliamentary elections in South Korea in April, said analyst Ko Jae-hong at the Seoul-based Institute for National Security Strategy. Through provocations, North Korea hopes to spread fears among South Korean voters that increasing pressure on the North, as the current administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol has tried to do, might “lead to a nuclear war,” he said.
North Korea “will continue to increase tensions until after the U.S. elections,” said Thomas Schäfer, a former German diplomat who served twice as ambassador to North Korea. But “at the height of tensions, it will finally be willing to reengage with a Republican administration in the hope to get sanctions relief, some sort of acceptance of their nuclear program, and — as main objective — a reduction or even complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula,” Schäfer said in a rebuttal to Carlin’s and Hecker’s analysis.
Since Kim came to power in 2011, he has committed to building North Korea’s nuclear capability, using it both as a deterrent and as a negotiating tool to try to win concessions from Washington, like the removal of U.N. sanctions, to achieve economic growth.
He tried it when he met Trump in 2018 and again in 2019. It failed spectacularly, and Kim returned home empty-handed and in humiliation.
He then vowed to find a “new way” for his country.
Since then, the North has rejected repeated calls from Washington for talks. It has also rejected South Korea as a dialogue partner, indicating from 2022 that it would use nuclear weapons against South Korea in a war and abandoning its long-held insistence that the weapons would keep the Korean Peninsula peaceful as a deterrent. It has tested more diverse, and harder-to-intercept, means of delivering its nuclear warheads.
There is doubt that the North has yet built a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that could target the United States. But two of the North’s main enemies, South Korea and Japan, are much closer.
On the diplomatic front, Kim has taken pains to signal that he no longer views the United States as a critical negotiating partner, instead envisioning a “neo-Cold War” in which the United States is in retreat globally. He has aggressively improved military ties with Russia, and in return has most likely secured Russian promises of food aid and technological help for his weapons programs, officials say.
“I worry that his confidence might lead him to misjudge with a small act, regardless of his intention, escalating to war amid a tense ‘power-for-power’ confrontation with the United States and its allies,” said Koh Yu-hwan, a former head of the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul.
Despite its own increasingly aggressive military posture in recent years, China may prove to be a damper on any North Korean military adventurism.
China and North Korea are bound by a treaty signed in 1961 that requires each country to provide military assistance if the other is attacked. But China has little incentive to be drawn into a war in Korea right now.
“A war on the Korean Peninsula would be disastrous for Beijing. An entire half-century of peace in East Asia, a period of unprecedented growth for the PRC, would come to a crashing halt,” said John Delury, a professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, referring to the People’s Republic of China.
The United States has long leaned on Beijing to rein in North Korea. By drawing close to Moscow, Kim has been putting his own pressure on China’s leader, Xi Jinping.
“It is notable that Kim made his first post-pandemic trip to the Russian Far East, skipping China, and he just sent his foreign minister to Moscow, not Beijing,” Delury said. By raising tensions, Kim “can see what Xi is willing to do to placate him,” he added.

Source: Institute for the Study of War (ISW)
Details: The ISW reported that geolocation data from 20 January showed that Russian forces had captured Krokhmalne, a village located 20 km to the northeast of Svatove. Russian military bloggers earlier claimed that Ukrainian forces had withdrawn from their positions in the vicinity of Krokhmalne.
Geolocation data from 20 January also shows that Russian forces have made an insignificant advance to the east of Ivanivka (20 km to the southeast of Kupiansk).
Russian forces also advanced to the southwest of Bakhmut. Geolocation data from 20 January shows that Russian forces have also gained territory in a small forest to the northwest of Klishchiivka (to the southwest of Bakhmut).
The ISW said that Russian forces also made small gains in the area near the administrative border of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Geolocation data from 20 January shows that Russian forces made limited gains to the southeast of Urozhaine (10 km to the south of Velyka Novosilka).
Positional engagements continued along the entire front.
To quote the ISW’s Key Takeaways for 20 January:
Russian President Vladimir Putin falsely claimed that Russia supports the ""unconditional equality"" and ""sovereignty"" of all states in a letter from 20 January to the Non-Aligned Movement Summit, contradicting Russia’s official position on its war in Ukraine and its wider imperial ambitions.
Russian Ambassador to Denmark Vladimir Barbin threatened Denmark, a founding member of NATO, on 20 January in response to a recent US-Danish agreement allowing US forces access to military bases in Denmark.
Russian energy exports to China significantly increased in 2023 amid increasing Russian reliance on oil revenues to manage the fiscal burdens of the war in Ukraine.
European Union (EU) Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton stated on 20 January that the EU will have the capacity to produce 1.3 to 1.4 million artillery shells by the end of 2024 and will ensure that it delivers the ""majority"" of the shells to Ukraine.
Russian forces made confirmed advances along the Kupiansk-Svatove-Kreminna line, near Bakhmut, and in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area amid continued positional engagements along the front.
A Russian Storm-Z instructor claimed on 16 January that Rosgvardia (Russian Guard) personnel operating in occupied Ukraine have systematic issues with equipment and weapons storage.
Occupation authorities continue preparations for the March 2024 Russian presidential election.

COP5HNTUHP_2XYE0JL550TJ017,Families are running out of time to claim thousands in government payouts,Ruby Hinchliffe,"January 21, 2024 at 2:00 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/families-running-time-claim-thousands-050000779.html,"Grieving families are at risk of missing out on thousands of pounds in bereavement benefit payments as the Government’s deadline for backdated payouts approaches on February 9.
The benefits, known as Bereavement Support Payment (BSP) and Widowed Parent’s Allowance (WPA), are designed to help those who have lost their partner, and can be worth thousands of pounds – but you need to fulfil certain eligibility criteria to claim.
Previously, only those who’d lost their spouse or civil partner could claim, but last year the Government opened this out to those who had been cohabiting with their partner. For a limited time, these bereaved partners can backdate claims for the benefit they’d missed out on.
Bereaved parents who lost their partner between April 9, 2001 and February 8, 2023 may be eligible for a backdated payment – even if they no longer have dependent children.
The decision to open up the payments to unmarried couples came on February 8, 2023, following a Supreme Court ruling, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) opened a 12-month application window for unmarried, cohabiting parents.
In November, DWP minister Lord Younger said he “would urge anyone who thinks they may be eligible to claim as soon as possible”.
The Government’s decision to extend the benefit could affect as many as 21,000 families, according to the Childhood Bereavement Network – which has called the benefit a “lifeline for grieving families”.
But thousands are still yet to claim, with just three weeks to go. Alison Penny, director of the Childhood Bereavement Network, said only around a quarter of the 21,000 families potentially eligible had claimed as of October last year.
Ms Penny added: “It would be helpful if the window for claiming could be extended – but in the meantime it’s crucial that everyone continues to share news of the deadline.
“There is still time to claim, but the clock is ticking on being eligible for a full backdated payment.”
The BSP is for spouses, civil partners and partners who are living together “as though they are married”. It is not means tested, so you can claim regardless of how much you earn, or have saved.
The payments were launched in 2017 by DWP to support surviving spouses who lost their partners on or after April 6, 2017.
It’s for those who were below the state pension age when their partner died, and the deceased must have either died as a result of an accident or disease caused by their job. They also must have made National Insurance contributions for at least 25 weeks in one tax year since April 6, 1975.
For married couples, you can claim regardless of whether you have children. For cohabiting couples, you must have either been pregnant, receiving child benefit or entitled to child benefit at the time of death.
Usually, to get the full payment you’ll need to make a claim within three months of your partner’s death. You’ll receive a one-off lump sum, followed by up to 18 smaller monthly payments. These depend on your circumstances.
The rules are different if you want to backdate your claim. Firstly, it’s only for those who weren’t married when their partner died.
How much you get depends on when they died. If it was on or after August 30 2018, you might get both the usual one-off payment and monthly payments; if they died before, you won’t get the one-off sum, but might be able to get up to 18 monthly payments.
To get the full amount, you must apply by February 9. It’s still possible to make claims until November 8 2024, but your claim will be reduced.
Widowed Parent’s Allowance is the predecessor to BSP, and covers those whose partners died before April 6, 2017.
It can also be claimed by those who were married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting at the time of the death, and there are the same rules as BSP about the deceased either paying NI contributions or dying as a result of their job.
Regardless of whether or not you were married, you must have been eligible to receive child benefit for at least one child at the time of death. It may also be possible to claim if you were pregnant, or fell pregnant after fertility treatment at the time of the death.
Backdated payments are only for those who were not married to their partner when they died. Usually, those claiming WPA get up to £139.10 per week, but this can vary depending on your partner’s NI contributions.
The backdated amount may be less if you’re receiving certain other benefits, such as Universal Credit, Income Support or Jobseeker’s Allowance.
There’s a standard and higher rate for BSP. For most people, it includes a one-off payment of £2,500 and a monthly payment of £100 for 18 months (£1,800). That’s a total of £4,300.
If you receive child benefit or are pregnant, the one-off payment is £3,500 and the monthly payment £350 – equating to £9,800.
WPA payments work differently. The amount a partner gets is based on how much their partner paid in National Insurance contributions. The maximum is £139.10 a week.
But note, if they died because of an accident at work or a disease due to work, National Insurance contributions may not come into it.
Payments for both the old and new bereavement benefits can only be backdated to August 2018, even if a parent’s partner died before this date.
Vicky Anning, of charity Widowed and Young, said the backdated payouts have allowed one parent she was working to take her child on holiday for the first time in 10 years.
Elsewhere, one mother of two has already reportedly received as much as £22,000 in backdated Widowed Parent’s Allowance after the unexpected death of her partner in 2016, according to MoneySavingExpert’s Martin Lewis. She had been living with her partner for 27 years.
It’s important to note that as a claimant, you don’t have to be living in the UK. Most of Europe, as well as a handful of countries outside the continent, also offer these types of benefits.
You can claim BSP online, and also check the Government’s full list of eligibility criteria on gov.uk.
For WPA, you’ll need to download a paper form, print it, fill in the details, and send it to this address:
Dover Benefit Centre,
Post Handling Site B,
Wolverhampton, WV99 1LA.
You can also request paper forms to be sent to you via the Bereavement Service helpline: 0800 151 2012.
Melanie Hodson, of charity Hospice UK, said it is important that grieving families previously cut off from the benefit “don’t miss out for a second time”.
She added: “When someone dies, thinking about finances can be just one more thing to worry about at an incredibly difficult time. If there is more support available, we want as many people as possible to know about it.”

CPOWMEZ8FV_0Q95FIHRDYFWM07,"More Californians are driving EVs, making public charging a ‘potential nightmare’ | Opinion",Stephanie Finucane,"January 21, 2024 at 10:00 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/more-californians-driving-evs-making-130000274.html,"EV drivers, like everyone else, are creatures of habit. They have their go-to charging stations where they can plug in, use the bathroom, maybe grab a sandwich.
Lately, though, some of the most convenient fast-charging stations — mostly those located off major highways — have become gridlocked, especially on busy weekends. Drivers are reporting waits of half an hour or more — sometimes much more. One driver who posted on Reddit waited three hours to charge in Kettleman City on Thanksgiving weekend, turning a five-and-a-half-hour trip into a 10-and-a-half-hour ordeal.
Ugh.
Look, it’s one thing to spend 30 or 40 minutes charging a battery, which is a given when you take an EV on a road trip. But having to wait in a long line just to get to an open charging bay?
What’s happening now is “potentially a nightmare for drivers as more EVs hit the road,” described GreenBiz transportation writer Vartan Badalian.
In California, more than 20% of new cars purchased in 2023 were EVs, according to the California New Car Dealers Association, and that number will only grow as the state gets closer to phasing out sales of new, gasoline-powered cars.
That’s good for the environment, but not so swell for the drivers competing for a limited number of chargers.
The logical answer is to add more chargers. The state of California says it’s doing that.
“The California Energy Commission (CEC) is focused on rapidly deploying funds to meet the surge in demand and ensure an accessible, reliable, convenient charging network,” wrote CEC’s director of communication.
But throwing money at a problem is no guarantee it will be resolved in short order. So while we’re waiting for that “convenient charging network” to appear, what should we do?
Badalian, the transportation writer, has an idea on how to deal with gridlock:
“As you approach a full charging location, your EV (of any make) connects to the charging location and enters itself into a virtual queue, with entry to the queue dependent upon close geographical proximity. Drivers then park in an available normal parking spot, and only when prompted, proceed to plug in and charge. If a driver attempted to charge before their turn, the chargers would simply not communicate with the vehicle..”
If only that would work. Unfortunately, plug-in chargers have a tough enough time fulfilling their basic task of delivering electricity.
Here’s how bad it is: A survey of non-Tesla chargers conducted in the Bay Area in 2022 found that 27% of chargers were not working.
This would be a good time to point out that Tesla superchargers have a much better performance record than other types of chargers, and that Tesla is opening “select” supercharger stations to other types of vehicles.
Also, efforts are being made to increase the reliability of public chargers; the U.S. Department of Transportation just awarded $149 million in grants for the repair and replacement of broken chargers. The biggest share, $64 million, is going to California.
In other words, hope is on the horizon.
For now, though, we seem to be relying on a haphazard honor system.
Here’s how the honor system played out during a recent stop in Los Alamos, a sweet little town in Santa Barbara County along the 101. It’s a dot-on-the-map kind of place — population 1,275 — but it’s been discovered thanks to its tasting rooms, boutique hotels and gourmet restaurants, including one with a Michelin star. It’s also blessed with a non-Tesla, fast-charging station — a rarity for a town of that size — that’s made it popular with EV drivers.
When I pulled in, hoping to get a quick charge, I was immediately warned off by a stern-faced man wagging a finger at me. Turns out, one charger was out of service, the other spaces were filled — some with cars whose drivers were nowhere to be seen, meaning who knows when they might be back. Only one driver appeared close to being finished, and the self-appointed line monitor was first up for that one, with another person waiting behind him.
I moved on to Buellton, where I wound up charging at a tiny, hidden-away station near an alley behind City Hall.
There’s got to be a better way to keep order. Heck, restaurants do a better job keeping order by just asking customers to scrawl their names on a waiting list.
How hard would it be to use some orange cones to designate a “waiting lane”? That way drivers pulling in could get an immediate read on how long they might have to wait. No finger wagging required.
Also, limit drivers to an 80% charge, and require them to drive away within, say, five minutes after the charger has stopped. That might be hard to enforce, but peer pressure can be a powerful incentive.
The point is, somebody has to step up and make charging stations more driver-friendly, and the obvious choice is whoever is in charge of the chargers.
Otherwise, there will be even more disgruntled EV drivers out there — like the guy who waited three hours in Kettleman City — who will scare off folks who are contemplating an EV purchase.
For the sake of the environment, we don’t want that to happen. So get this fixed, please.
If you are thinking of buying an EV, don’t let the scare stories stop you. Just avoid Kettleman City — and Los Alamos — on busy weekends. And be sure to pack some reading material."

Details: On Sunday morning, the Donbas News media outlet, citing eyewitnesses, reported that a market in the Tekstylnyk microdistrict in occupied Donetsk came under fire, with ""a large amount of dead and wounded"".
Denis Pushilin, the leader of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed 27 dead and 25 wounded as a result of the attack. (DPR is a self-proclaimed and non-recognised republic in Donetsk Oblast – ed.)
Dmitry Polyansky, First Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, said that the strike on Donetsk would be one of the central topics of the UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine requested by Russia on Monday, RIA Novosti reports.
The Russian Foreign Ministry accused Ukraine of a ""terrorist act"" and stated that this allegedly proves that the aggressor must achieve all the goals of the so-called ""special operation"" against the Ukrainian state, because ""security threats and acts of terrorism should not emanate from the territory of Ukraine"".
However, on Sunday evening, the Joint Press Centre of the Ukrainian Defence Forces on the Tavriia front stated that it was not involved in the matter.
Quote from the Defence Forces on the Tavriia front: ""Russians are spreading information about a strike on the market in Donetsk. We responsibly declare that the forces subordinate to the Tavriia Operational Strategic Group did not engage in combat operations with weapons of destruction in this case. Donetsk is Ukraine! Russia will have to take responsibility for the lives of Ukrainians that have been taken.""

Bihus.Info journalists are renowned for their important investigations into the Ukrainian government and politicians.
A video surfaced online on Jan. 16 allegedly showing Bihus.Info staff using drugs. Bihus claimed that there had been illegal surveillance lasting about a year, with edited fragments from different times.
In another case, unknown individuals attempted to break into journalist Yuriy Nikolov’s Kyiv apartment.

“Do we really want to have two presidential candidates in their 80s?” she rhetorically asked a crowd of New Hampshire voters in Derry. “No!” a few people in the crowd yelled back.
A woman in the crowd interrupted Haley’s references to age, critical of Haley’s snipes. The former South Carolina governor quickly clarified that mental competency is important at any age, suggesting again that mental competency tests in Congress should be considered.
“This is the most pressured job in the country. You can’t make a mistake,” she said.
Haley then leaned into former President Trump’s recent gaffe, where he appeared to mix her up with former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in reference to security issues on Jan. 6, suggesting that it was Haley who was in charge instead of Pelosi.
“Trump goes on and on, multiple times, saying that I prevented the security on January 6 at the Capitol. I wasn’t even anywhere near the Capitol. I wasn’t in office,” Haley said. “The reality is that he was confused. He was confused the same way that Joe Biden was going to start World War II. He was confused the same way that he said he ran against President Obama.”
In the past few days, the former U.N. ambassador has dropped any reluctance toward criticizing her former boss on the campaign trail. She is now leaning into attacking Trump, especially on his age and his spending in office. She also referenced a recent poll showing that 70 percent of Americans don’t want a rematch between Biden and Trump, a poll that she has mentioned at least twice in the past few days.
Haley has cut Trump’s lead in half in New Hampshire in the past two months. Trump is currently leading Granite State polls by 11 points, according to The Hill and Decision Desk HQ’s polling average. Two months ago, that lead was 22 points.

The team at Ray C. Anderson Foundation saw the green spaces that run alongside the highway as the perfect opportunity for their sustainability project. Now, a solar farm with 2,600 panels soak up the sun on a stretch of highway in West Georgia.
The five-acre site is a triangular area of land where an exit ramp meets the road. It used to be a barren, unused space. The team has transformed it to provide enough power for more than 100 homes.
“What it is today is a field of clean, green energy,” said Allie Kelly, the Ray’s Foundation executive director. Not only does the space harness solar energy, but the panels stand higher than normal ones so wildflowers can also grow.
Alongside the project, the foundation teamed up with mapping company, ESRI, to develop a free digital tool to help transportation departments recognize potential solar projects in their areas. It works by identifying land where solar would work best, allowing planners to make a virtual mock-up of the solar installation so that it doesn’t block a view or sit too close to the highway.
Eddie Lukemire of the Maryland Department of Transportation’s office of environment commented on the usefulness of the tool, as not all land can host solar panels. The land might be rocky or filled with trees, but the digital tool can virtually map the potential for solar panels.
“When you look at 3,000 rows in an Excel spreadsheet, and then you uncross your eyes, those are just numbers. I don’t have a column that says, are there trees on that parcel,” said Lukemire of the 3,000 parcels of land in his state. “It’s really cool to be able to put that jumble of numbers into a program and have an output that is understandable by me, you, anyone.”
The Ray estimates there are more than 52,000 acres of empty roadside in the U.S. that could hold solar panels which could generate enough energy to power 12 million electric vehicles.
By turning our attention to renewable energy sources, we are choosing to rely on accessible energy that has very little impact on the world around us, reducing the emission of harmful gases which contribute to Earth’s rising temperatures.

Now it's a place of holy rat-rimony.,"Lloyd Lee,Associated Press","January 21, 2024 at 3:20 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/chicagos-rat-hole-mysteriously-filled-062029461.html,"A rat-shaped hole in a Chicago neighborhood recently went viral and instantly won some fans.
The hole was reportedly filled on Friday but was quickly restored.
People have left behind tributes while others got engaged and married at the hole.
The viral Chicago ""rat hole"" was quickly restored after it was mysteriously filled in, proving how the imprint has instantly become a beloved attraction — and a site for love?
In a city infamous for its gangster past, some culprit filled in a Northside Chicago neighborhood landmark affectionately called by residents the ""rat hole.""
The indentation in the pavement on West Roscoe Street resembles the outline of a rat — claws, tail, and all. It was reported Friday on social media that the ""rat hole"" had been filled with a substance resembling white plaster.
Transportation and Streets and Sanitation officials told the Chicago Tribune that the city was not behind the fill-in — which one day may find itself part of Windy City tongue-in-cheek lore like Al Capone's vault and a coil of bronze faux feces on a fountain intended to remind people to pick up their dog poop.
Neighbors gathered Friday afternoon using a brush and water to scrub the shallow hole in the sidewalk clean, restoring it to its ""ratfull"" place among the city's iconic — if not strange — attractions.
Tributes — including plastic flowers, a prayer candle, small toys, a pack of cigarettes, and coins — adorn what may have been the final resting place of ""Lil Stucky"" or ""Chimley,"" names given by some in the neighborhood to the creature that once lay there spreadeagled.
""Overall, people just appreciate that our wonderful block is getting attention — even if it's to look at a rat hole,"" Jeff VanDam told the Chicago Sun-Times for a story Friday. ""It's a small, quirky feature of a neighborhood where we get used to it, we care about it, and we want to protect it.""
The hole also appears to have become a site to mark relationship milestones.
One post on X from Saturday appeared to show a proposal, while another video showed a ""gay wedding"" in front of the hole, an X user said.
Chicago resident Winslow Dumaine learned about the ""rat hole"" from a friend and posted a photo earlier this month of it on X, formerly known as Twitter. The photo drew more than 5 million views, he said.
People living nearby said the imprint had been there for nearly two decades and was made by a squirrel, according to Dumaine.
""I think at the end of the day, the rat hole is a silly thing, but the thing that made it so viral was the fact that thousands and thousands of people were in on a big, sweet, heartfelt joke,"" Dumaine told the Tribune.
""Chicago prides itself on all of the things that make Chicago difficult, and no matter how much Chicago hates rats, they love rats,"" he added. ""It's a part of our culture.""

“I will continue to support every single member within the House Democratic Caucus family, from the most progressive to the most centrist, to the most moderate,” Congressman Jeffries told The Root. “That’s been my position and perspective even prior to serving in this role in the previous four years as chair of the House Democratic Caucus.”
It’s unclear if Jeffries plans to join these members on the trail and provide additional protection as they face millions in outside spending and the fight of their political lives.

Multiple explosions, fires reported overnight in Russian rear due to alleged long-range Ukrainian strikes
Explosions reported in occupied Sevastopol
Air Force: Russian air defense sufficient on front lines, in Crimea but not on Russian soil
Budanov: North Korea currently Russia's largest arms supplier
Military: Russia's capture of Kharkiv Oblast village a 'temporary phenomenon'
Russian attacks on Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia oblasts kill one, injure two over past day
Explosions and large fires were reported in several Russian cities overnight on Jan. 21, in a possible coordinated effort by Ukraine to strike key targets deep inside Russian territory.
The terminal of Russia's Novatek natural gas company caught fire in the port of Ust-Luga in Leningrad Oblast near St. Petersburg, Governor Alexander Drozdenko reported on Telegram.
The terminal halted operations after an alleged Ukrainian drone attack caused a large fire at the fuel plant, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 21.
The explosions in Ust-Luga were a result of a planned operation by the Security Service of Ukraine, according to an unnamed source in the agency cited by Ukrainska Pravda.
Local authorities reported no casualties, but other Russian media sources suggested that 150 people had to be evacuated.
Novatek is the largest independent natural gas producer in Russia. The fire was still ongoing as of 9 a.m. local time on Jan. 21, according to Drozdenko.
Other attacks were reported overnight on Jan. 21 in Russia's Tula, Smolensk, and Oryol oblasts, targeting infrastructure critical to the Russian military.
The Russian Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of launching multiple drone attacks and claimed that one drone was shot down over Tula, four over Smolensk, and one over Oryol.
Citing its sources in Ukraine's special services, news outlet Suspilne reported that the Shcheglovskiy Val plant in Tula, where Pantsir mobile air defense systems for the Russian military are produced, was one of the targets.
The Smolensk Aviation Plant, which produces Kh-59 cruise missiles used to frequently target Ukraine, was hit in the overnight attack, Hromadske reported, citing its source in Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR). The plant was previously hit in October and November 2023.
Smolensk Oblast Governor Vasily Anokhin denied that there were casualties or property damage during the drone attack.
A source from HUR confirmed to Ukrainska Pravda that the agency was also behind the attacks in Oryol and Tula.
Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, multiple attacks have been reported across Russian territory. Ukraine does not always claim responsibility for these attacks.
An overnight drone attack that hit an oil depot near St. Petersburg was carried out by Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR), Ukrainska Pravda reported on Jan. 18, citing a source in intelligence.
Local media and Russian occupation authorities reported several explosions in the port city of Sevastopol in occupied Crimea on Jan. 21.
Around three explosions were heard in the early afternoon, according to a local correspondent for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Crimean service.
Soon after, the head of the Russian-installed city authorities Mikhail Rozvozhaev reported that an airborne target had been shot down over the sea nearby.
Later in the day, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that two Ukrainian missiles had been shot down over the western coast of Crimea.
As the full-scale war has developed, military facilities and infrastructure in Russian-occupied Crimea have become increasingly vulnerable to long-range Ukrainian drone and missile strikes.
Most spectacularly, separate Ukrainian strikes in September 2023, reportedly with British-made Storm Shadow missiles, destroyed a Russian landing ship, submarine, and the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol.

Russia has a sufficient capacity for air defense on Ukraine's front lines and in occupied Crimea but not on Russian soil, Yurii Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force, said in an interview for Focus media outlet published on Jan. 20.
Ihnat's statement follows reports that Ukrainian drones attacked oil depots in Klintsy in Russia's Bryansk region and the Russian city of St. Petersburg on Jan. 18-19.
Klintsy lies around 80 kilometers from the border with Ukraine's Chernihiv Oblast, while Saint Petersburg is over 1,000 kilometers away.
""Russian air defense is thinning out. They filled the front line and Crimea with it (air defense). But you see that the Russian territory is not so filled with air defense equipment,"" Ihnat told Focus's journalist.
""Moscow, Saint Petersburg, (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin's bunkers will be more or less protected, but Ukrainian-made drones reach Moscow, St. Petersburg, and oil depots in other cities. This is a very good sign.""
Reports of drone attacks against military targets on Russian soil have increased in recent months. Kyiv usually doesn't officially comment on such strikes.

When asked by Focus what weaponry can help change the course of the war, Ihnat said that Ukraine can't effectively fight with an army ""that surpasses us in terms of numbers and technology.""
""We need a tool from our partners to end the war. And this tool is high-tech long-range weapons,"" Ihnat explained, saying that in addition to U.S.-supplied ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles delivered by the U.K., Ukraine needs Taurus missiles that Germany has so far refused to provide.
""We need to have (large) numbers to beat the enemy more effectively. Then it will be a serious help to our brothers from the Ground Forces,"" he added.
""We understand the conditions in which they are currently fighting at the front… Artillery is firing, aviation is firing, drones are flying overhead to destroy you. This is extremely hard work… Therefore, air support is critical, in particular, for long-range strikes to reduce the supply of enemy ammunition and logistics.""
According to the Russian military design bureau ""Stratim,"" as cited by Russian state-controlled media TASS on Jan. 18, Russia is developing a cheaper version of the Iranian-designed Shahed drone called the ""Hawk.""
Russian forces have extensively used Shahed-type kamikaze drones to attack Ukraine's cities and critical infrastructure.
At the same time, Ukraine plans to produce one million drones in 2024, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Dec. 19 last year, recognizing the importance of this weaponry on Ukrainian battlefields.

Russia's capture of Krokhmalne, a village in Kharkiv Oblast, is a “temporary phenomenon,” the Ukrainian Ground Forces Command spokesperson Volodymyr Fityo said, as quoted by Hromadske on Jan. 21.
In its morning summary, Russia’s Defense wrote that the village had been taken over by Russian forces. Fityo noted that Ukrainian troops had been moved to prepared reserve positions to hold the defense and prevent Russia from advancing further.
""We simply don't report on the repulse of 100-200 meters, and for Russian propagandists, any victory must be presented to explain why they lost 7,055 soldiers at the front in the Khortytsia zone of responsibility in January alone,"" Fityo said during the live televised broadcast.
He added that the front lines shift daily and that the loss of the small village, which had a pre-war population of 45, is a “temporary phenomenon.”
Ukraine managed to repel 21 attacks near Synkivka, Petropavlivka, Kharkiv Oblast, and Stelmakhivka, Luhansk Oblast, the Armed Forces General Staff reported earlier in the day. 80 clashes took place on Jan. 20.

North Korea is currently Russia's largest arms supplier, Ukrainian military intelligence (HUR) chief Kyrylo Budanov told the Financial Times in an interview published on Jan. 21.
North Korea has transferred ""a significant amount"" of artillery ammunition to Russia, according to Budanov.
""This allowed Russia to breathe a little,” Budanov said. “Without (North Korea's) help, the situation would have been catastrophic.”
Russia has been struggling to keep up with the production of its weapons and munitions at a rate that matches its usage on the front. As a result, they have been compelled to seek military assistance from countries such as North Korea.
""This has always been considered beneath them, it’s an indignity,"" Budanov said.
Moscow and Pyongyang have significantly increased their military ties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
A spokesperson for Ukraine’s military intelligence previously said on Jan. 15. that North Korea has supplied Russia with around one million rounds of ammunition, mainly 122 mm and 152 mm artillery shells.
As reported both by Kyiv and Washington, Russia also used North Korean ballistic missiles against Ukraine for the first time in strikes against Kharkiv on Jan. 2.
North Korea's state news agency, KCNA, also reported on Jan. 21 that Russian dictator Vladimir Putin is planning to visit North Korea in the near future.

Russian attacks killed one civilian and injured two over Jan. 20-21 in Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, local authorities reported.
Russian forces attacked the city of Kurakhove with Grad rockets, killing one civilian and injuring another, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on Jan. 21.
Residential buildings were targeted in the attack, according to Filashkin. A 31-year-old man was killed at the site of the rocket impact.
A kindergarten and several houses were also damaged by the strikes, causing a fire to break out. While the fire has been extinguished, authorities are assessing its aftermath, the governor said.
Kurakhove is located around 12 kilometers west of the front line, running near the destroyed town of Mariinka, which Russian forces took the last streets of in December.
It was home to over 18,000 people prior to the full-scale invasion.
Filashkin urged all residents remaining in Donetsk Oblast to evacuate the region.
Russian forces struck Zaporizhzhia Oblast 95 times across 16 localities over a 24-hour period, regional governor Yurii Malashko reported on Jan. 21.
A 71-year-old resident was injured in Huliaipole due to artillery shelling. There were two reports of the destruction of residential buildings.
Russia continues to occupy a large portion of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, including all of its coastline. The region suffers frequent attacks.
Russia conducted seven multiple rocket launcher attacks on Mala Tokmachka and Robotyne, as well as 26 drone strikes on Huliaipole, Orikhiv, Zaliznychne, Luhivske, Novoandriivka, Robotyne, Levadne and Poltavka.
Sixty-two artillery shells hit Novodarivka, Novoandriivka, Mala Tokmachka, Charivne, Shcherbaky, Huliaipole, Lobkove, Kamianske, Piatykhatky and other settlements.
Southern Kherson Oblast suffered 76 shelling attacks on Jan. 20, according to Oleksandr Prokudin, head of the regional military administration.
On the same day, Russia shelled Sumy Oblast 37 times. In both cases, no civilian casualties were reported.

Allegheny County dispatchers say emergency crews were called to Hampshire Avenue and Rutherford Avenue at 3:32 p.m. on Saturday.
Pittsburgh Police say the incident began after a 17-year-old boy, identified in court documents as Marcus Glass, stole a tip jar from the taco stand at Las Palmas on the 1600 block of Broadway Avenue. He ran out of the store and police say he began shooting at employees who chased after him. The employees then shot back. No one was injured during the exchange.
After responding to calls about the gunfire, police set up a perimeter in the area and officers began looking for Glass.
Glass was caught after a K9 found him in the 1600 block of Belasco Avenue. He was taken to a hospital to be medically cleared.
Once released from the hospital, police interviewed Glass. According to a criminal complaint, he told police his friend recently died, and “he was looking for a way to make money quickly.” He admitted to robbing Las Palmas of a tip jar.
A gun was also found by a second K9 while police were searching for Glass. The complaint states the gun was reported stolen out of Swissvale in April.
Glass is facing over a dozen charges, including aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person and robbery. He is being held at the Allegheny County Jail without bond awaiting a preliminary hearing.

D5HDWI68Z6_PEAVGZOX5O1DARN,Trump goes all in on attacking Nikki Haley ahead of New Hampshire primary,"Gregory Krieg, CNN","January 21, 2024 at 11:29 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-goes-attacking-nikki-haley-032835928.html,"Former President Donald Trump spent the three-year anniversary of his White House departure trying to sweep away the few remaining Republican obstacles to his third consecutive nomination, hammering former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and warning supporters against complacency two days ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
“We need big margins,” Trump said at a rally in Manchester, “because we have to send real unity as a message.”
But over more than 90 minutes, Trump delivered the vengeful message that he has made the focus of his campaign, moaning about the lost 2020 race; defending the January 6, 2021, rioters; pushing again for the Supreme Court to declare him and all presidents immune from prosecution; mocking President Joe Biden; and, with the most gusto, lashing out at Haley, his former UN ambassador and the candidate closest to him in Granite State primary polls.
Even before he spoke, Trump’s campaign beamed its message on a big screen above the stage with rotating slides attacking Haley over supposed ties to “Democrats, Wall Street & Globalists” and her positions on Social Security and other hot-button issues.
When he took the microphone, Trump kept up the barrage.
“Nikki Haley is using radical Democrat money to run the radical Democratic campaign operation she’s running,” Trump said, referencing his rival’s appeal to some centrist and anti-Trump political groups and donors. “What the hell kind of Republican candidate is that?”
After running through a laundry list of policy criticisms, most pointedly Haley’s campaign pledge to raise the retirement age for younger people, delaying their access to Social Security payments, Trump jabbed back at Haley over her suggestion that he is too old to be president again – which followed an incident in which Trump confused her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“The concern I have is — I’m not saying anything derogatory, but when you’re dealing with the pressures of a presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do it,” Haley, 52, said earlier Saturday of Trump, 77, at a rally in Keene, New Hampshire.
Trump shot back at the rally, claiming he’s recently taken a “cognitive test,” which he “aced,” before promising to “let you know when I go bad.”
After finishing third in Iowa behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Haley’s campaign is on the line in New Hampshire. A CNN/UNH poll released Sunday found that 50% of likely GOP primary voters there support Trump, compared to 39% who back Haley. Haley has the support of a majority — 58% — of registered undeclared voters, but the former president is backed by 67% of registered Republicans.
Granite State voting rules — and their potential to help Haley — were a frequent target for Trump on Saturday night, as the former president groused over the potential for those who don’t consider themselves Republicans or typically vote for the GOP to cast ballots in its presidential primary.
But he added a false flourish to that case, telling the audience that Democrats, too, can take part on the Republican contest. They cannot.
“Registered Democrats cannot vote in the Republican primary, and registered Republicans cannot vote in the Democratic primary,” New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan told CNN earlier this week after Trump leveled a similar charge.
Trump also looked ahead to the next major clash in the race: South Carolina. It’s Haley’s home state, where she was twice elected governor, but Trump leads there in the polls and among influential GOP leaders – a handful of whom showed up in New Hampshire.
“We could be in our home state, but we chose to come up to New Hampshire for a reason,” Rep. Russell Fry said. Gov. Henry McMaster invoked the Spice Girls – really – to tell voters “what we want, what we really really want” is Trump.
“We’re going to be there in three weeks, so you know what I’m doing,” Trump said of his guests, adding, “I’m kissing ass.”
Again, it was Trump’s desires that took centerstage.
He repeated his contention that all US presidents, beginning with him, should have immunity from prosecution. This relatively new line of argument comes as Trump awaits a ruling from a federal appeals court regarding his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. In the meantime, he’s argued presidents should never face legal consequences for their actions.
The court hearing the claim has expressed skepticism, but Trump is continuing to make his case in public. On Saturday night, he invoked President Harry Truman’s use of the nuclear bomb in Japan in 1945 as a case study.
“Look at Harry Truman,” Trump said. “He wouldn’t have done, if you think Hiroshima, not exactly a nice act but it did end the Second World War probably, right? Nagasaki. He wouldn’t be doing that; he said, ‘I don’t want to do that because my opponents will indict me.’”
The US dropped atomic bombs on both cities toward the end of the war, killing at least 150,000 in Hiroshima alone, according to some estimates. Though the morality of the decision has been debated, no one sought to bring legal charges against Truman.
Trump had much less to say about DeSantis. He even made a point of noting how little he’d spoken about the Florida governor (before proceeding to mock his height at the prompting of a supporter). He had more kind words, though, for Hungary’s right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban.
“It’s nice to have a strong man running your country,” Trump said of the strongman, happily reciting the nice things that Orban has recently said about him.

DCQG7HL5EC_MHH8A9RI4O1NVHO,Alabama plans to carry out first nitrogen gas execution. How will it work and what are the risks?,KIM CHANDLER,"January 21, 2024 at 11:11 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/alabama-plans-carry-first-nitrogen-141112226.html,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama is preparing to use a new method of execution: nitrogen gas.
Kenneth Eugene Smith, who survived the state’s previous attempt to put him to death by lethal injection in 2022, is scheduled to be put to death Thursday by nitrogen hypoxia. If carried out, it would the first new method of execution since lethal injection was introduced in 1982.
The state maintains that nitrogen gas will cause unconsciousness quickly but critics have likened the never-used method of execution to human experimentation.
WHAT IS NITROGEN HYPOXIA?
Nitrogen hypoxia execution would cause death by forcing the inmate to breathe pure nitrogen, depriving him or her of the oxygen needed to maintain bodily functions.
HAS IT EVER BEEN USED?
No state has used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out a death sentence. In 2018, Alabama became the third state — along with Oklahoma and Mississippi — to authorize the use of nitrogen gas to execute prisoners.
Some states are looking for new ways to execute inmates because the drugs used in lethal injections, the most common execution method in the United States, are increasingly difficult to find.
HOW IS IT SUPPOSED TO WORK?
Nitrogen, a colorless, odorless gas, makes up 78% of the air inhaled by humans and is harmless when breathed with proper levels of oxygen.
The theory behind nitrogen hypoxia is that changing the composition of the air to 100% nitrogen will cause Smith to lose consciousness and then die from lack of oxygen.
Much of what is recorded in medical journals about death from nitrogen exposure comes from industrial accidents — where nitrogen leaks or mix-ups have killed workers — and suicide attempts.
WHAT DOES THE STATE PLAN TO DO?
After Smith is strapped to the gurney in the execution chamber, the state said in a court filing that it will place a “NIOSH-approved Type-C full facepiece supplied air respirator” — a type of mask typically used in industrial settings to deliver life-preserving oxygen — over Smith's face.
The warden will then read the death warrant and ask Smith if he has any last words before activating “the nitrogen hypoxia system” from another room. The nitrogen gas will be administered for at least 15 minutes or “five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer,” according to the state protocol.
The state heavily redacted sections of the protocol related to the storage and testing of the gas system.
The Alabama attorney general’s office told a federal judge that the nitrogen gas will “cause unconsciousness within seconds, and cause death within minutes.""
WHAT ARE THE CRITICISMS?
Smith's attorneys say the state is seeking to make him the “test subject” for a novel execution method.
They have argued that the mask the state plans to use is not air tight and oxygen seeping in could subject him to a prolonged execution, possibly leaving him in a vegetative state instead of killing him. A doctor testified on behalf of Smith that the low-oxygen environment could cause nausea, leaving Smith to choke to death on his own vomit.
Experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council earlier this month cautioned that, in their view, the execution method would violate the prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.
The American Veterinary Medical Association wrote in 2020 euthanasia guidelines that nitrogen hypoxia can be an acceptable method of euthanasia under certain conditions for pigs but not for other mammals because it creates an “anoxic environment that is distressing for some species.”
IS THIS THE SAME AS THE GAS CHAMBER?
Not exactly. Some states previously used hydrogen cyanide gas, a lethal gas, for executions. The last prisoner to be executed in a U.S. gas chamber was Walter LaGrand, the second of two German brothers sentenced to death for killing a bank manager in 1982 in southern Arizona. It took LaGrand 18 minutes to die in 1999.
WHO IS THE INMATE?
Smith was one of two men convicted of the 1988 murder-for-hire of a preacher’s wife. Prosecutors said Smith and the other man were each paid $1,000 to kill Elizabeth Sennett on behalf of her husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect insurance money.
Alabama attempted to execute Smith in 2022 by lethal injection. He was strapped to the gurney in the execution chamber being prepared for lethal injection, but the state called off the lethal injection when execution team members had difficulty connecting the second of two required intravenous lines to Smith's veins. Smith was strapped to the gurney for nearly four hours, according to his lawyers, as he waited to see if the execution would go forward.
ARE THERE LEGAL CHALLENGES?
The question of whether the execution can proceed will end up before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments Friday in Smith’s request to block the execution. After the court rules, either side could appeal.
Smith has argued that the state’s proposed procedures violate the ban on cruel and unusual punishment. He has also argued that Alabama violated his due process rights by scheduling the execution when he has pending appeals and that the face mask will interfere with is ability to pray.
In a separate case, Smith is arguing it would violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment for the state to make a second attempt to execute him after he already survived one execution attempt. Lawyers for Smith on Friday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the execution to consider that question.
WHAT IS POTENTIALLY AT STAKE?
Lethal injection is the most commonly used execution method in the United States, but death penalty states have struggled at times to obtain the needed drugs or encountered other problems in connecting intravenous lines.
If the Alabama execution goes forward, other states may seek to start to using nitrogen gas.
If the execution is blocked by the court or botched, it could halt or slow the pursuit of nitrogen gas as an alternative execution method."

Utah Rep. John Curtis, Bishop Oscar Solis of the Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City, the Respect for Life ministry, the Knights of Columbus, Latter-day Saints for Life and other notable figures and organizations sponsored and attended the event.
Curtis commented on the importance of compassion within the pro-life movement in Utah and said he appreciates the renewed focus on empowering every human life. He added lifting and caring for mothers helps communities and saves lives.
At the event, keynote speaker and director of development at Pro-Life Utah, Merrilee Boyack, said, “I cannot even begin to tell you what it feels like to see these little babies born and think, ‘I contributed a little bit to that little baby being alive today.’ It is the best investment you will ever make.”

Since Roe v. Wade was enacted in 1973, 180,000 abortions have been performed in Utah, Boyack said. Over 4,800 abortions have been performed in the state since it was overturned in June 2022.
“I encounter so many people who think we don’t have elective abortion in the state of Utah at all. How wrong,” Boyack said. “Approximately nine babies are killed in the state of Utah day after relentless day.”
She continued, “It is time to stop the slaughter. It is time to stop being nice and accepting this issue. It is time for outrage.”
Boyack compared the number of lives lost to abortion to the number of U.S. soldiers lost in the Vietnam War, saying, “We’ve lost triple that number in the state of Utah to elective abortion, and yet people in Utah continue to accept it, and baby deaths continue.”
Boyack encouraged Utahns to “draw a line in the sand” and commit to the pro-life cause in the form of time or donations.
Boyack has been involved with Pro-Life Utah for the past three years. She told the Deseret News a common question she is asked as a pro-life advocate is, “What do pro-life organizations do for women?”
Pro-Life Utah parked their mobile clinic on the steps of the Capitol during the event. Before the program began, workers welcomed the public to sit inside the vehicle and learn about resources they offer “abortion-minded mothers,” as Boyack described.
LeeAnn Evans works in this van three days a week. She explained the van is typically parked outside abortion clinics and workers greet women entering the buildings, offering free ultrasounds, free pregnancy tests and counseling options.
They also hand out care packages that include a pair of socks, candy, chapstick and various brochures with information ranging from the Life Grant Program to “post-abortion healing.”
She said the mothers she’s met in the mobile clinic come from all walks of life. She continued, “A lot of time, they feel like their only option is to abort because of their circumstances, but in reality with all of the resources that are in our community, there are lots of options.”
“We’re not there to judge; we’re there to support.” Evans said. “We are there to just meet them in the circumstance they’re in and find out how we can support them and help them”
Pro-Life Utah President Mary Taylor said her work “takes compassion.” She told the Deseret News, “I had one volunteer drive 5 1/2 hours in a blizzard and 5 1/2 back to get a woman away from a boyfriend who was trying to force her to have an abortion.”
She added, “They’ll literally do anything to help our clients, and it’s just so heart-warming to watch.”
Taylor told the Deseret News when she was a young adult, “the pro-life community was justifiably angry,” but their anger “was not beneficial to the movement.” Since then, the movement has become more about uplifting the moms, she said.
She added, when Utah held its first March for Life eight years ago, 35 people attended. This year attendance estimates ranged from 1,200 to 1,500 people.
In 2023, Pro-Life Utah “saved 70 babies,” Boyack said, adding that since the beginning of 2024 they’ve “saved 14 babies.”
Many women seeking an abortion feel as though they have no other option, Boyack said. “When they come (to the mobile clinic), we tell them the things we’d help them with: financial support, baby supplies, safe housing, etc.”
Of the women intercepted by workers in mobile clinics or online, 82% “change their minds and choose life,” she said.
In 2020, the Utah Legislature passed a trigger bill making elective abortion illegal, with some exceptions, if Roe v. Wade was overturned. On Friday, June 24, 2022, Roe was overturned, but by Monday morning, the law was enjoined by District Court Judge Andrew Stone.
Currently, Utah bans abortion after 18 weeks.
At the federal level, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, recently announced “four bills to protect the unborn,” including the Abortion is not Health Care Act, the Protecting Life in Health Savings Accounts, the Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act and the Guaranteeing the Unborn Access to Respect and Dignity (GUARD) Act, as the Deseret News previously reported."
DEN6CKS8E2_RGBQOAC85R2P1GU,Bronson Battersby: Speculation over toddler's death 'unhelpful',"Tim Iredale - Political editor, Yorkshire & Lincolnshire","January 21, 2024 at 4:12 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/bronson-battersby-speculation-over-toddlers-071225864.html,"Lincolnshire's police and crime commissioner has described speculation surrounding the deaths of a toddler and his father in Skegness as ""unhelpful"".
Bronson Battersby, two, was found alone in the house in Skegness with 60-year-old Kenneth Battersby on 9 January.
It is believed Bronson starved to death after his dad had a heart attack.
Speaking to BBC Politics North, Marc Jones said the fact that the matter was being investigated did not mean any ""wrongdoing"" had taken place.
A ""rapid review"" into the involvement of social services is being carried out by Lincolnshire County Council and the police watchdog is investigating whether there were ""missed opportunities"" to check on Bronson and his father.
Mr Jones said his heart went out to anyone who had been affected by what happened.
""It is just an incredibly difficult story to hear,"" he said.
However, Mr Jones said: ""It's absolutely right that such tragic incidents are looked into thoroughly, and we are going to see that with the review and the investigation.
""The fact that they have happened does not mean any wrongdoing.
""We need to bear that in mind - so speculation is unhelpful at this point.""
Asked about whether he believed there were missed opportunities, he replied: ""What I do know is all the agencies involved take child protection exceedingly seriously, in this case and in every other case.
""We can't speculate on whether anything went wrong that could have been prevented.""
He said police would follow the law with regard to entering a property and there were certain circumstances where this would be appropriate.
However, he added: ""As we've heard [in this case] entry was gained by a social worker using a key.
""I don't think we should speculate about whether forced entry would have been the right route.""
On the subject of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation, he said: ""You would hope they would treat this with some expediency, but nevertheless they need to do a proper and thorough job.""
Previously, Lincolnshire Police's Deputy Chief Constable Julia Debenham said: ""What I would like to make clear is that we did respond to information supplied to us, but for reasons of transparency we have also referred the case to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.
""This is standard procedure and they will be undertaking their own independent investigation.
""Any speculation around the exact actions of any agencies involved at this stage is premature, though I do understand why our communities want answers as soon as possible.""
27 December: A social worker ""has contact"" with Mr Battersby and a home visit is arranged.
2 January: The social worker arrives at the property but there is no response at the door. She tries to locate Bronson at other addresses and, unable to find him, speaks to her manager and the police.
4 January: A second attempt at a home visit is made. Again, there is no response. The social worker informs police.
9 January: A third attempt is made and the social worker alerts Mr Battersby's landlady. Entry is gained and the bodies of both father and son are found.
15 January: Lincolnshire County Council notifies the national Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel of a serious incident that meets the criteria for rapid review.
17 January: Lincolnshire County Council confirms a review is under way and Lincolnshire Police says it has referred itself to the IOPC.

Zacharie Scott, 22, was caught with the illicit packaged prawns inside his two suitcases at the Queens airport on Friday morning, the feds said.
Scott, an American citizen living in Guyana, had just departed his American Airlines flight from the South American country when Customs and Border Protection officers selected him for a secondary search while he went through screening, court documents say.
When examining Scott’s luggage, officers found loose clothing and multiple packages of frozen jumbo shrimp wrapped in sealed plastic.
Upon cutting open the packaged shrimp, they discovered bricks of white powder that was later determined to be cocaine, say court papers. The haul of cocaine weighed 18.45 kilograms in all, say the feds.
When Department of Homeland Security officers arrested Scott, he allegedly stated that “he knew it was wrong to bring the packages into the United States.”
Scott told investigators he was supposed to get a payment of about $5,000 to $6,000 for the illegal task, court documents show.
Federal Magistrate Judge Joseph A. Marutollo ordered Scott held at his Saturday arraignment pending a bail hearing on Tuesday.
Scott’s attorney, James Darrow, declined to comment on the case.
If convicted, Scott faces up to 20 years in prison."
DMDVMV5FCM_RA6DAD9KMF4R8JV,A Miccosukee-led plan could finally end new oil drilling efforts in the Everglades,Alex Harris,"January 21, 2024 at 7:00 PM·10 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/miccosukee-led-plan-could-finally-100000227.html,"Miles below Big Cypress National Preserve, land of elegant cypress trees festooned with air plants, there is oil.
Not a ton of it, but enough to spark a small domestic drilling industry that continues today, decades after the land became the nation’s first national preserve and the federal government bought it all up.
The environmental effects of the drilling, ranging from thousands of gallons of spilled oil to threats to the local water supply, have long prompted buyout offers from the state and federal government.
But a new plan, hatched by the Miccosukee tribe and a nonprofit, might mean the end of future prospecting and drilling on hundreds of thousands of acres of land within Big Cypress, a crucial part of Florida’s Everglades.
The deal, which has been quietly in the works for nearly two years, includes an inked agreement with the politically powerful family that holds all the rights to hunt for oil and gas within the preserve’s boundaries. And this time, the Miccosukee feel like success is in sight.
The Collier family, descendants of the land baron who owned much of the real estate in the county that bears his name, has agreed to sell much of its vast holdings of mineral rights within the preserve to the federal government — for the right price.
That would protect nearly 420,000 acres of land the Miccosukees consider sacred. It’s what sustained and protected the tribe when soldiers chased and harassed them a century ago. It’s where many make their living, and it’s the final resting place for some tribal members, including modern ones, in traditional burials.
“A lot of these areas have cultural significance for us. And the more we see that damaged, the more it hurts the tribe culturally,” said Talbert Cypress, chairman of the Miccosukee tribe. “It’s important for us to keep it as intact as possible.”
Oil drilling in the Everglades has been a longstanding problem in Florida. The Sunshine State’s oil rush kicked off in the 1940s and peaked in the 1970s, right as the federal government was snapping up acres for Big Cypress National Preserve.
The Collier family owned much of the land, and when they sold it off to the National Park Service, they kept the rights to the oil and gas resources underground. Over the last half-century, they’ve leased the right to prospect and drill to several companies, including two within the last few years.
In 2020, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered the state to buy a 20,000-acre swath of land near Broward County where the owners had recently won the right to drill for oil over state objection. “This will permanently save the land from oil production,” DeSantis said at the time.
But efforts to buy out swaths of Big Cypress, which covers far more land, have been less successful.
In the 2000s, then-Gov. Jeb Bush tried to orchestrate a buyout to protect the Everglades, right around the time the Colliers started seismic testing to look for new potential wells.
The Colliers signed an agreement with the federal government in 2002 to sell their mineral rights for $120 million and suspend plans for 26 new exploratory wells, but it fell through over bickering over the price.
Previous quotes for those mineral rights have been all over the map; various government estimates ranged from $5 million to $235 million.
This time, though, the deal makers are determined to land on a number to which everyone can agree.
Enter David Houghton, director of WildLandscapes International. His nonprofit is helping the Miccosukee tribe seal the deal with the Colliers, as well as the federal government.
“We’re the real estate geeks in the back making it all happen,” he said.
His team worked for years with the Colliers to hammer out an agreement that now covers 420,000 acres, including the spots where Texas-based Burnett Oil has been hunting for new wells. Crucially, that involved arriving at a price everyone was happy with.
The Colliers are officially on the hook to sell those mineral rights if the price is above or at the number they agreed to. If it ends up lower, they still have the option to sell but aren’t obligated to.
Houghton wouldn’t share the exact figure the Colliers agreed to but said they negotiated the deal when oil was going for far less per barrel than it is now, so he has high hopes.
The next step is for an accounting firm to complete an appraisal, which is due in April. The firm, hired by WildLandscapes and approved by the Department of the Interior, will hand over its estimate for what the mineral rights are worth. If it’s within the range the Colliers agreed to, then it’s up to the federal government to scrape together the cash and complete the sale.
Houghton said he’s hopeful that, if they get that far, Florida legislators’ bipartisan skill at finding federal money for Everglades restoration will apply here, too.
“Right now we know that there is significant interest by the Florida delegation to pursue this. We would not be running around spending huge amounts of money trying to figure this out if there wasn’t interest,” he said.
And there are promising signs the agreement could pan out. This summer, the Collier family sold more than 11,000 acres of its land near Everglades City, including the mineral rights, to the state for just under $30 million. Houghton said this was the first time the Colliers have outright sold their mineral rights.
But for all the big ideals of this plan, what it won’t do is stop the relatively small oil industry that still operates within the boundaries of the preserve. Within Big Cypress alone there are 11 producing wells — five at the Raccoon Point drill site to the east and six at the Bear Island site to the north.
Cypress, of the Miccosukee tribe, said the plan is to come back for those mineral rights next, in future phases of the buyout plan.
That could put at least a decade between the end of current drill operations in the preserve, but Cypress said the tribe is willing to be patient.
“It’s obvious that this area has been changed forever. And that happens a lot out here with the Everglades,” he said. “We talk about restoration, and trying to get back to things that are where they were. And that almost may not be possible. But you know, we got to do the best we can to get as close to it as we can.”
According to state data, those two sites within Big Cypress have collectively produced about 36 million barrels of oil since they were first drilled in the 1970s. That’s peanuts compared to any of the gushers in Louisiana and Texas, the heart of the nation’s oil industry, and it’s even dwarfed by the state’s other oil resources in the Panhandle, where about three-fourths of the state’s oil is produced.
In 2022, Texas produced nearly two billion barrels of oil — double what all of Florida has produced in nearly a century.
The industry directly employs about 700 people statewide, according to a 2022 report on oil drilling in Big Cypress. Oil drilling brought in about $25 million to Florida’s economy in 2020.
As that report put it: “Broadly speaking, oil production does not matter to the Florida economy, and Florida does not matter to oil production.”
Beyond the economics, scientists around the globe have made excruciatingly clear that the world needs to stop burning fossil fuels as fast as possible to avert the worst impacts of climate change. Those effects, like hotter days, rising tides and more powerful hurricanes, are already disproportionately harming Floridians.
So why keep drilling?
“To me, the juice is not worth the squeeze,” said Edward Glab, director of the global energy forum at Florida International University and a former longtime executive at ExxonMobil.
“If you look at a risk-reward equation, you’d have to come to the conclusion that we have no business drilling for oil in the Everglades, anywhere. We don’t need it. It’s not the sort of oil that’s really in demand or commands a premium price, but I think more importantly there’s always that risk of contamination and some sort of spill,” he said.
Glab said the oil found in the area is thicker and more expensive to process. That might be why big companies, like Exxon, have sold off the wells they originally drilled to smaller companies, he added.
Breitburn, the Texas-based company that runs the wells within Big Cypress, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Evan Hjerpe, executive director of the nonprofit Conservation Economics Institute and author of the report on oil drilling within the preserve, said the math must still make sense for companies like Breitburn, or they would have exited the business long ago. Some companies like to hold on to low-performing wells like these so they have extra resources to ramp up production when oil prices skyrocket.
Plus, he said, properly closing a well can be an expensive and tedious process.
“A lot of the times it’s cheaper to keep a marginal well in production than it is to do a full closure and reclamation of the well,” Hjerpe said.
And yet, companies are still asking the state for permission to drill more than two miles into the earth for their own shot at black gold.
Texas-based Burnett Oil won the right to start exploring for oil in Big Cypress in 2017. That meant big, heavy trucks grinding through trees, sinking into the mud and pounding the ground in search of the telltale vibration signal that there’s oil down below.
But in 2022, Burnett withdrew its request for a permit. Environmental groups called it a victory.
And now, seven years later, the scars of those prospecting efforts remain. A report from the National Park Conservation Association found that more than 500 of the preserve’s namesake cypress trees were felled, and in their absence, invasive species like Gulf Coast spikebrush and old-world climbing fern took over. In other places, the tracks left in the soft mud by 33-ton vehicles are still visible.
“We’re talking about zero regeneration in those damaged areas,” said Melissa Abdo, author of the report and Sun Coast regional director for NPCA.
According to Burnett’s permit, they were supposed to restore the area after they finished looking for oil by replanting 1,500 cypress trees. So far, the NPCA report found, it hasn’t replanted any.
That’s why Abdo said she supports a permanent end to oil exploration and drilling in the preserve through the Miccosukee-led buyout.
“Florida is heavily reliant on our environment for our economy. If we’re looking forward, it just doesn’t really make economic sense to permit one company’s private economic gain to be had at the cost of all the environmental restoration gains we’ve made or all those eco-tourism dollars Florida relies upon,” she said.
“Why risk all of our environmental progress in Everglades restoration for what is, in effect, a few drops of oil?”

DMPG7M5YSA_LR4EYA1RBHOY1DV,Tens of thousands expected to protest against Germany's far-right,DPA,"January 21, 2024 at 9:11 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/tens-thousands-expected-protest-against-121135734.html,"Following a day full of mass protests, tens of thousands of people are again expected to take to Germany's streets on Sunday to rally against the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and its anti-immigrant stance.
Police in Munich are expecting up to 25,000 participants while organizers of a rally in Cologne put the number of estimated demonstrators at some 10,000. Further protests are expected in several German cities, including Cottbus, Dresden and Chemnitz in the east.
But the largest protest is likely to be in the capital Berlin, where an alliance of different organizations has called on people to gather in front of the Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, from 4 pm (1500 GMT).
While police are only expecting 1,000 participants, past demonstrations have far exceeded initial estimates and Berlin is home to a very active protest scene.
Germany has been swept by protests for over a week following the release of an investigative report which revealed that AfD members had attended a meeting of far-right extremists in November.
At the meeting in Potsdam outside Berlin, participants discussed plans to repatriate asylum seekers and migrants deemed not assimilated enough, even those with German passports.
The report by investigative outlet Correctiv published on January 10 has caused an uproar in Germany, where there is mounting dread among mainstream political parties about the surge in public support for the AfD.
The party is riding high in the polls of three former East German states that hold regional elections later this year.
At the Potsdam meeting, far-right extremists discussed topics like ""remigration,"" a term frequently used in far-right circles as a euphemism for the expulsion of immigrants and minorities.
Anti-AfD demonstrations have already drawn huge numbers of people. At least 300,000 people joined protests on Saturday, according to counts by the police and organizers, with roughly 35,000 people attending rallies in Frankfurt and Hanover alone.
Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck has called the demonstrations as an encouraging sign for democracy.
""Democracy lives from the people who stand up for it,"" Habeck told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper.
Katrin Göring-Eckardt, a senior Green Party lawmaker from the eastern state of Thuringia, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday night that she was particularly pleased with the crowds in parts of the former East Germany, such as Leipzig, Erfurt and Dresden.
""Everywhere in the East, people are on the streets for the democracy we fought for in 1989,"" she wrote. ""Encouraging!""
Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, speaking at a conference of her Green Party on Sunday, said ""we must stand up for democracy with all our strength.""
She praised the growing protest against the far-right, especially in Germany's smaller and medium-sized cities.
""That is the strength of our country,"" said Baerbock."
DMWYZAE3T5_IZN7HYJQN31N2PG,Labour’s North Sea drilling ban ‘will bring forward rig closures’,Matt Oliver,"January 22, 2024 at 5:53 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/labour-north-sea-drilling-ban-185331135.html,"Labour’s plan to ban new oil and gas drilling is “economically senseless” and threatens to bring forward rig shutdowns by a decade, a major North Sea operator has warned.
Amjad Bseisu, chief executive of Enquest, said blocking new drilling licences would put jobs and investment at risk, while bringing forward shutdown costs for the taxpayer.
The company operates oil and gas platforms as well as the Sullom Voe terminal, where huge quantities of oil from the West of Shetland basin are processed.
Labour has vowed to block all new oil and gas developments if it comes to power, investing in renewable energy instead.
Mr Bseisu warned that if a ban on new licences is introduced, Enquest’s two large Magnus and Kraken platforms would become less economic and be put at risk of early closure.
The ban would not directly halt drilling at the two sites, which have licences already, but it would lead to reduced investment in the North Sea overall, forcing operators to accelerate decommissioning of rigs that are already operational.
In that scenario, Magnus would have to be decommissioned 10 years early in the mid-2020s. The date for Kraken, which is currently scheduled to shut down at some point between the late 2030s to the early 2040s, would likely move forward by five years.
That would hit the Treasury with extra costs earlier than expected, as oil companies receive big tax breaks for decommissioning.
Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Bseisu said: “If the Government [under Labour] said there’s no new field licences, it would be economically senseless.
“It will exacerbate the decline of the industry and actually exacerbate the costs to the taxpayer, because we will have to decommission everything sooner rather than later.
“You drill a well and the well declines. Without drilling another well to extract further production, decline rates will be exacerbated.
“And once you get to a certain level in a field, it becomes uneconomic and you have to go to decommissioning. I would assume, in many cases at least, a decade acceleration in field life.”
Mr Bseisu added: “We will still need oil and gas. And [if we ban new drilling], we will just end up importing more and destroying jobs in the UK, having a higher carbon footprint and a larger trade deficit.
“It should be evolution, not revolution – it’s called a transition.”
Labour has insisted that there are enough existing North Sea licences to ensure production continues and argued that granting more conflicts with Britain’s agreements to tackle climate change.
On Sunday a party spokesman said: “Labour is proud of our close working relationship with the oil and gas industry.
“Shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband and Labour leader Keir Starmer visited Aberdeen in November 2023 for discussions that were praised by leading industry figures.
“Unlike the Conservatives, whose own Energy Bill has been criticised by the industry and led to one of their MPs resigning, Labour has an industry-backed plan to deliver energy security for our country.”
It comes as the developer behind Cambo, Britain’s largest and most controversial remaining oil field, races to seek approval for the project before an autumn election.
Shell, the previous owner, cancelled its plans to develop Cambo in 2021 after a huge backlash from environmental groups and senior Labour politicians including Ed Miliband, who repeatedly attacked the company and the project.
But Ithaca Energy, which bought out Shell’s share, now says its final development plan will be lodged within months, with development to follow over 2024 to 2026.
Ithaca said the aim was to get the project fully approved before autumn 2024.
Cambo could produce about 170m barrels of oil equivalent during its 25-year operational life at half the carbon intensity of the average barrel of North Sea oil, according to the company.
It has also promised there will be no gas flaring at Cambo and that its rigs will be powered by electricity, rather than gas or diesel.
Israeli-owned Ithaca is also involved in the similarly controversial Rosebank development, which is led by Equinor.
As part of the UK’s target to reach net zero, Enquest is separately working on plans to use the Sullom Voe facility for sequestering carbon emissions under the ocean.
Under the scheme, which is awaiting a final investment decision, the company would receive liquified carbon dioxide from tanker ships at the terminal before pumping it through existing pipelines into depleted oil fields.
Enquest is also looking at potential green hydrogen or green ammonia production facilities, powered by nearby offshore wind farms in Shetland.
Green hydrogen has been touted as a potential replacement for natural gas while green ammonia could replace chemicals used to produce fertilisers or be made into fuel for container ships.
Mr Bseisu said final approval for the scheme would depend on the UK successfully striking agreements with other countries to allow CO2 shipments.
The company has already secured carbon storage licences from the North Sea Transition Authority.

See where","Mary Boyte, Mississippi Clarion Ledger","Updated January 22, 2024 at 7:29 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/elevated-black-carbon-levels-found-101156919.html,"Elevated levels of black carbon, a factor in cancer risk and climate change, were found in several towns and cities in Mississippi, according to a recently released study.
Jackson had the highest levels, with Hattiesburg coming in at a close second.
University of Mississippi faculty members Courtney Roper, assistant professor of environmental toxicology, and Hang Nguyen, postdoctoral research associate, conducted the study.
Their research concluded that black carbon concentrations in several Mississippi towns and cities exceed health recommendations set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Black carbon particles are small air pollutants and is better known as soot.
The particles are often visible and derive from common activities including driving a car and burning wood. They can also come from manufacturing processes and burning fossil fuels.
""A good example would be a construction vehicle or a large truck that emits black smoke,"" Roper said. ""A large part of that would be classified as soot. It is one of thousands of different parts of air pollution.""
Black carbon is released from incomplete combustion during those processes.
Here are the cities, in order from highest to lowest concentration, in which the black carbon levels were above the cancer risk threshold:
Jackson
Hattiesburg
Pascagoula
Gulfport
Hernando
Grenada
Black carbon is a potential cancer risk and can easily get into the respiratory system.
It is a component of PM 2.5 air pollution. Prolonged exposure to PM 2.5 air pollution is linked with approximately 4 million deaths around the globe yearly.
Mississippians are already at a high risk for cancer. It is the second leading cause of death in the state. One in every five deaths in Mississippi is attributed to cancer.
Mississippi on average reports 16,000 new cancer cases each year and an average of 6,500 people die of cancer yearly, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health.
Black carbon also contributes to climate change. Because black carbon is made of black particles, they absorb solar radiation, increasing heating in the atmosphere.
Nguyen and Roper wanted to investigate the potential human health effects of black carbon. There have been studies in the past on its potential health implications, but there is still a long way to go, Roper said.
Black carbon data is not regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency and most states do not consistently report black carbon concentrations.
Until more data and studies come out, it is difficult to tell just how extreme the levels are in Mississippi compared to other states.
However, Nguyen and Roper did find that even in Mississippi's rural areas, the black carbon levels matched large urban cities such as Atlanta. Those finding went against Nguyen and Roper's predictions that they would find significant drops in rural communities.
One reason for the elevated rural concentrations may be due to the mobile nature of air pollution.
""Even though air pollution may be emitted in an urban area, that doesn't preclude those pollutants from traveling to less populated areas,"" Roper said.
Roper said she hopes to conduct more studies in the near future to collect more data.
Nguyen and Roper's study uses data from 2013 and 2014. The delayed data is due to several factors. The filters that collect the particles for study come from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, which often has a six-year lag between collecting and releasing data.
Roper said it's hard to say for sure whether more recent samples will have the same black carbon levels as the old samples, but she expects they will still contain elevated concentrations.
So, what can the average Mississippian going about their day do with the information?
The main recommendation, Roper said, is to understand the risks of black carbon and other air pollutants, especially in vulnerable populations.
""Like anything in the environment, there are potential risks that something may be harmful,"" Roper said. ""On a day-in, day-out basis, there may not be a health risk, but there are times where air pollutants are elevated.""
If you are in a vulnerable population, Roper recommended checking the air quality index for your area before going out. Vulnerable populations include children, pregnant women, elderly adults and individuals with heart and lung diseases, according to the EPA.
The air quality index can easily be found on most smartphones. On an iPhone, the index is included on the Apple weather app under the 10 day forecast.

Scott Carter and Murray Evans, The Oklahoman","January 21, 2024 at 9:03 PM·13 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ryan-walterss-yearlong-feud-top-120351081.html,"After almost a year of growing tension, state Rep. Mark McBride and state schools Superintendent Ryan Walters surprised many at the Capitol last week when suddenly they were making nice.
Behind the scenes, however, the new 'friendship' between the pair was the culmination of a months-long effort by increasingly frustrated House leadership to rein in Walters, according to several people familiar with the efforts.
Those efforts included pointed, closed door meetings with Walters, House Speaker Charles McCall and other leaders, as well as a legislative subpoena to Walters for documents. The effort intensified as internal polls showed Walters' popularity in freefall, interviews with people familiar with the situation said.
It also helped that McBride, once considered Walters' arch nemesis, is a pragmatic politician and, at the same time, a player in leadership circles.
During a Jan. 10 House budget hearing, Walters and the Oklahoma State Department of Education submitted the agency's yearly budget request to lawmakers. Walters spent most of the two-hour session outlining the rationale behind his funding requests for a handful of new proposals. The discussion was cordial, and Walters freely answered questions from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.
After the meeting, McBride said he was pleased. “We met last week and I think the big reset was, 'Hey, this is appropriation and budget. I’m not (on the) policy committee,' "" McBride said. ""This is about the money going to things (in education). I don’t want to hear about certain things. Just come in here and tell me what we’re going to do to improve student outcomes and teachers. Those are my two big things – have been for a long time.""
The hearing marked a major change in a relationship that, throughout most of last year, was more akin to a well-publicized feud rather than a policy discussion between two state political leaders.
Late last year, the tension between Walters and McBride, R-Moore, had grown to the point that McBride and fellow lawmaker Rep. Rhonda Baker, R-Yukon, issued a legislative subpoena on Dec. 19, forcing Walters to supply information the pair said they'd sought since the fall.
That legislative subpoena, rare for a state lawmaker, was also signed by House Speaker McCall. In fact, it was the speaker's signature on the subpoena that raised the profile of the problem, McBride said.
“The speaker is very balanced. He’s not a guy that’s just going to put his name on a subpoena just because. It had reached that level of — what would you call it — level of frustration that I said, ‘What do we do?’ There are other things we could have done but, the thing is, they could have called me anything they wanted,"" McBride said. ""They call me all kinds of names. I never did anything but ask questions, and they didn’t want to answer them. The superintendent answered questions yesterday.""
That subpoena became the capstone to a yearlong range war that included:
A debate that grew so ugly during the 2023 spring legislative session that Walters was ""cut out of budget negotiations"" with members of the House leadership because of his behavior, a source told The Oklahoman. ""In the House, they were just exhausted by dealing with him,"" said a source, close to the situation who asked not to be identified. ""So they worked the budget without him.""
Radio silence in July. Two months after the legislative session ended, McBride asked the Education Department for information about a teacher bonus recruitment program that Walters had announced in the spring. McBride didn't receive the information until he subpoenaed Walters in December.
Extreme political rhetoric. Walters shared a posting on TikTok, which resulted in a bomb threat made against Ellen Ochoa Elementary School in Tulsa on Aug. 22. Officials said the threat appeared to be in retaliation for a librarian's public post. Walters shared the post to his superintendent account, with the caption stating, ""Woke ideology is real, and I am here to stop it."" After the incident, Democrats began calling for his impeachment.
Silence again in the fall. In late October, McBride said he’d been caught off guard by the resignation of the Education Department's program manager for grant development and compliance. That resignation was one of a series of resignations that occurred after Walters took over the department. At that time, McBride said, “I really don’t know what’s going on over there. Nobody does. There is some lack of transparency.”
Adviser's letter in October. The resignations came at the same time McBride made yet another request for information from the Education Department. After that request, McBride said he and Baker received a note from Walters’ top adviser, Matt Langston, that read, “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.”
Langston's letter was slipped under McBride’s office door at the Capitol after working hours. The letter sparked a furious response from the House's Republican leadership. Sources told The Oklahoman that McCall met with Walters ""and let him know that type of behavior was completely uncalled for and inappropriate.""
Langston, however, made the issue even more explosive when he responded to the subpoena, telling The Oklahoman that McBride had ""made up false narratives and has yet to show a serious effort to improve education in Oklahoma. All Oklahomans should question his political and ideological stances.”
Langston's statement, though, did not address the contents of the subpoena. Days after the incident, the House's second-in-command, Majority Leader Jon Echols, blistered Walters and Langston during an appearance on a televised talk show.
""Policy differences are fine, but what you saw was Chairman McBride, who is chairman of the Education committee, asking for information from the state Department of Education,"" the normally low-key Echols said during an appearance on KWTV. ""And while it's well known that Chairman McBride and Ryan Walters don't get along, what's not well known, and what is not well taken, is the childish antics of a Texan, by the way, who is the chief of staff of the state superintendent, flaunting the Open Records Act and speaking nonsense to an elected official.""
Langston's letter, Echols said, was beneath the dignity of the state Education Department. ""I was disgusted, never seen anything like it. It was embarrassing.""
After the incident, Walters sent a letter to some legislators defending his department’s handling of what normally are routine applications for millions of dollars of federal reimbursement funds. McBride, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Education, wasn’t included.
By December, the atmosphere between McBride and Walters had become so toxic that some legislative leaders were openly speaking about the possibility of impeachment.
Then in January, the tension between McBride and Walters quickly melted.
Speaking after last week's meeting, McBride said he was pleased by the change. “I think it went awesome. It went how I wanted it to go. It was calm. We got questions answered,"" he said. ""We all showed each other respect.""
""Like I said earlier, I think we need to reset. Am I going to agree with Ryan, or is he going to agree with me, on some of the other issues that are out there? No, probably not. But as far as funding for public education, that needs to be our focus in this room and before my committee.”
Walters quickly replied to McBride and Baker's legislative subpoena and later, spoke at a House budget hearing, praising McBride and acting as if the pair had a long history of working together.
""We’ve been able to work together. We’ve had a lot of great discussions,"" Walters said after the budget hearing. ""I appreciated his feedback in the hearing today.""
I appreciated his commentary. I think we’re going to have a great (legislative) session. I really look forward to working together to improve Oklahoma education. I think it was a great hearing today. They asked a lot of great questions and gave us a lot of great feedback.”
So what exactly happened?
According to several people closely familiar with the situation, the effort to rein Walters in began last spring. During 2023 budget negotiations, House leaders began sending Walters a series of messages, some quiet and some direct.
House leadership also barred Walters and Langston from the common education budget negotiations. House leaders let Walters know they had issues with his staff and how he was operating the Education Department, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.
Still, it took more than one message.
After Walters failed to provide information requested by McBride during the summer, the House again quietly put the education leader on notice. Then, in October, following Langston's letter, Walters was contacted directly by McCall.
That meeting, one of the people familiar with it said, wasn't pretty.
""He got chewed out pretty good,"" the person said. ""There was no room for doubt. Walters knew he and Langston had pissed a bunch of people off and that included the speaker and the majority floor leader.""
McBride said Walters' meeting with McCall sparked a subsequent conversation between Walters, himself and Baker.
""We had a very good conversation,"" McBride said. ""He asked me what I wanted in the committee hearing, and I shared with him that I just wanted to hear the budget. My job isn’t this other stuff. My job is to fund education. It changed the tone. It was kind of a reset. He and I are not going to change our opinions. I’m still going to push back on things, but hopefully we can do this in a different manner and be adults and not childish name-calling.”While McCall's signature on the Walters subpoena was unexpected, it was Echols' appearance on television that resonated with Walters and other lawmakers. Echols, who normally works quietly within the GOP caucus, is not known for his temper or his public statements. After Langston's letter, Echols was absolutely furious, and his rare public demonstration of anger got Walters' attention.
Other facts came into play, too.
While the complaints and public expressions of frustration raised the tension between Walters and the House, they weren't the only thing that forced Walters to change his attitude. A series of polls, taken late in the year, showed that Walters' numbers are weak.
At least three different polls — one conducted by the governor's office, one by the House and one by the Senate — each showed Walters about 20 points down from his previous high.
Before the polls, many state lawmakers believed Walters had control of a large, loud group of supporters and numbers that made him all but invincible. This imagined strength prevented most lawmakers from questioning Walters' decisions and pushing back against Walters' extreme rhetoric.
""The numbers were really bad,"" one of the people familiar with them said. ""They showed Walters really underwater and showed that people were tired of 'career politicians.' The polls showed Walters that voters think he is just a extremist trying to score political points. The polls showed him weak. When the caucus saw those numbers, they realized that Walters wasn't bulletproof after all.""
After word of the polls got around, those polls and the House leadership's public anger at Walters, the person said, showed the rank and file that the state schools superintendent ""was no longer the golden boy.""
""Nothing is secret around politics,"" McBride said. ""He (Walters) would have surely heard about what his polling numbers (are). I’ve heard of five polls that are out there. They’re not public polls, but individuals I’ve talked to, four, I’ve seen two and talked with people that knew about the other two. They were not favorable.""
Still, problems with Walters continued, McBride said, and Walters left the House with no choice but to issue a subpoena.
""That’s a rare move, but it was the only move that we had,"" McBride said. ""I went to the speaker and said, ‘Hey, I can’t get information. Anything I get is sarcasm from a staffer and we need answers.’ I think that was the changing point, the subpoena. I know he reached out to the speaker. He he turned over the stuff in a very timely manner and the childish behavior stopped.""
""I don’t think Ryan was involved in that. If he was, I would be disappointed.”
Since then, Walters' relationship with House leadership has improved, but with the legislative session set to begin in about three weeks, Walters, one of the people familiar with the situation told The Oklahoman, ""will need all the help he can get.""
""Few people want to deal with him,"" the person said. ""They will listen if he can be reasonable, but if he gets out on a limb again, he'll fall.""
For McBride and other House members, even with the thaw, there are still questions that Walters — and only Walters — needs to answer.
“We still have lots of questions. As a matter of fact, somewhere around here, we’ve got a stack of questions that we’re working on sending over there that I didn’t want asked during the meeting,"" McBride said. ""I tried to keep it to appropriations and budget. I didn’t hear the word ‘woke.’ The Democrats were behaved.""
I know there were a lot of people angry about the press release he did (the other day, about not working with three nonprofit education service groups). I had some members come to me and I said, ‘We’re not going down (that road). I just read that thing and we’re just not going there.’”
Langston, who is Walters' de facto chief adviser, did not attend when Walters presented the proposed Education Department budget to House members. McBride said that was a good thing.
“If we want to have a good relationship going forward, he (Langston) probably doesn’t need to come over to the building,"" McBride said. ""That would help things a lot.”The Oklahoman asked a spokesman for Walters for an opportunity to speak with the superintendent after another recent legislative meeting, seeking Walters' perspective on how his relationship with the Legislature has changed. The spokesman declined to make Walters available for an interview. In addition, neither McCall nor his spokesman could be reached for comment.And McBride? Right now, he's just waiting and trying to help write a budget.
""We’ve got a job to do. He has a job to do. We want to stay focused on good policy and the budget. I did not have a lot of problems with his budget. Are we going to implement his whole budget? Well, I don’t know,"" the lawmaker said. ""That will be a negotiation. But as far as a leash? I still have my views on education and a lot of what my problem with him has been the rule of law. There are some things that you can do and some things you can’t. He pushes the envelope. I think that will be a place where him and I disagree, but hopefully, we can disagree in a different manner going forward.”

DQCT0WAGTG_KRNQOYJTZ5KKW52,5 Costco Furniture Items That Are A Waste of Money,Laura Bogart,"January 21, 2024 at 9:00 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-costco-furniture-items-waste-000032775.html,"A Costco membership is often a valuable resource for finding good deals on some of our favorite products. At Costco, we can fill our freezers and pantries, find dishware to serve our meals on, and even purchase a table to seat our guests. However, every store will have its share of less-than-popular items with consumers–and Costco is no exception. While Costco is known for having affordable items in its furniture showroom, some shoppers and critics question whether their pricing is truly competitive with big box furniture stores, or if the pieces offer enough quality to be worth the investment. There’s no reason we can’t find worthy furniture or home décor at Costco, but there are a few items we may want to reconsider.

While many of the beds listed on Costco’s website received high customer marks, the Ashland Upholstered Bed fell into the middle, only averaging a 3.3 out of five in customer reviews. Several reviewers cited the need to purchase additional parts that didn’t come with the initial purchase as a major deterrent. Another customer mentioned receiving their delivery with missing nuts and washers. One shopper lamented, “When we opened the box, we noticed the bed was very cheaply made with the kind of iron frame mattress stores sometimes give you for free as a temporary structure.”
Though the Harstine Leather Sofa has received relatively good reviews on the Costco website, writer Maurie Backman suggests that, with a little price shopping, we might find a higher-end sofa for a better cost. In a piece published through The Motley Fool, Backman encourages readers to consider going with better-known brands for big-ticket purchases: “Have you heard of the brand in question? If not, you may be taking a risk, even though the item seems to have good reviews on Costco’s site.”
Backman shares that a quick search of “leather couches” on the website of furniture retailer Raymour & Flanigan yields a more luxurious option for a similar price. In fact, the Raymour & Flanigan site includes a number of sleeper sofas priced under $1,000.
The notion of a sofa going viral over TikTok may seem odd–but it’s a very real phenomenon that occurred in the fall of 2023, when a TikTok user recorded a woman who was playfully “selling” her husband on this $1,299.99 convertible sofa. The New York Post shares that the video earned roughly 34.1 million views and over two million likes, sparking interest in the sofa. However, some customers were quick to try and derail the hype train, detailing their experiences with guests who were so uncomfortable on the sofa that they had to change seats. TikTok users also mentioned that tracks on the sofa broke easily.
According to House Digest’s list of the worst-reviewed items in Costco’s home section, this freezer may operate well enough, but it often arrives to customers with dents. One reviewer on the Costco website mentioned that “it was also a nightmare to level-you can only adjust the front, the back ‘legs’ are just tiny little wheels, so I never got it very stable.” Another customer lamented the lack of shelf space, saying that even common items like a turkey or even bags of Costco chicken won’t fit inside.
Priced at $1,099.99, this pair of San Sebastian side chairs certainly should offer stability and elegance. However, some reviewers on the Costco website said that the chairs delivered to their homes lacked the polish and elegance of the chairs in the photos. Other customers cited issues with the chairs wobbling, or even breaking.

“Nikki Haley, I know well. Sadly, she’s made an unholy alliance with the RHINOS, the never-Trumpers … the globalists, the radical left communists,” Trump said, slamming the former U.N. ambassador while he was surrounded by roughly 5,000 supporters who stood outside in 14-degree weather to see him.
In recent days, Trump has been hurling insults at Haley, who has been steadily closing the gap in New Hampshire. In the past two months, she cut Trump’s lead in the state by half. Trump has an 11 percent lead in the Granite State, according to The Hill and Decision Desk HQ’s polling average. Two months ago, he had a 22-point lead.
“Nikki Haley is using radical Democrat money to fund the radical Democrat campaign operation that she’s running,” Trump told supporters during the Saturday rally.
In an effort to especially irk Haley, Trump invited several politicians from her home state, including Gov. Henry McMaster (R), to join him on stage.
“Almost every politician from the state of South Carolina is endorsing me,” Trump said as a slight to Haley, who is a former governor of the state. South Carolina is also next major contest after New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary.
In addition to the Palmetto State politicians on stage, Trump also secured the endorsement of her home state’s senator, Tim Scott (R-S.C.), on Friday. Haley nominated Scott to the Senate when she was governor and lobbied for his endorsement when he dropped out of the 2024 GOP presidential race.
These attacks haven’t been one-sided. Haley has dropped her reluctance to criticize her former boss and has ramped up attacks on the former president in recent days.
“The reality is who lost the House for us? Who lost the Senate? Who lost the White House? Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump,” Haley said Thursday.
Tuesday’s primary is a critical moment for both Haley and Trump. If Haley can pull off a win — or a close second-place finish — in the Granite State, it could threaten Trump’s front-runner status for the GOP presidential nomination.

DXC3BQ6Q9E_4Y12U1FPUUDIBPG,Here's Why We're Not At All Concerned With Prophecy International Holdings' (ASX:PRO) Cash Burn Situation,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 8:36 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-were-not-concerned-233627283.html,"Just because a business does not make any money, does not mean that the stock will go down. For example, biotech and mining exploration companies often lose money for years before finding success with a new treatment or mineral discovery. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?
Given this risk, we thought we'd take a look at whether Prophecy International Holdings (ASX:PRO) shareholders should be worried about its cash burn. For the purpose of this article, we'll define cash burn as the amount of cash the company is spending each year to fund its growth (also called its negative free cash flow). First, we'll determine its cash runway by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves.
See our latest analysis for Prophecy International Holdings
A cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. As at June 2023, Prophecy International Holdings had cash of AU$12m and no debt. Importantly, its cash burn was AU$1.4m over the trailing twelve months. That means it had a cash runway of about 8.6 years as of June 2023. Even though this is but one measure of the company's cash burn, the thought of such a long cash runway warms our bellies in a comforting way. You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.
Given that Prophecy International Holdings actually had positive free cash flow last year, before burning cash this year, we'll focus on its operating revenue to get a measure of the business trajectory. Although it's hardly brilliant growth, it's good to see the company grew revenue by 20% in the last year. Of course, we've only taken a quick look at the stock's growth metrics, here. This graph of historic earnings and revenue shows how Prophecy International Holdings is building its business over time.
Notwithstanding Prophecy International Holdings' revenue growth, it is still important to consider how it could raise more money, if it needs to. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. By comparing a company's annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).
Prophecy International Holdings has a market capitalisation of AU$42m and burnt through AU$1.4m last year, which is 3.2% of the company's market value. That's a low proportion, so we figure the company would be able to raise more cash to fund growth, with a little dilution, or even to simply borrow some money.
It may already be apparent to you that we're relatively comfortable with the way Prophecy International Holdings is burning through its cash. In particular, we think its cash runway stands out as evidence that the company is well on top of its spending. Its revenue growth wasn't quite as good, but was still rather encouraging! Taking all the factors in this report into account, we're not at all worried about its cash burn, as the business appears well capitalized to spend as needs be. On another note, we conducted an in-depth investigation of the company, and identified 2 warning signs for Prophecy International Holdings (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

But journalism proved not to be her vocation, said The Daily Telegraph. She moved into TV, hosting a pop show, and in 1970 she became the first female DJ on BBC Radio 1. In that role, she met some of the biggest stars of the era, from The Beatles (who became close friends) to Jimi Hendrix (""charming""), Mick Jagger (""very shrewd""), Marc Bolan (""hilarious"") and Jim Morrison (""a bit of an arse""); and she championed the music of a host of up-and-coming stars, including David Bowie. Meanwhile, her appearance morphed from unthreatening girl next door to ""rock chick"", with bleached hair and outsized shades. She'd entered a boys' club, and her determination to find a place in it would blaze a trail for Annie Mac, Jo Whiley, Zoe Ball, Sara Cox and many more.
Annie Nightingale was born in 1940 in Osterley, west London, and educated at Lady Eleanor Holles School. She claimed that music was her first word, and after gaining a diploma in journalism, she joined the Brighton and Hove Argus, where she wrote a music column. She moved into TV; then, inspired by the success of the pirate station Radio Caroline, she started to lobby the BBC for a radio job. Female DJs were banned on Radio 1, Nightingale: embraced rave culture but in 1970 she was offered a trial, which led to her own afternoon slot. ""It was quite unbelievably sexist,"" she recalled. ""They said a woman's voice wouldn't carry on the airwaves, that DJs were substitute husband material [for housewives], that I would alienate other women. I thought I'd last a year, I really did."" It would be 12 years before another woman – Janice Long – joined her. By then, Nightingale had moved to a Sunday evening show where she had more choice over the music she played. She had also become the first female presenter of TV's The Old Grey Whistle Test.
Having loved prog rock and punk, Nightingale didn't care for a lot of 1980s music, but she was reinvigorated by acid house, and with her children grown up, she embraced the rave scene, said The Times. In the 1990s, she hosted a late-night radio show for returning clubbers called Chill Out Zone; and she DJ'd at clubs and festivals all over the world. In 2001, she was named ""caner of the year"". In 2002, she was awarded the MBE (later upgraded to CBE). She was still working in her ninth decade, always playing new music, never oldies. Radio 1's longest-serving DJ, she appeared on air for the last time on 19 December, on a show dominated by drum and bass, and techno. ""Every week, in my job, is a new adventure. I enjoy it,"" she said last July. ""Most people get bored with pop music when they're a certain age. I go on being interested in where it's going, its twist and turns."""
DYJOIHN2OC_896MIPSO3W7VT6C,Man cited for stealing newspapers the day a story published on alleged sexual assault at a Colorado police chief’s home,"Sara Smart, CNN","January 21, 2024 at 9:51 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/man-cited-stealing-newspapers-day-005148495.html,"A Colorado man has been cited after allegedly stealing more than 200 newspapers in Ouray County after a story about a reported sexual assault at the local police chief’s house was published, according to area law enforcement and the Ouray County Plaindealer.
The newspapers were returned to the publisher hours after being stolen from nearly all the racks across town, the newspaper notes.
The incident took place after the weekly edition of the Ouray County Plaindealer was published this week. The paper featured a front-page story about the arrest of three individuals in connection to an alleged May 2023 sexual assault at the home of Ouray Police Chief Jeff Wood.
CNN has reached out to Chief Wood and the Ouray Police Department for comment.
On Thursday morning, more than 200 copies of that newspaper were missing from vending racks around the town, according to the Plaindealer.
“I’m sorry that most of you locals who like to get your papers from the racks were not able to put your quarters in and receive your weekly news today,” co-publisher Erin McIntyre said in a statement to readers Thursday afternoon.
“It’s pretty clear that someone didn’t want the community to read the news this week,” McIntyre added in the statement.
The newspaper said they worked to get another round of the newspaper printed and redistributed around town.
By Thursday evening, the newspaper announced an individual confessed to taking the papers and returned them all in garbage bags to the newspaper’s office.
The suspect is “not a member or relative of local law enforcement and not associated with the defendants in the recent reported sexual assault,”  according to the Ouray County Sheriff’s Office.
The newspaper reported Saturday the suspect was cited on suspicion of petty theft.
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation continues to investigate the sexual assault case.
According to a statement from the city of Ouray, “no personnel investigations are being conducted in the Ouray Police Department regarding this (sexual assault) case.”
“Thank you for the outpouring of support we have received to help pay us to reprint the paper, and to those who also support our message that you can’t kill the public’s right to know by stealing a few hundred newspapers,” publishers of the Plaindealer said in a Friday update.
The Plaindealer announced it received more than $2,000 in donations since the theft was announced.
Ouray County is in southwest Colorado, about 160 miles south of Aspen.

E1BKTINSAF_8ELIHJN02SL9J1P,"Old age isn't a modern phenomenon – many people lived long enough to grow old in the olden days, too","Sharon DeWitte, University of South Carolina","January 22, 2024 at 12:09 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/old-age-isnt-modern-phenomenon-121822430.html,"Every year I ask the college students in the course I teach about the 14th-century Black Death to imagine they are farmers or nuns or nobles in the Middle Ages. What would their lives have been like in the face of this terrifying disease that killed millions of people in just a few years?
Setting aside how they envision what it would be like to confront the plague, these undergrads often figure that during the medieval period they would already be considered middle-aged or elderly at the age of 20. Rather than being in the prime of life, they think they’d soon be decrepit and dead.
They’re reflecting a common misperception that long life spans in humans are very recent, and that no one in the past lived much beyond their 30s.
But that’s just not true. I am a bioarchaeologist, which means that I study human skeletons excavated from archaeological sites to understand what life was like in the past. I’m especially interested in demography – mortality (deaths), fertility (births) and migration – and how it was linked with health conditions and diseases such as the Black Death hundreds or thousands of years ago. There’s physical evidence that plenty of people in the past lived long lives – just as long as some people do today.
One of the first steps in research about demography in the past is to estimate how old people were when they died. Bioarchaeologists do this using information about how your bones and teeth change as you get older.
For example, I look for changes to joints in the pelvis that are common at older ages. Observations of these joints in people today whose ages we know allow us to estimate ages for people from archaeological sites with joints that look similar.
Another way to estimate age is to use a microscope to count the yearly additions of a mineralized tissue called cementum on teeth. It’s similar to counting a tree’s rings to see how many years it lived. Using approaches like these, many studies have documented the existence of people who lived long lives in the past.
For example, by examining skeletal remains, anthropologist Meggan Bullock and colleagues found that in the city of Cholula, Mexico, between 900 and 1531, most people who made it to adulthood lived past the age of 50.
And of course there are many examples from historical records of people who lived very long lives in the past. For example, the sixth-century Roman Emperor Justinian I reportedly died at the age of 83.
Analysis of the tooth development of an ancient anatomically modern Homo sapiens individual from Morocco suggests that our species has experienced long life spans for at least the past 160,000 years.
Given physical and historical evidence that many people did live long lives in the past, why does the misperception that everyone was dead by the age of 30 or 40 persist? It stems from confusion about the difference between individual life spans and life expectancy.
Life expectancy is the average number of years of life remaining for people of a particular age. For example, life expectancy at birth (age 0) is the average length of life for newborns. Life expectancy at age 25 is how much longer people live on average given they’ve survived to age 25.
In medieval England, life expectancy at birth for boys born to families that owned land was a mere 31.3 years. However, life expectancy at age 25 for landowners in medieval England was 25.7. This means that people in that era who celebrated their 25th birthday could expect to live until they were 50.7, on average – 25.7 more years. While 50 might not seem old by today’s standards, remember that this is an average, so many people would have lived much longer, into their 70s, 80s and even older.
Life expectancy is a population-level statistic that reflects the conditions and experiences of a huge variety of people with very different health conditions and behaviors, some who die at very young ages, some who live to be over 100 years old, and lots whose life spans fall somewhere in between. Life expectancy is not a promise (or a threat!) about the life span of any single person.
What some people don’t realize is that low life expectancy at birth for any population usually reflects very high rates of infant mortality. That’s a measure of deaths in the first year of life. Given that life expectancies reflect averages for a population, a high number of deaths at very young ages will skew calculations of life expectancy at birth toward younger ages. But typically, many people in those populations who make it past the vulnerable infant and early childhood years can expect to live relatively long lives.
Advances in modern sanitation – which reduce the spread of diarrheal diseases that are a major killer of infants – and vaccinations can greatly increase life expectancies.
Consider the effect of infant mortality on overall age patterns in two contemporary populations with dramatically different life expectancies at birth.
In Afghanistan, life expectancy at birth is low, at just over 53 years, and infant mortality is high, at almost 105 deaths for every 1,000 children born.
In Singapore, life expectancy at birth is much higher, at over 86 years, and infant mortality is very low – fewer than two infants die for every 1,000 who are born. In both countries, people do survive to very old ages. But in Afghanistan, because so many more people die at very young ages, proportionally fewer people survive to old age.
It’s incorrect to view long lives as a remarkable and unique characteristic of the “modern” era.
Knowing that people often did have long lives in the past might help you feel more connected with the past. For example, you can imagine multigenerational households and gatherings, with grandparents in Neolithic China or Medieval England bouncing their grandchildren on their knees and telling them stories about their own childhoods decades before. You might have more in common with people who lived long ago than you had realized.

E20JHWP51X_5IAMSF4CXB2WZF8,I’m a British student at a US college — these are the dumbest things Americans say,Andrew Court,"January 21, 2024 at 3:09 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/m-british-student-us-college-180928684.html,"These Americans may be college-educated, but it looks like they’d score an “F” on a general knowledge test.
A British man studying at an unidentified US university has revealed the three stupidest things he’s heard his classmates say, prompting disbelief about the seemingly poor state of education in America.
The English student, who has not disclosed his real name, took to TikTok to list the moronic remarks in a viral video that has been viewed more than 1.7 million views.
First, the TikTokker claimed he’d had an American peer say to him: “Considering you’re European, your English is really good.”
When the Brit tried to explain that it was because he hailed from England, the classmate appeared confused as to whether or not England was considered a part of Europe.
Additionally, it appears some US students seem to think Australia and England are the same place.
“A lot of Americans get the Australian and English accent mixed up,” the TikTokker stated, saying it was “fair enough” if they weren’t used to hearing either dialect.
But the Brit claimed that someone once asked him: “Oh, you’re from the UK? That’s like Australia, right?'”
“When I said ‘No, that’s like the UK,’ she said: ‘Are those two things [England and Australia] not the same thing?'” he recalled.
Thirdly, the TikTokker said he had once spent an hour trying to convince an American friend that English villages still exist and aren’t just a fictional concept that appear in the computer game “Minecraft.”
Thousands of viewers flocked to the comments section to shame the American students for their uneducated remarks.
“You have to remember college in the US is like elementary school in England,” one snarked.
“Going to the US from the UK is a real step down,” another savagely stated.
I’m convinced they learn nothing about the rest of the world at school,” a British viewer sassily said of US citizens."
EA32ET0U2R_WA6K40YNE9NE6OI,Latest EPA assessment shows almost no improvement in river and stream nitrogen pollution,BY MELINA WALLING and MICHAEL PHILLIS,"January 21, 2024 at 11:40 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/latest-epa-assessment-shows-almost-144002970.html,"ST. LOUIS (AP) — The nation’s rivers and streams remain stubbornly polluted with nutrients that contaminate drinking water and fuel a gigantic dead zone for aquatic life in the Gulf of Mexico, according to a recently released Environmental Protection Agency assessment.
It’s a difficult problem that's concentrated in agricultural regions that drain into the Mississippi River. More than half of the basin’s miles of rivers and streams were in poor condition for nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer that drains into waterways, the agency found. For decades, federal and state officials have struggled to control farm runoff, the biggest source of nutrient pollution that is not typically federally regulated.
It’s a problem only expected to get harder to control as climate change produces more intense storms that dump rain on the Midwest and South. Those heavy rains flood farm fields, pick up commercial fertilizers and carry them into nearby rivers.
“It’s really worrying that we are clearly not meeting the goals that we’ve set for ourselves,” said Olivia Dorothy, director of river restoration with the conservation group American Rivers.
The assessment is based on samples collected in 2018 and 2019 and it allows experts to compare river conditions from previous rounds of sampling, although different sampling sites were used. It takes years for the agency to compile the results and release the report, which is the most comprehensive assessment of the nation’s river and stream health. Phosphorus levels dipped slightly while nitrogen levels remained almost exactly the same.
About half of all river miles were found to be in poor condition for snails, worms, beetles and other bottom dwelling species that are an important indicator of biological health of the river. About a third were also rated as having poor conditions for fish based on species diversity.
“Controlling pollution is a big job. It is hard work,” said Tom Wall, director of watershed restoration, assessment and protection division at EPA. “Things are not getting worse, despite the tremendous pressures on our waterways. And we would like to see more progress.""
Water pollution from factories and industry is typically federally regulated. The Biden administration recently proposed toughening regulations on meat and poultry processing plants to reduce pollution, Wall said.
When nutrient pollution flows into the Gulf of Mexico, it spurs growth of bacteria that consume oxygen. That creates a so-called “dead zone,” a vast area where it’s difficult or impossible for marine animals to survive, fluctuating from about the size of Rhode Island to the size of New Jersey, according to Nancy Rabalais, professor of oceanography and wetland studies at Louisiana State University.
That affects the productivity of commercial fisheries and marine life in general, but nutrient pollution is also damaging upstream. Too much nitrate in drinking water can affect how blood carries oxygen, causing human health problems like headaches, nausea and abdominal cramps. It can especially affect infants, sometimes inducing “blue baby syndrome,” which causes the skin to take on a bluish hue.
The EPA established the hypoxia task force in the late 1990s to reduce nutrient pollution and shrink the dead zone, but it relies on voluntary efforts to reduce farm runoff and hasn't significantly reduced the dead zone.
Anne Schechinger, Midwest director with the Environmental Working Group, said new regulations are needed, not voluntary efforts. She said the Biden administration has done a lot to improve drinking water, but not enough to reduce agricultural runoff.
Methods to prevent runoff include building buffers between farmland and waterways, creating new wetlands to filter pollutants and applying less fertilizer.
It’s a politically fraught issue, especially in major Midwest farming states that significantly contribute to the problem. Many of those states cite their voluntary conservation programs as evidence they’re taking on the problem, yet the new EPA data shows little progress.
Minnesota is one of the few states that has a so-called “buffer law” that requires vegetation to be planted along rivers, streams and public drainage ditches. But because groundwater and surface water are closely connected in much of the Upper Midwest, nutrient pollution can end up leaching underground through farm fields and eventually bypass those buffers, ending up in streams anyway, said Gregory Klinger, who works for the Olmsted County, Minnesota soil and water conservation district.
There should also be a focus on preventing over-fertilizing – about 30% of farmers are still using more than the recommended amounts of fertilizer on their fields, said Brad Carlson, an extension educator with the University of Minnesota who communicates with farmers about nutrient pollution issues.
Martin Larsen, a farmer and conservation technician in southeast Minnesota, said he and other farmers are interested in practices that reduce their nutrient pollution. He’s broken up his typical corn and soybean rotation with oats and medium red clover, the latter a kind of plant that can increase nitrogen levels in the soil naturally. He's been able to get by with about half as much fertilizer for a corn crop that follows a clover planting as compared to a corn-corn rotation.
Growing oats and red clover as cover crops improves soil, too. But Larsen said it’s difficult for many farmers to plant them when they often rely on an immediate payback for anything they grow. Cover crops are planted on just 5.1% of harvested farmland, according to 2017 data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Larsen said since regulations are so unpopular, more should be done to incentivize better practices. For example, he said that could include companies shifting the makeup of feed they use for animals, giving farmers an opening to plant some crops that use less fertilizer. Or government programs that do more to subsidize things like cover crops.
He said that many farmers in his community acknowledge the need to do things differently. “But we also feel very trapped in the system,” he said.

See what they're like — from a sold-out 6-month luxury cruise to a cheaper $21,100 option.",Brittany Chang,"January 21, 2024 at 7:11 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/9-around-world-cruises-joined-101101879.html,"Nine new around-the-world cruises have already set sail in 2024.
These ships joined Royal Caribbean's nine-month Ultimate World Cruise at sea.
Oceania said its 2024 world cruise sold out in 30 minutes.
The Seven Seas just got a bit more crowded: Nine new world cruises have recently set sail, joining Royal Caribbean's ongoing Ultimate World Cruise in a quest to travel around the world in 2024.
TikTok has developed an obsession with Royal Caribbean's nine-month vacation. But it's not the only one of its kind — nor was it the most in-demand.
In 2021 and 2022, other operators also announced their global cruises, with one selling out 30 minutes after it was offered. Since the start of the new year, nine of these have already embarked. Take a look at which ones.
Oceania's 2024 world cruise was so hot that it sold out 30 minutes after reservations opened in March 2022, the premium cruise line said at the time.
After almost two years of waiting, these travelers finally set sail from Los Angeles on January 14. For the next 180 days, the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings subsidiary says the Insignia is set to sail to 96 ports in 34 countries.
The vessel is now on its way to Hawaii, the Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand, Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Canada, according to its world cruise itinerary. This includes 24 expected overnight stays in destinations like Yangon, Myanmar, and Reykjavik, Iceland.
Oceania's cabins started at $48,500 per person.
On January 6, the Seven Seas Mariner departed Miami on a roundtrip 132-night global expedition. Through May 17, the ship is set to stop at 66 ports in 31 countries — sailing to expected destinations in Central America, Hawaii, the Pacific Islands, New Zealand and Australia, Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Bermuda.
Fares started at $73,500 per person for Regent Seven Seas' basic suite. Too cheap? The most luxurious 2,000-square-foot accommodation had a $200,000-per-person price tag.
Like Oceania, these fares didn't stop travelers from flocking to the luxury cruise. The ship was fully reserved in less than three hours when bookings opened in July 2021, Regent Seven Seas said at the time.
Azamara's sold-out 2024 world cruise departed on January 5 from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Over the next 155 nights, the Azamara Onward plans to stop in 40 countries across Central and South America, the Pacific islands, New Zealand and Australia, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe before concluding in Barcelona.
There are 22 overnights scheduled throughout this world tour.
The private equity-owned cruise line's 2024 global adventure started at $39,000 per person for the windowless interior cabin. Travelers who prefer to cruise in luxury would've paid $157,000 per person for the highest-end suite.
Ultra-luxury Silversea's 2024 global vacation set sail on January 15 from San Francisco. Through May 26, the Silver Shadow is scheduled to see 65 ports in 14 countries.
Unlike most world cruise itineraries, this one is scheduled to spend most of its 132 nights traversing the Pacific Ocean, sailing to the Pacific Islands, New Zealand and Australia, Southeast and East Asia, Alaska, and Canada before returning to San Francisco.
Silversea's fares started at $66,000 per person for the least expensive vista suite, cheaper than Regent Seven Seas' cruise of the same length.
On January 4, the Island Princess embarked on its 111-day world cruise from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with a second pickup scheduled in Los Angeles on Thursday. From there, travelers are expected to get to see 51 destinations in 27 countries across Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Europe, and the Americas, according to the Carnival Corp brand.
Fares started at almost $21,100 per person.
Regret not going on Princess' world cruise? There's another chance: The cruise line's second 2024 global itinerary is sailing in late April.
It seems like every major cruise giant has an ultra-luxury brand. Carnival Corp's is Seabourn — and on January 11, the Seabourn Sojourn departed Los Angeles on a 145-day, 72-port, 28-country cruise.
The sailing is set to conclude in Piraeus, Greece, near Athens, on June 5. Along the way, the itinerary shows the Seabourn Sojourn traveling east to destinations like Hawaii, Australia, China, Japan, Sri Lanka, Egypt, and Jordan.
The Sojourn is scheduled for 20 overnights in destinations like Cairns, Australia, and Honolulu.
Fares started at $74,300 per person.
Luxury operator Cunard has two 2024 ""world voyage"" itineraries: 123 nights on the Queen Mary 2 and 107 nights on the Queen Victoria.
Queen Mary 2's four-month roundtrip New York City voyage departed on January 3, sailing east to 32 ports in the UK, Europe, Africa, Australia, Asia, and the Middle East, according to its itinerary.
Eight days later, the Queen Victoria also began its 3 ½-month roundtrip Southhampton, UK journey. According to the UK-based operator, the ocean liner is set to sail west to 29 ports in Bermuda, Aruba, Central and North America, the Pacific Islands, New Zealand and Australia, Asia, Africa, and Europe.
Cunard did not immediately respond to Business Insider's inquiry about its fares.
On January 3, Holland America Line's world cruise guests would've moved onto the Zuiderdam to spend the next 127 nights circumnavigating the globe, according to the operator's itinerary.
This roundtrip Fort Lauderdale, Florida cruise is scheduled for 46 ports in the Caribbean, Central and South America, the Pacific Islands, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.
Holland America did not immediately respond to Business Insider's inquiry about the itinerary's fares.

EC8K07LK8Q_1VT5JUVSPNI0ZGX,Scientists warn melting permafrost could unleash ancient ‘zombie viruses’,Andy Gregory,"January 23, 2024 at 5:49 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ancient-zombie-viruses-melting-permafrost-135956607.html,"Ancient “zombie viruses” frozen in melting Arctic permafrost could fuel a new pandemic if unleashed by climate change, scientists have warned.
Global heating is enabling increased human activity in the Earth’s northernmost reaches, as melting sea ice opens up shipping and industrial possibilities, including mining deep into the permafrost which covers a fifth of the northern hemisphere, mainly in Canada, Siberia and Alaska.
But scientists have reportedly started to plan an Arctic monitoring network to watch out for any early cases of a disease sparked by ancient viruses, also known as Methuselah microbes.
Ancient viruses have already been found in Siberian permafrost, including one sample which was 48,500 years old. A team led by geneticist Jean-Michel Claverie has revived several such viruses, capable of infecting only single-cell organisms.
But the scientists fear viruses capable of infecting humans likely also lurk in the permafrost. “We see the traces of many, many, many other viruses,” Professor Claverie told CNN in March, adding: “If the amoeba viruses are still alive, there is no reason why the other viruses will not be still alive, and capable of infecting their own hosts.”
As a result, Prof Claverie is among scientists working with the University of the Arctic network on plans to establish quarantine facilities and provide medical expertise that could pinpoint and attempt to treat any early cases without them leaving the region, according to The Observer.
“At the moment, analyses of pandemic threats focus on diseases that might emerge in southern regions and then spread north,” Prof Claverie, of Aix-Marseille University in France, told the paper. “By contrast, little attention has been given to an outbreak that might emerge in the far north and then travel south – and that is an oversight, I believe.
“There are viruses up there that have the potential to infect humans and start a new disease outbreak.” Among the genomic traces of human pathogens identified already by the team in Siberian permafrost are pox viruses and herpes viruses, he said.
Virologist Marion Koopmans agreed, telling the paper: “We don’t know what viruses are lying out there in the permafrost but I think there is a real risk that there might be one capable of triggering a disease outbreak – say of an ancient form of polio. We have to assume that something like this could happen.”
With forecasts suggesting the Arctic Sea will be ice-free as early as 2040 due to climate breakdown, it is the prospect of increased human activity in the Arctic, as opposed to melting permafrost, which most concerns Prof Claverie.
“Huge mining operations are being planned, and are going to drive vast holes into the deep permafrost to extract oil and ores,” he said. “Those operations will release vast amounts of pathogens that still thrive there. Miners will walk in and breathe the viruses. The effects could be calamitous.”
“Our immune systems may have never been in contact with some of those microbes, and that is another worry,” said Prof Claverie. “The scenario of an unknown virus once infecting a Neanderthal coming back at us, although unlikely, has become a real possibility.”
Prof Koopmans added: “If you look at the history of epidemic outbreaks, one of the key drivers has been change in land use. Nipah virus was spread by fruit bats who were driven from their habitats by humans. Similarly, monkeypox has been linked to the spread of urbanisation in Africa.
“And that is what we are about to witness in the Arctic: a complete change in land use, and that could be dangerous, as we have seen elsewhere.”"

However, I would be far more uncomfortable not writing it. As we celebrated Martin Luther King Jr. Day I was drawn back to his “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” written in 1963.
King closes the letter with: “Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.”
It’s been 61 years since he wrote this letter, an epistle of biblical quality and wisdom. This week a CBS poll showed between 72% and 82% of republicans asked, agreed with Trump’s claim that migrants are “poisoning the blood of our country.” The historical reference to the Nazi racial slur is unmistakable and frightening.
There are nice people on both sides of the Charlottesville white supremacy rally statement by then President Trump is a precursor of his present position. The Muslim ban Trump tried to impose at the outset of his presidency exemplifies his unspoken position on white supremacy.
As we draw closer to the 2024 election the racial rhetoric and the attempts to restrict voting are evidence that nationally, equality is on the ballot and totally at risk.
Early in King’s letter, he references the interconnectedness of all. “I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities … injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.” The wisdom of these words is profound. They are lost to those who would deny another the right to vote or the right to immigrate to our country.
This concept of interrelatedness reminded me of Thich Nhat Hanh whose primary belief was the interconnectedness of all. I remembered that King had nominated Hanh for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1967 and so checked to see when the two first met. Thich Nhat Hanh first wrote to King in June of 1965 seeking his help to bring peace to Viet Nam. Like King’s letter Hanh’s reads like a biblical epistle explaining the legitimacy of the Buddhist monks’ self-immolation. Distinguishing it from suicide Hanh writes: “The Vietnamese monk, by burning himself, say with all his strength [sic] and determination that he can endure the greatest of sufferings to protect his people….Their enemies are not man. They are intolerance, fanaticism, dictatorship, cupidity, hatred and discrimination which lie within the heart of man.” Again, the wisdom of these words is irrefutable.
People today resort to tribal behavior believing conspiracy theories that influence their decisions in choosing who leads our institutions; our country.
Even our religious institutions have failed to heed King’s words and fail to recognize Hanh’s interconnectedness. When King writes “An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality.” I could not help but think of the recent refusal of the Catholic Synod to allow women deacons. To characterize the restriction on the priesthood as anything but discrimination is without merit.
To call this a pivotal time is an understatement. We are at risk and must act at least in the confines of our own home, our own community. I urge you to read both letters as they are profound, and it seems unfathomable that they were written 60-plus years ago. To think that we have almost gone backwards and that we are far more polarized today may at first be discouraging but it may also be a wake-up call to action; to force us to do the right thing and stand up for decency, equality, and defend the dignity of all. King: “Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.”

EEU54VVO9R_2T05I1OH41GM6CM,17-year-old American-Palestinian fatally shot by Israel in the West Bank,Mark Moran,"January 22, 2024 at 6:00 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/17-old-american-palestinian-fatally-210022617.html,"Jan. 21 (UPI) -- An American-Palestinian teenager was shot dead by Israeli forces in the West Bank, the U.S. State Department has confirmed.
Tawfiq Hafiz Ajjaq, 17, was fatally shot by Israeli forces this evening near the town of Al-Mazraa Al-Sharqiya, east of the city of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian official news agency WAFA reported.
Ajjaq, a native of Louisiana, moved to the West Bank almost a year and a half ago to complete his high school education and had plans to return to New Orleans to study business in college, according to family members.
His family said that Ajjaq was shot while he was driving back from the mountains near their village, according to News Nation Now. He was shot by the Israeli military and succumbed to his injuries shortly after being transported to a nearby hospital.
""I woke up from a phone call saying that my cousin was murdered. And I was just in disbelief,"" Maher Abdul Jabbar, Tawfiq's cousin, said. ""The good always die(s) young. And that's a prime example of what happened to my cousin.""
Israeli authorities have initiated an investigation into the incident and other family members are still working out the details surrounding the incident.
""The sadness is covering us from all over,"" Mohammad Salen, Tawfiq's great uncle, said upon learning of the death.
IDF forces reported that an off-duty police officer and a civilian fired at a person suspected of throwing rocks in the area. The IDF soldier present at the scene allegedly fired at the Palestinian victim. The claim is currently under review. The U.S. State Department is also investigating the incident.
National security spokesman John Kirby expressed concern and said the investigation would yield more details. ""It's definitely deeply concerning, but I'm afraid I don't have more information than that right now,"" Kirby said.
A vigil was held in the New Orleans area Saturday, where he was a member of a local mosque.
369 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, the day Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, kicking off the latest spasm of violence in Gaza. More than 25,000 people have died in Gaza in the fighting so far."
EFL08UEJXJ_681R76VXLRFPT6W,Understanding a week of missile strikes across Middle East,Raffi Berg - BBC News Online Middle East editor,"January 21, 2024 at 7:32 p.m.·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/understanding-week-missile-strikes-across-010157139.html,"The past week has seen new rounds of violence across the Middle East, deepening fears of conflict spreading in an already unstable region.
Here is a brief guide to what has happened - and where it might lead.
On Tuesday, Iran unexpectedly carried out a missile and drone attack on Pakistani territory. Iran said it was targeting an Iranian Sunni Muslim militant group, Jaish al-Adl, that has staged attacks inside Iran. Pakistan said two children were killed and swiftly hit back, launching missiles at Pakistani ""terrorist hideouts"" on Iran's side of the border. Iran said three women, two men and four children were killed.
The flare-up has heightened tensions in a region already experiencing a multitude of crises. Although the area of the tit-for-tat strikes is far from the main theatres of fighting in the Middle East, the border is volatile and further incidents here could quickly escalate, for instance if Jaish al-Adl retaliates against Iran.
A sign of a perilous region
This week saw multiple rounds of US Navy missile strikes against the Houthi Zaidi Shia movement in Yemen, following Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a waterway crucial to world trade. The Houthis - backed by Iran - stepped up their attacks in November following the outbreak of the war in Gaza. They vowed to target ""Israeli-linked"" boats so long as Israel's offensive continued, to show solidarity with the Palestinians.
Tracking Houthi attacks in the Red Sea
Why are the Houthis attacking Red Sea ships?
Consequently all merchant shipping in the international waters has been put under threat, something considered intolerable by Western powers. The US and UK, backed by allies, launched the first air strikes against the Houthis last week to try to deter them - but the group has remained defiant.
On Monday, the Houthis hit a US vessel in the Gulf of Aden in what appeared to be their first successful attack on an American ship since their campaign began. A second was hit in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday and the Houthis have vowed to continue - raising the prospect of further US strikes and the question of whether Iran will feel forced to respond.
An increasingly intensifying years-long shadow war between arch-foes Israel and Iran ratcheted up on Monday when Iran fired missiles at what it described as headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency in Irbil in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, killing four people. Iraq - an ally of Iran and hostile to Israel - denied Mossad was there and condemned the attack.
Why did Iran launch strikes on its allies' territory?
Iran said its attack was a response to the alleged Israeli killings recently of a senior Iranian commander in Syria and two top Iran-backed militants in Lebanon - one a commander of the Shia militant movement Hezbollah and the other the deputy leader of the Palestinian group Hamas.
The Israel-Lebanese border, where Israel and Hezbollah - heavily armed and funded by Iran - have frequently traded strikes since the Hamas attack on Israel and start of the Gaza war on 7 October, is one of the most dangerous fronts in the region.
On Wednesday Israel's military chief of staff said ""the likelihood of [war in the north] happening in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past.""
At the same time as it struck in Iraq, Iran fired missiles into a rebel-held province in north-west Syria, saying it had targeted bases of the Islamic State (IS) group in retaliation for IS suicide bombings in southern Iran on 3 January which killed 94 people. IS, a Sunni jihadist group, considers Shia Muslims heretical, and Iran is the dominant Shia power in the region.
While Iran is a key ally of the Syrian government, directly striking militants in the rebel-held region is a rare step and a signal to its adversaries that Iran is prepared to act far afield.
Iran shows power with regional strikes
An air strike on the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Saturday killed 10 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five of them were senior members of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Syria and Iran blamed Israel, with Iran vowing revenge.
It follows similar strikes around Damascus earlier in the week. Israel has not commented, but has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of aerial operations in Syria involving attacks on targets it says are linked to Iran. An interception of a fighter aircraft by Syrian air defences - which has so far not happened - or deadly retaliation could ignite a new crisis in a region beset by wars.
Intense fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has continued, with the war there now in its 15th week. At least 891 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardment since last Sunday, raising the death toll there since 7 October to more than 25,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. On the Israeli side, nine soldiers were killed in the same period, bringing its combat death total to 189.
Israel intensified its offensive on the southern city of Khan Younis this week, while troops reached their furthest point south since the start of the war, the Israeli military said. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the conflict could go on until 2025, Israeli TV reported this week.
Gaza destruction 'risks lost generation of children'
Israel was also hit by a car-ramming and stabbing attack on Monday, for which police arrested two Palestinian suspects from the occupied West Bank. The attack, which was praised by Hamas, killed a woman and injured 17 other people. It was one of the first such attacks inside Israel since the start of the Gaza war, heightening anxieties among Israelis still reeling from the 7 October attacks.
Violence has also escalated in the West Bank alongside the war. Israeli air strikes there on Wednesday killed nine Palestinians, medics said. Israel said at least five of the dead were planning an imminent attack.
Missiles were fired at an air base used by US-led coalition forces in western Iraq on Saturday, injuring several US military personnel, US Central Command said. Iranian-backed militants are suspected of being behind the attack.
Bases housing US and coalition forces in Iraq and north-east Syria have been attacked dozens of times by Iranian-backed militants in recent months, drawing US retaliation. The attacks are seen as part of Iran's indirect conflict with the US, where it can strike US assets at arms length.
About 3,400 coalition personnel are in Iraq and Syria as part of efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group, which still operates in pockets in the region.
Attacks by one country into another have also been happening in other places in the Middle East this week.
Turkey carried out air strikes against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq and a US-backed Kurdish-led militia alliance in northern Syria on Monday, its defence ministry said. The latest strikes are part of a decades-long and bloody conflict between Turkey and armed Kurdish groups which Turkey, which has a large Kurdish minority, regards as terrorist organisations. One of the strikes is reported to have hit a prison holding more than 3,000 IS prisoners.
There were also rare air strikes by Jordan across its border with Syria. Ten people, including children, are reported to have been killed. It is thought to have targeted drug smugglers. Iran-backed militias in Syria have been accused by Jordan of trafficking the amphetamine Captagon into the kingdom and on to Gulf Arab states."

Denis Pushilin, head of the Russian-installed authorities in the city of Donetsk, said another 20 people, including two children, were wounded in the strike on the outskirts of the city, the AP reported. He claimed shells were fired by the Ukrainian military.
Pushilin claimed the area was hit with a 155 mm caliber and 152 mm caliber artillery, with shells being fired from the direction of Ukrainian cities Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka, per the news wire.
Kyiv did not comment on the event and the claims could not be independently verified, the news wire noted.
The Russian Foreign Ministry, in a translated statement, called the incident a “barbaric terrorist act against the civilian population of Russia.”
“The terrorist attacks of the Kiev regime clearly indicate its lack of political will for peace and the settlement of the conflict by diplomatic means,” the statement said. “The need to achieve all the goals and objectives of a special military operation is obvious. Security threats and acts of terrorism should not come from the territory of Ukraine.”
A fire also broke out at a chemical transport terminal at Russia’s Ust-Luga port after two explosions, the AP said, citing local media reports. Local media reported the port was attacked by Ukrainian drones and a gas tank exploded.
Yuri Zapalatsky, who heads Russia’s Kingisepp district, where the port is based, reported no causalities and that the area was on high alert, the AP reported.
Russia’s Ministry of Defense also announced Sunday that Moscow’s forces took control of the village Krokhmalne in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region, the news wire added. Ukrainian forces confirmed the settlement was occupied, describing the incident as a “temporary phenomenon.”
The war between Ukraine and Russia is approaching its two-year mark next month, with thousands of troops killed on each side.

EJTDVM4HEB_DUKUYEG8OBE2VSQ,Canned Sardines Make For A Delectable Banh Mi In A Pinch,Matthew Wilson,"January 21, 2024 at 11:15 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/canned-sardines-delectable-banh-mi-021556837.html,"The bánh mì is a staple in Vietnamese cuisine — simple to make but easily customizable. The sandwich features meat of your choice and veggies like pickled daikon, cucumber, carrots, and cilantro on French baguette bread. The sandwich is topped with mayonnaise for a creamy finish. While you can make bánh mì with fresh fish, canned sardines add a salty flair to the sandwich. Plus, they're convenient if you want to make a quick and easy but fulfilling sandwich.
Canned sardines stand out among the various proteins you can choose for the sandwich such as chicken, meatballs, or even pork. There's a historical element with Vietnamese people having a long history with canned sardines, which we will get to in a minute. For Vietnamese immigrants, the sandwich is a reminder of home, and for others, it's a tasty snack. The saltiness of the canned fish pairs well with the sourness of pickled veggies like the aforementioned daikon. The heartiness of the fish contrasts well with vegetables, so much so that people often throw canned sardines in a salad. The fish adds an additional flavor and depth to the meal, without sticking out or seeming out of place with the other elements of the sandwich. The preferred type of sardines for this sandwich are the kind soaked in tomato sauce because you get that sweet hint of tomatoes to further bring things together.

You may tempted to use fresh sardines in your bánh mì sandwich because fresh is always better, right? While it's true that fresh ingredients, including sardines, typically have a higher quality, the dish has historically been made using canned sardines. So if you want a more authentic sandwich, then it's better to grab a couple cans of sardines for your bánh mì.
Generally, if you're using fresh sardines then your sandwich will have a different taste. Fresh sardines have a less potent fish taste and are generally sweeter than the canned variety. While that may make for a more pleasant dining experience if you were eating the fish straight up, there's a risk of fresh sardines not standing out among the other ingredients of your sandwich. In comparison, canned sardines have a stronger salty taste.
Additionally, canned sardines are more convenient if you're trying to make a bánh mì or perhaps a fish taco in a pinch. You don't have to worry about the hassle of cooking them before you prepare your sandwich. Fresh sardines can be difficult to find unless you have a fish market in your town. Likewise, they typically don't last long unless frozen. Comparatively, canned sardines can last a lot longer in your pantry.
As mentioned above, the Vietnamese have a somewhat conflicted history when it comes to canned sardines. The French originally introduced the canned fish to the country in the early 1900s. With the process for canning becoming available in the 1800s, canned sardines became a staple for the lower classes in France. At the time, Vietnam was a French colony called Indochina, which it remained until 1954. The meal proved to be popular among colonists, often eaten in tomato sauce.
The meal also became a hit among the Vietnamese middle and upper class in the country. When France pulled out of Vietnam so did most of its import of canned sardines, but Vietnam started its own sardine canning company, Ha Long Canfoco. For immigrants who left Vietnam during the height of the Vietnam War, canned sardines took on a strong association with their homeland but also difficult times. Vietnamese immigrants ended up in refugee camps waiting for passage into another country, and canned sardines were a common meal for these refugees.
Still, many of these immigrants enjoyed the taste of canned sardines in the years afterward. They took the recipe for the canned sardine bánh mì sandwich with them, passing it down to their families.

The deputy fired his gun during the struggle, but missed 33-year-old Corey Allen Leazer, the Iredell County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release.
Leazer was captured “in the early morning hours” Sunday, Jan. 21, and treated for exposure to the cold, officials said.
Investigators have not released the deputy’s identity or details of any injuries.
The traffic stop happened Saturday, Jan. 20, at a gas station in the 800 block of Oakridge Farm Highway near Mooresville, the sheriff’s office said.
“During the stop, the driver of the vehicle ... attempted to get away from the deputy by pulling away from the deputy and getting back into his vehicle,” officials said.
“As the deputy tried to pull Leazer out of the vehicle, Leazer placed the vehicle in drive, dragging the deputy about 15-20 feet. The deputy fired his weapon but did not appear to hit the suspect.”
The deputy was able to get back in his patrol car and chase the vehicle, but ended the pursuit in Rowan County when the suspect began to endanger other drivers, officials said.
Leazer’s vehicle was found “a short time later inside Mecklenburg County” and a perimeter was established to track him down.
Iredell County and Mecklenburg County deputies searched through the night and Leazer was captured in the early morning, officials said.
“Due to exposure to the weather conditions, Leazer was treated by EMS and taken to a local medical facility,” officials said.
Temperatures fell into the teens during the search.
Leazer has been charged with felony assault with a deadly weapon on a law enforcement officer, felony flee to elude, resisting arrest, obstructing and delaying a law enforcement officer “and several driving-related charges,” officials said.
He is being held without bond “due to Leazer being out on bond for prior charges,” officials said.

ELI1DO8WRK_XXWRD5YAC8P8MAK,Bill Cotterell: Florida legislators should stop the LGBTQ cheap shots,Bill Cotterell,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 12:44 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/bill-cotterell-florida-legislators-stop-100700603.html,"As Florida legislators work on hundreds of bills in the 2024 session, they ought to ask themselves some threshold questions every time they debate a bill.
Is this really a problem happening all over Florida?
Are we dealing with something worthy of a grown-up’s attention, or am I just posturing for the voters back home?
The 60-day lawmaking session that convened January 9 has plenty of serious business to discuss. There are matters of homeowners insurance, education, health care and public safety, to name just a few. These require varying degrees of hard work and expenditure of tax money, and they’re often not glamorous.
But there are also some feel-good bills and cheap shots that require no courage to vote for and bring the political bonus of being difficult for an opponent to argue against this summer when most legislators will be back home running for re-election.
And no topic makes for easier demagoguery than sex, specifically any activity that makes strait-laced Republicans a little squeamish.
After the last two sessions — with passage of the “don’t say gay” law, tightened abortion restrictions, a crackdown on drag performances and the purge of school library shelves — you’d think Florida has little left to attract chanting demonstrators, rainbow banners and colorful picket signs to the Capitol.
But there’s a dozen or so proposals pending to provoke the LGBTQ activists and their Democratic allies who mainly speak out, offer doomed amendments, and cast futile votes against bills being rushed to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ desk.
Consider, for instance, House Bill 1233, which says the sex listed on your driver’s license or state identification card must be the same as the anatomy you were born with. The real-world effect of this is just to needlessly insult trans people. If a man decides to live as a woman, or the other way around, it’s a free country and he or she has a right to do so.
If a cop is puzzled by the information on a license, a couple of questions can straighten it out — “Yeah, that’s an old picture, and that was my name when I was a guy.”
Do we have thousands of drivers, or people showing identity cards for other reasons, who cause massive confusion all over Florida? Or is this just a cheap, easy way for lawmakers to cast a vote for traditional family values — and potentially to upstage an opponent with TV ads and mass mailings saying this guy might be soft on trans people.
Some transgender teachers are challenging the constitutionality of a law restricting use of personal pronouns in schools. A bill pending for this session expands that law, forbidding government agencies and contractors from using the “he” or “she” or “they” as desired by a trans or non-binary person.
That one also says non-profit organizations and companies receiving state payments may not require their employees to undergo training on sexual orientation, sexual identity, or gender expression. Never mind if some of those companies, or individual employees, think such instruction is useful in creating a harmonious work environment.
In this regard, the conservative Republican Legislature will make an exception to its usual hands-off approach to private enterprise and tell employers how to deal with a small number of staffers.
But do we need a law?
If your official identification says “John Smith” and you live your life as “Jane Smith,” what harm is done? Anyone observant enough to be a traffic cop, or a school registrar or some other kind of official functionary can probably clear up any confusion pretty quickly. It’s hard to imagine some necessary government function, licensing requirement or official verification that requires retaining a person’s original genitalia.
The real purpose of these bills is not to meet any real needs of the state, or solve any pressing problems of the people. It doesn’t even matter much if the bills pass or fail.
Introducing them and advocating these ideas in the House and Senate gives their sponsors bragging rights. To tell voters back home they stood up to that very loud and highly visible LGBTQ crowd.
That’s a lot easier, and gets more TV publicity, than dealing with rising hurricane insurance rates on Florida’s coasts or sinking reading and math scores in our schools.

Matt Gaetz sentenced to probation,Danielle Wallace,"Updated January 23, 2024 at 2:42 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/hampshire-man-admitted-threatening-kill-194555299.html,"A New Hampshire man received probation after admitting to threatening to kill Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., whom he accused in a voicemail of ""coming for the gays.""
Allan Poller, 24, had already pleaded guilty in October to transmitting in interstate commerce a threat to injure the person of another.
He was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay a $500 fine in federal court on Thursday, according to the New Hampshire Union Leader.
Poller, a Keene State College student at the time, called the Washington, D.C., office of a member of the U.S. House of Representatives on March 29, 2023, and left a voicemail message stating in part, ""I just want to let you know, Representative [Name], if you keep on coming for the gays, we’re gonna strike back and I guarantee you, you do not want to f--- with us.""
TRUMP MAINTAINS BIG LEAD IN POLLS, NEW ENGLAND NEWSPAPERS ENDORSE HALEY
The FBI affidavit redacted the name of the member of Congress, but Gaetz previously confirmed he was the recipient of the voicemail.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
In an episode of his podcast ""Firebrand,"" Gatez played out a snippet of Poller making the death threat.
""We will kill you if that’s what it takes. I will take a bullet to your f---ing head if you f--- with my rights anymore. And then if you want to keep going down that path, you know who’s next,"" Poller said in the call placed at approximately 12:20 a.m., according to the FBI affidavit.
""I believe in redemption and forgiveness. I hope he finds a better path,"" Gaetz told Fox News Digital Sunday.
Poller, a men's track athlete for Keene State, according to his profile on the school's website, was arrested on April 3, 2023.
Prosecutors say Poller later admitted to placing the call and leaving the message. He allegedly stated to investigators that he had been drinking and left the message after becoming angry while watching videos on the social media application TikTok.

Prosecutors previously said the charging statute provided a sentence of no greater than five years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000.
Poller ""has used the catastrophic effect of his actions as a catalyst to begin a new path in his life,"" a sentencing memorandum written by his attorney read, according to WBTS. ""He has strengthened his bond with his family and has completely accepted recovery into his life.""
The U.S. Attorney's Office stressed how Poller, ""is a young man who has faced dramatic challenges in his life but had no prior contacts with the criminal justice system. He has also already faced significant consequences as a result of his conduct, arrest, and plea in this case.""
Fox News Digital reached out to Gaetz's office for comment on Sunday.
The FBI and U.S. Capitol Police led the investigation, with assistance provided by the Keene Police Department and the Springfield, Vermont, Police Department.

ER45PJMK5R_Q9JBBIX6EKD07K3,Newton teacher strike extends after two sides unable to reach deal Saturday,"Jill Konopka,Bryan Lambert","January 21, 2024 at 1:53 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/newton-teacher-strike-extends-two-012930262.html,"The ongoing strike by Newton educators will continue after the two sides could not reach a deal despite a full session of bargaining on Saturday, the mayor’s office says.
The two sides met with a mediator at the Newton Education Center at 10:00 a.m. Saturday morning and continued to negotiate past 7:00 p.m., Newton Mayor Ruthanne Fuller updated Saturday evening.
The mayor says both sides hope to get students back in the classroom on Monday.
“In Newton, we deeply value our teachers. That is and will always be the case. And, we want them in their classrooms,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. “The current impasse in contract negations is not a referendum on our respect for teachers nor on the vital role schools play in our City.”
On Friday, a Middlesex Superior Court judge filed a preliminary injunction against the Newton teachers, ordering an immediate cease and desist of the ongoing strike and an immediate return to the classroom.
The Newton Teachers Association has until Sunday by 3 p.m. to cancel the strike or they will be breaking the law, according to a ruling by Judge Christopher Barry-Smith.
“This is a difficult time for children, families and caregivers, and teachers in Newton. I understand that. The School Committee negotiating team will work hard on Sunday to settle. That’s our goal.,” Mayor Ruthanne stated. “If that doesn’t happen, I urge the union to end their strike which is illegal and teachers to be with students on Monday while the NTA continues to bargain.”
The teacher’s contract expired at the end of August and the two sides have been negotiating a three-year contract.
The educators are calling for a cost-of-living pay increase to more adequately compare to peers in comparable districts. In addition, to pay the other concerns brought by the union include large class sizes in the high school and more staff in the elementary schools.
The teachers’ current contracts have step increases each year (annual bumps and raises with each year of experience). The union claims the mayor’s offer lumps those annual bumps in, which they say makes the offer less valuable than it appears.
Newton schools were closed Friday due to the strike.
A spokesperson for the Newton Teachers Association told Boston 25 News Friday that they recognize the strike causes inconvenience but believe it will be worth the effort.
“The NTA realizes that strikes come with disruption, but we believe the short term disruption is worth it to secure continued educational excellence for the students of Newton,” the NTA stated. “We are dedicated to securing a contract that the students, parents, and educates of Newton need and deserve. Mayor Fuller can end the strike immediately by fairly addressing the issues we have been raising for years.”

ERDJYPVUAU_2IA7PKTUARXL1B5,"'Drugged, robbed, killed': The city catching US tourists in dating trap",BBC,"January 22, 2024 at 4:47 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/drugged-robbed-killed-city-catching-020947111.html,"A series of mysterious deaths involving American men in Colombia has been linked to dating apps. Relatives of those killed are now searching for answers, writes Austin Landis in Medellin.
Tou Ger Xiong loved coming back to Colombia.
""He talked about the high spirited people… just enjoying life,"" his brother, Eh Xiong, told BBC News. ""He even picked up Spanish.
""It never, ever even crossed his mind that he would end up in a tragic incident this way.""
Tou Ger, 50, was a Hmong-American community activist and comedian from Minnesota. Prior to his most recent trip to Medellin, he had been speaking to a woman online.
A few weeks into his two-month visit, in mid-December, he called his brother and asked him for $2,000 but didn't say what it was for or that anything was wrong. Eh said he would transfer the money. He never heard from his brother again.
The next day, police found Tou Ger's body in a remote, wooded area of the city. A friend in Medellin explained to Eh that his brother had been kidnapped and held at gunpoint for the $2,000 ransom.
""I did not want to believe it. I didn't know if it was really happening,"" Eh said. ""My heart just sank.""
Eh scrambled to contact the US embassy, who confirmed it was his brother's body. Colombian police this week arrested a woman and two men linked to his death, charging them with kidnapping and murder.
It's not clear whether he first met the woman through a dating app or through friends. But his death is one of eight in Medellin that prompted a warning from the US embassy about the risks of using dating apps. All eight victims were Americans who died in suspicious circumstances in November and December.
The US state department said it was aware of a gang in the city that previously used dating apps to isolate victims before abducting and killing them. But it's unclear if a gang was behind the US deaths.
In the first 10 months of 2023, Medellin's tourism observatory had already recorded 32 violent killings of foreigners in the city - including at least 12 Americans and three from the United Kingdom - a 40% increase from the previous year.
Jeff Hewett was found ""lying dead in a pool of blood"" in his Medellin hotel room, his friends wrote online, describing him as ""an easy-going, wry, kind spirit"" and apparent victim of a ""robbery gone bad"".
Johny Jerome was killed on his 45th birthday. Phillip Mullins was drugged and died of an overdose, according to local media reports.
The embassy says several of these cases began with a dating app used to lure victims, part of a concerning increase in people who end up ""drugged, robbed, and even killed by their Colombian dates"". Neither Tinder nor Bumble, both popular in the city, would comment.
Carlos Calle, the former director of the city's tourism observatory, said it's common for criminals to drug tourists with scopolamine, an odourless substance known as ""Devil's Breath"". The US embassy also warned about the drug, which sedates victims for up to 24 hours.
Eight US deaths in Colombia linked to dating apps
""There's a negative profile of the tourist in the city that looks for a certain type of opportunities,"" said Calle in an interview. It's usually related to sex work, he said.
A spokesperson for the tourism observatory confirmed that the ""majority"" of victims last year were men, but added that many cases are still under investigation.
Prostitution is legal in Colombia and widespread in tourism hotspots like the cities of Medellin and Cartagena. But there's nothing to suggest the men killed were using prostitutes.
Alok Shah, 36, thinks scopolamine is what caused his vision to ""go sideways"" when he brought a woman back to his hotel room in late 2022. It was like his short-term memory was disappearing, he said.
The Texas resident had matched with a Colombian woman in her mid-20s on Tinder. They first went out for coffee, but Shah later decided to buy beers and bring her to his hotel.
He says he hadn't felt unsafe during his previous frequent visits to Medellin, or like prostitution was as prevalent when he first came in 2017. But he knew women were a draw to the city. ""If you're a single guy, the women are very lovely here,"" a friend had told him.
Before his watch, jacket and $200 in cash disappeared that night, he remembers his date rubbing a powder on his neck. But he stayed conscious enough to realise something was wrong, threatening to call the police and chasing her away.
""I generally don't interact with the locals there now,"" he said. ""There's just too much danger, there's too much risk.""
The new US embassy notice recommends its citizens avoid taking dates to private places like hotels, plus inform friends, family or building staff about who they're with. And don't resist a robbery because that could be fatal.
Medellin's city police would not comment on the recent increase in violent deaths and referred BBC News to the mayor's office.
""We want more and more foreigners to come to the city,"" said Mayor Federico Gutierrez, but added that tourists coming purely for sex and drugs were not welcome. He said he's directed the police to crack down on what he says is a related underlying issue - the sex trafficking of minors.
Police have been directed to begin ""special interventions"" in the neighbourhoods where tourism is most prominent, a spokesperson for the mayor told BBC News, including the popular nightlife area called El Poblado.
More than 1.4 million foreigners visited the city as tourists in 2022, a new record over previous years, and over a quarter were American, according to statistics released by the mayor's office. The numbers for 2023 are expected to be even higher, partly because Medellin has become a top destination for remote workers.
Last week, Eh Xiong came to Medellin himself for the first time, to carry out a Hmong tradition by calling his brother's spirits back home.
""We're not mad at the people of Colombia,"" he said. ""I truly believe that he would have forgiven the people who did that to him.""
He added: ""[Tou Ger had] this quick wit, fearlessness, that believes in the goodness of all people.""
Austin Landis is a multimedia journalist based in Medellin, covering migration and stories from Colombia. She previously covered the White House in Washington for Spectrum News"
ERUOQGBOZE_6MYGXQ9O63KTNIT,It's 3 weeks into January and your New Year's resolutions might be starting to slip. Here are 6 tips from an entrepreneur to make lasting goals in 2024.,Sawdah Bhaimiya,"January 21, 2024 at 7:22 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/3-weeks-january-years-resolutions-102201036.html,"Keeping New Year's resolutions for a full 12 months can prove difficult.
Entrepreneur Mimi Ikonn shared six valuable insights about making goals with Business Insider.
Some unusual tips include making mood boards, sharing goals on social media, and having an accountability buddy.
Making New Year's resolutions is an age-old tradition that sees people around the world sit down and reflect on their big goals for the coming year — only to abandon them a few weeks later.
A recent Forbes Health survey of 1,000 adults in the US found that the average New Year's Resolution lasts just 3.74 months with only 6% of respondents sticking to their goals until December.
Meanwhile, the series of dates celebrating the failure of New Year's resolutions such as ""Quitter's Day"" on the second Friday of January and ""Ditch New Year's Resolutions Day"" on January 17 suggests there's a gap between making goals and actually turning them into lifelong changes.
Mimi Ikonn, the cofounder of wellness brand Intelligent Change and a social media influencer, told Business Insider that making lasting changes requires a holistic approach.
""We have to keep in mind that unless we make these fundamental subconscious changes, nothing is going to change in our life because we are guided every day to make decisions based on our subconscious mind,"" Ikonn said in an interview.
""It literally makes more than 95% of all the decisions we make. So unless we change certain habits day to day and rewire the way the brain works, nothing is going to change in our lives because we go back to our old habits.""
Ikonn offered six valuable insights about keeping New Year's resolutions.
Ikonn said that Intelligent Change launched tools that were based on the founders' personal lives to help users develop goals based on all of the different facets of their identity.
Ikonn said you have to look at ""your whole life as a system.""
""So you are not just somebody who works, you're somebody who has relationships, you're somebody who has a relationship to self, and has spiritual practises.""
She suggests viewing goals like slices of a pie or even an umbrella and slotting them into each section like it's a different facet of your life.
But she warned against making too many goals and instead to narrow it down to three to five ultimate goals for the year.
""I think the reason people fail is because we can be a little bit over ambitious about our capabilities and we set out too many goals and then we quickly disappoint ourselves and the moment we disappoint ourselves, we feel deflated and then we just stop trying,"" Ikonn explained.
The most important thing to consider when setting a goal is the ""why"" factor which can help you determine the motivation behind achieving the goal.
""If you have a strong 'why,' you will find a way to get there, and if you don't, most likely you won't,"" Ikonn said.
An exercise that can help you determine your ""why"" could be creating a list of values before you write down your goals for the year.
""Once you create the values, when you create the goals, it's so much easier to see if your goals are aligned with your values and then that allows you to create a bigger vision of your life.""
The saying ""moving in silence"" is a popular sentiment meaning working on your goals in private is more rewarding because you're cutting out external judgment.
However, according to Ikonn, this isn't necessarily true, and can be a mistake. In fact, sharing your goals with others is actually a worthwhile pursuit because it will encourage you to not give up.
""I think one thing that people miss out on is having accountability partners,"" she said. ""The more people you tell about your goals and dreams, the more chances you're going to actually do it.""
An accountability buddy can be a friend or family member who you can check in with every week.
""Accountability is huge when it comes to forming any new habits,"" Ikonn said. ""Sometimes we need a little bit of support from our community and it can make a world of a difference.""
Similar to having an accountability buddy, sharing your resolutions on social media can actually put gentle pressure on you to achieve them.
Ikonn said that one of her goals in 2024 was to do more public speaking and she decided to share this on social media. People started inviting her to more events and giving her the opportunities to do so as a result.
""So it is fascinating what happens once you put it out there into the world, whether you do it on your social media, whether you do it in person with your friends in your community, where people will hear what you're doing, and they will connect you with the right person. They will tell you about a workout program or maybe a new job opportunity.""
The hashtag #newyearmoodboard has almost a million views on TikTok with users putting together aesthetic collages of images and quotes that often represent their dream life.
Although it may just look like a fun activity, Ikonn says there's a deeper reason behind why it can work.
""There's a part of our brain called the reticular activating system, which helps us filter through all the information that we are faced with every single day because we're overwhelmed by all this information.
""So when you focus on something specific, it allows your brain to filter for opportunities and people and ways to get to those opportunities.""
However, it's not just about creating the vision board, you actually have to do the work and take actions to bring the dreams to life but it's ""extremely helpful to visualize where you're going.""
You've created your list of goals, found yourself an accountability buddy, and ensured that it aligns with your values and long-term vision for your life. Now, how do you make sure it actually sticks?
Ikonn says your goals have to be ""very clear and actionable and something you can measure."" You should also avoid being vague.
""For example, instead of saying, 'Oh I want to be healthier' you can say, 'I want to start running three times a week' or 'I'm going to take three yoga classes a week' or 'I'm going to do this workout program on an app and I'm going to commit to it five times a week.'""
The next step is breaking those goals down into actionable steps to schedule into our months and weeks because ""things we don't schedule will never get done.""
Ikonn emphasized that it's not always possible to do something everyday.
""In real life, there will be times when we feel unwell, when our family needs us, when work needs us more than usual, and we'll be unable to actually keep the habit going. But the truth is we can always pick up where we left off and restart the habit at any point in time.""

Ahead of the upcoming season, lifeguard recruiting and training is already underway with the goal of turning things around.
""Who doesn’t want to be a lifeguard in the summer?"" said Lance Zaug. ""It’s a lot of fun. I’d say it’s like easy money. It doesn’t really feel like work.""

For Zaug, swimming isn’t just a pastime – it’s a paycheck. He started as a county lifeguard roughly three years ago, but a new wave of potential lifeguards arrived Saturday for an in-water training session.
""If we don’t get enough lifeguards, we don’t get to open all of our pools and keep our indoor pools open in the summer,"" said Andrea Wallace with Milwaukee County Parks.
To keep pools open and staffed this summer, the county is holding sessions like Saturday's at the Pulaski and Noyes pools. Sessions continue through spring.
""We’ve set our sights on 150-200 guards, so that we're able to open the pools in all the communities,"" Wallace said.

The county said, to qualify for training, candidates must be at least 16 years old by the time of hire, in good physical condition, and able to swim 100 meters in less than 1 minute 45 seconds.
Lifeguards don’t just sit in chairs above pools. They are often in the water, connecting with people of all ages to improve their swimming ability.
""It keeps people safe around the water, it gets people comfortable around the water,"" said Wallace.
Lifeguard pay for the 2024 season starts at $17.13 per hour. Milwaukee County Parks also offers incentives and bonuses.
""If you’re looking for something to do in the summer, something to pick up, this is definitely something,"" Zaug said."

According to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Central District of California, Steven Robert Sablan, 62, of Cleburne, Texas, pled guilty.
The 62-year-old admitted that he had sexually assaulted the 13-year-old girl after kidnapping her.
Sablan drove the Texas teenager to California after kidnapping her on July 6, 2023 in San Antonio.

Sablan allegedly approached the victim and raised a black handgun to his side while ordering her to get into his sedan.
""If you don’t get in the car with me, I am going to hurt you,"" Sablan allegedly told the teen, who complied and got into his car.
Court documents state that the now 62-year-old began driving and told the girl he could take her on a cruise ship to see her friend in Australia.

While her attacker was preoccupied, officials say the teen victim wrote ""help me"" on a piece of scrap paper in an attempt to catch someone's attention.

During a search of the vehicle, officers retrieved a black BB gun, a ""Help me"" sign, and a pair of handcuffs.
Sablan was arrested and will be sentenced on October 25 for a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in federal prison and a statutory maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

EU4GTX1GWN_5CR8JMGLZ5RQFIZ,Who is at greatest risk of fentanyl death in Tri-Cities? Overdose stats paint a profile,Cory McCoy,"January 21, 2024 at 10:00 PM·10 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/greatest-risk-fentanyl-death-tri-130000748.html,"The Tri-Cities victims of the fentanyl epidemic probably aren’t who you think. And those misconceptions are costing lives.
The lethal opioid is pushing the Tri-Cities toward a grim milestone — 500 overdose deaths in eight years.
Information about the people dying from drug overdoses in recent years paint a picture of who are at the highest risk of falling victim to the deadly drug.
A Tri-City Herald analysis of Benton Franklin Health District data shows it’s often a man in his 40s or 50s, working in construction, trade labor, the food service industry or healthcare.
He most likely graduated high school and sometimes attended college or a trade school.
Tri-Cities victims usually aren’t homeless, though there is a good chance he lives alone — possibly contributing to his death.
Out of nearly 400 Tri-Citians who died from overdoses from 2016 to 2022, only 32 people (8%) were listed as unemployed or disabled.
Just a handful of those who died last year were listed as homeless by our county coroners.
Merit Resource Services Executive Director Shereen Hunt said that whether we realize it or not, we all know someone struggling with addiction, and helping them find a path to recovery could save their life.
“Every single one of us in our community, we all know someone,” she said. “Either a family member or a friend who is having problems in their life because of drug and alcohol use, it impacts everyone. It impacts their families, our criminal justice system, our hospitalization rates. It impacts everything.”
For Yvonne Lakey, Merit’s lead Recovery Navigator, family encouraging her to get into recovery was life saving and life changing.
Now she tries to meet people struggling with addiction where they are, whether it’s a walk-in at one of their offices or when they’re booked into jail, in order to help them start on the path to recovery.
“Everyone has situations in their life, past trauma. This isn’t the life they want to have,” Lakey said. “If they want to make that change I want to help them get there.”
Tri-Citians are dying from overdoses at more than twice the rate they were just five years ago.
For the second year in a row, 2023 saw the Tri-Cities reach a new record with fentanyl-related deaths in Benton and Franklin counties.
About 70 people died of overdoses or medical issues tied directly to drug use last year.
At a rate of about 9-in-10, fentanyl or fentanyl combined with other substances was the primary driver of these deaths.
Only 8 of 65 overdose deaths were caused by drugs other than fentanyl, according to preliminary data from the coroners in Benton and Franklin counties.
Fentanyl is a synthetic drug that is 100 times more potent than morphine and hundreds of times stronger than street-level heroin, federal officials have said.
About two-thirds of the victims who died from overdose-related deaths in 2023 were at least 40 years old. Only 10 were younger than 30.
That includes at least two children and a 16-year-old whose deaths are believed to have been caused by the deadly opioid.
The death of a 1-year-old girl in Franklin County is still under investigation.
And a 4-year-old girl in Kennewick that police believe died from ingesting fentanyl while her parents were in a motel bathroom allegedly getting high. Toxicology results for 4-year-old Ryleigh Walker have not yet confirmed she died from fentanyl, but investigators say partially intact fentanyl pills were found in her stomach and in her nose.
Statewide, the crisis has gotten so severe that in 2022, nearly 1-in-12 emergency calls for injuries were related to suspected overdoses in Washington.
The state estimate is in line with regional numbers, according to data from the state Department of Health and community health organization Greater Health Now. However not all ambulance services participate in data collection.
Greater Health Now is region wide and also includes Yakima, Kittitas, Whitman, Walla Walla, Columbia, Garfield and Asotin counties.
The Benton Franklin Health District said the EMS calls in our region are likely lower than the state’s estimate, lining up more closely with Tri-Cities emergency department visits related to suspected overdoses, which was at 2% for the last quarter of 2022 and 3% for the year.
Kadlec Regional Medical Center in Richland sees more than 100,000 visits to its ER each year, according to a 2017 state Department of Health estimate.
If 3% of all visits were overdose related, that would average 8 each day.
During the same period, nonfatal overdoses in Benton and Franklin counties accounted for about 9% of all injury hospitalizations, and more than a quarter of all injury deaths in the Tri-Cities area.
That means 1-in-11 injury hospitalizations are being linked to suspected overdoses.
But in the Tri-Cities, and across Washington, overdose hospitalizations remain on a downward trend, while overdose deaths continue to tick upward.
The reason goes back to the likelihood of victims living alone with no one to call for help.
If an EMT responds to an overdose call, they can administer Narcan, or naloxone, which reverses overdose symptoms and greatly improves the person’s chance of survival, leaving those using fentanyl at home alone at much greater risk.
Education and access to naloxone are two key ways to help reduce fatal overdoses, Hunt told the Herald.
Hunt said people struggling with addiction need education to make them better aware of how much more dangerous fentanyl is than many other drugs and to stress the importance of having ready access to naloxone to help reverse overdoses.
Gov. Jay Inslee is making it a priority this year to increase funding for education in schools across Washington and recently announced the rollout of a new program to put naloxone on every school campus.
The health district told the Herald they are looking into what it would take to get the Tri-Cities to “naloxone saturation” or a high enough distribution of the life-saving drug to ensure it is available whenever needed.
Their early estimate is that the Tri-Cities would need 3,964 kits in circulation, or 1,270 per 100,000 people.
The American Medical Association has said there is a correlation between the decline in prescription opioid use after tougher laws were passed and the rise in fentanyl use.
Fentanyl is often mixed in with various other counterfeit prescription medications or illicit drugs, leaving many users unaware of its presence until they become hooked or accidentally overdose.
The problem has become so widespread that a Los Angeles Times investigation last year uncovered fentanyl and methamphetamine in Adderall and opioid pain medications coming from legitimate pharmacies in Mexico.
Hunt said fentanyl use, like heroin, comes with severe withdrawals, leading many people to continue using just to stave off the symptoms. They may not have even known they were taking fentanyl until it’s too late.
“Their goal is to get high or alleviate those severe withdraw symptoms, not to die,” she said. “It’s a fine line between ‘the next time I use am I going to get high enough or go over the line and not wake up?’ It’s like Russian roulette.”
Hunt said that while education and naloxone can save lives in the short run, with continued fentanyl use, the longer it goes on, the higher their risk of dying becomes.
Merit performs intake surveys with new patients and immediately gives them a naloxone kit if they indicate they’ve used fentanyl. Hunt said they stress the danger of using alone at home. Then they work with the patient to help get them a formal substance use disorder diagnosis in order to begin medical treatment.
Medications such as suboxone, or buponephrine, have been shown to increase the likelihood a patient is successful in recovery, and can cut the chances of fatal overdoses in half, according to the National Institutes for Health.
Inslee is also pushing for expanded funding for Oxford House Recovery Homes, which are community-based mutual help residences for high-risk individuals. They help people struggling with addiction stay clean, find work and offer ongoing support.
Last year Merit launched its Recovery Navigator Program, which pairs peer specialists with patients to help guide them in their recovery journey. These peer specialists are people who have been successful in their own addiction recovery, and can relate to the fears or struggles a patient might be experiencing.
Lakey said that five years ago she wouldn’t have believed you if you told her that she’d one day be leading an entire team of people in recovery as they helped others survive and overcome their own addiction issues.
“I am a recovering addict, I believe everyone deserves a second chance” she said. “My grandfather is the one who, when my life was turned upside, gave me a second chance ... Really being able to give back what was given to me really helps me in my recovery.”
Lakey said that her own recovery journey has transformed her life and relationships, and she wants to help others do the same.
“I am truly grateful for what I do, I’ve been able to go back and mend relationships in my life and go back and thank the law enforcement officers who gave me the push I needed,” she said. “My grandfather passed, but before he passed away he was able to see me clean and sober for over two years. He was a big person in my life.”
Lakey said she’s also been able to build a relationship with her father who has had similar struggles and now they’re closer than they’ve ever been. She said she’s grateful every day that she has a relationship with her children and that her grandchildren will never have to see her struggle with substance use.
Lakey said her own struggles help her build bonds with people in recovery, and help them see that getting their life back is possible.
“It’s a good feeling, it’s definitely a good feeling knowing that somebody is willing to possibly turn their life around, and follow the recommendations,” she said. “It’s a new journey, just knowing I’m going to be able be part of that is (fulfilling).”
Lakey said that whether you are struggling with addiction or it’s a loved one who needs assistance, the most important thing you can do is reach out and ask for help. She recommends 12-step treatment programs like Narcotics Anonymous, which also has support groups for family members.
“You don’t have to go through this alone,” she said. “None of us wanted to grow up and be an addict. It’s not something we chose and I think that a lot of people don’t realize that.”
Hunt said that access to help has improved greatly, and if someone is looking for help with addiction, they can get them started on a program right now.
“I think the biggest thing we can do is to let them know that help is available, there is access to treatment. We don’t have a waiting list, we don’t have a capacity problem,” Hunt said. “There are empty beds right now, it’s just a matter of getting their assessment.”
“If we can get them in the door and start the process, that’s the biggest hurdle, and that’s where the recovery navigator peers come into play to help them.”"

They were described as small grassroots efforts.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu (Democrat) joined the efforts in Nashua and Manchester.
The President does not appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot due to a disagreement between the local and national party. The National Democratic Party is recognizing South Carolina’s primary as its first in the national primary.
Those who are encouraging voters to write in the President’s name on Tuesday said it was important to continue their first in the nation status. They also said it was important to make sure voters understand that the President is running for a second term.
Mayor Wu said, “We are heading to a dangerous rematch of 2020.” She went on to say, “Having been in city government under President Obama and Trump and now President Biden, it makes such a difference on the local level. I remember after that time (President Trump’s election) the unleashing of hate and fear....We are not going back there”
The Mayor spoke at a rally at Soel Sistas in Nashua before heading out to hold signs at polling locations in Nashua and then Manchester.

EXXKLU8DU6_CQH9A1ORPLPY4JB,"After more than a year of savaging DeSantis, Trump 'honored' to be endorsed by governor","Antonio Fins, Palm Beach Post","Updated January 23, 2024 at 3:32 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/more-savaging-desantis-trump-honored-214517741.html,"Donald Trump's campaign said it was ""honored"" to be endorsed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who suspended his campaign Sunday, as the former president said he would no longer call the governor by the mocking nickname ""Ron DeSanctimonious.""
The brief note Sunday followed in the the governor's announcement. The statement read: ""With only a few days left until President Donald J. Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, we are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates.""
Trump's campaign added that ""it is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump."" At the moment, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley remains the only one of the initial close-to-a-dozen Republicans who sought the GOP nomination remaining as a challenger to Trump.
Later, while speaking in Rochester, N.H., Trump ""congratulated"" the governor and complimented Florida first lady Casey DeSantis.
""He ran a really good campaign. I will tell you it's not easy,"" Trump told those attending his rally. ""But as you know, he left the campaign trail today, at 3 p.m., and in so doing he was very gracious and he endorsed me. I appreciate that. And I also look forward with Ron and everybody else to defeat Crooked Joe Biden.""
Earlier, Trump told a crowd that the derisive nickname ""DeSanctimonious"" was now ""officially retired"" to loud cheers.
DeSantis' fake Churchill quote: Did he quote a Budweiser ad when he dropped out of the race?
One Florida ally of DeSantis immediately called for unity around Trump's candidacy.
""As Republicans we must all rally behind President Donald J. Trump. Let’s stop the infighting and unite behind a strong leader that will turn this country around!"" wrote a post by state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, a Spring Hill Republican and former chairman of the Florida Republican GOP.
Commentary from Trump's supporters ranged from appreciative to gracious to taunting.
U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, who endorsed Trump last November, posted: ""Florida is all in for President Trump!""
U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Pensacola Republican who is one of Trump's most vocal backers on Capitol Hill, shared on social media a photo of himself with DeSantis and simply the words ""thank you.""
“We’re getting the band back together!”Thank you ⁦@RonDeSantis⁩#Trump2024 pic.twitter.com/ZaskRatDxm
— Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) January 21, 2024
Taylor Budowich, CEO of Make America Great Again Inc., praised DeSantis saying he ""made the right decision today to drop out and get behind President Donald Trump.""
Trump campaign manager Susie Wiles, a former DeSantis campaign aide, responded to a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, foreshadowing his departure from the race saying ""Bye, bye.""
Trump's campaign took aim at Haley, who served as U.N. ambassador in Trump's administration in its statement saying ""Nikki Haley is the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement.""
The muted response to DeSantis' exit from the 2024 race was a sharp contrast to more than a year's worth of savaging of the governor by the former president.
Trump dubbed DeSantis as ""DeSanctimonious"" in November 2022, just days before that year's midterm elections and as Trump readied to announce his 2024 presidential comeback campaign. Trump took on blowback for ridiculing his one-time political ally, who won a decisive reelection that fall, and the former president shelved his attacks until early 2023.
It was then that Trump began unleashing fierce salvos singularly aimed at DeSantis, who did not officially enter the race until May, despite what by the spring of last year was a broad field of other suitors for the Republican nomination.
In a speech in West Palm Beach last February, Trump rolled out an early attack strategy in vowing that ""under no circumstances will we allow anyone to cut Medicare or Social Security for our nation."" In April, Trump's team fired off an ad ridiculing the governor, this one mocking DeSantis' purported habit of scooping pudding with his fingers.
In West Palm Beach, Trump spoke at the Turning Point USA summit and repeated what by then was a stump speech staple, claiming credit for DeSantis' initial gubernatorial win in 2018. As DeSantis' standing in the polls eroded precipitously, Trump raised the intensity of the withering attacks.
Speaking to the Club 47, a Trump fan club, the former president issued this warning last fall to the governor about his political future.
""I think he blew it for in four years. You never know what's going to happen, but in '28, I don't see it happening,"" Trump said to a crowd of supporters. ""I can never forget because that's such great disloyalty.""
After winning the Iowa caucus Jan. 15, Trump seemed to give both DeSantis and Haley an off-ramp by congratulating them in what was a seemingly uncharacteristic call for reconciliation and unity.
When DeSantis didn't drop out after Trump decisively won the caucus, the former president again turned up the heat. In a post last week on his social media platform, Trump called DeSantis ""very flawed"" and said he is ""out of money"" and ""out of hope.""

EYVLL89NDA_9PT9P8XXIV331G7,"TikTok campaign needed to boost MMR uptake amid measles outbreak, says Jess Phillips",Michael Searles,"January 22, 2024 at 12:48 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/tiktok-campaign-needed-boost-mmr-154821984.html,"A TikTok campaign is needed to boost uptake of the MMR vaccine amid the ongoing measles outbreak, Birmingham MP Jess Phillips has said.
Cases of measles have soared across the West Midlands in recent months to their highest level since the 1990s, with 216 confirmed cases since October 1, and a further 103 “probable” cases, officials have said.
Almost four in five cases have come in Birmingham, although the majority of the West Midlands has been affected by the outbreak.
The city has among the lowest vaccination rates in the country, however, with just 75 per cent of people having had both doses of the jab.
Ms Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, said a TikTok campaign was “needed” because that is where most people under the age of 40 in her constituency talk to each other, especially those with children.
”[It’s] really really concerning, especially when you consider the evidence about [measles] being in more vulnerable communities, communities that already suffer poorer health outcomes,” she told the BBC.
“We really have got to understand why this has happened so we can do everything we possibly can to get the messaging right [and] make sure there are the healthcare professionals in the community to go out so that the questions can be answered.”
She said that fake, anti-vaxxer sentiment was spreading online quicker than the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) was issuing advice and needed to be tackled.
“I think it’s criminal when people spread that fake news because it’s hurting people, it’s harming people,” she said.
“Frankly those people should be held to task and account for essentially causing illness in these areas.”
Dame Jenny Harries, the chief executive of UKHSA, said vaccination rates were “well below” what is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), which targets 95 per cent of the population having both doses of the vaccine.
Currently, this stands at just under 85 per cent for England, but is much lower in Birmingham and parts of London, where outbreaks have occurred, as well as other cities, like Nottingham, Manchester and Liverpool.
UKHSA has called on the public to get up to date with their vaccines and ask a trusted healthcare professional about any questions or concerns they have.
Ms Phillips said this was “hard to do for most people these days”.
“I think a huge effort needs to be put in to make sure this is abated at 216 cases.”
She said both her children were vaccinated.
“It’s not just a good parenting decision, it’s a good community decision because there are some people who cannot take the vaccine because they are ill, so I personally think it is a good parenting decision.”
Mark Pawsey, Conservative MP for Rugby, told BBC he was “not sure” enough was being done to tackle the outbreak and that people were “very casual” about taking the vaccine.
“I think part of the issue is because it hasn’t been around for so long, I think my generation of people do understand the concerns because our parents knew exactly how severe this was.
“It hasn’t been around for a long time and I think that’s made people very casual about taking the MMR vaccine.”

EZB54GL5M8_JMR9A6JSETIAGKC,Returns On Capital At Converge Technology Solutions (TSE:CTS) Paint A Concerning Picture,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 9:21 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-converge-technology-solutions-122142557.html,"To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Having said that, from a first glance at Converge Technology Solutions (TSE:CTS) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.
Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Converge Technology Solutions:
Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
0.047 = CA$53m ÷ (CA$2.2b - CA$1.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).
Thus, Converge Technology Solutions has an ROCE of 4.7%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the IT industry average of 12%.
View our latest analysis for Converge Technology Solutions
Above you can see how the current ROCE for Converge Technology Solutions compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Converge Technology Solutions.
On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Converge Technology Solutions doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 37% over the last five years. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.
On a related note, Converge Technology Solutions has decreased its current liabilities to 47% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE. Keep in mind 47% is still pretty high, so those risks are still somewhat prevalent.
Even though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Converge Technology Solutions. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 601% to shareholders in the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.
Converge Technology Solutions does have some risks though, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for Converge Technology Solutions that you might be interested in.

EZVY9C8SQI_KIPM1OIAYO7PWP2,Three attacked in Leicester Square ‘for being Jewish’,Michael Searles,"January 22, 2024 at 4:43 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/three-attacked-leicester-square-being-194326744.html,"Three people were attacked in Leicester Square, London, “for being Jewish” in the early hours of Sunday morning after they were overheard “speaking Hebrew”.
The three victims, all in their twenties, were enjoying a night out when they were attacked by a group of men.
A 28-year-old woman, Tehilla, told The Telegraph she was “physically attacked” and called the Metropolitan Police 10 times “afraid she was going to die” but that police did not attend.
She was out with two male friends, both 25, who it is understood suffered blows to the head.
The group were heading towards a nightclub when they were accosted for speaking in Hebrew but they “walked away because they wanted to stay out of trouble”.
They were later threatened around 2am by people “swearing in Arabic”.
“They heard us talking and said, ‘are you Jewish?’” Tehilla, who has lived in London since she was 13, told The Telegraph. “I said ‘yes, I’m Jewish,’ and then they started chanting ‘Free Palestine’, and ‘f--- Jews’, all this kind of swearing at us.
“So we just tried not to get into trouble, to walk away, but they started following us and then all of a sudden, it started with like two or three guys, and all of a sudden, they called all their friends and 15 to 20 guys started attacking us physically.”
She said she had tried to intervene but “they started attacking me as well”.
“I hurt my leg, they punched me in the neck,” she said. “I tried to run away and I called the police so many times, at least 10 times and I kept crying to them, ‘I’m a girl, there’s a group of guys attacking me and my friends because I’m Jewish, please can you come, I’m scared I’m going to die’.
“They don’t really care. They kept saying ‘I’m sorry, it takes some time, you are not the only one that called tonight’,” she said, adding that she “never thought this would happen in London”.
It’s understood the police attended the scene 28 minutes after being called. They arrived at Tehilla’s house around 6pm on Sunday, some 16 hours after the first call, and are treating the incident as a hate crime.
The Community Security Trust, a charity to support and protect Jewish people in Britain, said it would be “raising” the handling of the incident with the police.
“This appalling incident was reported to CST’s 24/7 control centre last night and we are in contact with the victims,” a spokesman said. “We will be raising it with the police and will provide ongoing support to the victims.”
A friend of the victims who wished to remain anonymous said they visited them at the hospital in North London where they were for a few hours and that the police “never showed up” despite claiming they would.
“We believe there’s a two-tier police situation. The police are not tackling the weekly hate marches, they are not tackling anti-Semitism,” they told The Telegraph.
“The feeling for the Jewish community is that the leadership of the police, the Government do not care about us,” they added. “The climate is very, very distressing for the British Jewish community.”
Det Supt Lucy O’Connor said: “We are investigating this incident as an anti-Semitic hate crime.
“I know how upsetting such inexcusable violence is for anyone who was injured or who witnessed the incident, and also for the wider community. I share their concerns.
“Officers arrived at the scene some 28 minutes after they were called. Of course, I wish we could have come to their aid sooner.
“The police investigation will now focus on speaking with the woman and any other victims or witnesses, as well as following up all lines of enquiry including analysis of CCTV. I urge any witnesses to get in touch.
“I can assure Londoners, tackling anti-Semitic crime is a priority for the Met. There is no place for hate in our city.”
A police spokesman said officers were called at 1.37am on Sunday 21 January to a woman assaulted in the area of Leicester Square and said the caller stated that she did not require an ambulance.
“Officers attended the location, arriving shortly after 2am, at which point all parties had left the scene. We understand that a woman subsequently attended hospital for treatment,” the spokesman said.
“The incident is being treated as a hate crime. Officers will speak with the victim to take a statement and identify any other victims and witnesses.”

F2I2BX8PHC_JJSUK6BBFXVVW05,Libya says production has resumed at its largest oilfield after more than 2-week hiatus,SAMY MAGDY,"January 21, 2024 at 11:10 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/libya-says-production-resumed-largest-141031167.html,"CAIRO (AP) — Libya’s state-owned oil company resumed production at the country’s largest oilfield Sunday, ending a more than two-week hiatus after protesters blocked the facility over fuel shortages.
The National Oil Corp. said in a terse statement that it lifted the force majeure at the Sharara oil field in the country’s south and resumed full production. It didn’t provide further details. Force majeure is a legal maneuver that releases a company from its contractual obligations because of extraordinary circumstances.
The company had activated the maneuver on Jan. 7 after protesters from the desert town of Ubari, about 950 kilometers (590 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli, shut down the field to protest fuel shortages.
Over the past two weeks the company’s chief, Farhat Bengdara, and military officials from eastern Libya have been negotiating with the protest leaders, Fezzan Group.
Barzingi al-Zarrouk, the protesters’ spokesman, announced that they have suspended their protest after they reached agreement with the company.
He said the agreement was brokered by the self-styled Libyan National Army, which is commanded by powerful military general Khalifa Hifter. Hifter’s forces control Libya’s east and much of the south.
The protesters have reportedly called for rehabilitating infrastructure and repairing roads in the southwestern region of Fezzan, one of the historic three provinces of Libya. They previously closed the field for two days in July.
Libya’s light crude has long featured in the country’s yearslong civil conflict, with rival militias and foreign powers jostling for control of Africa’s largest oil reserves.
Libya has been in turmoil since a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The North African nation has for most of the past decade been split between rival administrations in the east and the west, each backed by militias and foreign governments."
F5WE5K8O1F_2WUJJPFZDZJ8GBG,"They studied, passed the exam but were denied nursing licenses. Is Florida at fault?",Camellia Burris,"January 21, 2024 at 9:00 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/studied-passed-exam-were-denied-120000824.html,"Romelia Farinas moved to Miami from the Dominican Republic 10 years ago hoping to expand the healthcare career that she’d been preparing for since childhood.
After working for several years as a certified nursing assistant and a patient-care technician, she was encouraged by her employer to take the national exam to become a registered nurse, a natural career step. To prepare, she enrolled in Universal Career School, a private for-profit outfit. While preparing for motherhood — she was six months pregnant — she took the exam and passed.
Her co-workers threw her a party. The celebration was short-lived.
Despite passing the national nursing exam, called the NCLEX, she would not be getting her license due to a bureaucratic standoff between two states — Florida, where she went to school, and New York, whose online portal administered the test.
Florida’s Department of Health would not discuss the matter with the Miami Herald.
The school in Sweetwater is no help. It’s closed, its offices abandoned, its website defunct. She owes $20,000 in student loans.
Farinas is the latest example of how students can get burned attending private, for-profit schools, which, in some cases, can have shaky accreditations and disappear overnight. The Herald spoke to eight women who are struggling with similar problems, leaving them in limbo, owing thousands.
It’s happening at a time when nurses are in short supply. According to Nurses.org, a clearing house for those in the profession, Florida is in the top five states projected to have the largest shortage of nurses.
Among the women is Yaimi Perez, 40, who graduated from Miami Regional University in May 2022. Although she lives in Miami, she, too, took the test through the New York online portal, passing in 2023. New York is a popular option, especially among test takers for whom English is not their first language. The test is hard enough for native speakers but can be even harder for those who sometimes struggle with English.
New York offers test takers unlimited opportunities to pass. Florida offers just three. The state that administers the test issues the license. Either way, at the end of the process, the nurses should be able to practice their profession in Florida
When Perez inquired with the New York State Education Department about her licensing status, it sent an email that she was on hold because her school’s licensure status was “probationary” as indicated on the Florida Department of Health’s list of nursing programs.
It didn’t matter that the U.S. Department of Education’s Database of Accredited Postsecondary Institutions and Programs said the school was fully accredited. The “probationary” status in Florida meant New York would not issue her the license.
Unlike Universal Career School, Miami Regional University is still in business.
In a statement , Miami Regional University pointed out that its nursing programs are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing. The university highlighted the COVID-19 pandemic’s negative impact on its associate nursing program test scores but stressed that its most recent passage rates have shown significant improvement.
“We are aware of New York state’s blanket policy banning licensure of out-of-state students as a result of investigations into other schools in Florida and we have advised all graduating students about the current situation in New York.”
A native of Cuba, Perez moved to Miami eight years ago. She is currently unemployed as she tries to determine the best route around her current predicament.
Universal Career School, closed shortly after Farinas graduated in the spring of 2022.
Now 40, she became interested in medicine at a young age — attending a specialized high school for nursing in her rural hometown before moving to Santo Domingo to attend university.
While studying medicine, she met her future husband, Edgar, who was visiting from Miami. The two married and moved stateside.
Farinas began working as a certified nursing assistant at the Palace at Coral Gables, a high-end independent and assisted living community. She thrived in her new role, earning accolades like “employee of the month”  before she was promoted to supervisor of the certified nursing assistants. She later transferred to HCA Kendall, where she currently works as a patient care technician.
She decided to take her career to the next level by taking the NCLEX so she could work as a registered nurse — a role requiring the ability to perform more advanced nursing tasks, including administering medications and managing patient care plans. Her employer, eager to promote her, offered a flexible work schedule so she could attend school.
After graduating, she sat for the nursing exam through the New York portal at a testing site in Doral in March 2023. She passed, but became concerned when after a month she still hadn’t received her license.
Farinas reached out to the New York State Education Department. A customer service representative told her the department was investigating her alma mater and that her license was on hold.
This information stunned Farinas because she’d submitted her transcripts to the department in advance — a prerequisite for sitting for the exam.
“Why didn’t they give me that information ahead of time so I could decide if I take the test or not with the state?” she asked. “It’s so unfair and frustrating.”
A letter to Farinas from the New York State Education Department said the Florida Department of Health and Florida State Board of Nursing had terminated her school’s nursing program in June 2021. It noted that Farinas’ transcript indicated that she completed coursework at the supposedly terminated program in the fall of 2021 — and that she graduated on Feb. 28, 2022.
“Since your education has not been approved, you should not have been eligible for the NCLEX examination,” the letter read.
Eligible or not, she passed on her second try.
Farinas told the Herald that during the last few months of her enrollment, the administration told her that the school was going to close but she was never informed of any prior termination of the nursing program. The other women who spoke to the Herald said they were similarly blindsided.
While Florida enforces a three-tries-and-you’re out, policy,  an applicant can earn another chance at the test by successfully completing a Florida Board of Nursing approved remedial course.
State Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat, believes that the onus is on Florida government officials to offer these women a path forward.
Students who have completed their coursework and passed the required examination, she said, should not be punished due to a lack of accountability and oversight within the state’s for-profit college system.
The Florida Department of Health’s failure either to notify students of their colleges’ changing accreditation status or provide them with a transitional plan exacerbates these issues, according to Eskamani.
“At the very least, there also has to be accountability to get their money back from these institutions that have lied to them,” she aid.
Both Farinas and Perez are now paying off the debts they acquired to fund their education. Farinas, who said she and her husband are five months behind in their mortgage, took out approximately $20,000 in loans. Perez’s debt load is higher — about $36,000.
Eskamani said it is not uncommon for state agencies to create an emergency process in situations like these, or when there is a workforce shortage, as there is in the nursing field.
The world of nursing schools is in some cases fraught with fraud. Recently, three South Florida men were tried for allegedly running a nursing-school “diploma mill.” According to prosecutors, over 3,500 students paid between $10,000 and $20,000 for fake academic credentials from the now-defunct Palm Beach School of Nursing. The three were found guilty in December.
Until a pathway forward is found, Farinas feels stuck. Because she says she didn’t have access to her passing score, she’s considered retaking the exam in Florida, but that option is costly, both in time and effort. Aside from the $200 exam fee, it would take months to prepare because the test is so challenging.
“Why do I have to pay for something that’s not my fault?” she said.
After going back and forth with the New York State Education Department for nearly a year, Farinas received a letter two week ago from the department reiterating its decision to withhold her license due to questions surrounding her education.
Except: It said it is willing to release her passing score to Florida so she can complete a separate application process for Florida to issue her a license.
While grateful for this potential reprieve, Farinas maintains that the inability so far to get her license has caused irreparable financial harm.
The delay “totally changed our economic situation,” said her husband, Edgar."

F84TW95DAP_0QJPPKV78SEK8HQ,Should we bring wooly mammoths back to life? | ECOVIEWS,Whit Gibbons,"January 21, 2024 at 7:09 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/bring-wooly-mammoths-back-life-100914258.html,"Q. What do you think about the efforts by geneticists to re-create mammoths and mastodons and let them live in Siberia or northern Canada where they once thrived?
A. The project you’re asking about involves woolly mammoths rather than mastodons.
Mastodons, like woolly mammoths, were relatives of elephants, but they were more distantly related genetically to modern elephants than the woolly mammoths were.
Representatives of both, however, were alive as recently as 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. One reliable report states that in the Arctic Ocean on Wrangel Island, within 300 miles of Alaska, an isolated population of woolly mammoths persisted up to 4,000 years ago.

Cloning presents practical and ethical dilemmas to be sure. First is the question of whether such a project is feasible at the genetic level. Can it even be done?
In the simplest terms, the plan is to use DNA from frozen mammoths and implant embryos in Asian elephants (the closest living relatives of mammoths) as surrogate mothers. The genetic challenges are incredibly complex, and the scientists involved in the effort are to be commended for working through the intricate details.
We learned from ""Jurassic Park"" that such plans are technically possible. Although ""Jurassic Park"" was fiction (I hope), the genetic concept is believable, and some brilliant minds are working to make it happen.
Also on the practical side, consider that the last time woolly mammoths and mastodons shared a large part of Earth with humans, they did not fare so well (though it may not have been entirely people’s fault). Today, many species face dwindling population sizes, with some even headed toward extinction. Why would we think a new set of giant creatures roaming around would meet a better fate?
Woolly mammoths, one of several extinct species of elephant-like creatures, roamed the northern tier of the globe for more than 2 million years including the most recent Ice Age.
For the last few centuries of their existence, woolly mammoths overlapped with humans. A hunting party successfully bagging a full-grown mammoth would presumably be clan heroes, as everyone could dine on steaks for weeks. Living in a refrigerator-cold environment would make preservation an easy task.
Scientists debate the reasons for the ultimate extinction of woolly mammoths, with hypotheses ranging from overhunting to a meteoritic impact that caused climate and habitat changes. Whatever the explanation for the wooly mammoth’s demise, carcasses with viable DNA have been found in Siberia.
Navigating the maze of genetics and successful incubation of woolly mammoth embryos seems possible within the realm of modern scientific knowledge. However, what to do with a herd of gigantic herbivores requiring an arctic climate pushes the envelope of practicality.
Do we just release them into Siberia, northern Canada and Alaska to let them fend for themselves? Not a chance that would happen.
Today’s approach to wildlife management is to keep close tabs on every individual if possible. And anyone who thinks international politics would not come into play does not follow the same news programs the rest of us do.
Who would be held responsible when a rogue woolly mammoth charges out of Kazakhstan and crushes a Mongolian family in their yurt? Furthermore, what about the economic aspects, which are nearly limitless. I feel certain some enterprising wildlife conservation society is already developing their Adopt a Woolly Mammoth program.
The ethical implications may be more complex. They involve various perspectives and opinions, including this idea: just because we can do it doesn’t mean we should.
How much ought we tamper with the creation of life simply because we know how to manipulate genetic codes? In fact, might the possession of such a wealth of genetic knowledge make society more complacent about standing by while today’s animals go extinct?
Are we comparable to spoiled children who destroy the toys they have with no compunction because their indulgent parents will buy them new toys whenever they want?

FDO9OOWIH4_3A7PJGJ7FWKZMZW,New Hampshire Republican primary – what to expect and what it can tell us,Joan E Greve,"January 23, 2024 at 4:15 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/hampshire-republican-primary-expect-tell-130029018.html,"New Hampshire voters are headed to the polls on Tuesday. After Donald Trump’s landslide victory in the Iowa caucus last week, his top rival for the Republican nomination – the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley – hopes to make a splash in the critical primary state.
But the Republican primary is not the only contest being held in New Hampshire on Tuesday. New Hampshire Democrats are moving forward with their own primary, one with a major asterisk: Joe Biden’s name will not appear on the ballot as the Democratic National Committee has said that the New Hampshire primary is “meaningless” after party officials moved to make South Carolina the first voting state.
Here is everything you need to know about the New Hampshire primary:
New Hampshire will hold the first primary election of the 2024 election cycle, while Iowa held the first caucuses of the Republican nominating contest. In a caucus, each voter is required to appear in person at a specific precinct location to cast a ballot, as the Guardian’s Martin Pengelly explained earlier this month.
A primary is much more straightforward, with polling locations across the state open for a set number of hours to allow voters to cast their ballots. Because of the relative ease of voting and the option for undeclared voters to participate in either party’s primary, New Hampshire generally sees higher turnout than Iowa.
In 2020, roughly 176,000 Iowans participated in the Democratic caucuses, while nearly 300,000 New Hampshire voters participated in the Democratic primary. The turnout gap is particularly notable considering Iowa’s population is more than twice the size of New Hampshire’s.
Two dozen candidates filed the necessary paperwork to appear on the Republican primary ballot in New Hampshire, but the overwhelming majority of votes are expected to be cast for Haley and Trump.
DeSantis dropped out of the race on Sunday, just two days before the primary, after it was clear the downward trajectory of his campaign could not be revived in New Hampshire. He joined other candidates who had ended their presidential bids.
After their disappointing performances in Iowa, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson both dropped out of the Republican primary. Their names will still appear on the ballot, as will the names of other former candidates like the former vice-president Mike Pence and the South Carolina senator Tim Scott.

Yes, but it’s complicated. The Democratic National Committee voted last year to designate South Carolina as the party’s first primary state moving forward, while New Hampshire would have the opportunity to vote second.
The decision outraged New Hampshire Democrats, who insist they will not go along with the national party’s plan to rob them of their “first-in-the-nation” status. As a result, the New Hampshire Democratic party decided to hold its primary the same day as the Republican primary in defiance of the DNC’s decision.
The DNC has criticized the New Hampshire primary as a sham, calling on the state party to “educate the public” that the contest “is a non-binding presidential preference event and is meaningless”. The New Hampshire attorney general, Republican John Formella, in turn sent a cease-and-desist letter to the DNC to compel the organization to stop making “false, deceptive and misleading” claims about the primary.
Because of the standoff, Biden’s name will not appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot, although many Democrats still plan to vote for him as a write-in candidate. Other long-shot candidates, including Minnesota congresswoman Dean Phillips and self-help author Marianne Williamson, will appear on the ballot and hope to capitalize on New Hampshire Democrats’ frustration with the change in the voting calendar.

Voters who are registered as a Democrat or a Republican may only vote in their party’s primary, but undeclared voters may choose to participate in either primary. There are already indications that Democrats and independents in New Hampshire plan to participate in the more competitive Republican primary, as thousands of voters changed their registration leading up to the deadline in October.
The presence of independent and Democratic voters in the Republican primary could dramatically affect the results. Haley in particular hopes that she can sway enough of those voters to chip away at Trump’s advantage with more hard-right Republicans.
Polls show that Trump remains well ahead of Haley in New Hampshire, although Haley has significantly narrowed the former president’s lead in recent weeks. According to the FiveThirtyEight average of New Hampshire polls, Trump is about 13 points ahead of Haley, but he was leading by 25 points last month.
Even though she finished third in Iowa, Haley had presumptively made the argument that the primary was “a two-person race” between her and Trump because of DeSantis’s low polling numbers in New Hampshire and South Carolina, which will hold its Republican primary late next month. After DeSantis dropped out of the race on Sunday, Haley faces a new opportunity to consolidate the support of non-Trump voters and overtake the former president. But as the results of the Iowa caucuses showed, there may not be enough non-Trump voters left in the Republican party for Haley to pull off an upset.
New Hampshire is generally whiter, older and wealthier than the rest of the nation. According to the American Community Survey conducted by the US Census Bureau, 90.5% of New Hampshire’s voting-age residents identify as only white, compared with 67.1% of all American adults who identify as such. Only 1.1% of New Hampshire residents over 18 identify as Black and 3.1% identify as Hispanic, while 12.3% of all American adults identify as Black and 14% identify as Hispanic.
New Hampshire also has a higher share of citizens over the age of 65, with 25% of its adult residents in that age bracket compared with 23.2% of all American adults. The median age of all New Hampshire residents is 43.3, which is older than the 39.0 median age for all Americans.
In terms of household wealth, 7.2% of New Hampshire adults report an income that falls below the poverty level, compared with 11.1% of all Americans whose incomes fall below that level. And while 94.1% of New Hampshire’s adult residents have at least a high school degree, 91.3% of all Americans over 18 can say the same.
Because of the demographics of New Hampshire, a number of critics have challenged the state’s early voting status. In its move to push the New Hampshire primary to a later date, the Democratic National Committee cited the racial diversity of other early states like South Carolina and Nevada to justify their prioritization in the voting calendar.
“This calendar looks like the Democratic Party, and it reflects the diversity of America,” the DNC chair, Jaime Harrison, said last year.

Isaac Zimmern, 27, and long-time girlfriend Emma Wilmer-Shiles climbed aboard a kit-built aircraft that was piloted by their friend, Lochie Ferrier, the New York Post reported. Ferrier and his fiance, Cassidy Petit, also died in the crash last week.
Zimmern was the son of Johann Zimmern, 59, the head of Global Education Marketing at Zoom, who lives in San Francisco, according to International Business Times.
Isaac Zimmern was also living in San Francisco with Wilmer-Shiles, 27. The couple had been together for a decade.
Zimmern spent the last three years working in New York City as a senior operations associate for Burrow, a Brooklyn-based furniture manufacturing company, according to his LinkedIn profile.
The plane was identified as a Cozy Mark IV, a single-engine, four-seater kit plane. It crashed last Sunday around 4 p.m. off the coast of Half Moon Bay.
A witness told a 911 operator that the plane was hurtling toward the water after hearing ""the engine sputter,"" according to Sgt. Philip Hallworth of the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office.
The National Transportation Safety Board said the cause of the accident is under investigation and a preliminary report would be filed in a week or two. The cause could take as long as two years to fully investigate, however, the NTSB said.
The Federal Aviation Administration is also part of the investigation.
The U.S. Coast Guard called off the search-and-rescue operation less than a day in, saying it was unlikely that any of the victims survived the crash, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Only Wilmer-Shiles' body has been found so far.
The San Mateo County Sheriff's Office will continue to look for the bodies of Zimmern, Petit and Ferrier.
Ferrier, an Australian, was well-known in the experimental aircraft community. He graduated MIT with a degree in aerospace engineering."

After witnessing his failure to uphold his oath of office, his unfulfilled campaign promises, the relentless turmoil during his presidency, his blatant disregard for our Constitution, his persistent and unfounded claims of election fraud, his impeachable offenses, and his numerous criminal acts, the thought would have seemed preposterous. At that time, I might have wagered that Trump would either be confined in a jail cell or isolated at Mar-A-Lago, with the Republican Party having decisively turned its back on him.
Yet, here we are again. Trump’s base has not moved on and continues to be consumed by a man who abuses their patriotism and mocks them behind their back. A disturbing number of so-called leaders continue to echo Trump’s lies — driven by weakness and a fear of retribution.
But there’s a silver lining. New Hampshire, known for its fierce independence, has the opportunity to take a stand. This is evident by the fact that the state has more registered Independents than Republicans or Democrats. And due to their open primary system, New Hampshire independents have the ability to vote in either the Republican or Democratic primary, making them uniquely positioned to swing the 2024 election.
Make no mistake: this Tuesday, democracy itself is on the ballot. To all the independents in New Hampshire, in the spirit of your state’s strong tradition of independence, I urge you to cast your vote in the Republican primary in support of democracy. You have the unique opportunity to cast an historic vote against the bitter forces that divide our country, and build a more united America. You have the chance to champion democracy, to defend its principles, and to celebrate our cherished democratic traditions and that fierce New Hampshire independence.
New Hampshire, I leave you with a challenge I posed three years ago, which resonates even more profoundly today. Will we prey on people’s fears, or draw upon their hopes? Will we feast on anger, or summon our better angels? Will we lead America forward and upward?
This rings as true today as it did then.
The future of America is unwritten. New Hampshire, your votes can significantly shape the trajectory of our nation’s future, perhaps more than ever in American history. Let’s show the country and the world that democracy, integrity, and the true spirit of New Hampshire remain strong. You know what to do.

Details: Fito explained that the Ukrainian soldiers had left the village and moved to better and more prepared positions.
Quote from Fito: ""Krokhmalne, so you understand, was a settlement with a population of 45 people before the start of the large-scale war. It had, perhaps, 5 houses.
The Russian aggressor destroyed these 5 houses, and therefore, our goal was to save the lives of Ukrainian defenders; their positions have been moved to the defensive lines prepared beforehand, where they are now holding the defence, preventing the enemy from advancing.
This does not pose any threats to neighbouring units. I think this is a temporary phenomenon. The front line is changing daily.""
Background: On 20 January, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that Russian forces had advanced along the Kupiansk-Svatove-Kreminna line and captured the village of Krokhmalne.

Since Mediazona's last update on Dec. 29, the names of 1,685 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties.
The journalists specify that the actual figures are likely considerably higher since the information they have verified so far comes from public sources, including obituaries, posts by relatives, news in regional media, and reports by local authorities.
Among the Russian casualties in the most recent update, Mediazona confirmed the names of four military personnel who were killed by a Ukrainian missile strike on the Russian landing ship Novocherkassk on Dec. 26. The attacked allegedly killed 74 and injured 27 Russian soldiers, according to a Ukrainian hacker group that claimed it had intercepted an email from the Russian Black Sea Fleet’s press service.
Since Russia's full-scale invasion began, over 3,000 officers, with 349 holding the rank of Lieutenant Colonel or higher have been killed in combat in Ukraine. In contrast, there have been nearly 5,089 casualties among newly recruited Russian soldiers.
A majority of those killed in action come from Krasnodar, Sverdlovsk, Bashkiria, Chelyabinsk, and Moscow regions, as well as the Buryatia republic.
Total estimates of Russia's casualties since the full-scale invasion vary widely.
As of Jan. 21, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces says that Russia lost 376,030 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022 - although that number is likely to be both those killed an injured during the war.

“We don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign,” Mr DeSantis said. “I’m proud to have delivered on 100% of my promises. I will not stop now.”
“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”- Winston Churchill pic.twitter.com/ECoR8YeiMm

The Florida governor went on to endorse the former president for the nomination.
“I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the Coronavirus pandemic, and his elevation of Anthony Fauci,” he said. “Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden.”
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge,” he continued. “He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, or a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
Meanwhile, Nikki Haley said Ron DeSantis “ran a great race” after receiving the news he had dropped out during a campaign event in New Hampshire.
“He’s been a good governor, and we wish him well,” Ms Haley said at the Sunday afternoon event. “Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.”
The announcement comes just days ahead of the New Hampshire Republican primary, in which Mr DeSantis was polling in third place with single digits after winning second place in the Iowa Republican caucus. If Mr DeSantis received less than 10 per cent of the vote, as the polls are projecting, he would have been inelligble for any delegates per state primary rules.
The Florida governor’s campaign was plagued by challenges long before the primary season kicked off in Iowa.
Last month, Jeff Roe left his role as top adviser to Never Back Down, the super PAC backing the DeSantis campaign. The move came just hours after The Washington Post published a story about the internal disputes and suspicions between the PAC, the campaign and DeSantis’ allies.
NBC News also published an exclusive report on Sunday detailing the pitfalls of the DeSantis campaign.
“This thing blew up on the launch pad,” a former adviser to the governor told the outlet. “They had six months to get ready for very serious strategic questions, the most important of which was how to deal with Donald Trump. They had no answers. We are nine months in, and they still have not figured it out.”
Mr DeSantis also cancelled his Sunday media appearances ahead of this announcement, with press secretary Bryan Griffin claiming it was due to scheduling issues. The move prompted questions about the future of his campaign hours before Sunday afternoon’s confirmation.
The Independent has contacted the DeSantis campaign for additional comment.

At least one shooter opened fire around 2 a.m. local time at a Katy, Texas, residence authorities believe had been contracted as a short-term rental, according to the Harris County Sheriff’s Office.
“We believe this was a small gathering that turned deadly,” Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said at a news briefing. “It appears there were a number of people inside the residence – possibly, just guessing, between 10 and 20 people.”
A man and a woman died at the scene, while another man died at a nearby hospital, Gonzalez said. At least two people were hospitalized and their conditions are unknown. It’s possible others were wounded as well, according to the sheriff.
None of the victims have been identified, though authorities say the guests were believed to be in their 20s. Investigators are now working to identify any suspects and to determine how many people opened fire.
A motive has not been determined but officials believe “many” rounds were fired, with early evidence suggesting shots were discharged inside and outside of the residence, Gonzalez said.
“We don’t know if there was some type of disturbance that broke out amongst the invited guests or the people that were already inside, or if it’s somebody that showed up unannounced, some type of targeted attack,” Gonzalez said. “That will be part of our investigation.”
While authorities initially said the house has possibly been rented out through Airbnb, the company released a statement saying that was not the case.
A deputy arrived at the scene on the 4600 block of Russet Leaf Trace within minutes of being notified and observed at least one person already dead, according to the sheriff.
“It was a very active scene,” Gonzalez said. “It was very chaotic upon the deputy’s arrival.”
Katy is about 30 miles west of Houston.

“After affirming to the campaign that your pooler would attend the events, NBC News was informed at about 2:20pmET that the pool would not be allowed to travel with Trump today,” the pool report stated.
It’s believed by sources at the network that the campaign refused to allow Hillyard in the pool because of his questions on Saturday to Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY), a Trump surrogate, about the E. Jean Carroll case. A jury last year found Trump liable for sexual assault of Carroll and later defaming her, and a trial is currently taking place in New York largely to determine additional damages.
“Do you believe E. Jean Carroll?” Hillyard asked.
Stefanik said, “They are all witch hunts against Donald Trump and the reason is he is pulling ahead of Joe Biden.”
She seemed to be irritated by the question and added, “The media is so biased. This is just another example of the media being out of touch…”
Hillyard added, “It’s not me. It’s not the media, it’s a jury that found…”
Stefanik added, “The media is so out of touch with the American people. Like 2016, you are going to see the American people speak out loudly and clearly with their vote.”
Puck first reported on the Trump campaign’s restriction of Hillyard.
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Dean Phillips, D-Mn, blasted President Biden as ""unelectable and weak"" during a campaign event in New Hampshire, where Biden is set to skip the first Democratic presidential primary this week.
Phillips is challenging Biden in the Democratic primary, and New Hampshire represents his top opportunity. Biden chose to skip the state's primary entirely after New Hampshire declined to give up its first primary slot to South Carolina.
While Biden supporters are organizing a write-in campaign to prevent Phillips from securing a win, he still says he hopes to secure upward of 20% of the vote.
""Sadly it's going to demonstrate that our incumbent president is unelectable and weak and I think it's going to show this country that there's a candidate here who can actually do here what has been promised for generations,"" Phillips told reporters at a campaign event.

Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang endorsed Phillips in New Hampshire last week, saying Biden's aged candidacy was stifling the Democratic Party.

While Yang was complimentary of Biden, he ultimately said that the party will struggle to ""reinvent grandpa.""
""He is a substantial, accomplished president. I campaigned for him in 2020. I endorsed him,"" Yang said of Biden. ""He’s a good man, a true public servant and a great American. He was the right candidate four years ago. He is not the right candidate for 2024.""
Polls have repeatedly shown in recent months that overwhelming majorities of Americans, and even Democrats, believe Biden is too old to lead effectively in a second term.

FWVQQNB20F_HEYQ34SGX89QIFA,"Years after civil war, security wall holds back Iraqi city",Abdel Khaleq Al-Samarrai,"January 21, 2024 at 12:13 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/years-civil-war-security-wall-031345556.html,"Khaled Ibrahim dreams of a home on the outskirts of Samarra, but a concrete wall built to protect the Iraqi city is stopping him and hampering sorely-needed urban expansion.
Built more than a decade ago at the height of Iraq's civil war which tore apart the multi-faith, multi-ethnic country, authorities say the wall must remain to prevent the threat of jihadist violence, even as security has gradually improved across the country.
Samarra is home to the Al-Askari shrine, one of Shiite Islam's holiest sites and famed for its golden dome, but sits in the predominantly Sunni province of Salahaddin.
An attack by Sunni militant group Al-Qaeda in 2006 destroyed the dome, and set off a brutal sectarian conflict in which tens of thousands of people were killed. A year later, a second attack destroyed the two minarets at the site.
Today the wall around Samarra has also become a burden on daily life in the city that has expanded from 300,000 to 400,000 residents since 2008, pushing up property and land costs.
""It's a nightmare, worse than a prison,"" said Ibrahim.
The 52-year-old and his two sons, who all work as day labourers, currently rent accommodation in Samarra for around $180 a month, which for them is a small fortune.
Ibrahim has a plot of land just outside the city walls where he would like to build a house, but he is becoming increasingly frustrated that the fortified barrier makes this impossible.
""The security forces do not allow us to approach the wall,"" he said.
""And then there are no services, no water, no electricity. Building beyond the wall is like living in exile.""
In the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, 110 kilometres (70 miles) to the south, many of the blast walls that once surrounded key streets, embassies and government offices are being taken down.
But in Samarra, small, unfinished cinderblock houses languish just inside the city's wall. On the other side, abandoned plots stretch as far as the eye can see.
- 'Sleeper cells' remain a threat -
There are three tightly controlled checkpoints in the barriers allowing access into Samarra, which is home to the remains of what was the capital of the Abassid caliphate in the ninth century, now a UNESCO heritage site.
Aware of residents' frustrations, authorities intend to overhaul the wall, with work to start within a month.
They plan to extend its perimeter by three to seven kilometres, increase the number of entry points to six, and add watchtowers and surveillance cameras.
""We would have liked to remove it, but there are obligations and security plans which mandated its presence,"" Riyad al-Tayyas, the deputy governor of Salahaddin, told AFP.
Tayyas said that building outside the wall was not officially banned, but he acknowledged that the barrier's presence was hindering urban expansion.
Residents opt not to build on the other side, fearing ""they will find themselves cut off from the rest of the city"", Tayyas said.
Nevertheless, he insisted lingering worries over security meant the barrier must stay.
This is to ensure there was no ""repeat of the catastrophe of 2006, which led to a sectarian war"", he told AFP.
""Even though the security situation has improved, there are still sleeper cells"" of the Islamic State group (IS), he said.
A UN report in 2023 noted a drop in the frequency of IS attacks in urban centres but also warned that the group has maintained a presence in its strongholds, including around Salahaddin.
Tayyas's position chimes with the concerns of some Samarra residents such as 64-year-old retiree Laith Ibrahim, who said he was in favour of extending the wall's perimeter.
""In Samarra, inside the city, the security situation is excellent... Outside, it's exposed,"" he said.
But there is also ""a shortage of land, housing,"" he said. ""Real estate (prices) are soaring day after day.""

Source: a Facebook post by Merezhko, as reported by European Pravda
Details: The lawmaker said the state ""must have some basic sense of self-respect"".
""It is completely unacceptable to pretend that nothing is happening when a leader of another state makes remarks that call the sovereignty of the state into question. This is a red line that requires a decisive and unequivocal response, especially when the leader of the other state is making such disgraceful claims ahead of a visit to the state whose sovereignty he denies,"" he said.
Merezhko added: ""In such cases, the visit should be cancelled, and the Foreign Ministry should issue a statement to protect the sovereignty and honour of its state.""
The Ukrainian official wrote the post following the latest wave of anti-Ukrainian remarks from Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who is scheduled to visit Ukraine on Wednesday.
However, in comments under his post, Merezhko refused to either confirm or deny that he had formulated this demand in response to the Slovak prime minister’s remarks, stressing that it was his ""general observation as a lawyer in the field of international law"".
Background:
Fico said Ukraine was a state under ""absolute US influence"" and hinted that it would have to give up part of its territory to Russia.""There has to be some kind of compromise, which will be very painful for both sides. What do they expect? The Russians to leave Crimea, Donbas and Luhansk? That’s not realistic,"" Fico said.
The Slovak prime minister noted that he intends to announce at the meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Denys Shmyhal that he will block Ukraine's accession to NATO in every possible way.
Previously, during a press conference with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Fico reiterated his earlier claim that Russia's war against Ukraine ""has no military solution"".
Later, he resorted to blatantly parroting the Russian propaganda narrative that the West had ""forbidden the Ukrainian political leadership to conclude a truce"" with Russia at the start of the full-scale invasion because it ""relied on the idea that by pouring billions [of dollars] and weapons into Ukraine, Ukraine would deliver the wounded Russian bear on a plate"".

Thus, even though the independence-oriented Lai won the presidency, 59 percent of the vote was “China-friendly.” Also, Lai’s party lost its majority in the legislature. His “agenda will be hamstrung by the DPP losing its majority in the legislature. The Kuomintang’s ability to block Lai will make him look fragile to Beijing …”
Lai, in his post-election comments, emphasized democracy saying the election was “writing a new chapter in our democracy. We have shown the world how much we cherish our democracy…Taiwan will continue to walk side by side with democracies from around the world. ... The Taiwanese people have successfully resisted efforts from external forces (i.e., China) to influence this election.” These words by Lai were provocative regarding an authoritarian China and tracked nicely with U.S. foreign policy as being a democratic versus authoritarian approach to the world. Lai was challenging China and siding with the U.S. He went too far, I believe.
We cannot let the tail wag the dog in the relationships among Taiwan, the U.S., and China. A vote in Taiwan cannot determine the future of Taiwan. It is a matter of international law and geopolitics. The U.S. recognizes China’s sovereignty over Taiwan in the One-China policy. This is based on sound history. China’s claim goes back to at least the 17th century. The U.S. fiction, after the Communist Party took over authority in 1949, that Taiwan (known then as Republic of China) was the
government of all of China and Mongolia, with the Republic of China being the representative of China in the UN, was the reason Taiwan is not a part of China today. This fiction cannot be allowed to divert our perception of legal reality. Moreover, once President Carter recognized China in 1979, with Taiwan as part of it as a result of the Shanghai Communique by Nixon of 1972, the U.S. tried to have it both ways by passing the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, whereby it arranged to provide Taiwan with military aid to defend itself. This was done under the leadership of the conservative Senator Barry Goldwater. But for the U.S. fictions and interference, Taiwan would no doubt be unified with China today.
From a geopolitical perspective, Taiwan is a mere 100 miles off China’s coast. As we move to a multipolar world, with China as a great power, the U.S. has no business operating right off of China’s coast. Perhaps, China could agree not to operate in Cuba off the U.S. coast if the U.S. agrees to not operate in Taiwan. Regional balance of power may be the formula for peace in the coming multipolar world order.
Taiwan is an attractive polity. According to Nicholas Kristof, who lived in Taiwan in the 1980s studying the Chinese language, and who has visited frequently, Taiwan is today “a thriving democracy with a free press and excellent quality of life ... a first-rate national health system, legalized same-sex marriage and greatly expanded opportunities for women and girls, longer life expectancy than the United States, minimal homelessness, safe from crime ... with some of the best food in the world.”
It will be hard for the U.S. accept Taiwan becoming a physical part of authoritarian China, as has Hong Kong. But this is reality under the rule of law and as part of a multipolar world. The U.S. cannot control the whole world, and we do not need to risk a nuclear war to try.

G6P4TBXH4B_XOE68VPL9ER4PD3,Cartel human smuggling business is turning entire border towns into war zones,Luis Chaparro,"January 22, 2024 at 2:51 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/cartel-human-smuggling-business-turning-175159268.html,"CIUDAD JUÁREZ – Mexican drug cartels are making millions in profits from the hundreds of thousands of migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border and are now turning entire border towns into war zones.
The money left by the migrants trying to get across the border wall from Mexico into the U.S. to criminal organizations that are charging to guide them across, extorting them or kidnapping them is creating a multimillion-dollar illegal business. Now the different criminal organizations operating across the border are fighting to death for a piece of the pie.
From small towns like Sonoyta, across the border from Lukeville, Arizona, to entire cities like Ciudad Juárez, across the river from El Paso, Texas, different cartels are killing each other and challenging Mexican authorities to gain control of the smuggling routes.
In a video from Dec. 29 shared online from Sonoyta, Sonora in northern Mexico, an SUV with several armed men around it is set on fire during a violent gunfight between alleged members of a local criminal organization with ties to the Sinaloa Cartel and the Mexican army, according to local news outlets.
MEXICAN CARTEL BASES USED TO SPY ON ENEMIES, DISPATCH HITMEN
The gunfight lasted for several hours, according to Sonora state authorities. The gunmen used AK-47s and AR-15s to fight authorities. After the gunfight, only five of over a dozen henchmen were captured, according to authorities.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
Several videos from the same gunfight were shared online by locals where sicarios are seen firing their weapons at authorities barely managing to stay put. The main international bridge between Sonoyta and Lukeville remained closed for days after the incident, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) authorities.
""This last one (shooting) was probably the most publicized because the videos made it to mainstream news, but it is not the first one. This is all because of the amount of migrants arriving to this town,"" Joel Pérez, a local Sonoyta resident, told Fox News Digital.
DEADLY CARTEL DRONE ATTACK STRIKES REMOTE MEXICAN VILLAGE
A few weeks back, on Dec. 4, the same bridge was closed for a full day by U.S. authorities regarding a large number of migrants arriving at the border and overwhelming U.S. border authorities' capacities.
The Tucson sector, where Lukeville sits, is one of the busiest sectors on the southern border, recording over 300,000 migrant crossings in FY 2023 alone.
On Jan. 2 in the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas, 31 migrants were kidnapped by a convoy of cartel members while riding a bus heading toward the city of Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville.
The group was stopped in the middle of the night on a highway by armed men who ordered them to get off the bus and board several pickup trucks. The migrants had to pay over $2,000 each to be released, according to Mexican news outlets that obtained proof of the ransom. The group was freed 24 hours later.
MEXICAN CARTELS FORCE LOCALS TO COVER BOOTLEG WI-FI COSTS UNDER THREAT OF DEATH
A cartel member in Ciudad Juárez, across El Paso, Texas, who oversees human smuggling operations for a local criminal gang, said that over the past two years the illegal business around immigration has become ""more profitable than ever before"".
""No one wants to work on anything else right now. Everyone wants to work with the migrants because you can make a lot of money from it these days and it is easy work,"" the cartel member told Fox News Digital, at the request of remaining anonymous.
""Right now it is more profitable to smuggle migrants than to traffic bricks of cocaine, and with less risk if you get caught,"" he said.
The attorney general in Chihuahua, César Jáuregui, where Ciudad Juárez is located, also said the city is ""[experiencing] a spike in homicides"" as a direct consequence of the number of migrants arriving to the city and the illegal business around them.
""Criminals are finding a profitable business in migrants and abusing them to bleed more money from them, and this is increasing as more large numbers [of migrants] keep arriving in the city or transiting along the state,"" Jáuregui said.
MEXICAN SOLDIERS FIND FACTORY PRODUCING DRONE BOMBS, GRENADE LAUNCHERS, FAKE MILITARY UNIFORMS
Overall the U.S.-Mexico border had record-setting numbers during 2023 for migrant apprehensions, with more than 225,000 in the first 27 days of December, according to U.S. Border Patrol statistics.
""It is cruel that we have to go to criminals to help us navigate through the border or get killed, we come running from very similar situations in our countries, only to find more of that here in Mexico,"" Alfonso Robles, a Venezuelan migrant in Ciudad Juárez told Fox News Digital.
Robles left Venezuela after a local gang began extorting his small business, threatening to kill him. He traveled from Venezuela to the U.S.-Mexico border along with his wife and his 7-year-old daughter.
""As soon as we entered Mexico they started to extort us, or try to kidnap us. Right now we don’t know what else to do because the (U.S.) government is not allowing us to get into the United States and wait there, but here, it's only a question of time before a criminal group finds us and takes us,"" Robles said.
The same cartel member in Ciudad Juárez confirmed that two gangs, one affiliated with the Juarez cartel and another with Sinaloa Cartel, are fighting for the human smuggling business, and that the turf war has extended to U.S. border cities.
""This business is not only on this (Mexican) side of the border, it is also leaving millions in the U.S. to American smugglers, so they are also fighting for this business over there,"" the smuggler said.

Brian Kemp told world business leaders Thursday.
Speaking as part of a panel focused on electric vehicles at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the Republican governor highlighted the construction of the Georgia Power’s two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle, near Augusta — the country’s first new reactors in decades.
“We’ve done as much as anybody in the country ... but we’re going to have to have more,” Kemp said, although he did not call for closing any current power plants that burn coal, natural gas or oil
[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]
It’s Kemp’s second year in a row to visit the forum of world business and political leaders. He told The Associated Press on Thursday in Davos that the trip is aimed at “really just selling the state from an economic development standpoint.”
That includes touting the electricity produced at Plant Vogtle. One of the reactors in the $31 billion project is generating power, while the other is expected to reach commercial operation in coming months.
“We’re letting people know that we got a great airport, great seaport, got a great energy supply with our two nuclear reactors that are online and coming online,” Kemp said.
The fellow members of Kemp’s panel said that electric vehicles need to be made with electricity that isn’t produced by burning coal, oil or natural gas that emits world-warming carbon dioxide. Zeng Yuqun, founder and chairman of Chinese battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL, said a “dirty battery,” or one produced with lots of carbon emissions, is “big trouble.”
“That’s why I’m looking for sustainability in all of this very quickly,” said Zeng, one of China’s richest people.
Kemp, who said Georgia is “well on our way” to achieving his goal of being the “e-mobility capital of the world,” said he hears the need for clean energy from firms such as Hyundai Motor Group and Rivian Automotive.
“Talking to the companies that we’re recruiting, people that are looking to the state, they obviously want to produce with clean energy,” Kemp said.
It’s another instance of how Kemp has shied away from tackling climate change directly, but has welcomed some changes in the name of business recruitment.

The governor said he would look to electric utility Georgia Power Co. and its Atlanta-based parent, Southern Co., to meet those clean energy needs. But environmentalists have panned a current request from Georgia Power to increase its generating capacity largely using fossil fuels.
Kemp told the AP that he remains confident in his push to recruit electric vehicle makers, despite a slowdown in electric vehicle sales in the United States. He blamed a law backed by President Joe Biden that included big incentives for buying American-made electric vehicles, saying it “tried to push the market too quick.”
“I think the market’s resetting a little bit now,” Kemp said. “But I do not think that’s going to affect the Georgia suppliers — everybody’s still very bullish on what’s going on in Georgia. And I am too.”
[SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter]
Kemp told the panel the biggest challenge in Georgia’s electric vehicle push is making sure manufacturers and their suppliers can hire enough employees.
“That’s the big thing for us, is making sure we have the workforce,” Kemp said.

G9LMAFOI9N_YKQRMCSHE5BK99V,Johnny Appleseed biography includes stories of his ties to Mansfield,"Mark Caudill, Mansfield News Journal","January 21, 2024 at 7:20 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/johnny-appleseed-biography-includes-stories-102013502.html,"During his travels from Pennsylvania to Indiana, John Chapman passed through many places and influenced many people.
Better known as Johnny Appleseed, he spent significant time in Mansfield, living in and around here for about 20 years, between 1810 and 1830.
Readers can learn a lot more about the enigmatic figure in the book ""Johnny Appleseed: The Man Behind the Folklore,"" by Mark Bodanza.
Bodanza and Appleseed share the same hometown, Leominster, Massachusetts. Bodanza is a lawyer, author and city councilor. ""Johnny Appleseed"" is his 13th nonfiction book.
""As a Leominster native, I felt a certain obligation to tell John Chapman's story,"" Bodanza said. ""I have had a keen interest in history since grade school and have been vigorously pursuing that with writing and research over the last two decades.""
Bodanza said Appleseed's time in Mansfield coincided with the War of 1812.
""He interacted with the natives,"" Bodanza said. ""In at least a couple of cases, he warned the settlers of impending native attacks.""
Bodanza relayed a couple of Mansfield-centric anecdotes about Appleseed. When asked if people would have the same professions in heaven, Appleseed replied they would.
A lawyer asked about his profession.
""You guys don't go to heaven,"" Appleseed said. ""You are mired in mud and get to sling it at each other for eternity.""
In another case, a traveling preacher asked for the location of the ""barefoot Christian traveling to heaven.""
Appleseed, who was laying on a piece of timber, lifted his foot in acknowledgement.
While Appleseed was considered a local hero, he was also a bit of an enigma, Bodanza said, adding nearly half of the nation doesn't even believe he existed.
Appleseed was born on the eve of the American Revolution and was a man who heeded the westward call of the frontier. He set out on a mission that not only included propagating apple seedlings but also spreading deep-seated religious beliefs along with his mindful way of life.
""Everything about Johnny Appleseed is not entirely clear,"" Bodanza said. ""He's an enigmatic figure.""
The author said a 1948 Disney film popularized Appleseed.
""I don't think he would have gotten as much publicity in modern times if not for that film,"" Bodanza said.
Next year will mark the 250th anniversary of Appleseed's birth.
Known for going barefoot, Appleseed lived the ""simplest of lives.""
""He was the ultimate minimalist before the term was invented,"" Bodanza said.
He said he didn't realize what a thoughtful and purposeful life Appleseed led.
""It was difficult to capture in words,"" Bodanza said of trying to define Appleseed. ""He can't been contained to one place. It's almost like he was a spirit.""
Appleseed has a historical marker in Mansfield at the intersection of Brinkerhoff Avenue and Summit Street.
He is recognized in other area towns. In Wayne County, the village of Apple Creek holds a Johnny Appleseed Festival, scheduled this year for July 26-27.
In Mifflin, just off Ohio 603 in Ashland County, sits the now-closed Johnny Appleseed Amphitheater. It opened in 2004 but closed the next year, in part, because of poor attendance for a play documenting Appleseed's life.
""I'm truly happy I finally took on an examination of Chapman's life,"" Bodanza said. ""It has a great deal of relevance to the times we live in and life generally. At the very least, Johnny Appleseed will always speak to us about introspection and the world around us.""
Bodanza's biography is available on Amazon and the Barnes & Noble website by searching the author's name. ""Johnny Appleseed: The Man Behind the Folklore"" is also available at bodanza.com.

G9OTYVWP1Q_16MDZZ6JFPZNMU2,Bwari kidnapping: Nigeria police secure release of sisters taken from Abuja,Oliver Slow - BBC News,"January 21, 2024 at 7:41 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/bwari-kidnapping-nigeria-police-secure-104147271.html,"Nigerian police say they have successfully rescued five sisters who were held hostage after being kidnapped in the country's capital.
The girls were freed in a joint police-army operation in a forest in northern Nigeria on Saturday night.
They were taken from their home in Abuja earlier this month, along with another sister who was later killed.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom for their release, but the statement made no mention of one being paid.
Nigerian police said the girls had been reunited with their family following the operation, which took place near the Kajuru forest in Kaduna State at around 23:30 local time (22:30 GMT) on Saturday.
The six sisters, aged from the early teens to 23, were taken hostage alongside their father, Mansoor Al-Kadriyar, on 2 January at the family home in Bwari, a suburb of Abuja.
Witnesses said the girls' uncle ran to find help but was ambushed and killed, as were three police officers.
The kidnappers released Mansoor on the condition he raise a large ransom, but his 21-year-old daughter, Nabeeha, a final year university student, was then killed as a warning, according to a family member who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity.
BBC Africa Live: Updates from the continent
Kidnapping has become rife in Nigeria, with hundreds of people abducted in recent years, largely by criminal gangs who see it as an easy way to make money. It has been particularly bad in the north-west of the country.
The case of the Al-Kadriyar sisters prompted widespread anger in the country, with many arguing that the kidnapping emergency has continued despite government promises to bring it to an end.
First Lady Remi Tinubu urged security agencies to ""intensify their efforts"" to end the kidnapping and security crisis, and demanded a ""swift return of the Al-Kadriyar sisters"".
The ransom for the girls' return was set at 65m naira ($68,000; £53,000), leading to many Nigerians donating to a crowdfunding initiative.
However, Defence Minister Mohammed Badaru Abubakar urged people not to contribute towards the ransom, saying it would ""only worse the situation"".
""We believe we have to stop - as painful as it is. We have to stop responding to payment on ransom. If we stop, over time the kidnapping will not be profitable and they will stop,"" he said.
No matter how desperate the circumstances, Nigerian law prohibits the payment of ransom money. However, many victims pay up because they do not trust authorities to secure the release of their loved ones.
There has now been an outcry that the insecurity has reached the capital, prompting Abuja's police force to launch a special squad to tackle the kidnapping gangs.
Mr Abubakar said he believed operations against the gangs elsewhere had forced them to move to areas near the capital.
""The security agencies are working very hard to push them out and block the movements and finish them off once and for all,"" he said.

GAZZT3JRB4_FI0IFLS2Z85AVTO,"‘SNL’ mocks Trump court cases, presidential campaign in first cold open of 2024",Miranda Nazzaro,"January 21, 2024 at 10:49 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/snl-mocks-trump-court-cases-134954589.html,"Saturday Night Live kicked off its 2024 season with a parody of former President Trump’s ongoing legal battles and standing in this year’s race for the White House.
The cold open sketch began outside of a fake New York City courtroom with Trump attorney Alina Habba, played by Chloe Fineman, where she called the judge in the former president’s defamation trial “very unfair,” and ridiculed Habba’s experience.
“And I want to make this perfectly clear, I am new at this and I am learning,” Fineman said. “Now, the president may or may not stop for brief remarks, but due to a strict gag order, he will not be commenting on anything pertaining to this case, Miss Carroll or the judge.”
Trump last week appeared for a defamation trial in New York City where a jury convened to determine how much the former president has to pay for defaming longtime advice columnist E. Jean Carroll. It comes after a jury last year concluded Trump sexually abused Carroll in the mid-1990s at a New York City department store and later defamed her. Trump has denied the claims and repeatedly criticized Carroll, whom he claims has wrongly accused him.
Moments later, Trump — played by James Austin Johnson — entered before mocking his own legal team.
“You’re great on TV,” Johnson said to Fineman. “Maybe the worst lawyer I’ve ever had, which is quite an accomplishment. Look at this team… this is the bottom of the barrel, folks, this is who said yes. I’m in the lead for president, and this is the best I can get. Feels like a red flag, no?”
Johnson addressed the group of lawyers standing behind him, saying “You’re not getting paid, by the way.” The lawyers then left the scene and Johnson said he will be “abiding by this horrible gag order,” and proceeded to discuss the case, a violation of a gag order.
“So I will not be saying that the judge is an idiot or where he lives or what kind of crappy car he drives,” Johnson said.
The judge in Trump’s separate civil fraud trial in New York imposed a gag order in October, barring the former president and his counsel from making public comments about the trial judge’s staff after Trump made false claims about the judge’s principal law clerk. Trump was later issued a fine of $10,000 for violating the order.
Johnson eventually turned the focus to the 2024 election, where Trump remains the GOP frontrunner in a field that has reduced to himself, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley.
Referencing Trump’s win in the Iowa caucuses last week, Johnson said, “We just got back from Iowa, where we won. Very big, very big in Iowa.”
“I want to congratulate Mr. DeSantis on a truly embarrassing showing,” Johnson continued. “He went to 99 counties, but b**** couldn’t win one. Ron DeStupid, Ron DeStupid. It just works.”
Johnson went on to congratulate biotech Vivek Ramaswamy, who dropped out last Monday after receiving low support in the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Trump.
“[Ramaswamy] dropped out of the race and has agreed to live in my suit pocket. I love my little ‘Ratatouille,'” he said.
Johnson nodded to the upcoming primary in New Hampshire this week where he will face off against DeSantis and Haley, whom he said “thought I was done, but I’m back in a big way.”
Trump continues to lead in New Hampshire, according to a polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ, though Haley has narrowed that lead and surpassed DeSantis for second place in recent weeks.
Johnson compared himself to President Biden, his likely rival for the White House this year, claiming the president “sniffs little girls’ hair.”
“I am different, of course, I do far worse than that. You ever see that video of me dancing with Epstein? Boy, is that some dark energy,” Johnson said, adding later,  “I wouldn’t be surprised if that footage is fake. Of course, it’s very real, but you have to think, in many ways, it could not be.”
This was seemingly a reference to the video released in 2019 showing Trump and the late financier Jeffrey Epstein interacting at a party in 1992. The former president was shown dancing with women and talking and laughing and raised questions over the extent of Trump’s relationship with Epstein, who was charged with sex trafficking and was later found dead in his jail cell ahead of his trial in 2019. His death was ruled a suicide.
Johnson’s Trump referenced the former president’s absence from the GOP debate stage and the apparent loyalty from some of his voters.
“But I love this country and its traditions. That’s why I’m not doing any debates and barely doing elections. I don’t need to, my people love me. I got the old people, they’re waiting in snow for two hours to vote for Trump.”
Ending the nearly five-minute dialogue, Johnson offered a look at the future for Trump, saying, “But 2024 is going to be a very exciting year. I’m either going to jail, be president or frankly, ‘The Purge,'” in reference to the film where all crime is legal for 12 hours one day a year.

However, a stretch of dry weather may be on the horizon later this week for portions of Central and Southern California.
A storm tracking into the West Coast will continue to bring soaking rain to locations from Washington to California through Monday night. Additional rainfall totals could range between 1-2.5 inches in some areas along the central and northern coasts. In the foothill areas to the south of Klamath National Forest, Shasta-Trinity National Forest and Lassen National Forest could contend with locally higher amounts of 3-4 inches from this latest storm.
Farther south, across a large part of Southern California, steadier rain is in store. Some of that rain may fall at a heavy enough rate to lead to urban flooding. Downtown Los Angeles observed 0.41 of an inch of rain on Saturday, Jan. 20, and a trace of rain on Sunday, Jan. 21. As of 10 a.m., close to 0.80 of an inch of rain had fallen for Monday. Through Monday evening, Los Angeles can tally storm total rainfall amounts of 1.50 to 2 inches.
""Dry weather returns across most of the state on Tuesday, then another piece of energy will move into the Northwest that can bring showers to Northern and Central California again,"" added AccuWeather Meteorologist Haley Taylor.
Localized roadway flooding will continue to be a concern through Monday night as this band of rain tracks through the City of Angels. Nearby mountain locations can pick up even more rain, with localized totals upwards of 2-3 inches. Along the coast, there can even be a few rumbles of thunder.
Coastal flood advisories and beach hazard statements were put in place through the end of the weekend, warning of strong rip currents, high surf, localized beach erosion and flooded roads along the coast.

As the storm pushes inland Monday night and Tuesday, rain will begin to overspread towns in Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. Cooler air lingering in the parts of northern Arizona, south-central Utah, and western Colorado will allow for occasional snow showers in the highest elevations. Snow levels across the region will generally remain above 6,500 feet.
Falling temperatures in Flagstaff, Arizona, as the storm moves through the region, will allow for snow showers at times through Tuesday morning. Daytime highs will stay mainly in the 30s through early week with overnight lows below the freezing mark. Snowfall totals are projected to range between 1-3 inches early this week in Flagstaff, with the chance for 6 inches in the highest levels above 7,500 feet.
By Tuesday, a zone of high pressure will push into the Southwest coast and promote drier conditions for many California and western Nevada residents. Meanwhile, a separate storm will begin barreling into the Northwest with additional coastal rain and snow in the mountains.
The late-week pattern across the West will favor drier conditions to the South and continued damp and dreary weather to the north. Cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles could experience a stretch of dry weather from late week into early next week, potentially longer if the pattern of high pressure persists.
On Sunday, Jan. 28, the San Francisco 49ers will take on the Detroit Lions in their home field, Levi's Stadium, in Santa Clara, California.

GF9ZD49CBV_OATSBY1B4OR1PAG,Irish government will be involved if Stormont does not return - Alliance MP,BBC,"January 21, 2024 at 9:38 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/irish-government-involved-stormont-does-123820637.html,"The Irish government will have an increased say in Northern Ireland's affairs if devolved government is not restored, an Alliance Party MP has said.
Stephen Farry said there'll be ""no choice"" but for Dublin to be part of a plan B for governing Northern Ireland.
A legal deadline to restore devolution in Northern Ireland passed on Friday.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been blocking devolution since early 2022.
It is facing pressure to back a new deal to end the impasse, but made no decision when its 12 party officers, including leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, met on Friday.
Northern Ireland's government collapsed after the DUP withdrew in protest against post-Brexit trade checks between the region and Great Britain.
Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is expected to set out the next steps in Parliament in the coming days, after a legal deadline for the restoration of devolution passed.
He is now under legal obligation to call an early assembly election, but he has pushed back this deadline several times before and has indicated he will do so again.
There has been much speculation on how Northern Ireland will be governed if Stormont does not return, with one senior Conservative MP indicating that traditional direct rule is off the table and suggesting there would be an increased role for the Irish government.
Unionists, including the DUP, have said they would be strongly opposed to Dublin's involvement in Northern Ireland.
However, Mr Farry, Alliance's deputy leader, said there would be no other option if Stormont does not return.
""It will be a consultative role [for the Irish government], not an executive role because that takes us into a different space,"" he told BBC News NI's Sunday Politics programme.
""But, absolutely, the principle of an Irish government having a consultative say was established in 1985 under the Anglo-Irish Agreement and I find it utterly bizarre that some people who are rejecting moving forward under a restored assembly are saying: 'Well, we can always have direct rule as a fall back.'""
Mr Farry added that he did not believe ""we're necessarily going to see an Irish dimension straight away but there will be pressure applied in that particular respect"".
""I don't see it at a very granular level, it will be at a high level in terms of those engagements but that is the direction of travel.
""And for those that are seeking direct rule as a fall back they have to be extremely aware of where this is going to go and it's bizarre and illogical in terms of the position they're taking.""
The DUP withdrew from power-sharing in February 2022 over its objection to what was known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - the post-Brexit rules that would oversee how trade operates between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
The UK agreed a new deal with the European Union called the Windsor Framework aimed at addressing issues with the previous deal, but the DUP said this did not go far enough and the party has been in talks with the government.
Before Christmas the government offered a £3.3bn package if devolution was restored, but the DUP said more changes were needed.
Pressure is building on the party, however, particularly over pay for public sector workers.
More than 100,000 workers including nurses, teachers and civil servants took part in the biggest strike seen in Northern Ireland in decades on Thursday.
Sixteen trade unions were involved in the industrial action that halted bus and train services, closed schools and disrupted health services.
Of that £3.3bn offered by the government, £548m is earmarked to address public sector pay issues - but Mr Heaton-Harris has said this will only be released if power-sharing government returns."

On Dec. 22, Gulfport police were called to a home to do a welfare check on a possible missing person, according to a Facebook post by the police department.
Detectives questioned 66-year-old Jerri Lynn Isreal at the time.
Five days later, on Dec. 27, detectives followed up with Isreal but say they began to notice some discrepancies.
“Throughout the course of the investigation, Isreal became increasingly uncooperative and changed her statements multiple times,” police said.
Investigators discovered that Isreal was convicted of murder in 1995 in Florida and “made several attempts to dump the deceased subject at different locations throughout Florida.”
After learning this, they obtained a search warrant for the residence.
On Jan. 18, detectives searched the home and found a wooden box behind a false wall. Inside the box, police say they found the body of John Allen Gaither.
Gaither, 42, was Isreal’s son, according to WLOX.
The box was described as a “military locker-style container,” according to Magnolia State Live.
At the time police searched the home, they said Isreal was taken to a hospital for medical treatment.
She was then taken to the Harrison County Adult Detention Center to be held in lieu of her bond.
Isreal was charged with first-degree murder on Jan. 20, police say.

Haley asked Republican voters to consider Trump’s age after he appeared to mix her up with Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during a campaign speech in Concord, New Hampshire, on Friday.
Trump blamed his former ambassador to the United Nations for the Jan. 6 attacks, an accusation he’s repeatedly aimed at Pelosi, who was then speaker of the House.
“I wasn’t in D.C. on Jan. 6th,” said Haley, who left the Trump administration at the end of 2018. “I had nothing to do with the Capitol.”
Nikki Haley speaks to reporters after a campaign stop at the Monadnock Center for History & Culture on Saturday.
“It’s things like that,” she continued in footage from USA Today. “He said multiple times that he ran against President Obama. He didn’t run against President Obama. These things happen because, guess what? When you’re 80, that’s what happens. You’re just not as sharp as you used to be.”
New Hampshire governor and Haley supporter Chris Sununu echoed her concerns on “Meet the Press” Sunday, telling host Kristin Welker, “I mean, look, the point is you have two nearly 80-year-olds fighting this thing out.”
“That’s not what America wants. That is a great example of, this is not Donald Trump, the disruptor of 2016. This guy has lost his fastball.”
President Joe Biden broadcasted Haley’s remarks in a post on X on Sunday.
“I don’t agree with Nikki Haley on everything, but we agree on this much: She is not Nancy Pelosi,” Biden’s account posted along with video of Haley’s criticism intertwined with multiple Trump blunders.
Haley and allies’ attacks on Trump’s age comes as she aims for an upset in the New Hampshire primaries, which will be held on Tuesday.
On Sunday, CNN released a poll that showed Haley still trailing behind Trump in the Granite State. According to research conducted by the University of New Hampshire, Trump has the support of 50% of likely Republican primary voters while Haley holds 39%.

GMZXYG3ZPU_V45CDNGO916M6KM,How one mother is fighting to prevent suicide following her daughter's attempts of taking her own life,Emma Pitts,"January 21, 2024 at 9:41 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/one-mother-fighting-prevent-suicide-004158293.html,"Brandy Vega’s daughter was 14 when she sat beside her, not knowing if her daughter was going to survive. “I remember being in the hospital and looking at her lifeless body and praying to God, ‘Please save her.’ Telling him that I would do absolutely anything in the world if he would just give me a second chance,” Vega said. “And by the way, this was our second chance.”
Vega’s daughter had previously tried to take her own life at the age of 12. By a miracle, her daughter survived, but the Utah mom knew she wouldn’t get another chance.
As a mother, Vega realized she had to change the way she approached the conversation of suicide to help her daughter. After her daughter’s first attempt, “We didn’t talk about it. Because of the pain and shame, or fear and all the things, all the reasons we don’t talk about mental health and suicide and addiction, and sexual abuse and trauma,” she said.
On Thursday, Vega shared her family’s journey with mental health in front of a crowd, along with a four-person panel who shared their expertise and tools regarding mental health, at the Mental Health Promise2Live Silicon Slopes Town Hall event.
Vega started Promise2Live as her call to action following her daughter's attempt to take her own life. The event was a way to unite Utah business leaders, supporters and collaborators to discover practical and effective strategies for approaching mental health in the workplace.
“Our mission is to increase awareness in the business sector regarding mental health because people aren’t leaving their mental health issues at home,” panelist Dave Morgan, a licensed psychologist and director of mental health awareness for Silicon Slopes, said in the event Thursday.
Morgan emphasized that mental health struggles are not something people just leave at the door of their businesses when they clock in each day and then pick right back up when they clock out.
According to the latest statistics by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, in 2021, there were an average of 132 suicides per day with 48,183 total deaths by suicide, but an estimated 1.7 million attempts.
“Men died by suicide 3.90 times more than women,” and “white males accounted for 69.68% of suicide deaths in 2021,” the statistics found.
Morgan shared that because mental health is so complex, there are a number of strategies to help a person find solutions to their pain. There are five aspects of a person’s life that he said, although they are separate when you make a change to one, it improves other parts of the brain:
Mental.
Social.
Emotional.
Physical.
Spiritual.
“If you have someone that’s struggling with suicidal behavior, and you’re trying to help them, and maybe spiritual isn’t their thing, but they love to run, (then) physically they can start there, (and) that’s going to have an effect on their system,” Morgan explained. “And maybe they’re not a runner, but they love to connect with someone emotionally. So that’s where they start and begin going to therapy, and that helps. Anything that can be done is a good place to start.”

Record demand for 988 suicide prevention, mental health hotline
“Utah Sen. Daniel Thatcher initiated the idea for a three-digit crisis line in Utah, and it resulted in a national hotline,” per the Utah Senate. In July 2022, the United States launched the 988 crisis hotline for mental health.
“In its first six months, more than 2 million people in crisis have availed themselves of the service, using phone calls, chats and text messages which funnel to local mental health crisis centers. The line is free, confidential and operates all the time,” the Deseret News previously reported.
However, since the launch of 988, Vega stressed that nearly 80% of Americans don’t know it exists.
To bring awareness, Vega gave each guest a small medallion that she called pocket hugs. “When times are tough and you don’t know what to do, here is a hug from me to you,” the Promise2Live token reads with the 988 crisis hotline information on it as well.
Having open and honest communication with your loved ones can be pivotal in saving a person's life; Vega said, “Honest questions, get honest answers.” Vega encouraged the audience to go home and ask their loved ones if they are okay, if they are struggling or having thoughts of suicide.
“You will not plant the idea. You will open the conversation for real love and support and a genuine connection,” she added.
If you or someone you know is in crisis, please contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988 or chatting online at 988lifeline.org."

“You don’t need a lot of money to buy your first real estate deal, contrary to what people say,” he said in a recent YouTube video. “I work with people that do this stuff with no money down, a little bit of money down, traditional loans, VA loans, FHA loans, mass debt, bridge debt, crowdfunding.”

Cardone credits real estate with creating his own financial success.
“I ultimately turned a $3,000 investment into $5 billion worth of real estate,” he said. “And I know that seems like impossible. […] Real estate is the greatest retirement asset on planet Earth, including 401(k) [plans] and IRAs. I took all my retirement money and IRA money and self-directed it into real estate deals, and it grew at three times the rate that it would have grown in the stock market.”
Of course, not every real estate investment is a winner, especially in the current environment.
“Remember, [for] real estate investors right now, this market is going to get really freakin’ wobbly,” he said. “It’s going to be crazy.”
That’s why Cardone said that it’s essential for any real estate investment you make right now to have these four features.

In the YouTube video, Cardone outlines the most important factors you need to have in any real estate investment.
“Remember these four things: location, cash flow, you’ve got to have an exit and don’t overleverage,” he said.
Of the four factors, Cardone said there is one that should be the primary focus.
“What you want most importantly right now is the location,” he said.
However, cash flow is also essential.
“If it [doesn’t] cash flow, you can’t keep it,” he said. “All real estate is not created equal. It’s got to cash flow. If it doesn’t cash flow, you can’t keep it because you won’t be able to support the mortgage, expenses, the upkeep, etc.”

GUIJJZ3YUR_TV9HZBINQJT82YM,Nestlé S.A.'s (VTX:NESN) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 71% Above Its Share Price,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 4:55 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nestl-vtx-nesn-intrinsic-value-075543574.html,"Nestlé's estimated fair value is CHF166 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
Nestlé's CHF97.43 share price signals that it might be 41% undervalued
Analyst price target for NESN is CHF112 which is 32% below our fair value estimate
Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Nestlé S.A. (VTX:NESN) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.
See our latest analysis for Nestlé
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 0.08%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 4.1%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = CHF19b× (1 + 0.08%) ÷ (4.1%– 0.08%) = CHF471b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= CHF471b÷ ( 1 + 4.1%)10= CHF316b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is CHF444b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of CHF97.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Nestlé as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 4.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Strength
Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.
Weakness
Earnings declined over the past year.
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Food market.
Opportunity
Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Swiss market.
Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.
Threat
Dividends are not covered by cash flow.
Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the Swiss market.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Nestlé, we've put together three important items you should further research:

The regulator is set to publish a document next week outlining options on how Royal Mail can ""evolve to more closely meet consumer needs"".
However, Ofcom - which regulates the postal industry - says it is not commenting on what the options will be.
Royal Mail posted a £319m loss for the first half of this financial year.
The business has been calling for urgent reform since 2020 and previously said it would like to go from delivering six days a week to five, from Monday to Friday only.

A spokesperson for Ofcom confirmed that it will publish evidence on ""how the universal postal service might need to evolve to more closely meet consumer needs"".
""It would ultimately be for the UK government and Parliament to determine whether any changes are needed to the minimum requirements of the universal service,"" they added.
Ofcom announced in September that it would look at evidence on how the universal service, which states letters must be delivered Monday to Saturday, may need to change to reflect how people now use the service.
On Thursday, Martin Seidenberg, chief executive of Royal Mail's owners, International Distribution Services plc, said in its trading statement that while it was doing all it could to transform, ""it is simply not sustainable to maintain a delivery network built for 20 billion letters when we are now only delivering seven billion.""
The legal basis for the universal service is the Postal Services Act 2011. A Department for Business and Trade spokesperson said there were ""no current plans to change the statutory minimum requirements"" - but it would ""carefully consider any advice that Ofcom puts forward""."

Brown Act at two Nov. 2023 meetings. Berkeley resident and Berkeley People’s Alliance Board Member and Nathan Mizell was also listed as a party to the cease-and-desist.
The group alleges that the Brown Act violations occurred at city council meetings on November 21 and 28, 2023 after the meetings were interrupted by protesters.
Multiple weather advisories issued and rainfall expected: NWS
The letter, sent by the law office of Jonathan Weissglass, outlined the legal basis for the Berkeley People’s Alliance’s claims against the city.
The Brown Act, also known as Government Code §54957.9, dictates that when government meetings are willfully interrupted by a group or groups of people, the government body must first attempt to restore order by removing disruptive individuals. If that fails, members of the legislative body can have the room cleared of all attendants–apart from members of the media– and continue in session, ideally readmitting individuals not responsible for the disruption.
Weissglass claims that the Berkeley City Council did not attempt to remove the individuals interrupting the meeting, nor did they attempt to clear the room and re-admit individuals not responsible for the disturbance. Instead, Weissglass said, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguín recessed the meeting and later held the remainder of the meeting in a different location, without allowing the public to be present.
“Although BPA and Mr. Mizell do not condone the use of force to remove individuals who are allegedly willfully interrupting a meeting, the Legislature provided that removal is a prerequisite to holding a City Council meeting without the in-person presence of the public,” Weissglass said in the cease-and-desist letter. “The Legislature has made its decision and that decision must be followed.”
Previously, Berkeley People’s Alliance member Margot Smith sent a letter to the City of Berkeley on Nov. 28, 2023, accusing the city of Brown Act violations at Nov. 14 and Nov. 21, 2023, board meetings.
City representatives were not available for comment on these accusations.

The Warren Group reported Tuesday that record high prices and an insufficient inventory made it a tough year for buyers, and home sales were down by nearly 22.5% in 2023, compared to 2022. The median sale price for a single-family home in Massachusetts last year was $570,000, up about 3.6% over 2022.

A large dumpster was being filled outside Angies Bodywork Spa at Pleasant Street as it appeared workers were clearing out the site of a fatal shooting on Thanksgiving. State regulators have opened an investigation into the business at 383 Pleasant St. Angies Bodyworks does not hold any licenses from the City of Worcester, a city spokesperson said in December. Marcel D. Santos-Padgett, a 31-year-old man from Leicester, was charged with murder in the shooting in Central District Court. He is being held without bail.  Prosecutors have said surveillance video captured Santos-Padgett entering the business around 2 a.m. Thanksgiving and entering a workroom with the victim.

A building off Route 9 that was once used as a roller skating rink will be converted into a self-storage facility and an office building. MA Restoration Inc., a water damage restoration service with offices in Westborough, wants to renovate the property at 161 Milk St. The Planning Board Dec. 12 approved the company’s request for a special permit to redevelop and build on the four-acre property. The existing building, with its faded green exterior, was constructed sometime in the late 1960s, according to property records. With Planning Board approval, MA Restoration looks to convert it into a fully automated self-storage site.

So you can imagine the shock when one American tourist described Australia's impressive coastline as ""mediocre"".
Travel vlogger Grace Cheng recently visited Australia but revealed she didn't like her stay in the country after visiting Melbourne, Sydney, Byron Bay and the Gold Coast.
""If I'm honest none of these cities really stood out to me,"" she told her 75,000 followers.
While she said they were lagging on other cities across the world, it was her remarks about beaches that really hurt.
""Australia's very much known for its nature instead, [but] this trip pretty much consisted of mediocre beaches and city life.""
She also lamented the cost of Australia while said its location ""far away from everywhere else in the world"" was a negative. She did however admit she had a good time and enjoyed the restaurant scene Australia had to offer.
Unsurprisingly, the video triggered a wave of comments from Aussies in disbelief over her claim.

""Anyone who has been to even the Gold Coast and Byron and saying the beaches are bland is baffling,"" one person said, garnering hundreds of likes.
""Our beaches are the best,"" a proud Aussie hit back.
""I've never heard anyone bag Australia like this,"" one stunned user wrote. ""You're joking right?"" another asked.
While there are a raft of different global beach rankings, TripAdvisor's annual list is compiled analysing user's ratings and is well-respected. Last year, two Australian beaches made the top 20 – Broome's Cable Beach and Sydney's Manly Beach.
TikTok's surge in popularity has seen a wave of travel reviews flood the platform, with many users documenting their reactions to all things Aussie.
For Brit Jordana Grace, she loves Australia's beaches, but was left surprised by one trend she hadn't seen before.
“I don't know if this is the same around Australia but here on the Sunshine Coast you leave your shoes by the beach and they’re still there when you get back and I just love it,"" she explained on TikTok.

Siemens' €161 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate
Analyst price target for SIE is €185 which is 4.1% below our fair value estimate
Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Siemens Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:SIE) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.
Check out our latest analysis for Siemens
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = €68b
We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (0.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.3%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = €9.0b× (1 + 0.5%) ÷ (6.3%– 0.5%) = €155b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= €155b÷ ( 1 + 6.3%)10= €84b
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is €152b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of €161, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Siemens as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.164. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Strength
Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.
Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.
Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.
Weakness
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Industrials market.
Opportunity
Annual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the German market.
Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.
Threat
Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the German market.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

Tate Reeves’ tax cut plan for Mississippi,Bobby Harrison,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/green-energy-plant-goes-against-110000104.html,"Tate Reeves may be trying to have his cake and eat it, too.
The Republican governor for years has proclaimed that the state should eliminate the personal income tax to entice people to move to Mississippi. But during his push this week to land legislative funding for a plant to manufacture electric vehicle batteries in north Mississippi, Reeves is now saying that residents of Tennessee, where there is no income tax, will come to Mississippi to work at the plant and decide to move here. He said nothing about the state income tax being a hinderance to their moving to Mississippi from a no-income tax state.
“There is a possibility that some of the employees may come from the state of Tennessee,” Reeves said during a press conference this week. “My expectation is they are going to come down to work for this particular company and see how great it is to live in Mississippi. I think you will see population growth because I do think you will see people moving from all over the country and in fact all over the world to work at this particular company.”
The Legislature did, in fact, approve the at least $350 million incentive package in a one-day special session.
The plant will be located a stone’s throw from the Tennessee state line. There are multiple reasons, including the state’s generous incentive package, for the battery manufacturer to locate in Marshall County.
The transportation outlets available for the plant will be important. The plant will be located on the intersections of U.S. Highway 72 and state Highway 302, both which were four-laned years ago thanks to the forethought of the historic 1987 highway program. There also is a nearby railroad and major airport in Memphis that will be attractive to the companies building the battery plant. In addition, the plant location is near population centers in adjacent DeSoto County in northwest Mississippi and the rest of the Memphis metropolitan area in, yes, Tennessee.
People could actually continue to live in Tennessee, where there is no state income tax, and work at the plant, which means they would be required to pay a Mississippi income tax.
While Reeves is touting eliminating the state income tax, Bill Cork, the governor’s executive director of the Mississippi Development Authority, told legislators one of the many reasons the plant is a good investment for Mississippi is that the workers would be paying state income taxes — an estimated $160 million over 30 years, according to projections shared with lawmakers this week. If the income tax is eliminated, as Reeves wants to do, the state no longer would receive that tax revenue from the workers at the plant. A matter of fact, if Mississippi eliminates the income tax, theoretically Tennessee residents could travel the short distance to Marshall County to work at the plant, collect a paycheck, return home and never spend a dime in the Magnolia State.
Since the plant is located near (very near) the state line and is expected to employ Tennessee residents, the income tax is one of the most effective ways for the state to recoup some of its investment. More Tennesseans than Mississippians live within driving distance of the plant. Republican House members rejected Democrats’ efforts this week to ensure a majority of the workers at the new plant would be Mississippians.
The plant actually will be located in an area of the state that has repeatedly dispelled Reeves’ claim that eliminating the income tax would attract people to Mississippi. That might be true in some instances, but it should be noted that DeSoto County for years has been by far the state’s fastest growing county primarily because people have been moving from Memphis in Tennessee, where there is no income tax, to Mississippi, where there is an income tax — albeit one of the lowest in the country.
People have moved across the state line from Tennessee to Mississippi for a number of reasons. But Mississippi’s modest state income tax has not prevented tens of thousands of people from moving here from a state that, again, does not have an income tax.
As the governor said himself during the news conference, people will move to Mississippi because it “not only is an affordable place to live, but the quality of life is extremely high.”
And Reeves said that if Tennesseans who work at the green energy plant do not move to Mississippi, they at least will be paying the payroll tax to the state — unless, of course, he is successful in eliminating it later this year.

‌Prince Harry and Meghan reportedly contacted both senior royals in different ways last week, as the Princess recovered from abdominal surgery and the King prepared to undergo treatment for an enlarged prostate.
The move will be considered an olive branch as the couple seek to build bridges after a tumultuous few years in which relations with the Royal family have plummeted.
‌A source told The Mirror: “The King and the Princess of Wales have received support from Prince Harry and Meghan regarding their health.
‌“The Duke and Duchess contacted both parties in different ways to pass on their concern and best wishes.”
The King and Queen had been enjoying a New Year break on the Balmoral estate when Charles received his diagnosis last Wednesday.
They flew back to England on Friday and are understood to have spent the weekend separately, the King at Sandringham and the Queen, 76, at her private home, Ray Mill House in Wiltshire.
The King did not attend church on the Sandringham estate on Sunday as he usually does when in residence.
Buckingham Palace has declined to disclose when he will be admitted to hospital and where he will undergo treatment.
The King’s Serjeant Surgeon is Ranan Dasgupta, a urological surgeon who specialises in specific forms of treatment for an enlarged prostate and works at several hospitals, including the London Clinic, where the Princess of Wales is recuperating.
The Princess was admitted to the private hospital, in Marylebone, central London, last Tuesday before undergoing surgery. She is not expected to be discharged for another week.
Neither Prince William nor their three children are thought to have visited her this weekend.
Meanwhile, the Duke of Sussex appeared at a star-studded awards gala on Friday night, when he was honoured as a Living Legend of Aviation.
In a speech as he accepted the award, he appeared to ridicule host John Travolta by accusing him of “dining out” on the story of how he danced with his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.
He described how flying had taught him “the power of discipline, the power of patience, and beyond that, the power of trusting your gut.”
Asked about his first flight experience, he joked: “I think I was maybe seven or eight years old. Wessex Helicopter. I jumped into it, very excited, and then my father jumped in behind me at the controls and I was terrified.”
The King graduated from RAF College Cranwell in 1971, receiving his flying badge, or ‘wings’.
During his training he became the first heir to the throne to take part in a parachute jump, completing a further seven at RAF Brize Norton.

Rumors have circled on social media about Willis since his friends, David Harrington, Clayton McGeeney and Ricky Johnson were found dead at his home on Jan. 9 in the 5200 block of Northwest 83rd Terrace.
Police were called to the home by McGeeney’s fiancée, who was searching for him at Willis’ home, where he, Johnson and Harrington went to watch the Chiefs game that Sunday. No one had heard from the three men after that night, loved ones told The Star.
When there was no answer at the door, McGeeney’s fiancée broke into the basement and found a dead body on the back porch, police said. Officers arrived and found two other men dead in the backyard.
Police said there were no obvious signs of foul play at or near the scene and are awaiting the results of a medical examination to learn the causes of death for the men.
John Picerno, an attorney who represents Willis, said his client knew nothing about the men’s deaths and last saw them when they exited his home and Willis went to bed. Willis didn’t know that the men remained in his backyard and may have needed medical attention, Picerno said in a news release.
Picerno said Willis hadn’t received calls or texts from the loved ones of his friends prior to the police showing up at his home. Two people came to Willis’ home, but he didn’t hear them because he sleeps with headphones and a loud fan, according to the news release.
One person contacted him on Facebook Messenger, but Willis didn’t see the message until after police contacted him, Picerno said.
Two of the men parked their cars on the street, but Willis didn’t notice them and wouldn’t find it unusual for his friends to leave their cars at his house overnight, the attorney said.
When police arrived, Willis allowed them into his home, told them what he knew and willingly consented to a search of his home, according to Picerno.
“Jordan is unaware of how his friends died,” Picerno said. “Like the rest of us, Jordan is anxiously awaiting the results of the autopsy and toxicology report.
“On behalf of Jordan and his family, we wish to express our deepest sympathies to the friends and family members of these young men, and our thoughts and prayers are with them.”"

A work environment where people feel respected and valued regardless of who they are, where they come from, their role or their viewpoints is important to create an engaged workplace culture. I equate this for its simplicity and directness to The Golden Rule. Some have expressed the idea as a Christian religious value that has no place in a public university. However, every major world religion has a version of the Golden Rule, and it is ubiquitous in positive cultures, ensuring all associated with any enterprise have equal opportunities. However, as each expresses their ideas and beliefs, they should demonstrate public virtue in recognizing the values and beliefs of others.
William Arruda, writing for Forbes, says creating respect and belonging in any work culture involves a multifaceted approach that includes leadership commitment, policy development, training, open communication and ongoing evaluation. The initiative must start from the top. Leaders should demonstrate, through their actions and words, that respect and treating all with civility are core values of the organization. The development and communication of clear policies that outline what is expected regarding respectful behavior are important but are not a substitute for virtuous interaction between people.
Virtue can be clearly defined, but discussing virtue in contemporary society is difficult, according to Catholic Women in Business. Even using the concept of virtuous behavior and treatment will cause consternation. People will ask,"" Whose virtue, under what circumstances, enforced how…?"" Here is a start. One individual or group should not demean or debase another individual or group to further any agenda in any workplace public or private. A positive view of workplace virtue should foster a discrimination-free work environment that rejects harassment of any type and provides equal opportunities for anyone.
Promoting open communication and encouraging an environment where people feel comfortable sharing their ideas and concerns has value, according to a study by Axios HQ. Fostering a working environment that recognizes accomplishment and achievement, rather than group membership, provides the chance for anyone to be successful by criteria that are responsive to all. This includes a comprehensive effort when hiring to consider people from a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to further the organizational mission, goals and objectives. A work environment accommodating different needs and styles is an important and logical extension of the Golden Rule or the Law of Reciprocity.
Holding self and other individuals accountable when they do not meet the standards of respect and civility is important and should be integrated into performance reviews and recognition programs.
Regularly seeking feedback from all on the civility of the workplace and being open to making improvements in response to the expressed needs is a form of accountability in an organization. This should naturally lead to involvement in the decision-making processes, ensure a variety of perspectives are considered and valued and foster shared governance in University environments. The concept of shared governance is important in universities and valued in other settings of diverse enterprises. For example, David Rosowsky, writing in Forbes, says, ""Shared governance is a cornerstone of American higher education. In fact, faculty shared governance has been called the second longest standing system of institutional shared governance in the world, second only to the Church."" And it's not just the church and the university. The Online Journal of Issues in Nursing published an analysis of shared governance to increase the quality of patient care, telegraphing the same logic in churches and universities. Toyota uses a set of principles called The Toyota Way that starts with the simple concept of ""Respect for People."" It is not a stretch to call the Toyota Way the Golden Rule on wheels.
Engagement and involvement in the extended community that the enterprise serves encourages and supports respectful, virtuous, work cultures. Such action helps to reinforce human commitments both internally and externally.
At West Texas A&M University, we believe in integrating strategies of any version of a law of reciprocity that values treating people with dignity and civility toward a more respectful and powerful work culture. Such a culture benefits not only our faculty, students, staff and the constituents we serve but also improves overall performance and reputation.

The Ouray County Plaindealer reported that sexual assault charges had been filed against three men, including a relative of the police chief, for actions that allegedly occurred at a party in May last year.
The incident is said to have happened at the home of Jeff Wood, Ouray’s police chief, where drugs and alcohol were present.
The suspects were aged 17, 18 and 19 at the time, and the person who reported the rapes was 17, records said.
After the story made the front page of the Plaindealer’s weekly edition, the newspaper said more than 200 copies went missing from vending racks around the town.
Its owner and publisher, Mark Wiggins, said: “If you hoped to silence or intimidate us, you failed miserably. We’ll find out who did this. And another press run is imminent.”
By Thursday evening, someone had returned a garbage bag full of newspapers to the Plaindealer and supporters had donated about $2,000 to the paper, something Mr Wiggins called “extremely heartening and humbling”.
Mr Wiggins believed the person who returned the newspapers was the person who took them and that only one person was involved in the theft.
Mr Wiggins declined to identify the person, but he reported the information to police. Officers also had surveillance video of some of the thefts, he said.
The Ouray Country Sheriff’s office said the suspect is “not a member or relative of local law enforcement and not associated with the defendants in the recent reported sexual assault”.
The Ouray County Plaindealer is published on Thursdays and delivered to racks late Wednesday. The rack price for the weekly newspaper is $1, but subscribers can also receive the paper by mail.

The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once wrote, ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.""
Rating:
The late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., known for his eloquence and ability to mobilize the masses throughout the Civil Rights era, is often incorrectly credited for quotes that he never said. One of the most famous lines attributed to King is typically quoted as ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.""
In January 2024, this quote was even posted on the official X (formerly Twitter) page of the State of Israel.
""𝐃𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐜𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐝𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐝𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬, 𝐨𝐧𝐥𝐲 𝐥𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐝𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭. 𝐇𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐝𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐡𝐚𝐭𝐞, 𝐨𝐧𝐥𝐲 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐝𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭.""

These words were indeed written by King. However, for more than a decade now, there has been confusion as to the precise wording of the quote. In 2011, following the killing of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, a version of the quote went viral on the internet. It stated: ""I will mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy. Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.""
Given that if followed the controversial killing of bin Laden, the quote spread across the internet at an impressive reach, especially for the time. Penn Jillette, a famous magician and outspoken libertarian, tweeted the quote to his 1.6 million Facebook followers, and it only continued to go viral from there.
Questions about whether the quote was presented accurately were picked up by The Atlantic, NPR, and other news outlets. They found the wording was correct except for the very first sentence, which was not found in King's speeches or writings: ""I will mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy.""
As it turns out, however, Jillette was only a perpetuator – not the originator – of the erroneous version of the quote. Before Jillette shared it, Facebook user Jessica Dovey quoted the King passage correctly on her status, but prefaced it with a sentence expressing her own personal thoughts: ""I mourn the loss of thousands of precious lives, but I will not rejoice in the death of one, not even an enemy."" She distinguished her own thoughts from King's via an opening quotation mark, which was dropped somewhere along the line as it picked up internet traction.
(Image via The Atlantic)
The complete quote by King, which can be found in his 1963 book ""Strength to Love,"" read as follows:
Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. Hate multiplies hate, violence multiplies violence, and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction. So when Jesus says “Love your enemies,” he is setting forth a profound and ultimately inescapable admonition. Have we not come to such an impasse in the modern world that we must love our enemies—or else? The chain reaction of evil—hate begetting hate, wars producing more wars—must be broken, or we shall be plunged into the dark abyss of annihilation.
Commenters on Israel's X post quoting King were quick to point to a clarification provided by Bernice King, MLK's youngest daughter, on Oct. 31, 2023, in regard to her father's stance on Israel.
🧵 Amy:
Certainly, my father was against antisemitism, as am I.
He also believed militarism (along with racism and poverty) to be among the interconnected Triple Evils.
I am certain he would call for Israel’s bombing of Palestinians to cease, for hostages to be released… https://t.co/haahcqcuAf

HDHBJ99HH1_UNDFE69P2235MBX,Philippines leader Marcos Jr criticised for helicopter ride to Coldplay concert amid Manila’s traffic woes,Shweta Sharma,"January 22, 2024 at 12:51 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/philippine-leader-marcos-criticised-helicopter-112406212.html,"Philippines president Ferdinand Marcos Jr received backlash on social media for using a presidential chopper to attend the Coldplay concert to beat the capital’s horrendous traffic.
Mr Marcos arrived at the British rock band Coldplay’s concert on Friday and videos of him attending the show went viral on social media.
Most Filipinos criticised the president and his family for using a helicopter with taxpayers’ money while remaining oblivious to the traffic conditions around metropolitan Manila, a metropolis of 16 overcrowded cities of about 13 million people.
Manila has earned the dubious distinction of being the “worst in the world” for traffic among 387 cities in 55 countries, according to navigation and mapping firm TomTom.
But that did not prevent Mr Marcos from making it to the show and reaching the concert venue, that is approximately 30km north of the capital, Manila. It would have taken concertgoers at least three hours to travel by road.
Addressing the controversy, the Presidential Security Group said in a statement the Philippine Arena, the world’s largest indoor arena, saw an influx of 40,000 concert-goers resulting in “unforeseen traffic complications along the route”.
The traffic situation posed a security threat to Mr Marcos who attended the Friday night concert with his wife, prompting the use of the presidential chopper, it added.
Preşedintele din Filipine stârneşte furie după ce a folosit elicopterul prezidenţial pentru a ajunge la concertul Coldplay - https://t.co/BEpxfj8cW9 Preşedintele filipinez Ferdinand Marcos Jr. este criticat pe reţelele sociale pentru că a folosit un elicopter prezidenţial... pic.twitter.com/LUQ6gnELSM

However, residents expressed frustration about the traffic situation in the city and the use of taxpayer funds by Mr Marcos, the son and namesake of the late strongman president, whose rule concluded almost four decades ago through a historic “people power” revolution.
""Using official resources, like the presidential chopper, for personal and non-official activities is generally considered an abuse of power or misuse of government resources,"" Facebook user James Patrick Aristorenas said in a post on Saturday.
“We paid for the use of the chopper, fuel and security, who knows even for the tickets for everyone,” Facebook user Arvine Concepcion said."
HFR7C0KYMY_HVDDAKHMVZKPFND,Netanyahu again rejects Palestinian sovereignty amid fresh US push for two-state solution,Abeer Salman,"January 22, 2024 at 6:47 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/netanyahu-again-rejects-palestinian-sovereignty-163940111.html,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday rejected calls for Palestinian sovereignty following talks with US President Joe Biden about Gaza’s future, suggesting Israel’s security needs would be incompatible with Palestinian statehood.
“I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan - and this is contrary to a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu said in a post on X
The Israeli leader did not provide any other details in his one-line post in Hebrew. The territory west of Jordan encompasses Israel, the occupied West Bank, and Hamas-run Gaza, where Israel is battling the militant group following the October 7 attacks.
Biden and his top officials — including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who visited Israel and the region last week — have said the creation of a Palestinian state with guarantees for Israel’s security is the only way to finally bring peace and stability to the Middle East.
United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Sunday called opposition to a two-state solution “unacceptable.”
“The refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people, are unacceptable,” Guterres posted on X.
Amid reports the US, Egypt and Qatar want Israel to join a new phase of talks with Hamas, Netanyahu this weekend also publicly rejected what he characterized as Hamas’ terms for releasing more Israeli hostages from Gaza: an end of the war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian enclave, and the release of more Palestinians from Israeli prisons.
“If we agree to this - our soldiers fell in vain. If we agree to this - we will not be able to guarantee the security of our citizens,” Netanyahu said Sunday.
Netanyahu’s comments comes amid a rift with the US, Israel’s most important ally, on what Gaza will look like once the conflict ends, and exposes the complex position Netanyahu is in.
The Israeli prime minister is facing competing pressure from the international community to allow the creation of a viable Palestinian state and domestically to guarantee Israel’s security, most notably from far-right members of his coalition.
Adding to the pressure, he is also facing calls for early elections, with thousands taking to the streets of Tel Aviv on Saturday. Critics have accused Netanyahu of prolonging the war to stay in power. War cabinet minister Gadi Eisenkot says he hopes that is not the case, but also says elections should happen within months.
Netanhahu’s statement on Palestinian sovereignty appears to run counter to what he told President Biden a day earlier, CNN reporting suggests. Netanyahu had told Biden in a private phone call on Friday that he was not foreclosing the possibility of a Palestinian state in any form, a personal familiar with the conversation told CNN.
Biden administration officials have recently been engaged in discussions about a future demilitarized Palestinian state, an idea the US president finds “intriguing,” the source said.
Following the phone call, their first in weeks, Biden told reporters he believed Netanyahu could ultimately be convinced of some kind of two-state solution. “There are a number of types of two-state solutions,” he said.
“There’s a number of countries that are members of the UN that are still – don’t have their own military; a number of states that have limitations, and so I think there’s ways in which this can work,” Biden added.
But the day after Biden spoke, the Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement: “In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.”
Biden and Netanyahu remain publicly at odds over the question of what will happen to Gaza once the Israel-Hamas war concludes, despite intense American efforts over the past several months to engage officials in Israel and the wider region on a plan they hope can finally resolve the decades-long conflict.
The two-state solution has been the goal of the international community for decades, dating back to the 1947 UN Partition Plan, and many nations say that it is the only way out of the conflict.
It remains an open question how post-war Gaza will be governed but Netanyahu has had long-standing objections to a two-state solution.
And while Netanyahu’s stance is contentious internationally, he faces pressure from more right-wing members of his cabinet who have caused outrage with their suggestions on what should happen to people living in Gaza.
Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has championed the idea of a Palestinian exodus from Gaza. He and far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir sparked anger when advocating for the resettlement of Palestinians outside the Gaza Strip.

HGDU0T6H4Y_QMWPUQZYLVTDNQH,CNN Poll: Trump’s lead over Haley widens to double digits in New Hampshire,"Jennifer Agiesta, CNN","January 22, 2024 at 6:50 AM·8 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/cnn-poll-trump-lead-over-140815664.html,"The race for the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary appears to be former President Donald Trump’s to lose, according to a new CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire following Trump’s 30-point win in Iowa’s caucuses last week.
Trump holds 50% support among likely Republican primary voters in the Granite State, while his closest competitor, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, stands at 39%. Both have gained supporters since the last CNN/UNH poll in early January – when Trump held 39% to Haley’s 32% – as the field of major contenders has shrunk. Both Trump and Haley now hold their highest level of support in UNH polling on the race since 2021. But Haley’s sharp gains since late last summer have not been enough to catch Trump, as the gap between them has once again widened to double digits.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Sunday that he is ending his White House bid and endorsing the former president. He stood at just 6% in the poll, below the 10% minimum support he would need to win delegates there per the Republican Party’s rules.
For Trump’s opponents, New Hampshire has long appeared to be the place in the early primary calendar that offered the best shot at knocking him off track in his bid for a third straight GOP presidential nomination. It was the only early state where polls consistently found Trump without majority support, and where voters often showed the most openness to his rivals. But this latest survey suggests that Trump’s popularity within the GOP base and the commitment of his supporters outweigh the appeal of his challengers.
New Hampshire’s traditional independent streak and more moderate pool of likely primary voters, when compared with other states whose nominating contests land ahead of Super Tuesday, are part of why some Trump rivals fixated on the state as the place to stand out. And Haley has won over those groups.
She holds 58% support among those who are registered as undeclared (New Hampshire’s term for independent voters) and plan to vote in the GOP primary, and 71% support among those who consider themselves ideologically moderate. She also stands ahead of Trump among voters who hold college degrees (50% Haley to 38% Trump). But each of these groups on its own makes up a minority of likely GOP primary voters in New Hampshire: 47% are registered undeclared, 33% are at least college graduates and just about 3 in 10 describe themselves as moderate.
Trump has largely consolidated his support among the larger flip sides of each of those groups. He has the backing of 67% of registered Republicans, 71% of conservatives and 55% of those who do not have a college degree. And among Trump’s supporters, 88% say they have definitely decided to support him compared with 74% of Haley supporters who are similarly locked in. That translates to 45% of the electorate being firmly decided Trump supporters, compared with just 30% who are equally decided Haley backers.
With just a few days to go before Tuesday’s primary, about 1 in 5 likely Republican primary voters overall say they have not yet locked in their choice. That group broadly backs Haley as of now: 51% support her, 28% supportTrump and 14% say they support DeSantis.
Broadly speaking, New Hampshire’s likely Republican primary voters expect Trump to win on Tuesday (70% say they think he will carry the day, though just 36% of Haley backers feel that way), and more say they would be satisfied were he to become the party’s presidential nominee than would feel that way about Haley or DeSantis (61% say they would be either enthusiastic or satisfied should Trump win the nomination, compared with 54% each saying the same about Haley or DeSantis).
And Trump continues to be viewed more favorably than either Haley or DeSantis within the primary electorate: 56% have a positive view of Trump, compared with 36% who feel that way about Haley and 28% about DeSantis. He is the only remaining candidate to have maintained a net positive favorability rating throughout the past year, while Haley ends the campaign for the Granite State in negative territory.
The state’s Republican primary electorate also has a broadly positive outlook on what Trump actually did as president. Looking back on his first term in office, 70% of likely Republican primary voters say that he did more to help the country than hurt it, while 28% say he did more to hurt and 2% that his time in office didn’t make much of a difference.
The survey asked whether Trump would attempt – and whether he would succeed at – six things he’s talked about doing during the campaign: building a wall along the US border with Mexico, appointing a special prosecutor to “go after” President Joe Biden and his family, dismantling the “deep state,” repealing Obamacare and replacing it with another health care law, bringing the war between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and reimposing a travel ban for seven Muslim-majority countries.
Majorities in the GOP electorate say that if he wins, Trump would likely succeed in accomplishing four out of those six: building the wall (71% say he would definitely or probably succeed in doing so), ending the war between Ukraine and Russia (59%), reimposing the travel ban (56%) and appointing a prosecutor to go after the Biden family (53%). Far fewer see Trump as likely to succeed at dismantling the deep state (39%) or repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (34%).
Most New Hampshire residents agree with likely Republican voters that should Trump win the presidency, he is at least probably going to accomplish reimposing the travel ban (58%), appointing a special prosecutor to go after the Biden family (56%) and building the wall (52%). But there are deep partisan divisions in views on his prospects for ending the war between Ukraine and Russia; 71% of Republicans feel he will at least probably succeed in that effort, compared with 33% of independents and 8% of Democrats; 79% of Democrats say that Trump is unlikely to even try to bring the war to an end. And few of any partisan stripe feel he’s likely to repeal and replace the ACA (26% overall).
There is also a notable partisan divide over the chances that Trump will try or succeed in appointing a special prosecutor to “go after” Biden and his family. Nearly all Democrats think he will at least try (90%) compared with about two-thirds of independents and Republicans (63% each). Democrats are also most apt to say it is at least probable that he will succeed (64% say so), with only about half of Republicans (51%) or independents (47%) saying the same.
About two-thirds of likely primary voters on the Democratic side say they plan to write in Biden (63%). Biden did not file to be a candidate on the state’s primary ballot because the primary is in violation of the Democratic National Committee’s rules for the nomination process, but supporters have mounted a write-in effort on his behalf. Nearly all likely Democratic primary voters are aware of that effort; 91% said they had heard that Biden would not be on the ballot before taking the survey. Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips holds 10% support in the poll, matching his high mark in CNN/UNH polling on the race, and author Marianne Williamson has 9% support, with 11% saying they would support someone else.
Nearly all Biden backers, 92%, say they have definitely decided to support him, compared with just 28% of those who are supporting another candidate. Most in the Democratic primary electorate say they would be at least satisfied with Biden as their party’s nominee (70% say they would be enthusiastic or satisfied), but enthusiasm for Biden among Democratic primary voters (31%) is lower than enthusiasm for Trump on the GOP side (46%).
Still, just 46% of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire say that Biden would give the party its best chance to win in 2024, while 39% say someone else would give Democrats a better chance, and 15% say they’re not sure. There is little agreement among those who say someone else would be better around who that might be. Phillips is most frequently mentioned at 28%, but a wide range of other names also emerge.
Most likely Democratic primary voters say that in Biden’s time as president he has done more to help the country than hurt it (71% help, 16% hurt, 11% hasn’t made much difference).
But neither Biden nor Trump is seen by most New Hampshirites as helping the country during their respective presidencies. Overall, 55% of New Hampshire adults say that Trump hurt the country as president, and 51% say that Biden has. There isn’t much overlap between the two groups. Only 8% total say that both men did more to hurt than help, just 1% that both of them did more to help, 41% say that Trump helped and Biden hurt, 35% that Trump hurt and Biden helped, and 10% that Trump hurt while Biden hasn’t made much difference.
The CNN New Hampshire poll was conducted online January 16-19 by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. Results among the full sample of 2,348 New Hampshire adults drawn from a probability-based panel have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.0 percentage points. Likely Republican and Democratic primary voters were identified through survey questions about their intention to vote. Results among 1,210 likely Republican primary voters have an error margin of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Results among 838 likely Democratic primary voters have an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

The family was discovered in a house in Costessey, near Norwich, at about 07:15 GMT on Friday.
Norfolk Police has referred itself to the independent watchdog, saying it did not respond to a 999 call from the home at 06:00.
Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said it was ""deeply worrying"" and welcomed the referral.
Officers said post-mortems would be held on Sunday to find the cause of the deaths of the man and woman.
The bodies of two young girls, a 36-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man, named locally as Bartlomiej Kuczynski, were found in the house on Allan Bedford Crescent.
Post-mortems on the two girls will take place on Wednesday.
Both attended local schools and head teachers at Queen's Hill Primary and Taverham High School have encouraged pupils to return to classrooms on Monday.
Dr Bianca Finger-Berry, critical incident specialist lead at Norfolk County Council, said: ""Normal routines with opportunities to access additional services can be really helpful.
""We are encouraging children and young people to be back in school tomorrow, where they will be able to receive emotional support from school staff and educational professionals.""
Police said a man and children lived at the address and the related visiting woman was not a permanent resident. The force said it was not looking for anyone else following the incident.
Patrols will continue in the area and the road by the home, on the Queen's Hills estate, remains closed while investigations continue.
Det Ch Insp Chris Burgess said: ""While I can confirm all four people were found with injuries, we will not be disclosing any further information until these examinations have taken place and the cause of death has been established.
""This is a tragic incident, distressing for all involved and it is clear from the reaction it's caused a lot of shock and upset in the local community.""
On Saturday the force said it had referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) for the second time.
The first referral was over a callout to the same house on 14 December as part of a missing persons inquiry. The force said that particular investigation would now be re-examined.
A second referral was made due to an emergency call being received from the house at 06:00 on Friday, to which officers were not deployed.
Labour MP, Ms Cooper, said it was right that the police had been referred for investigation on the 999 call that was not responded to.
""I do think there is a wider issue of the 999 response to particularly domestic abuse cases,"" she said.
She said if elected, Labour would ""put domestic abuse specialists into 999 control centres"" so they had the expertise ""to deal with difficult cases"".
Thursday 14 December 2023 - Police attend the property in Allan Bedford Crescent, Costessey, in relation to a missing person inquiry
Friday 19 January at about 06:00 - A 999 call is made from the same address but officers do not attend
Friday at about 07:00 - A concerned member of the public calls the police
Friday at about 07:15 - Officers arrive at the scene, force their way in and find the four bodies
Friday - Norfolk Police refers itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) due to the missing persons inquiry
Saturday morning - Officers continue to patrol the area around the house
Saturday afternoon -The force announces it has referred itself to the IOPC for a second time due to not attending the 999 call
Saturday evening - The force says it is not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident
Sunday - A port-mortem examination is due to be carried out on the man and woman and on Wednesday one is expected to be carried out on the two girls
Reverend James Pinto from St Helen's and St Edmond's churches in Costessey said it was a close-knit community that had been left in ""shock"".
""People are finding it hard to come to term with the news, they [the family] were known and people are finding it hard to digest and there's a real sense of shock and bewilderment,"" he said.
He said his two churches had opened on Saturday to provide people with an opportunity to come together, light a candle, pray, talk and support one another.
Emma Isaac lives on the estate and said what had happened was ""absolutely horrible"".
""You just wouldn't expect it around here, it's a very quiet estate. There are not words for it, I just can't believe it,"" she added.

HI8ZHJ0HC1_7DBJGCYIMVRFMBM,"Death toll rises to more than 25,000 in Gaza as Israel’s war continues",Adam Schrader & Darryl Coote,"January 22, 2024 at 1:48 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/death-toll-rises-more-25-155457568.html,"Jan. 21 (UPI) -- The death toll in Gaza has risen to more than 25,000 people as Israel's war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas continues in the enclave.
The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that 25,105 people have been killed and 62,681 have been injured since Israel began the war, retaliating for the Oct. 7 attacks by the Iran-backed Hamas. Palestinian health officials said 178 people were killed by U.S.-backed Israeli troops in the last 24 hours alone.
The death toll had approached 23,000 by Jan. 7, meaning more than 2,000 people had been killed in just two weeks of the war.
Hamas has stated that its attack last year came after raids on the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, by Israeli Police and violence perpetrated by Israeli settlers, leading to the deaths of hundreds of Palestinians last year alone in a decades-long conflict.
At least 237 Palestinians were killed by Israelis before the Oct. 7 attack and the Palestine Red Crescent Society reported last year that its healthcare workers experienced 193 separate attacks from Israeli forces in the first six months of the year, a 310% increase compared to the same period in 2022.
Some 1,200 Israelis were killed on Oct. 7 with more than 240 others taken Hostage.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres chastised Israel over the level of destruction Israel's war in Gaza has caused, including the deaths of more than 150 U.N. staff.
""Israel's military operations have spread massive destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as secretary general,"" he said Sunday during a U.N. summit.
""This is heart breaking and utterly unacceptable.""
The U.N. head also reiterated his disapproval of Israel's recent repeated rejections of a two-state solution.
""The denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security, exacerbate polarization and embolden extremists everywhere,"" he said.
The Israeli Defense Forces said Sunday that it had killed 15 ""terrorists"" in Daraj Tuffah. Israel and the United States consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization. And in Khan Yunis, Israeli officials said its snipers had ""eliminated a number of terrorists.""
Hamas has not said how many of its fighters have been killed, though Israel claims that number is in the thousands. In December, an IDF spokesperson told CNN that it was ""tremendously positive"" that Israel had killed a Hamas militant for ever two Palestinian civilians it has killed in Gaza.
But, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, the death toll of Hamas fighters alone has fallen short of Israel's goal to eliminate the group, which governs the Gaza enclave.
""We have completed the dismantling of Hamas' military framework in the northern Gaza Strip and will continue to deepen the achievement, strengthening the barrier and the defense components along the security fence,"" Daniel Hagari, the spokesperson for Israel's military, said earlier this month.
""Now, we are focusing on dismantling Hamas in the central and southern Gaza Strip. We will do this differently, thoroughly, based on the lessons we have learned from the fighting so far."""

HJ1EUE18IR_3YEF8ZNRI70RPA7,Kentucky can't share funny messages on highway signs beginning in 2026. What to know,"Leo Bertucci, Louisville Courier Journal","January 22, 2024 at 4:01 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/kentucky-cant-share-funny-messages-190147542.html,"Highway safety messages seem to be funny every once in a while. Maybe a joke displayed on a sign above your head made you laugh and think, ""Did I just read that?""
Savor your laughs while you can because the writers of those electronic messages will be required to stick to a serious tone starting in 2026, according to a new federal rule.
Puns with references to internet memes, movie quotes and song lyrics are included in the ban. The Federal Highway Administration stated in a manual released in December that it wants the text of the signs to be ""simple, direct, brief, legible and clear.""
In its explanation of the rule change, the highway administration stated that ""messages with obscure meaning, references to popular culture, that are intended to be humorous"" should not be displayed because they may confuse and distract drivers.
When coming up with an idea for a sign, states were advised to limit their messaging to information on inclement weather updates and traffic reports, and reminders to wear seat belts, drive sober and follow speed limits.
The Kentucky Transportation Cabinet and other state transportation agencies sometimes share some humor to promote safe driving. In response to the rule change, the department said it will be reviewing the messages it plans to display to ensure the new federal standard is met.
""Improving highway safety is a priority of the administration,"" KYTC spokesperson Naitore Djigbenou said in a statement. ""The messages on the digital signs are intended to encourage safe driving behaviors and currently feature short, concise messages that coincide with state and national campaigns.""
State officials know fatal vehicle collisions are no joke. The Kentucky State Police estimated the state's economy lost $3.2 billion because of fatal crashes in 2022, according to a report released in September 2023.
In 2023, Kentucky reported 805 crash deaths, a 1% increase from the prior year, when there were 762 fatalities. Kentucky ranked 20th in the nation in vehicle fatalities in 2022, according to USA TODAY.

Real estate investors Jon and Stacy Bichelmeyer, owners of Archway Homes, buy homes in any condition. They have been buying and selling properties in the greater Kansas City area for over 20 years. They strive to make the difficult process of selling a home as stress-free as possible. They wrote the book on it. Literally! Home to Home Local Edition – Kansas City Metro outlines the steps homeowners can take to sell their home. You can call their office to get a free copy for yourself.
Billie T. recently worked with Jon to sell her house in Sugar Creek and raved about the experience. She had originally contacted another investor who buys homes for cash, but they kept her home tied up for over thirty days with repeated excuses why they could not close on it, so she contacted Archway.
“I would highly recommend Archway Homes,” Billie said. “Jon and his wife did what they said they would. Within seven to ten days of our first meeting, we were closed, and I was free to move on. The house needed some work, but I was able to just walk away, and I felt good about the terms and the experience. Anyone wanting to sell quickly should contact Jon,” she added.
Archway Homes features a no-obligation offer process. The first step is to call the office at 913-599-5000 to schedule an appointment. Jon will then walk through the home and can provide an offer price within 24 hours. Archway Homes can pay cash and close in as fast as three days. However, some sellers need the opposite approach, needing a delayed closing several months away. They may be downsizing and need time to find their next home, or they are building a home and need time for it to be completed. In that case, Archway Homes sets a closing date that will meet the sellers’ needs.
“We had one client who was waiting for a home to be built and construction was delayed,” Jon said. “They wanted to close on the home they were selling before the end of the year, but the new home wouldn’t be finished until late January. We closed on the home on the date they needed but didn’t take possession until the new one was completed, so they had the money they needed and didn’t have to move twice.”
Archway Homes has purchased houses in all sorts of situations. Sometimes they are filled with clutter and are inherited property that would be difficult for the heirs to clean out. If this is the situation, Jon’s reply is always, “I want the family to take what is of value to them and they can leave the rest. I want this to be easy and hassle-free for sellers.”
Recently, many of the houses purchased by Archway Homes are owned by baby boomers or empty nesters who are downsizing. By selling to Archway Homes, these sellers don’t have to go through the hassle of preparing their homes for market, having them ready to show to potential buyers at a moment’s notice and waiting for an offer. They know quickly what they can get for their home and move on to the next stage of their life.
“We love helping these sellers,” Stacy said. “Usually, the owners have lived there for years and have kept the house in good shape, but it needs updating. We understand the unique challenges of baby boomers. Their time is precious: caring for elderly parents and young grandchildren, their personal health concerns, and wanting the retirement they deserve. The ease of selling to us can make a difficult time of transition worry-free.”
Sometimes the properties need extensive repairs, including poor foundations or roofs. Again, Archway Homes will buy the home and make the needed repairs, relieving the sellers of the hassle and expense. “We are committed to working with sellers, even in difficult situations, to find a win-win for all,” Stacy said.
Jon is a third-generation real estate investor, following the career of his father and grandfather. “I have been buying houses long before HGTV inspired the new investors in town. Sellers know that I’ve been investing in our community for my entire adult life, and I continue to do so,” Jon said. “The other companies aren’t personally invested here like I am. I stand by my word. No one deal is more important than my name and reputation.”

The Gaza Health Ministry on Sunday said 25,105 people have died in the coastal enclave, while over 62,600 others have been wounded since Hamas launched its surprise assault in southern Israel on Oct. 7. This number included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza’s hospitals since Saturday, the Health Ministry added.
The overall death toll is believed to be higher as several bodies remain under the rubble from Israeli strikes or in places where medics are unable to reach them, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said, per the Associated Press.
The Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combats when tallying deaths, but said about two-thirds of those killed in Gaza were women and minors, the news wire added.
The numbers come more than 100 days since the start of the war, sparked by Hamas’s incursion into Israel that left about 1,200 people dead, mostly civilians. An estimated 250 people were taken hostage during these attacks and Hamas released about 100 hostages during a week-long cease-fire in November.
Israel responded to the Oct. 7 attacks by quickly launching a major counteroffensive in Gaza that has included attacks by air and a ground invasion into northern Gaza. With much of the northern part of the enclave leveled by Israel’s attacks, Israeli forces have moved their focus to the southern city of Khan Younis and refugee camps in central Gaza, the AP reported.
The Israeli military claims to have killed about 9,000 militants, though it has not provided evidence, and said 195 of its soldiers have been killed, the news wire said.
The violence in Gaza has forced an estimated 85 percent of Gaza’s population, equal to about 1.9 million individuals, from their homes and into overcrowded shelters and hospitals, where food, water and medical supplies continue to dwindle, the United Nations said last week. About nine in 10 Palestinians are eating less than one meal a day, the World Food Program said last month.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has largely rejected international calls for a cease-fire, maintaining Israel will not stop its offensive until achieving “complete victory” over Hamas and seeing the return of the remaining hostages.
The remaining hostages are believed to be held captive in Hamas’s intricate and deep underground tunnels and Israel has only been able to rescue one hostage since the war’s beginning, the AP said. Hamas has said several have been killed in air strikes or failed rescue operations.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

HM3URCELTB_EU5HP1Q05V670RI,International students taught slang to help them learn English,Catherine Lough,"January 22, 2024 at 4:42 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/international-students-taught-slang-help-194241115.html,"Foreign students learning English are now being taught modern phrases and slang words such as “beef”, “bare” and “fam” at schools and colleges, new research reveals.
But it is not just overseas youngsters who are learning modern jargon, including “salty” and “drip”; the teachers themselves are also having to get to grips with it.
A study by Trinity College London - an international English language exam board - found 71 per cent of overseas students learning English are asking teachers and lecturers to explain slang terms they have seen on social media, TV or elsewhere.
Trinity surveyed 505 academics who teach EFL (English as a foreign language) to students in the Generation Z age group, which covers those aged from 12 to their mid-20s.
Among those expressions most queried by the learners are “beef” (an argument), NPC (non-player character, ie a boring person) and to “pop-off” (go crazy) while others on the list include “rizz” (good at chatting-up or flirting), recently declared Word of the Year by Oxford University Press.
The survey found 80 per cent of foreign students arrive knowing multicultural English (MCE) slang terms, having picked them up through social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, but do not always know their meaning.
Gritty British TV series such as Top Boy also have an international audience thanks to Netflix and other streaming services, which is also influencing the English being picked up by younger overseas students arriving in the UK.
However, they are also learning our language from other internationally broadcast US series such as Friends, Grey’s Anatomy and Stranger Things and 45 per cent speak English with what is called a GenAm (general American) accent.
As a result, more than two thirds of EFL teachers (67 per cent) now include MCE in their lessons whether it is “bruv” for close friend or “bare” (a lot, many, very) but also recommend typically British series such as Bridgerton, Sherlock and Downton Abbey.
Dr Ben Beaumont, head of English language teacher education at Trinity, said: “The findings highlight the evolving nature of language in a connected world and the growing impact of social media and popular culture on language acquisition among Generation Z.
“The rise of streaming TV services and the popularity of specific shows have turned language learning into a dynamic, multimedia experience for Gen Z.”
While new words are being incorporated into classrooms, outdated expressions from “broken record” to “dialling a number” are confusing to the youngsters, as are idioms such as “neck of the woods” and “best thing since sliced bread”.
Dr Beaumont added: “Our study highlights the nature of language learning in today’s interconnected world, where social media and popular culture play pivotal roles.
“It’s essential to keep pace with Gen Z’s language journey and offer engaging ways for learning to blend seamlessly with their multimedia experiences.”
The research was commissioned by Trinity College London when developing its new Skill Up learning app which helps foreign students learn English.

HNYFA3NO4A_04PKLS6F5BVX088,Fact Check: Here's the Truth Behind That Video of a Woman Allegedly Creating an Ice Sculpture During the Polar Vortex,Jack Izzo,"January 21, 2024 at 9:00 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/fact-check-heres-truth-behind-000000053.html,"Claim:
A video posted to TikTok and Instagram during the January 2024 polar vortex shows a woman in Canada making a helix out of ice by pouring it on the ground in a spiral pattern.
Rating:
Every few years, when the cold, arctic air of the polar vortex plunges south, internet users around the globe are treated to viral videos about the cold snap. Examples include frozen sculptures made of ramen and clothes as stiff as a board. You can even throw hot water into the air and watch it turn into a white cloud of steam and ice.
TikTok user QueenChelsea wanted to take it a step further in January 2024, posting a video to her TikTok and Instagram page showing her pouring water on the ground and creating a helix out of ice. The video quickly went viral, with over 13 million likes on TikTok (with 191 million views) and over 5 million likes on Instagram. The frozen sculpture looked real enough to fool many commenters, and Snopes received emails inquiring if the video was real.
Unfortunately, Canada being cold was the only real part of the video. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble (another great thing to play with in sub-zero temperatures), although it is certainly a testament to QueenChelsea's editing prowess that some people believed the ice sculpture was real.
QueenChelsea, whose real name is Chelsea Laufer, is a Canadian content creator who makes short viral videos using clever editing tricks and incredible visual effects. She included the VFX hashtag in the captions on both the TikTok and Instagram posts, and her bio on both platforms includes the sentence, ""I like making impossible things.""
Snopes reached out to Laufer for comment, and she replied via email.
""I’m a visual effects content creator so all of the videos I post are edited with a sort of magical realism in mind,"" she wrote. ""I'll also add that the response to this video has been absolutely astounding! I made this video as a way to practice working with 3D CGI, and I never expected so many people to see it.""
On Jan. 18, she posted a video to TikTok breaking down how she made the effect.

It will also air on Fubo, which offers a free trial.
In December, Trump backed Moreno. The former Northeast Ohio auto magnate initially considered a Senate run in 2022 before Trump intervened.
""It's time for the entire Republican Party to UNITE around Bernie's campaign for Senate, so that we can have a BIG victory in what will be the most important election in American history,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.
DeWine hasn't backed a candidate in the Ohio Senator race yet.

HWI2LO8TKC_OWNX1EQOSTR2FH4,Water company bosses received more than £25m in bonuses,Amy Gibbons,"January 22, 2024 at 7:30 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/water-company-bosses-received-more-223000294.html,"Water bosses have pocketed more than £25 million in bonuses, benefits and other incentives since the last general election despite mounting concerns over illegal sewage spills, new analysis has found.
Data compiled by Labour shows the chief executives of nine water companies in England have received millions of pounds on top of their standard pay packets over the past four years, while household bills are set to rise to help fix the crisis in Britain’s waterways.
The party accused the Government of turning “a blind eye” to issues at the heart of the industry, resulting in “stinking, toxic sewage destroying our countryside”.
To address the problem, Labour has pledged to give Ofwat, the water regulator,  new powers to ban company bonuses where firms are illegally polluting Britain’s rivers, lakes and seas.
It said it will also end self-monitoring, make sure bosses face personal criminal liability for “extreme and persistent” law breaking, and introduce “severe and automatic” fines for wrongful discharges.
Water companies are permitted to release sewage from overflow pipes, but this should be done on rare occasions and only in extreme weather conditions to stop the system being overloaded.
Between 2018 and 2022, four firms were prosecuted by Ofwat for breaching overflow permits – with the Financial Times putting the total penalty at more than £94 million.
The Labour analysis found that water chiefs have received more than £10 million in bonuses, nearly £15 million in incentives and £621,580 in benefits since the 2019 General Election.
That includes £1.4 million in bonuses last year, less than half the £3.1 million paid in the previous year.
It comes as water companies are set to charge consumers more than £150 extra per year to help fund a solution to the sewage crisis.
This means the typical English household’s annual bill will rise from £425 to £575, in 2022-23 prices, according to documents submitted to Ofwat late last year.
For this extra strain on the household budget, customers are promised an “unprecedented” £96bn of investment in key infrastructure.
Sewage discharges into Britain’s rivers and seas have risen up the political agenda in recent years, with the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats all vowing to address the issue.
The structural nature of the problem, with the country’s Victorian-era plumbing system still in place in many parts of the country, has been pointed to as a mitigating factor.
Despite a public outcry, a report by the Environment Agency last summer warned that the tide of “pollution incidents” in England was still rising, from 1,883 incidents in 2021 to 2,026 in 2022.
There were also more than 300,000 storm overflow incidents, where raw sewage is discharged straight into rivers and the sea as a “release valve” when pipes struggle to cope after big downpours.
Steve Reed, the shadow environment secretary, accused the Government of wilfully turning a blind eye to the issue at hand.
“The result is stinking, toxic sewage destroying our countryside, and consumers facing higher bills while failing water bosses pocket millions in bonuses,” he said.
“Labour will put failing water companies under special measures. We will strengthen regulation so law-breaking water bosses face criminal charges, and give the regulator new powers to block the payment of any bonuses until water bosses have cleaned up their filth.”
The Environment Agency has said it takes sewage pollution “very seriously” and will always prosecute companies that are being misleading, while Ofwat stressed last month that senior executives bonuses came from shareholders, not customers.
A spokesman for Water UK, a trade association, said: “We agree that any financial reward should be tightly linked to performance – including protecting the environment. It is also right that regulators have all the powers they feel they need to hold water companies to account.
“It is clear, however, that the only way to the change we all want to see is through significant investment. Water companies have set out plans for the biggest investment in the sector’s history – including £11 billion to improve sewage overflows – tripling current levels of investment.”
A government spokesman said: “Our Plan for Water is delivering more investment, stronger regulation, and tougher enforcement – and we have already been very clear that water companies must never profit from environmental damage.
“That is why we have given Ofwat increased powers to hold them to account, as well as boosting Environment Agency powers through unlimited financial penalties. That’s on top of the £150 million levied through criminal prosecutions since 2015.
“All storm overflows across England are also already fitted with monitors, with this Government having increased monitoring from 7 per cent in 2010 to 100 per cent. now.”

HY9KBAMVZ0_VRDO3MAW5P5YNQW,Ron DeSantis drops out of Republican presidential race,Martin Pengelly in Washington and staff,"January 22, 2024 at 6:23 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-desantis-drops-republican-presidential-201127388.html,"Ron DeSantis, the hard-right governor of Florida, has ended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and endorsed Donald Trump.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” he said in a statement posted on X. “He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
DeSantis’s withdrawal in the days ahead of the New Hampshire primary follows a disappointing result in the Iowa caucus, where he finished second place but trailed Donald Trump by a large margin. In New Hampshire, his numbers were far behind former South Carolina governor Haley and Trump.
On Sunday night, Donald Trump set aside months of criticism of DeSantis and celebrated his onetime rival as his newest supporter.
“I just want to thank Ron and congratulate him on doing a very good job,” Trump said. “He was very gracious, and he endorsed me. I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron.”
“He’s been a good governor and I wish him well,” Haley said at a campaign event on Sunday. “Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.”
DeSantis’s news was the culmination of a long, agonising decline.

As recently as spring 2023, the former navy lawyer and rightwing congressman was widely seen as the Republican most likely to stop Trump becoming the nominee for a third election running, in large part by attempting to offer harsh Trumpist policies without the attendant drama.
In November 2022, DeSantis cruised past the Democrat Charlie Crist to win a second term in Tallahassee. In his victory speech, he crowed: “We have embraced freedom. We have maintained law and order. We have protected the rights of parents. We have respected our taxpayers and we reject ‘woke’ ideology.”
Referencing Winston Churchill, a near-mythic figure on the American right, he went on: “We fight the woke in the legislature. We fight the woke in the schools, we fight the woke in the corporations. We will never ever surrender to the woke mob. Florida is where woke goes to die.”
He received a rapturous reception, supporters with an eye on 2024 chanting “two more years” and the New York Post branding him “DeFuture”, as speculation abounded that Rupert Murdoch was finally set to move on from Trump.
But despite formidable fundraising, a seemingly strong campaign structure, strong polling and a rising Republican star in his wife, Casey DeSantis, after a long run-in to a formal campaign declaration, little went right.
DeSantis’s hard-right agenda ran into trouble as he chose to take on Disney, a dominant employer in Florida, over its opposition to his “don’t say gay” policy regarding LGBTQ+ issues in schools. Generating a string of stories, scandals and lawsuits over book bans in school libraries, the subject continued to dog the campaign.
In May the launch of that campaign, a Twitter Spaces session with Elon Musk, descended into farce as the platform glitched and buckled. The event host, the donor David Sacks, claimed: “We got so many people here that we are kind of melting the servers, which is a good sign.” Few observers agreed.
On the campaign trail in the months that followed, the governor came across as stilted and awkward. For a campaign focused on social media and the influencers who lurk there, the resultant string of mocking memes and threads could not have been in the plan.
Nor could a summer fiasco over bizarre campaign videos, posted to social media and featuring far-right, white supremacist, Nazi and arguably homoerotic imagery. A firing followed but the campaign’s image had taken another big blow, reports of fundraising problems appearing.
There was a scandal over an attempt to change history teaching in state schools, regarding the place of slavery in Florida’s past. There were attempts to troll Democrats on immigration, including sending undocumented migrants to Democratic-run states by bus or plane. That policy ended up in the courts as well.
As the polling gap to Trump grew, and as the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley steadily moved through the field, DeSantis sought ways to fight back.
In November he took the unexpected step of debating a Democrat other than Joe Biden. The Fox News-hosted contest with Gavin Newsom, the California governor, proved little more than a sideshow. Brandishing a map he said showed the spread of “human faeces” on the streets of San Francisco, DeSantis succeeded only in feeding more “poop map” memes.
DeSantis and Haley became more willing to attack Trump as the first vote neared, if still with the gloves kept on, even Trump’s lie about a stolen election in 2020 proving hard to simply disown. In Iowa, DeSantis picked up key nominations from the governor, Kim Reynolds, and evangelical leaders and eventually finished in second. But that still didn’t catapult his campaign into safe New Hampshire territory, and he dropped out before the numbers could prove just how far behind he might be.
Democrats celebrated the news on Sunday.
“As Democrats, we’ve been shouting from the rooftops that his strategy of waging culture wars on the backs of hardworking Floridians just to further his own ambitions was wrong for the state & would be disastrous for the nation,” said Fentrice Driskell, the lead Democrat in the Florida state legislature on Twitter/X.
Sarafina Chitika, spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee, said: “Just like Trump, DeSantis ran a campaign pledging to ban abortion nationwide, rip away access to healthcare, and gut Social Security and Medicare, while embracing election deniers and whitewashing January 6. Whichever candidate wins the race for the Maga base will be left running on the same dangerous and unpopular anti-freedom agenda that voters will reject in November.”
For its part, the New Hampshire electorate did not seem too shaken by his last-minute announcement.
Two hours before an event he had planned in New Hampshire, there were no signs of the DeSantis campaign or his fans at The Farm Bar and Grille. A member of staff said they had found out from news reports that DeSantis wouldn’t be coming and said he had not yet pre-paid for the space.
“Nope, I’m about to charge him right now.”

HYO0BSOXPG_TYDSZ4JFAQI15M2,Earth’s earliest creatures dated from Welsh rocks,Gavin Thomas - BBC News,"January 22, 2024 at 2:46 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/earth-earliest-creatures-dated-welsh-174643909.html,"Welsh rocks have revealed details about some of Earth's earliest creatures.
Fossils first discovered in Carmarthenshire in the 1970s revealed traces of organisms that have now been dated to 564 million years ago.
The ancient disc-shaped invertebrates probably lived in shallow waters along the coast of volcanic islands.
Researchers say the organisms - too primitive to be described as animals - are ""completely unlike any other forms of life"".
Mysterious medieval cemetery unearthed
Hundreds of remains found under department store
The research findings, which have taken decades to complete, have been published in the scientific Journal of the Geological Society.
The fossils were first discovered in 1977 at a quarry near the village of Llangynog, Carmarthenshire, by Prof John Cope.
They were quickly identified as being exceptionally old and important, but Prof Cope said he waited decades to find out their exact age, which hampered further research.
The breakthrough came when a method, which measures radioactive decay, dated the fossils to 564 million years ago, plus or minus 700,000 years.
They come from the Ediacaran period, when the first multi-cellular organisms - meaning organisms made up of multiple cells - existed on Earth.
Prof Cope, from Swansea, said of the organisms: ""They are multi-cellular but we just don't know what they were. They are completely unlike any other forms of life.
""We've known for a long time that these fossils were the oldest in Wales and then, in 2000, a scientist who had been working in Newfoundland on similar fossils looked at them and said 'they're exactly the same'.""
During the Ediacaran period, Wales was part of a micro-continent that geologists called Avalonia.
Newfoundland, in Canada, would have been a neighbouring area.
Over hundreds of millions of years, the creation of the Atlantic Ocean split Wales and eastern Newfoundland thousands of miles apart.
The breakthrough in dating the fossils was due to the work of the lead author of the paper, Pembrokeshire-born PhD student Tony Clarke, who has been working on radiometric dating at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia.
Mr Clarke has also dated some of the rocks that became the megaliths of Stonehenge.
As a co-author of the paper, Prof Cope, formerly of Cardiff University and now a research associate at Bristol University, said the work had been a major breakthrough.
""These dating techniques have improved so much over the years and they are now so accurate,"" he said.
The Llangynog fossils are held at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff."

For the first time in modern history, peers have exercised powers to lay a motion in the Lords seeking to halt the ratification of the Treaty until the Government can show that Rwanda is safe for asylum seekers.
They have set out a ten-point plan for new laws and judicial measures which they say ministers and Rwanda must put in place before they say the Treaty can be endorsed.
The motion has been put down by Lord Goldsmith, who was Sir Tony Blair’s attorney general during the Iraq War, in his capacity as chair of the international agreements committee which plays a critical role in the scrutiny and ratification of Britain’s new treaties.
Any vote in favour of the motion will not be binding but could be used by asylum seekers in future court challenges to deportation as evidence that Parliament did not regard Rwanda as safe.
If it is backed by peers, ministers will have to decide whether to ignore it and push ahead with ratification – due within the next two weeks – or accept a delay which could last months and jeopardise the plans to get flights off this Spring.
Twenty four peers including Rachel Treweek, the Bishop of Gloucester, have been listed to speak in the debate which will provide the first public indication of the scale of opposition that the Prime Minister will face in the Lords.
She was one of the original bishops who signed a letter warning that the Rwanda plan was an “immoral policy that shames Britain.”
Among others expected to support the calls for a delay is Lord Kerr, a former permanent secretary at the Foreign Office and ambassador to the US, who said the legislation would struggle to get through the Lords in its current form.
“I am a former diplomat and I take international law and our tradition of respecting it seriously. It is completely incompatible with the refugee convention and a number of other international laws,” he said. “It suggests that this bill will have a long, tortuous passage in the Lords.”
The motion to delay ratification is also likely to be backed by two former independent reviewers of terrorism legislation Lord Carlile and Lord Anderson.
Lord Carlile said that it was not just treaty ratification but also the progress of the Bill through the Lords that should be delayed. “It is premature at best for the actual Bill to proceed until the Treaty said of it has been sorted out,” he said.
The motion states that “Her Majesty’s Government should not ratify the UK-Rwanda Agreement on an asylum partnership until the protections it provides have been fully implemented.”
The ten-point plan includes a new asylum law in Rwanda – which is expected to pass in two months’ time, a system to ensure migrants cannot be returned to their home countries to face persecution, the appointment and training of international judges and the creation of monitoring committees and appeal bodies.

I66SKPEW4E_MKJ804UVQGTY082,I'm working but homeless and bottom of the housing list,"Chris Clements - Social affairs correspondent, BBC Scotland","January 22, 2024 at 2:49 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/im-working-homeless-bottom-housing-174928795.html,"Daniel Thomson is homeless and has been ""sofa surfing"" for four months.
He works 50 hours a week in a chip shop but can't find an affordable place to stay in his home city of Glasgow.
His only option for now, according to local housing groups, is a spell in one of the city's homeless hostels.
The 37-year-old is one of a growing number of people in Scotland described as suffering ""core homelessness"" - living in hostels, rough sleeping or staying with friends.
Homeless charity Crisis said this week that more 18,400 households were in this position each day of 2022. It warned that number is expected to rise by a third by 2026.
Daniel - a father-of-one - was made homeless after a relationship breakdown last year.
He told BBC Scotland News he spends his days wondering where he will spend the night - either with friends or with his ex-partner.
""There is not a limit when you're desperate but it's embarrassing to ask to stay at someone's house for a night or two,"" he said.
""It's not good for your mental health either.""
Daniel cannot afford to save for a deposit on a privately rented flat, so his only chance of finding a place of his own is through his local authority.
Last year, he received a Schedule 5 referral from his council - where the authority instructs social landlords to find him accommodation.
But after approaching five local housing associations, he still hasn't been offered temporary accommodation.
Despite tests for ""priority need"" being abolished in 2012, he claims he was told his circumstances would have to change before he was likely to find a home.
Daniel said: ""The housing told me that because I don't have any disabilities, because I am working and because I don't have a drug habit, they can't help me.
""They said I'd be at the bottom of a list and that I'd stay there for a long, long time.""
He continued: ""The homeless team told me that they could put me into homeless accommodation for £100 a night, which obviously no-one can afford.
""They said I could build up a debt. I was thinking it was maybe going to be for a couple of days but they said, no, it could be for up to a year.
""How is anybody supposed to mentally go forward paying £100 a night, racking up a future debt, just to get a home with a housing association?""
It comes less than two months after the city became the third council in Scotland to declare a housing emergency.
Daniel was told there was available space in one of Glasgow city centre's bed-and-breakfasts.
Crisis said the use of homeless B&Bs in Scotland has risen by 124% since the Covid pandemic.
However, Glasgow City Council said last year it was planning on ""decommissioning"" the hotels as part of a £4.9m savings to its homelessness budget.
Meanwhile, campaigners raised concerns about the number of drug deaths in the city's hostels.
Daniel told BBC Scotland News that his own brother Gary died in homeless accommodation last July.
""It is not a place I want to go,"" he said.
""Plus the stories I have heard as well - there are a lot of drugs and drug dealing in those types of places and I don't want to be around that.
""I also wouldn't get to see my daughter if I was in a hostel.""
He continued: ""There is no priority for anybody that works. I was even told that I'll be at the bottom of that list and I'll stay there until my circumstances change.
""It upsets me to know that I am paying all that money to the government in taxes and here I am, walking the streets on my day off.
""I could be at home or warm in my bed but here I am, walking the streets and freezing.""
Daniel spoke as Crisis released the latest findings from its Homelessness Monitor this week.
The UK-wide study analyses homelessness trends across the country as well as the impact of housing policy.
In England, it found rough sleeping had increased 132% since 2010.
In Scotland, it suggested ""core homelessness"" happens at a lower rate but has risen 11% since 2020.
It is expected to rise by a further 33% due to a shortage in social housing, increasing private rent costs and cost of living pressures.
Meanwhile, the number of children in temporary accommodation has reached record levels in Scotland., while half of Scottish councils reported ""significant increases"" in footfall to homelessness services.
Dr Beth Watts-Cobbe, of Heriot-Watt University, said the rises were ""concerning"".
She continued: ""But while many of the trends revealed in the Monitor are worrying, the report also shows that projected rises in core homelessness can be prevented through a comprehensive response from policy-makers.
""Homelessness has been a major area of policy focus for the Scottish government since 2017 and with the right commitment Scotland can reverse these trends and reduce homelessness.""
The charity urged the Scottish government to allow people to ""get help up to six months before they are at risk of homelessness, while also introducing new legal duties requiring public services to play a greater role in preventing homelessness"".
The recommendations are expected to be included in the Scottish government's forthcoming Housing Bill, which is supported by Crisis and other charities.
Housing Minister Paul McLennan said the government had ""already committed to many of these measures in our homelessness strategy"".
He added: ""We are committed to reducing the number of households in temporary accommodation and we are acting on the recommendations of the expert temporary accommodation task and finish group.
""This includes investing at least £60m in 2023-24 as part of our £752m Affordable Housing Supply Programme to support a national acquisition plan.
""However, as the report notes, other changes which would make a significant difference are not within the powers of the Scottish government.
""The UK government should heed the calls from Crisis to increase Housing Benefit and other working age benefits. It is also concerning that another Local Housing Allowance freeze is on the horizon.""
A UK government spokesperson said it was spending £2bn on tackling rough sleeping in England.
She added: ""Our Single Homelessness Accommodation Programme is delivering up to 2,400 homes for rough sleepers by March 2025, and through our Rough Sleeping Strategy, we will continue to work to end rough sleeping completely.""

In some areas, it broke a years-long snow drought that left many, especially northerners, confused.
Other states, such as Texas, got an inch of snow, something Texans seldomly see.
Freezing temperatures swept the nation – and parts of the globe – last week with snow, ice, and sleet.
Some areas of the country were finally relieved of a snow drought that had persisted for several years, ending a streak of short, dry winter days. Other states that rarely see snow got a chilly treat.
These images, both lively and picturesque, show what it looked like across the nation.
Texas
Texas rarely sees snow, but the cold front left a lake in the Dallas-Fort Worth area looking like a frosty wonderland covered in light snow. The area saw over an inch of snow during the cold front.
Washington, DC
The nation's capital saw its first snowstorm in two years to the gleeful delight of children who finally got to pull their sleds out of the garage.
New Jersey
In Paterson, New Jersey, ice blanketed portions of the 77-foot waterfall, turning it into an icy dreamland. Some disregarded warnings of the freeze to capture photos in the ice.
New York
New York City also saw its first serious snow in two years, ending a dry spell that set a record for a city which usually sees two feet of snow.
Oregon
Oregon saw freezing rain and icy conditions that caused school and airport closures along with days-long power outages. The weather conditions caused over a dozen deaths in the state and dozens more nationwide.
Alaska
In Alaska, a 20-foot-tall snowman returned from its hibernation, allowing locals to smile for pictures. An Anchorage family erected the giant snowman again in 2023 after a 10-year break. The tradition started in 2005, per the Anchorage Daily News.
Tennessee
Children took to sledding in Sevier Park in Tennessee's capital last week when temperatures dipped to as low as -1 degrees Fahrenheit, per the National Weather Service. The area saw over half a foot of snow.
Illinois
Snow and ice in the Chicago area are certainly not rare, though this year was warmer than most for areas along the Great Lakes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

I9K6GW10KD_AZAGTIW0XKUR9AX,Ron DeSantis drops out of presidential race and endorses Trump,Tony Diver,"January 22, 2024 at 6:34 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-desantis-drops-presidential-race-213408745.html,"Ron DeSantis has withdrawn from the Republican primary race, leaving just Donald Trump and Nikki Haley battling for the nomination ahead of New Hampshire’s primary tomorrow.
The Florida governor said he did not have “a clear path to victory” and was suspending his campaign to endorse Donald Trump.
In a video posted on X, he said that while he had “had disagreements with Donald Trump”, he was “superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden”.
“He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear,” he said.
“Following our second place finish in Iowa, we’ve prayed and deliberated on the way forward,” he said.
“If there was anything I could do to produce a more favourable outcome – more campaign stops, more interviews – I would do it.
“But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory.
“Accordingly, I am now suspending my campaign.”
Polls showed Mr DeSantis was expected to receive around 6 per cent of votes in the New Hampshire primary, where Mr Trump and Ms Haley are competing for first place.
His campaign has suffered in recent days following a disappointing performance in the Iowa caucuses last Tuesday, where he secured 21 per cent of the vote and only narrowly beat Ms Haley.
Mr DeSantis had poured significant resources into Iowa, hoping to be in contention to win the vote or close that gap between himself and Mr Trump, who won a landslide.
In New Hampshire, the eligibility of independent voters in the Republican primary and Mr Trump’s dominance of the contest left Mr DeSantis with little chance of attracting significant support.
A poll released yesterday morning found Mr Trump was projected to win in the Granite State with 46 per cent of the vote, with Ms Haley receiving 44 per cent. Mr DeSantis had the support of 6 per cent of eligible voters, it found. Other polls by CNN and Suffolk University suggested Mr Trump’s lead may larger, predicting he will beat Ms Haley by a margin of 11 to 19 points.
The first sign that Mr DeSantis was planning to withdraw came on Saturday night, when he cancelled two scheduled media interviews on CNN and NBC, while Never Back Down, his Super Political Action Committee, cancelled events in New Hampshire, citing scheduling issues.
Mr Trump’s campaign seized on the apparent turmoil in Mr DeSantis’s camp, with staff posting online that the “end is near”.
Vivek Ramaswamy, who withdrew from the race after the Iowa caucus results, said that Mr DeSantis “would do the GOP and the country a great service if he drops out tonight”.
“This movement can’t be about ego or ambition. He deserves immense credit if he does. This primary needs to end on Tuesday,” he said. In response to the news Mr DeSantis had cancelled events and interviews, David Axelrod, the former Obama strategist, said: “Sounds like the end of the road.”
Following the Iowa caucus result, Never Back Down reportedly began sacking campaign staff, and moving many of the remainder to South Carolina, which will vote for its preferred nominee at the end of the month.
Mr DeSantis had hoped that months of work in Iowa and an expensive ground campaign would help him secure an early victory in Iowa, but he attracted less support than expected from rural voters and evangelical Christians, analysis of the results shows.
The 45-year-old former US Navy officer launched his presidential bid in May last year, and became the favourite of various contenders hoping to beat Mr Trump to the Republican nomination.
Reacting to the news, Ms Haley said Mr DeSantis “ran a great race” as she told a crowd in New Hampshire: “There’s now one fella, and one lady left.”
Speaking to supporters on a campaign stop, she said: “He ran a great race, he was a good governor, and we wish him well.
“Having said that, there were 14 people in this race. There were a lot of fellas.
“All the fellas are out, and this comes down to: what do you want? Do you want more of the same? Or do you want something different?”

The National Park Service said while hiking in the winter can be a beautiful thing, it is important to keep various safety tips in mind. There are several things people can do to keep safe — both before and during the activity.
Before heading out, NPS said to be prepared, know where you are going, check the weather forecast, know trail conditions, and discuss your plans with others, to name a few.
While hiking, it is helpful to have snowshoes and traction devices, know your route, be avalanche aware, and keep off the ice, NPS said.
“Remember — when you head outdoors you leave behind the established comforts of home: food and water; shelter from the sun, wind, and weather; and easy access to emergency services,” NPS said.

Chris Coons (D-Del.) said he was optimistic that a border deal would be reached in the coming days, but he placed preemptive blame on House Republicans if the deal ultimately cannot get over the finish line.
“President Biden has been asking for congressional engagement and leadership. I am optimistic we are very close to finalizing in the coming days a package that will make that possible,” Coons said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“And if House Republicans refuse to take it up, to consider it and pass it, then they will own responsibility for another year in which millions of people suffer the journey of coming to our southern border, only to be either turned away or ultimately deported,” Coons added.
Coons’s comments come as congressional leaders seek to reach an agreement each chamber can agree on. Last week, Biden invited Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and other congressional party leaders to the White House to meet with national security experts to underscore what he views as the urgency with which Congress must provide aid to Ukraine.
A proposal by the White House late last year lumped border security in with funding for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific region, but a bipartisan agreement has yet to be reached on the request by Congress.
With a very narrow majority in the House, Johnson has faced pressure not to yield on hard-right conservative border policies, which would unlikely pass the Senate.
Coons, in the interview, made clear Biden thinks addressing the border is “important for our nation” and emphasized the work the president has been pushing to get legislation to his desk.
“It’s important for our nation, and it’s important politically, that we secure our border. I’ll remind you, President Biden in his first State of the Union to Congress asked for congressional leadership in legislatively addressing our badly broken immigration system.”
“President Biden in his supplemental funding request, now many months ago, asked for $14 billion to hire thousands more Border Patrol agents, Customs and Border agents, to deport more people who are here that have failed to prove that they have a right to asylum here. President Biden has been asking for congressional engagement and leadership,” he added.

Sheku Kanneh-Mason, 24, who performed at the royal wedding aged 19, has said some people “don’t realise how uncomfortable a song like that can make a lot of people feel”.
The song is often deemed controversial due to its associations with slavery and Britain’s colonial past.
Some of the lyrics seen as controversial include the lines: “Britons never, never, never shall be slaves,” and: “The nations, not so blest as thee / Must, in their turns, to tyrants fall / While thou shalt flourish great and free: The dread and envy of them all.”
The song is traditionally performed at the Last Night of the Proms, normally with a guest soloist. In 2020, the BBC said the concert would perform the song without lyrics due to its controversy, but made a U-turn at the last moment and the song was performed with the original lyrics.
Speaking to Lauren Laverne on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Kanneh-Mason said he did not think the song should be included because “so much wonderful music” could replace it.
“I think maybe some people don’t realise how uncomfortable a song like that can make a lot of people feel, even if it makes [the people singing it] feel good,” he said.
“I think that’s somehow a big misunderstanding about it.”
Kanneh-Mason suggested the song could be replaced with British folk music, adding: “There is so much wonderful British music, the wealth of folk music from this country is astonishing.
“There is so much that is worth celebrating and having as part of a big celebration at the end of a wonderful music festival.”
Kanneh-Mason, who became the first black person to win the BBC Young Musician award in 2016, performed at 2023’s Last Night at the Proms alongside conductor Marin Alsop.
Responding to Kanneh-Mason’s comments, a BBC spokesperson said: “The Proms are built on longstanding traditions that were established by co-founder Sir Henry Wood, and which are loved by people around the world.
“One of these traditions is the last night festivities, other traditions include promoting new music, accessibility and opening up the world of classical music to as many people as possible.”
Kanneh-Mason, who was raised in Nottingham, appeared alongside his siblings on the ITV variety show Britain’s Got Talent in 2015. He is the third of seven children, who all play musical instruments.
Speaking about his upbringing in a musical household, Kanneh-Mason said his home was always filled with “nice sounding music” as he and his siblings would practice after school on most evenings.
“I found growing up in that environment, where you’re surrounded by everyone else practising, it meant that practice was less of a lonely thing when everyone else was doing it around me,” he told Laverne."

A long-shot candidate is trying to get his name out there.
Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn) is trying to make his message heard. Phillips held a rally in front of a crowd in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Saturday.
Phillips asked the crowd, “Are you ready to send a message to Republicans and Democrats and all Americans that you all matter? And Democracy matters?”
The congressman is running in the Democratic primary. He said it’s time for a new generation of leadership.
“I called on the president to pass the torch,” Phillips told voters at the afternoon rally.
Phillips also took shots at President Joe Biden for not campaigning in New Hampshire.
“I can’t believe it, but the President of the United States is not on the ballot,” said Phillips. “If he wrote you off, why would you write him in?”
Phillips touted his plans for universal health insurance and helping Americans get more financial stability.
Voters are fond of his campaign promises.
“I can’t believe how aligned I am with him,” said Donna Leroy, a resident of Dorry, NH.
“His message embodies everything that I believe we need in going forward with politics,” said Molly Campbell of North Conway, NH.
“I really liked what he had to say,” said Paul Leroy of Dorry, NH.
President Biden is not on the ballot here in New Hampshire. His campaign pushed for South Carolina to get the first primary. New Hampshire officials were not pleased with that request, and they are now going forward with keeping the primary to be the first in the nation.

(NYSE:IQV) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.
While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.
See our latest analysis for IQVIA Holdings
In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Constantinos Panagos, sold US$4.2m worth of shares at a price of US$209 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$215, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was 100% of Constantinos Panagos's holding.
Insiders in IQVIA Holdings didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!
For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.
Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that IQVIA Holdings insiders own 0.8% of the company, worth about US$304m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.
It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded IQVIA Holdings shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of IQVIA Holdings, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for IQVIA Holdings you should know about.

She turns 18 on May 27, 2024, and sources say she has a big decision to make.
According to Hello! US, per MSN, Shiloh will likely be deciding to go to college this year! Her older sibling Maddox, 22, studied at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, and her sister Zahara, 19, attends Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. (In November 2023, Jolie and Pitt’s daughter Zahara was inducted in the HBCU’s Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority!) Does this mean Shiloh will choose somewhere far from home to further her education?

Of course, she may decide to forgo college to focus on her career instead. She’s already made her mark as a dancer, and insiders told Us Weekly, “[Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt] have no issue if she wants to turn pro, but they’re not pushing it on her by any means.”
She’s also had cameo’s in her parents film, including an uncredited role in Curious Care of Benjamin Button. But it seems like acting is not her calling, as Jolie once shared her daughter’s reaction when she asked her to play the child role of Aurora in Maleficent in an interview with Elle, “I asked Shiloh about being Aurora, and she laughed in my face. She said she’d be a horned creature.” She has her own personality, and she’s not going to do anything she doesn’t want to do!
Jolie and Pitt also share kids Pax, 19, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 15. The duo started dating in 2005 and got married in 2014, splitting two years later. Since then, they have been in an ongoing, messy legal battle over custody of their kids and their properties.
The Salt star seems focused on her kids. She told PEOPLE in 2021, “They’re pretty great people. And because there’s so many of them, I think they’ve had a very significant effect on each other. It’s not like I’m the head of anything. I’m very honest with my kids. And I’m very human with my kids.”

IKAQTDZOZ7_CW25B9M1PIEYZ2B,Harris takes center stage in 2024 abortion fight,Brett Samuels,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/harris-takes-center-stage-2024-110000825.html,"Vice President Harris has cemented herself as the Biden administration’s foremost messenger on abortion rights, the issue that the White House hopes will define the 2024 election cycle.
After an uneven first 18 months in office, in which Harris faced criticism over her ability to handle complex and intractable matters including migration and voting rights, the vice president has planted her flag in the fight over reproductive rights.
Ever since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that ended the constitutional right to abortion in June 2022, Harris has been traveling the country, visiting red, blue and swing states to meet with activists, providers and women impacted by abortion bans.
“As a leader, she uniquely was able to meet the moment when Roe v. Wade was overturned, and she so galvanized the anger and fear people were feeling when the news came down that Roe was overturned,” said Karen Finney, a veteran Democratic strategist.
“Reproductive rights connect to a number of different issues,” Finney added. “Having the vice president be able to say, ‘We get it, we see you, we hear you and we’re fighting with you’ is critically important.”
Abortion rights have been a key issue for Harris even before the Dobbs decision.
She was endorsed by pro-abortion groups when she ran for California attorney general in 2010 and has maintained strong ties with those organizations in the years since. When she was running for president in 2019, Harris vowed to put more federal guardrails around abortion access by requiring states with a history of restricting it to seek clearance from the Justice Department before enacting any new abortion laws.
Much of the messaging from the Biden administration ahead of the 2024 election has been focused on the ongoing threat a Republican administration would pose to reproductive rights — and personal freedoms more broadly.
“Donald Trump is the reason that more than 1 in 3 American women of reproductive age don’t have the freedom to make their own health care decisions. Now, he and MAGA Republicans are running to go even further if they retake the White House,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden-Harris 2024 campaign manager, said in a statement.
“In 2024, a vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe, and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to ban abortion across the country. These are the stakes in 2024 and we’re going to continue to make sure that every single voter knows it,” she added.
Beginning Monday, Harris is embarking on a nationwide tour focused on the Biden administration’s efforts to protect reproductive rights.
She will start in Wisconsin, a battleground state where abortion fueled a Democratic victory in a key state supreme court election last year. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is promising to fight a GOP supermajority Legislature that just introduced a 14-week abortion ban.
While there, Harris will “highlight the harm caused by extreme abortion bans and share stories of those who have been impacted in Wisconsin and across the country,” the vice president’s office said.
“She will also hold extremists accountable for proposing a national abortion ban, call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe, and outline steps the Administration is taking to protect access to health care,” it added.
Biden campaign aides and Democratic strategists believe Harris will be a particularly valuable asset on the trail as she engages with young voters and voters of color, both of which will be important to the president rebuilding the coalition that helped him win in 2020.
“The first order of business when you’re running for reelection is to consolidate your base, and Joe Biden hasn’t completely done that yet. He’s not where he should be with young voters. He’s not where he should be with some women voters and some nonwhite voters,” said Jim Kessler, a co-founder of center-left think tank Third Way.
“Kamala can do a great job in all those places. The choice issue will certainly be front-and-center,” Kessler added.
One Democratic strategist noted Harris has long-standing relationships with pro-abortion activist groups, and her record on abortion is clear, dating back to her time working in California politics.
That track record gives her credibility on the issue, which is particularly useful given how President Biden’s views on abortion have evolved.
Biden as a senator initially expressed skepticism about the Roe v. Wade ruling, and he previously supported the Hyde Amendment, which banned federal funding for most abortions.
Three of the largest abortion rights groups — Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly known as NARAL, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and EMILY’s List — all endorsed Biden and Harris for reelection in June, just before the anniversary of Dobbs.
Angela Vasquez-Giroux, vice president of communications and research at Reproductive Freedom for All, recalled an event it hosted with Harris in April at Howard University in Washington, D.C.
“People were so responsive and reactive to her message and the way that she delivered it,” Vasquez-Giroux said. “She is a Howard alum. She …  just came across to me as authentic, very comfortable, you know, speaking to a crowd of mostly young Black women and reproductive freedom advocates. She just really seemed like she was at home and in her element.”
Even Republicans have taken notice of Harris’s efforts as the face of the administration’s abortion efforts.
Former Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News that while she disagreed with Harris’s policy views, the vice president was effectively tying her broader messaging about the Biden agenda back to reproductive rights.
“Because she knows what is true and that is — is the GOP has lost every single abortion ballot initiative post-Roe,” McEnany said Wednesday, calling Harris’s approach “very powerful among women.”
“When even your sworn enemies are able to appreciate how good a messenger you are, I think that’s another really great proof point,” Vasquez-Giroux said.

IMIGB93CJE_INOGUAL7END34FF,Can Trump be stopped? Key questions ahead of New Hampshire after DeSantis drops out of race,STEVE PEOPLES,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 7:17 AM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-stopped-more-key-questions-132117106.html,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — Donald Trump's effort to march to the Republican presidential nomination faces perhaps its greatest challenge on Tuesday when voters in New Hampshire hold the first-in-the-nation primary.
With Ron DeSantis ending his 2024 campaign and endorsing Trump on Sunday, the primary becomes the first one-on-one matchup between Trump and Nikki Haley.
The former president enters the contest emboldened by his record-setting performance in last week's Iowa caucuses. But New Hampshire has a more moderate political tradition and primary rules that allow unaffiliated voters to participate in the race. Trump-backed MAGA candidates have struggled here in recent years.
Haley, the former U.N. ambassador and onetime South Carolina governor, is hoping to capitalize on those vulnerabilities, especially now that she is the only major candidate left in the GOP primary aiming to defeat Trump outright. DeSantis, even before dropping out altogether, had effectively surrendered New Hampshire to focus instead on South Carolina's Feb. 24 primary. But he did have supporters in New Hampshire who now must decide what to do.
A Haley victory would usher in a more competitive phase of a primary that Trump has so far dominated. A Trump win, however, could create a sense of inevitability that he would become the GOP nominee for the third consecutive time.
Don’t forget Democrats have a primary, too. President Joe Biden is not on the ballot, having made South Carolina the first formal stop on the Democratic primary calendar. But New Hampshire is sticking to tradition and hosting its own Democratic primary anyway.
Here's what we're watching for on Tuesday:
CAN TRUMP BE STOPPED?
If Haley can't beat him in New Hampshire, she may not be able to stop him anywhere else, even in her home state of South Carolina.
The one-on-one fight between Trump and Haley is exactly what Trump's Republican critics have been clamoring for. Haley appears competitive and enjoys support among moderate voters and independents. She's also earned the backing of popular New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu.
Still, Trump remains the favorite.
Sensing a knock-out blow, the former president has called in his growing army of prominent supporters in recent days to help demonstrate his strength. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Trump's former opponent, endorsed Trump at a New Hampshire rally over the weekend. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik and Ohio Sen. JD Vance stumped for Trump on Saturday before an appearance from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.
A significant number of New Hampshire Republicans insist they will never support Trump. And without a competitive Democratic primary in the way, many left-leaning unaffiliated voters could decide to support Haley. But that doesn't change the fact that Republican primary elections are typically decided by Republicans, and Trump's grip on the base appears stronger than ever.
Still, New Hampshire loves a comeback story (just ask Bill Clinton), so we wouldn’t rule anything out.
WHERE DO DESANTIS SUPPORTERS GO?
DeSantis was seen as a distant third-place finisher in New Hampshire even before ending his campaign Sunday.
The Florida governor visited the state for the first time as a major 2024 primary candidate in June. After his 30-point drubbing in Iowa, where DeSantis had committed most of his time and resources, he surrendered New Hampshire before a single vote was cast. DeSantis actually spent the weekend campaigning in South Carolina, which hosts its primary election in five weeks.
But dismal poll numbers don't mean DeSantis had no support at all in New Hampshire. With him having aimed for the most conservative factions in the GOP coalition and then endorsing Trump, it's possible his formal departure adds votes to the former president's vote totals. Could that be the difference between Trump managing a narrow victory over Haley or garnering a clear majority that he then uses to declare the nomination a done deal before Haley gets her home-state shot at him?
HOW MUCH DOES ELECTABILITY REALLY MATTER?
Publicly and privately, Democratic leaders have repeatedly acknowledged that they fear Haley much more than Trump in a prospective general election matchup against Biden. We're about to find out whether Republican primary voters agree.
Haley has spent months telling voters that, without Trump's chaos and political baggage, she would be better positioned to defeat Biden in November. That argument didn't help her much in Iowa, where she finished just behind DeSantis.
She's betting that voters in swing-state New Hampshire will place more value on her longer-term political appeal. Sununu, New Hampshire's popular GOP governor, has been at Haley's side for weeks reminding voters of Trump’s dismal record in national elections ever since he entered the White House.
It's unclear if the message has resonated.
If it doesn't, it'll be because Trump has effectively convinced Republican voters that he — not Haley — is the most electable general election candidate. That's a risky bet, given his extraordinary legal problems, the attack he inspired on the U.S. Capitol and his demonstrated record of alienating suburban voters in successive elections.
Biden's unpopularity is no doubt muddying the issue.
Still, New Hampshire voters have an opportunity to cast a strategic vote Tuesday based on the one issue that seems to matter more than all else in today's politics: the ability to beat the other side.
IT'S ALL ABOUT TURNOUT
The end result may be tied most to who actually shows up to vote on Tuesday.
Iowa saw one of its lowest turnouts in recent history in last week’s caucuses. Low turnout elections typically favor the candidate with the strongest support among the party’s base. And in 2024, that’s Trump.
But Haley, with arguments about Trumpian chaos and electability, has been trying to appeal to independents and less-ideological moderate Republicans and independents.
New Hampshire law allows unaffiliated voters to participate in either party’s nomination contest. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the GOP primary, although voters had an opportunity to change their registration before an October deadline.
Haley needs a large turnout, driven by those unaffiliated voters, to have a chance.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David M. Scanlan predicted that 322,000 voters would participate in the GOP primary, which would be a record high. On the Democratic side, he’s expecting just 88,000 given there’s virtually no competition.
A PRESIDENTIAL EMBARRASSMENT?
It may not be the headline, but New Hampshire Democrats are voting for their presidential nominee as well. As much as Biden's team wants you to think they don't care about the outcome, they're paying attention.
Biden won't be on New Hampshire ballot, of course.
He's avoiding New Hampshire altogether after pushing the Democratic National Committee to award the nation's opening primary to South Carolina, a much more diverse state that's set to vote on Feb. 3. Furious about Biden's decision, the “Live Free or Die” state ignored the president's wishes and will host an unsanctioned Democratic primary anyway.
There are several lesser-known Democrats on the ballot, including Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and progressive activist Marianne Williamson. Eager to demonstrate Biden's strength despite his absence, the president's allies in the state have been encouraging voters to write in Biden's name.
The outcome will have no bearing on the number of delegates needed to secure the Democratic nomination. But an underwhelming finish, even in a write-in campaign, would represent an unwanted embarrassment as Biden tries to improve his political standing heading into the fall campaign.

“CA officials faced backlash to Cedar the goat’s slaughter,” (sacbee.com, Jan. 16)
The story of Cedar the goat is tragic but not uncommon. More and more children participating in programs like 4H are having a change of heart after spending time with their animals. They come to see them not as science projects but as sentient beings with emotions and unique personalities. By the time that awakening occurs, these children — some not yet in their teens — may be locked into “terminal sale” contracts with county fairs.
In California today, fair officials do not have to offer an opt-out option, but their rules can’t contradict a state law. Social Compassion in Legislation, the nonprofit I founded 17 years ago to bring more compassion into laws and hearts in California, will be sponsoring legislation to create such a state law and ensure that 4H families have the right to save their animals from slaughter.

“Sacramento CA council may rescind city manager’s raise,” (sacbee.com, Jan. 10)
The issue is not whether the city manager or city attorney can or should be able to place items about raises on the agenda. This is a classic reframing of the issue by the mayor and city council to take public scrutiny away from the real issue: the mayor and council lack the will to keep salaries such as these in check.
Instead of creating another bureaucratic procedural hurdle, put the issue of these salaries up for a public discussion and vote. And while they are at it, how about a performance review? Something most employees are obliged to undergo yearly.
Why should these generously compensated employees be exempt from an examination of their job performance? It is not a conflict of interest — real or perceived — for an employee to ask for a raise. We just need elected officials who recognize their duty to taxpayers and act accordingly.

“Two Sacramento council members propose citywide daytime homeless camping ban,” (sacbee.com, Dec. 1)
As I understand it, the ordinance proposed by City Council Members Eric Guerra and Rick Jennings would remove camps for all individuals in Sacramento City limits. They would have no alternative shelter and be subjected to tickets, fines and charges. How does this help unhoused individuals? What choice do they have for their basic survival needs?
This ordinance is useless. Time and money need to be directed toward effective housing solutions and assistance for the unhoused.

“This ridge is considered a California ‘jewel.’ Here’s how tribes are trying to protect it,” (sacbee.com, May 1, 2023)
Molok Luyuk is a ridge located on the eastern edge of Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument that includes federally managed public lands in Lake and Colusa Counties. This week, residents had the opportunity to participate in a community meeting session with officials from the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service. Over 200 attendees came, and all 75 public speakers strongly urged officials to add these public lands to the existing monument.
Molok Luyuk is a special and sacred place for local tribes and for many residents who enjoy activities like hiking and mountain biking. The natural beauty of our home also drives tourism, which is key to the economic vitality of the region. Protecting these beautiful lands would be a gift to future generations.
I urge President Joe Biden to respond to our community’s request that these unique lands be protected.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday suspended his presidential campaign, a stunning fall for the conservative leader who had long been seen as the biggest threat to former President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.
""I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory,"" DeSantis said in a message to supporters. ""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance.""
""While this campaign has ended, the mission continues,"" he continued. ""Down here in Florida, we will continue to show the country how to lead.""
DeSantis, who entered the presidential race last May, sought to build on the national profile that he had built for himself as an immigration hard-liner and as a politician who had fought against COVID-19 mandates. After winning reelection in November 2022 in a 19-point landslide, DeSantis' profile exploded, and he was immediately viewed by many Republicans as the conservative who could go toe-to-toe against Trump and capture the GOP nomination.
In several polls taken before DeSantis entered the race, the governor actually polled ahead of Trump, which at the time revealed the vulnerable state that the former president found himself in politically after Republicans faltered in the 2022 midterm elections.
After DeSantis entered the race, he was competitive in the early-voting states, but as the summer and fall went on, his numbers slipped precipitously across the country. He staked his campaign on winning the Iowa caucuses, but Trump's standing in the state only strengthened by the end of last year.
Trump's myriad legal issues seemingly had the effect of boosting his polling numbers with GOP primary voters, which in turn iced out DeSantis as the leading alternative to the former president.
Trump would go on to win the Iowa caucuses, taking 51% of the vote to DeSantis' 21% share and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley's 19%. Despite campaigning in all 99 of Iowa's counties, DeSantis did not win a single county in the state.
DeSantis' exit from the race also comes two days before the New Hampshire primary, a contest where he was struggling for relevancy, with most his polling numbers mired in the single digits.
The governor in recent days had sought to pivot to the South Carolina Republican primary on Feb. 24, but with Trump riding high there and Haley have a sizable level of support in her home state, his pathway to continuing in the race became incredibly murky.

IPFBHPYHUM_HQRWAU33QRQC9RK,Jam Master Jay murder trial to start Monday in Brooklyn with jury selection,"John Annese, New York Daily News","January 22, 2024 at 3:28 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/jam-master-jay-murder-trial-182800512.html,"More than two decades after assassins burst into Jam Master Jay’s Queens music studio and shot him in the head, two of the Run-DMC founder’s alleged killers will finally stand trial for murder.
Jury selection starts Monday for the Brooklyn Federal Court trial of Karl Jordan Jr. and Ronald “Tinard” Washington — a day after what would have been the hip-hop DJ’s 59th birthday. Opening arguments are slated for Jan. 29.
The mystery of Jason Mizell’s 2002 murder frustrated his family and the New York hip-hop community — with some wondering if the killing involved Mizell’s closest friends.
On Oct. 30, 2002, Mizell was shot point-blank in the head with a .40-caliber gun and another man was shot in the leg by two gunmen who were buzzed into his second-floor Merrick Blvd. music studio in Queens.
“It’s been a long time,” said Mizell’s cousin, Doc Thompson. “It’s just been too long, and I just hope we get the facts together.”
In 2020, the arrests of Jordan and Washington brought some answers — federal prosecutors say Mizell was dealing drugs and had cut the duo out of a 10-kilogram cocaine deal.
But the arrests led to more frustration — the trial was delayed for nearly a year to handle a late request for an anonymous jury. In the interim, prosecutors indicted a third suspect, Jay Bryant, who the feds say took part in the killing and bragged about pulling the trigger, even though they believe Jordan was the actual shooter.
Bryant’s case has been severed from the others, with a second trial set for 2026. But his role in the shooting could factor into Jordan and Washington’s defense if they try to point the finger at him.
And Washington pointed the finger at his co-defendant Jordan and his father, Darren Jordan, in a 2021 Playboy interview, telling the magazine, “I’m positive it was Little D (Karl Jordan). I looked him right in his face before he ran off. … Little D told me, ‘My pops wasn’t supposed to shoot Jay. That wasn’t supposed to happen.'”
Federal prosecutors haven’t fully tipped their hand to the public on what to expect out of the four-week trial, or whether any of the four witnesses inside the studio — ex-con Randy Allen and his sister Lydia High; local resident Uriel Rincon and aspiring rapper Michael “Mike B.” Bonds – will testify about what they saw.
Rincon, who was shot in the leg, broke his silence in 2007 to tell the New York Daily News that Mizell was carrying a gun that night, but he trusted his killer enough to never reach for the weapon. He said at the time he never saw the shooter’s face.
Thompson, Mizell’s cousin, slammed those witnesses for keeping quiet all these years.
“These are weak individuals, let’s be honest, individuals that my cousin looked out for. And they weren’t really his friends at the end,” he said.
Court filings show that the feds plan to introduce evidence showing both men had access to .40-caliber guns, and that Jordan had asked Mizell to “put him on” and involve him in his drug-trafficking operation.
They also expect to introduce witness testimony that a .40-caliber gun Jordan normally stashed in a van in Queens went missing around the time of Mizell’s murder.
Several months after the killing, Jordan shot Mizell’s nephew in the leg with a .40-caliber gun, purportedly because the nephew accused him of the music icon’s murder in a rap song, prosecutors said in an October 2022 filing.
Another witness is expected to testify that Jordan threatened to kill him just like he did to Mizell, prosecutors said.
One thing the jury likely won’t be hearing: a 2011 song from Jordan’s rap group “Rich Fly Gee$,” titled “Aim 4 Da Head.”
Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall said during a 2020 bail hearing for Jordan that violent rap lyrics are encouraged by music executives, and she wouldn’t “penalize any individual for participating in that artistic form.”
“I’m not going to hold any individual accountable for the lyrics in a rap song that is consumed by our community; and in fact, it’s consumed by me,” she said.
At a status conference Wednesday, she echoed those statements when Assistant U.S. Attorney Artie McConnell raised the specter of song lyrics in his bid to get an interview video admitted into evidence.
“You know what the answer’s going to be?” she asked, adding that she plans to put her position on music lyrics into a written opinion before the trial.
“Surprise, surprise, I think it’s important that I want to write about it,” the judge said.

ITH68BDMMZ_L9I5NY5IE6TUS8V,This Michigan woman hadn't seen her brother in decades. Here's how she found him,"Rachel Greco, Lansing State Journal","January 21, 2024 at 9:00 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/michigan-woman-hadnt-seen-her-000011584.html,"LANSING — Elizabeth Michalski can remember countless times over the last two decades when she nearly gave up looking for her younger brother Gilbert, who was given up for adoption as a child.
""There were times I just wanted to just say, 'I'm done. You know, I'm never going to find him.' I was ready to accept that,"" Michalski said.
But her family wouldn't let her, she said; they knew Michalski wouldn't be whole until she found Gilbert.
Michalski, 60, who lives in Sault Ste. Marie, finally found Gilbert last year living in Minnesota. She hopes to meet him later this year.
When Michalski was little, her family lived near Laingsburg. Her father, Merlin Fournier, was a merchant marine often away from home working aboard a ship.
The family moved to to Sault Ste. Marie in the early 1970s. Michalski, the oldest of all her siblings, was 7 when her mother, who was bipolar and schizophrenic, and struggled with alcohol and drug use, left their home in the middle of the night, leaving behind a husband and five children.
Before Loretta died in 2001, she had four more children, including Gilbert. Michalski's four half-siblings were scattered around the country.
Michalski's relationship with her mother, whose last name was Fournier when she was married to Michalski's father and when Gilbert was born, was strained, and almost nonexistent in the two decades before Loretta's death.
Over the years, Michalski searched for and found all of her other siblings born to her mother, including her younger sister Christina, who lives in Florida. But finding her brother proved to be more difficult and frustrating.
She started looking for him in 2001, after Loretta's death from a heart attack. Her late mother left her a photo album filled with photographs, records and keepsakes from Gilbert's birth on Aug. 26, 1973, at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing.
Michalski believed Loretta lost custody of her brother and that Gilbert was in Lansing when he was adopted — but it would take years, a DNA search and some help from a stranger who's made a hobby out of helping people find their relatives to connect with her long-lost brother.
""I'm just glad that my husband and everybody just kept pushing me,"" she said. ""I feel whole.""
Two years ago, when Michalski first talked with the State Journal about Gilbert, she was hoping his birth certificate and spreading the word about her search for him would lead her in the right direction. The story prompted interest, she said, but no real leads about Gilbert's whereabouts.
Her only memory of Gilbert dates to when she was 11. Loretta visited her and her siblings at their home in Sault Ste. Marie in 1975. Gilbert was 2 then, a little boy with curly hair. By the time Michalski saw her mother again five years later, Gilbert was no longer with her.
Michalski said there were times when the search became overwhelming and felt nearly impossible.
""When it got too overwhelming, I put it on the back burner for a little bit, then started back up with it,"" she said.
Her first breakthrough came in the form of a gift from her sister-in-law, an Ancestry.com DNA kit she received in March 2023. The second was meeting Denise Donnelly through an online group that helps people find their families.
Donnelly, who lives in Illinois, has been helping others find their relatives since the mid-1990s. Offering to help people like Michalski is second nature now, she said.
Searching for people is a skill she learned ""as I went. I'm nosy by nature so that helps a lot,"" Donnelly said. ""I know how to look for clues, so to speak. I also have an extreme amount of patience, where I can sit and look through documents, yearbooks, make phone calls.""
Today, DNA helps immensely, Donnelly said. She used Ancestry.com to find Gilbert less than a month after she started to look.
""She found a Gilbert that was born in Lansing and was adopted and she had a gut feeling that was him,"" Michalski said.
Donnelly sent Michalski his name, Gilbert Jordan, and contact information for people she believed knew him.
Along with the information Donnelly gave to Michalski, there was a photograph of Gilbert, now 50. That was all the proof Michalski felt like she needed.
""Just looking at him, his picture, he looks just like my brothers,"" she said. ""He looks just like my relatives on my birth mother's side. Yeah. And I knew then, that was my brother.""
Michalski reached out to the mother of Gilbert's 12-year-old son. They talked for an hour about Gilbert's life and his desire to find his birth family. The phone call eventually led to a text conversation with Gilbert, who is recuperating from an injury suffered just before Christmas and was unavailable to speak.
""I was honest with him,"" Michalski said. ""I told him everything that I know about our mother and what happened.""
She's hopeful the two will meet one another in person later this year.
""God answered my prayers,"" Michalski said. ""After I talked to Gilbert people asked me, 'What do you want for Christmas?' I told them, 'I got it. I got everything I ever wanted. I found my brother. I found all my siblings.'""

Flight BA854 took off from Heathrow Airport just before 7:40am on Sunday, and had been due to land in the Czech capital at 10:05am.
But the Airbus A320 plane was turned around over the Channel and forced to return to Heathrow, where it touched down again less than an hour after taking off, flight tracking websites showed.
The aircraft returned to Heathrow due to a technical issue and landed safely after the pilots chose to return in order to prioritise passengers’ safety, The Independent understands.
British Airways said in a statement: “We’re sorry for the delay in our customers' journey after the aircraft returned to Heathrow as a precaution.
“Our teams looked after them whilst they waited to board a replacement aircraft to continue their journey.”
Reports of fumes being observed in the cockpit could not be verified.
Footage captured by livestreaming services showed that several fire engines rushed to help the plane when it landed at Heathrow, the Mail Online reported.
It comes as the airline cancelled more than three dozen flights from Heathrow on Sunday, as forecasters warn that Storm Isha will bring winds of up to 90mph.
The Met Office has issued seven weather alerts for wind and rain on Sunday alone, with warnings set to remain in force across much of the UK until midday on Wednesday.
Millions of people travelling by air, rail and sea are set to face disruption, as forecasters warn powerful winds will bring a danger to life and could damage properties, tearing roofs from homes and downing power lines."
IXK8T1AIAK_DJM7IF8OJQV72X5,Republican vying for McCarthy's seat vows plan on border 'chaos' driving exodus: 'California for Californians',Danielle Wallace,"January 21, 2024 at 6:00 PM·8 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/republican-vying-mccarthys-seat-vows-090037904.html,"Californian businessman and philanthropist Kyle Kirkland spoke to Fox News Digital recently about his decision to enter the field of nearly a dozen candidates vying for former Speaker Kevin McCarthy's vacated House seat, pointing to the border crisis and the restrictive economic regulations that he blames for unfortunately driving talent from the Golden State.
Billing himself a ""media underdog"" among those running in the March 15 nonpartisan primary for California’s 20th district, Kirkland is the owner of Club One Casino and president of the California Gaming Association, the trade group for what amounts to a $5.6 billion industry impacting about 30,000 workers in the state. He said that although he's relatively unknown nationally, he enjoys a strong local base of supporters who personally know of his decades-long reputation as a ""highly effective business person,"" namely in Fresno County and the Central Valley.
""I'm not a career politician,"" Kirkland told Fox News Digital. He said voters want solutions to the high cost of living, crime, the border crisis, inflation, and government regulation amid Washington's ""grandstanding.""
In a district former President Trump largely carried in 2020, and that McCarthy represented from 2007 until his resignation in 2023, Kirkland explained what it means to him to be running as a Republican in what's considered a heavily red area of the widely blue state of California. Though the most populous state, California lost the second-highest number of residents in the nation last year, ranking behind only New York in population exodus. And Kirkland says the migrant crisis and California's business climate are to blame.
""I often joke to people that I live in a red state in the middle of a blue state, right? I've been in California now for three decades,"" Kirkland told Fox News Digital. ""I'm very proud of my roots back east and have brought those values with me to California. I think California has some real challenges… in terms of, you know, messaging that they're giving to business and messaging that they're giving to people. We need to keep talent in this state. And the way our economy works now is it's very easy to work from other areas.""

""Talent is exiting the state. And I think it's important for us to recognize that we need – California needs to keep talented people, certainly a lot of talented folks in the state,"" he said. ""It's routine for me to be talking to our friends. And they've said, oh, I moved to Texas. I moved to Georgia. Oh, I moved to Florida. I'm in South Carolina now. Right. And California needs to recognize that it needs to be California for all Californians and not just, you know, throw open the borders, let everyone in unchecked, you know, and hope for the best.""
""I think what's most important for California to understand is, hey, listen, people, businesses in the state want to know that it's going to be a friendly environment to them. Where it can be regulated — but there's a difference between regulation and suffocation,"" Kirkland further explained. ""And I think that's what a lot of people feel certainly in the business community that, you know, there's 900 new bills every year, and they're probably well-intentioned but probably not well-read and thought through, and they're dumped upon the business community to try to sort out with, you know, plaintiffs lawyers looking over their shoulder. And that's a very challenging environment to operate our businesses. So, I'm bullish on California, but we'd be naive to think that, you know, smart people are looking at saying, hey, is there a better opportunity elsewhere?""
While grateful to Trump for showing non-career politicians there's a path to get involved,"" and holding ""deep respect for Kevin McCarthy,"" Kirkland said he wanted to focus on the current race, championing his ""unique background"" compared to other primary opponents.
He’s worked with very large and visible companies, noting how he started his career at Bain & Company, around the same time Mitt Romney was at the consulting firm. In the 1980s, Kirkland said he worked in management consulting for global manufacturers analyzing oil fields during a challenging time for the energy industry. He then took on health care clients and transitioned to finance, working for a Beverly Hills firm very visible on Wall Street. Later, he moved into entrepreneurship, founding a ""little fledgling music company,"" with a partner that they built through acquisitions, including the global piano company, Steinway & Sons.
He said he turned that venture into a company that operated on six continents with 2,500 employees and was the longest running chairman who wasn’t named Steinway. When he sold it, he said the company had the highest product quality and profitability in its history.
From his work transforming the gaming industry from a struggling sector in California to now bigger than that of Nevada, Kirkland says he knows first hand what it's like to deal with California Gov. Gavin Newsom and his administration.

As for the border, Kirkland said he'd bring his ""ability to look at complex problems"" and be ""very realistic"" in his approach, while avoiding the ""bickering"" seen in Washington.
""I mean, it's chaos, right? A direct result of the Biden administration's policy of, you know, pulling down the no vacancy sign and putting up with basically saying, hey, free buffet, come on in. And what happened was exactly what you'd expect to happen as a business person, where it went from 400,000 folks a year trying to come to the United States to 2.2 million and is overwhelming the borders,"" Kirkland said. ""I believe in lawful immigration. I think it's important for the United States, certainly important for the agricultural community and the economy. A lot of folks are here lawfully, legally, and you know, again, to pursue the American dream. I'm all for that. At our core, we're all immigrant based, right?""
""But very clearly, voters are saying we want it to be legal. We want it to be fair. It's fundamentally unfair to let folks in unlawfully and then give them access to free health care and housing and, you know, food and cellphones or whatever, when, you know, most folks are making or struggling to make ends meet,"" he continued.
""And we have in our existing infrastructure, we have housing shortages, we have an overtaxed healthcare system, in the state of California, depending on who you ask, it's a $30 to 60 billion budget deficit. I think it's unfair, and people definitely feel that, to say, hey, listen, we want to be humane, but we have to be realistic.""
Noting the California Gaming Association pays about half a billion in local taxes annually to benefit largely underserved communities, he stressed how the ""hypocrisy"" of COVID-19-era lockdowns impacted business in the state. He also took a swipe at Newsom for flouting restrictions to attend indoor dinner parties while telling everyday Californians not to gather.
""Throughout [the pandemic] we were consistently negotiating with Governor Newsom's administration on our ability to open what parameters we could take. I also pushed back against what I think is the inequity there, frankly — the government's saying certain industries are allowed to operate and others of us aren't, you know, that seemed very arbitrary to a lot of us that were shut down and struggling to make ends meet,"" he said. ""But more than anything, it was the inequity of some of these things. I'm very big in fairness. The hypocrisy. Hey, listen, if you're asking me to wear a mask and not participate in outings, don't shop at French Laundry with your friends, you know, with your mask off, enjoying $1,500 person dinners, right?""

Kirkland contrasted himself with some of the other primary candidates, namely California assemblyman Vince Fong, a former McCarthy staffer. Kirkland explained that he hasn't built a career in politics to earn him the bigger endorsements. Fong, who McCarthy endorsed as his potential predecessor, as well as Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux and teacher and small business owner David Giglio have received the most attention so far in the primary contest. After March 15, two finalists, regardless of their party, will move forward to the May 21 special election.
Also a board member of the Fresno Chaffee Zoo, and founder of the Kirkland Foundation, an animal rescue that aims to help reduce overpopulation, Kirkland, a Harvard and Stanford graduate, said this next stage of him entering the political realm represents a ""natural extension"" of him trying to make a difference.

J2QGUN7WPV_KAPW007W6CDAE7I,White House defends retaliation against Houthis: 'Deterrence is not a light switch',AYESHA ALI,"January 22, 2024 at 3:36 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/white-house-defends-retaliation-against-150141633.html,"A top White House national security official is defending the repeated U.S. strikes on Houthis in Yemen, amid attacks by the militant group on international ships in the Red Sea, which has drawn America into a pattern of back-and-forth retaliatory operations.
""In terms of how this is playing out, I think one thing that's important to keep in mind is deterrence is not a light switch,"" the White House deputy national security adviser, Jon Finer, told ABC News ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. ""It requires a pattern and a practice of activity over time and can't be accessed based on a snapshot of what's happening at any given moment.""
Raddatz had asked Finer: ""Where does this end? It's in this stage of tit for tat.""
President Joe Biden acknowledged to reporters last week that the strikes weren't stopping the Houthis but that they would continue.
""The purposes here go well beyond deterrence,"" Finer told Raddatz. ""We are also seeking to degrade the Houthis' ability to continue launching these attacks.""
Since strikes on Red Sea ships began escalating in recent weeks, the U.S. has also announced an international task force to, essentially, help police the Red Sea area from further attacks.
The U.S. has taken diplomatic steps, too, Finer said on ""This Week.""
""We've imposed sanctions on the Houthis, we have gotten dozens of countries to issue statements condemning their attacks,"" he said.
Last week, the Biden administration announced that the Houthis would once again be classified as a terrorist organization, reimposing a designation the White House had earlier lifted out of concerns about how it could affect Yemen's ongoing civil war.
""This is not an attack just on the United States,"" Finer said. ""This is an attack on the entire global economy and the world is standing up and saying they won't tolerate that.""
Both the Houthis in Yemen and Iran, whom the U.S. calls a key backer of the Houthis, have said they are carrying out strikes in response to Israel's bombardment of Gaza in order to take out Hamas in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack.
The altercations in the Red Sea, at Israel's border with Lebanon and at U.S. military sites in Iraq and Syria, as well as elsewhere in the Middle East, have raised concerns that Israel's war with Hamas could spill into a wider regional conflict.
That's something the U.S. has maintained it doesn't want.
At the same time, U.S. officials have said they must respond to strikes from Iranian-allied groups like the Houthis and others.
On Saturday, an American airbase in western Iraq came under fire from Iranian-backed fighters, military officials said. Finer, on ""This Week,"" said, ""I'm not going to get ahead of any decisions the president may make, but you can be sure that we are taking this extremely seriously and we'll have more to say about it soon.""
Raddatz asked Finer about the U.S. decision to not take more direct actions against Iran.
Finer said the U.S. rejects ""the justification and the rationale that because there is a conflict going on between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, that entitles a group to take action, military actions, against the entire global economy, against shippers ... that have nothing to do with that conflict.""
He went on to say that ""we have held Iran responsible for this in a number of ways.""
""We have taken military action against sites in Iraq and Syria tied to [Iran], which supports these militias,"" Finer said.
""I'm not going to sit here and say we are going to take this or that action ahead of decision-making,"" he said, ""but we have been quite clear and we have been quite willing to take action to hold Iran responsible for these attacks in the past.""
Raddatz also asked Finer about the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, where Israel is continuing its now monthslong campaign against Hamas and where approximately 25,000 people have been killed, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.
Finer said last month that the White House thinks Israel ""did not show sufficient care for civilian life"" in Northern Gaza -- echoing what various other high-level Biden administration officials have been saying, trying to balance opposition to Hamas with public concern for Palestinian civilians.
Referring to his previous comments, Raddatz asked on Sunday, ""Have things changed and what do we do about them?""
""We have stood up for Israel's right to take defensive actions against Hamas so that this threat cannot be perpetrat[ed] against them again. But we've also been quite clear that the way in which Israel conducts this conflict is of great concern to us,"" Finer said.
He told Raddatz that the U.S. had seen a a recent ""shift"" in the fighting in which Israel has begun ""to focus more on high-value targets, on Hamas leadership.""
Still, ""There needs to be more humanitarian assistance going into Gaza,"" Finer said.
And while he called out ""small but consequential steps"" like progress with a border crossing opening and the arrival of some goods, he said that was ""not enough.""
""And so we're gonna continue to put the pressure on and continue to try to work day in, day out, in excruciating detail to make sure that the humanitarian assistance in Gaza is improved as this conflict shifts to a different phase,"" Finer said.

Nikki Haley in Tuesday's New Hampshire Republican presidential primary.
""If you can select a Republican ballot on Tuesday,"" it wrote Sunday, ""we urge you to select Nikki Haley as your next president. New Hampshire is ready for a change. America is ready for a change. The world is ready for a change. We want a better option than we have had for the past eight years, and Nikki Haley is that option.""
The endorsement did not mention either former President Donald Trump or Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who are running against her, instead touting her character and her accomplishments.
""She is easily the most qualified candidate on either ballot,"" it said. ""Nikki Haley is an accountant by career and training. Nikki Haley is a mother. Nikki Haley is a military spouse. Nikki Haley is the child of immigrants. Nikki Haley has experience as a successful governor and a diplomat.""
Polling indicates that Trump, who won the Iowa Caucuses on Monday, is in the lead in the Republican race, with Haley second.
""New Hampshire can prove that the independent-minded voters of the Granite State will not be told the election is a done deal,"" the endorsement said. ""New Hampshire can prove that nothing is inevitable and send Nikki Haley home to South Carolina with a head of steam.""
The Union Leader, which is based in Manchester, has long been influential in New Hampshire politics and, by extension because of New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary status, nationally. However, its endorsements in contested Republican primaries have not fared all that well in recent years: Both former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (2012) and then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (2016) lost.
In 2020, when Trump was basically unopposed on the Republican side, it urged independents or Democrats in its state to back Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who also lost."
J92AUO2ME4_3A4XLM8I9D76BTO,The Pro-Life Movement’s Aspirational Moment,Daniel Darling,"January 21, 2024 at 4:42 PM·9 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/pro-life-movement-aspirational-moment-074200905.html,"In the fall of 1973, horrified by the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision earlier that year, a lawyer in the Labor Department organized a meeting of a small group of women in her home. Nellie Gray, a Texan and veteran of the Women’s Army Corps during World War II, worried that the anniversary of the monumental decision would pass by without being remembered. And she had reason to think so. Many considered this the end of the conversation over abortion.
While the Catholic Church was vocally opposed to the practice of abortion, evangelical Christians had a mixed response. Christianity Today condemned the ruling as “counter not merely to the moral teachings of Christianity through the ages but also to the moral sense of the American people” while the largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist convention, was initially ambivalent. A poll taken a few years before Roe found 70 percent of Baptists supported the right to abortion. Few pundits and prognosticators thought this would be a contested issue in American life.
Yet what Gray and others catalyzed in those early days grew: 20,000 people showed up in January 1974 to march past the Capitol and on to the Supreme Court in what would become an annual rite for those who care about the sanctity of life. Evangelical philosopher Francis Schaeffer toured the country with Boston pediatric surgeon C. Everett Koop, giving lectures on the moral horror of abortion and touting their video and book, Whatever Happened to the Human Race? Pro-life ethicist Richard Land became the Southern Baptist Convention’s chief public policy spokesperson. Ronald Reagan, who had signed legislation loosening abortion laws in 1967 as governor of California, ran for president in 1980 promising to oppose the practice. Shortly after he wrote a small book, Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation, outlining his beliefs.
As the march grew into a movement, there were small yet significant victories along the way. The 1976 Hyde Amendment prevented the federal funding of abortion. The 1984 Mexico City Policy kept foreign aid going to abortion, though the policy has typically been enacted by Republican presidents and rescinded by Democratic presidents.
Yet the biggest goal, overturning Roe, always seemed more aspirational than probable. Year after year pro-lifers worked to elect presidents to nominate and senators to approve Supreme Court justices who might be willing to strike down the case. Yet after many near-misses—such as 1992’s Casey v. Planned Parenthood decision—it all still seemed impossible. Come 2022, many pro-life groups were meeting in anticipation of a half-century anniversary.
Then the unthinkable happened: The Supreme Court reversed itself in the Dobbs decision in June 2022.
What began in a living room in Washington in 1973 became one of the most effective social and political coalitions in American history, provoking—through a mosaic of legislative, legal, cultural, scientific efforts—the nation’s conscience with a new moral vocabulary.
So now what?
The movement has some advantages now it did not have five decades ago: durable institutions, political leaders who champion the cause, and a public that favors modest restrictions on abortion. Yet today, as in 1973, enormous challenges confront those who care for the unborn.
Ironically, the end of Roe—which once seemed impossible—complicates the legal and political fight. The pre-Dobbs legal argument was fairly straightforward. Even the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a champion of abortion, admitted that Roe was a flawed legal ruling.
Now the arguments are more nuanced. Is abortion a state issue? A federal issue? Look no further than the Republican presidential primary contest for proof: Former President Donald Trump has criticized Florida Gov. Ron Desantis for signing a six-week abortion ban. Some candidates have insisted that the arguments against Roe—that abortion should be decided by voters in the states—should be the ongoing standard, while others argue the federal government has a role to play in regulating abortion.
Dobbs was also a galvanizing event for the pro-choice community, which was eager to seize on this moment. Abortion supporters captured the zeal of their young base. They also won ballot victory after victory across even red states like Kentucky and Ohio.
Stung by setbacks, some pro-lifers may despair. But we should not—despite the wishes of so many—go away. Instead we need the aspirational hope and long-term vision of those first courageous advocates. We still need to see ourselves as a movement. Every effective force for justice has taken the long view, even if that horizon stretched past their lifetimes. Abolitionist William Wilberforce’s fight to end the slave trade in Great Britain took him his entire life. The civil rights movement has been a long, slow, painful march. And ours will be as well, replete with setbacks and losses.
Pro-choice advocates and many sympathetic media voices are quick to say that the pro-life movement was caught flat-footed for the day Roe fell. But that thesis is too simplistic. For years, pro-life advocates preached that the legal battle was just the beginning of the fight, which would then proceed state to state and would require much more changing of hearts and minds.
Still, a new era will require new approaches. The legal fight, so persistent and effective, will take a myriad of forms, from working to stop the distribution of abortion drugs at the federal level to conscience protections for people of faith. We know legal restrictions on abortion work, as evidenced by the reduction abortions in the months following the Dobbs decision.
The legislative approach will take many forms, too. Perhaps states with pro-life majorities will pass comprehensive restrictions while swing states adopt incremental ones. Legislators should be wise to carefully word their legislative language to include the rare exception for cases in which the mother’s life is in danger and then effectively communicate those clarifications in the face of widespread misinformation and hyperbolic coverage. Pro-life public officials should talk about these hard cases with compassion and care. The Kate Cox case in Texas was an example both to correct the common misconceptions about the health of a mother and also demonstrate genuine compassion toward her. And pro-lifers should be steadfast, but realistic, at what can be accomplished at the federal level. Without a 60-seat pro-life majority in the Senate, even incremental restrictions will mostly stall in Congress.
Yet the most important, long-term project is cultural. Though the pro-life message is a half-century old, we falsely assume every generation has heard it. New cohorts of young people may be awakened to the horror of abortion for the very first time and might be persuaded by the growing body of science that demonstrates life at the earliest stages of development. Pro-lifers should not give up the art of persuasion, adjusting and adapting the apologetic for a new age.
Those conversations may happen in places we hadn’t anticipated before Dobbs. Recent ballot defeats in conservative states like Ohio and Kentucky demonstrate that large cohorts of Republican voters, when asked as a single issue in a referendum, are less sympathetic to the pro-life cause. Shifting political maps have seen Trump bring in many working class, previously Democratic voters, to the Republican Party. Many aren’t part of church communities and are right-leaning when it comes to immigration and other issues, but are ambivalent about or even supportive of abortion. As Francis Schaeffer and others made the case in the 20th century, so too must a new generation make the case today with innovative approaches and persuasive arguments.
Pro-lifers have always understood that abortion is downstream from other cultural issues, particularly the economic and social struggles of American families. Many women today are alone, abandoned by men who see abortion as a way of escaping responsible fatherhood. Thankfully, a network of thousands of pregnancy resource centers connect mothers with resources and communities, usually religious ones, that can help buoy motherhood in those early years. But we need to supplement this good work with a renewed emphasis on the goodness of the family. Sociologist Brad Wilcox and others have documented the social benefits of stable, two-parent families even as the share of single-parent homes continues to rise in the US. Conservatives should not hesitate to champion the family and find ways to stabilize homes economically. Many pro-life leaders are already thinking in these holistic ways.
Conservatives should also recover a political philosophy of virtue, not in an self-righteous, preening sort of way, but in keeping with the spirit of the American founding. The Constitution was made for a “virtuous and moral people,” John Adams famously wrote. Many who champion faith do not, as so many progressives often argue, seek to construct a theocratic state. Rather, they acknowledge that freedom can become atomized anarchy without Judeo-Christian religious morality. Christianity emphasizes liberty to serve God and others in the context of community, as opposed to libertinism and unbounded individualism. Yuval Levin accurately diagnoses this malady in his book, The Fractured Republic:
The capacity of individuals to define the terms of their own existence by defining their personal identities is increasingly equated with liberty and with the meaning of some of our basic rights, and it is given pride of place in our self-understanding.
The American Founders understood this idea well. In his letter to the Massachusetts Militia, Adams wrote:
Morality and virtue are the foundation of our republic and necessary for a society to be free. Virtue is an inner commitment and voluntary outward obedience to principles of truth and moral law. Private virtue is the character to govern oneself according to moral law at all times. Public virtue is the character to voluntarily sacrifice or subjugate personal wants for the greater good of other individuals or the community.
Where it has influence, the pro-life movement should attempt to frame its arguments in the context of virtue. This might involve a distancing from amoral, barstool conservatism. Sometimes we may be forced into political alliances with imperfect characters. But we should not turn votes into endorsements of the worst behavior. While we welcome advocates where we can, we should be careful about platforming, as champions, those who champion a sexual ethic that feeds the abortion industry. Thankfully, many across the ideological spectrum are starting to question the aims of the sexual revolution and reconsider the virtues of stable, nuclear family life.
As I write this, I’m leaving Washington, D.C, and reflecting on another trip to the nation’s capital to join the protest Nellie Gray started a half century ago. The first march began four years before I was born. Yet I will fly home to continue teaching my own children, now teens, about the importance of standing up for the dignity of every human life. And I wonder, as they grow into adulthood, what stories will they tell. What movement will they inherit? What aspirational pro-life milestones will they see achieved in their time? We can, and must, hope and pray and act.

J9U1QE912E_75FVGU990DOVRMV,"Census change complicates racial profiling data in Massachusetts, presents opportunity","Jeannette Hinkle, Cape Cod Times","January 21, 2024 at 7:03 PM·12 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/census-change-complicates-racial-profiling-100301569.html,"Hispanic is widely considered an ethnicity, defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin. It’s a multi-faceted and even shifting identity that can be held by Americans of all races.
But the Massachusetts traffic citation — the source of statewide data used in court proceedings and public policy research on racial profiling — doesn’t have a field for officers to mark both a driver’s race and ethnicity. For more than two decades, the citation has only included a field labeled “race.”
Hispanic is one of six categories from which officers are instructed to choose when filling in the driver race field on the ticket. One police training manual defines “Hispanic” similarly to the Census.
Still, several experts and advocates said that even if Hispanic is one of the options given to officers filling out tickets, the lack of a separate ethnicity field contributes to the erasure of Hispanic drivers from traffic stop data by increasing the likelihood officers will mark them as white — whether by mistake, because of inadequate training or intentionally.
Hispanic and Latino people make up 13.1% of the Massachusetts population, according to the 2020 U.S. Census, second only to people who identify as white.
A USA TODAY Network investigation by the Cape Cod Times, Worcester Telegram & Gazette and USA TODAY revealed that in nearly 60 communities, police marked the majority of men with Hispanic surnames as white on citations issued from 2014 to 2020. Experts said the practice skews studies of racial disparities in traffic enforcement by inflating the number of white drivers cited and deflating the number of drivers of color cited.
The data is used by researchers probing inequities in traffic enforcement, the most common police-public interaction, and is also the foundation of legal defenses involving allegations of racial profiling. The state public safety agency, led by Secretary Terrence Reidy, has yet to respond to the USA TODAY Network findings.
District Court Chief Justice Stacey Fortes, citing the need for traffic stop data in profiling probes and the state’s new data equity law, said in a statement to the Times that the court is now considering the addition of a separate ethnicity box to the state’s citation.
But the categories used by Massachusetts police to collect driver demographics since 2000 might soon become close to the national standard.
The U.S. Census Bureau has proposed asking about Americans' race and ethnicity in one question, rather than in two separate questions, a change that would result in the nation adopting similar categories to those now used by Massachusetts police when ticketing drivers.
""Number one, they (Massachusetts) should collect all stops. Number two, every department in the state should do an annual audit, not for nefarious reasons, but just to know what the hell is going on.”
Alexis Piquero former director of the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics
The looming federal change, which isn’t final but seems likely, according to government officials, might make it more complicated for the state to address the miscoding of Hispanic drivers in state traffic stop data. It's a problem that experts including Alexis Piquero, a former director of the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, said underlines the need to audit traffic stop data collected by police.
Piquero, now a University of Miami professor of sociology and criminology, said the Census proposal presents a unique occasion for Massachusetts to overhaul its traffic stop data collection systems, most of which don’t track driver demographics on stops that end with verbal warnings — an estimated 40% of all stops — let alone other data points experts say give necessary context to traffic stops.
“Number one, they should collect all stops,” Piquero said of Massachusetts police departments. “Number two, every department in the state should do an annual audit, not for nefarious reasons, but just to know what the hell is going on.”
Proposed changes to the U.S. Census would essentially add “Hispanic or Latino” as a possible answer to a question about respondents’ race or ethnicity, rather than race alone, bringing Census categories closer in line with those already used by Massachusetts officers ticketing drivers.
The proposal, which is subject to change, would ask Census respondents to identify as White, Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Middle Eastern or North African, or Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.
""The proposal for a combined race/ethnicity question encourages the self-identification of race and/or ethnicity, and multiple responses are permitted,"" Rachel Marks, Chief of Racial Statistics for the Census Bureau, said in a statement.
Under the new Census proposal, a respondent could check Black and Hispanic, for example.
That’s not an option for Massachusetts police filling out traffic tickets, who must pick one category denoting their perception of the driver's race.
The proposed Census changes are intended to better reflect the way the country’s Hispanic and Latino residents see themselves today, Piquero said.
The federal Office of Management and Budget, which sets the categories used by the Census, cited research showing that a combined race and ethnicity question results in more complete and accurate data, and many researchers agree a single question about race and ethnicity will lead to a better count of the nation’s Latino residents.
When asked about Hispanic origin separately from race, a significant number of 2020 Census respondents who identified as Hispanic or Latino chose “some other race” on the race question or left it blank because they did not see themselves as white or Black, for example.
People who identify as Hispanic or Latino made up 19% of the U.S. population in 2020, according to the Pew Research Center.
Lorna Rivera, Director of the University of Massachusetts Boston’s Mauricio Gastón Institute for Latino Community Development and Public Policy, is concerned the wording on the combined question will lead to an undercount of the nation’s Afro-Latinos, who she noted experience some of the state’s worst disparities in areas including health and housing.
“Having the question be ‘what is your race or ethnicity’ is going to undercount the number of Black Latinos, and this is a very serious problem,” Rivera said.
Both Rivera and Piquero think the Census should ultimately move toward questions that better allow people to describe themselves, but for now, the federal government seems likely to adopt the changes as proposed.
The Office of Management and Budget is on track to finalize the plan by summer 2024, according to an agency official. New race and ethnicity categories would likely begin appearing on government forms soon after, though full implementation could take years.
Piquero, echoing other researchers who said consistency among datasets is key, recommended the state traffic citation mirror the Census, and change when it changes.
Adding an ethnicity box to denote a driver’s Hispanic or Latino origin now, and then changing the citation again to match the new Census categories once implemented would show “how percentages change or don’t change,” he said.
“In my mind, this is a really good opportunity for Massachusetts to do something very quick, very simple,” Piquero said. “Because even if the Census makes a decision, it may be still years down the road before everything gets changed on the forms.”
A change in demographic categories available to officers filling out traffic tickets would also be a good occasion for Massachusetts to provide statewide officer training that could reduce the number of Hispanic drivers being wrongly coded as white, he said.
“If they're miscoding for non-nefarious reasons, then this is a way to correct it,” said Piquero, who co-chaired a federal interagency working group that authored a 2023 report about transparency in law enforcement data commissioned by President Joe Biden while leading the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
The USA TODAY Network analysis of traffic citations showed the practice has a significant effect on traffic stop data, especially in some communities.
In Holyoke, for example, police citation data indicates about a quarter of stops of the city’s adult male residents from 2014 to 2020 were of Hispanic men. If those with Hispanic last names had been identified as Hispanic instead of white, their share of stops would have risen threefold to nearly three-quarters.
Piquero said that training should be followed by regular audits of officers’ traffic stop data. That type of supervision would help police chiefs identify officers who miscode drivers as well as officers who stop drivers of color disproportionately, and allow supervisors to provide timely supplementary guidance, training, or, if necessary, discipline.
Few Massachusetts departments would be able to conduct those types of audits because the demographics of the estimated 40% of drivers given verbal warnings remain largely unavailable even for internal review. Driver data is collected only for stops that end with a citation or written warning.
Though police chief association leaders lobbied state lawmakers against requiring municipal police to track all stops in 2019, some chiefs say collecting a complete dataset is necessary.
Both the Massachusetts State Police and Boston Police Department already track data on all stops because of internal policies, as all police in neighboring Connecticut have for more than a decade.
“It doesn't matter what the outcome is, whether it's a verbal warning or a citation or written warning or a criminal complaint, the data should be collected,” Northampton Police Chief Jody Kasper said during a phone interview last year.
Without tracking stops ending in verbal warnings, any analysis of traffic stop disparities is seriously flawed, experts including Piquero said.
“The fact that (verbal warnings) are not even coded is just mind-boggling in this day and age,” he said. “How you would not want to have an understanding of what police do is mind-boggling.”
The U.S. Department of Justice, which is investigating the Worcester Police Department, criticized the Minneapolis Police Department for failing to supervise officers’ traffic stops in its June 2023 investigatory report, which found “stark racial disparities (in traffic stops) that violate the law” and “yielded few gains to public safety.”
“Without clear, complete, consistent documentation, supervisors cannot meaningfully review police actions,” federal investigators wrote in their report on Minneapolis. “The result is that supervisors cannot identify and address trends or problematic conduct, such as unlawful or improper stops, racial profiling, harassment, theft, and sexual misconduct.”
Authority to require the collection of data on all traffic stops lies with the state Legislature, but the authority to alter the Massachusetts traffic citation lies jointly with the Registrar of Motor Vehicles and the Administrative Justice of the District Court, according to state spokespeople from multiple agencies.
Motor Vehicles Registrar Colleen Ogilvie declined to comment on whether she would support adding a driver ethnicity field to the state’s traffic citation, according to Registry of Motor Vehicles spokesperson Jacquelyn Goddard.
“While current law does not require the collection of data concerning ethnicity on the Massachusetts Uniform Citation … the Chief Justice of the District Court appreciates the importance of this information to help inform possible patterns of racial and ethnic disparities during traffic stops.”
Jennifer Donahue, Trial Court Spokesperson
But District Court Chief Justice Stacey Fortes, acknowledging the need for demographic traffic stop data to probe racial inequities on the road, is considering the addition, Trial Court spokesperson Jennifer Donahue told the Times in a statement.
“While current law does not require the collection of data concerning ethnicity on the Massachusetts Uniform Citation … the Chief Justice of the District Court appreciates the importance of this information to help inform possible patterns of racial and ethnic disparities during traffic stops,” Donahue said in the statement.
“The Chief Justice of the District Court is committed to beginning a dialogue with the leadership of the Registry of Motor Vehicles and other Executive Branch agencies, which are subject to the recent provisions of the Data Equity legislation, about how to best use the Massachusetts Uniform Citation to collect ethnicity data,” the statement concluded.
In August, Gov. Maura Healey signed “data equity” legislation that requires state agencies already collecting figures on race or ethnicity to capture much more detailed demographic data than is currently recorded.
But it is unclear how the law would apply to the state’s traffic citation, which is filled out by officers instructed to use their best judgment when recording driver demographics on the ticket — a method of data collection maligned by many Massachusetts police chiefs who would prefer drivers self-identify to the RMV when getting or renewing a license.
In response to the data equity law, the Executive Office for Administration and Finance is now reviewing existing data collection processes across state government, including data collection processes related to traffic tickets, according to an agency spokesperson.
The next step in implementing Massachusetts' data equity legislation is for the agency to issue draft regulations by Jan. 1, 2025. The agency will then hold a public hearing to gather comments from the public. The law is scheduled to go into effect the following year, after which the Executive Office for Administration and Finance will hold annual public hearings on implementation.
Piquero said the looming Census change offers a chance for Massachusetts to overhaul its stop data collection and analysis practices — not only to bring the state in line with others including Connecticut, but to become a national leader in a foundational area of policing where most advances are made at the state level.
USA TODAY Network’s reporting about the erasure of Hispanic drivers from traffic stop data illuminated a problem that Piquero said he has no doubt is happening nationwide.
But without federal guidelines about traffic stop data collection — guidelines Piquero thinks are overdue — ferreting out and fixing traffic stop data problems such as widespread miscoding of Hispanic drivers as white will remain a state-by-state project.
Given the current condition of its traffic stop data, Massachusetts has work to do, Piquero said.
“Massachusetts leads in so many really good ways,” he said. “Here's a chance where you can now be once again leading an effort where people will say, ‘Look at what Massachusetts is doing. Let's take a plane, let's go to Logan, let's find out what they're doing and let's take it back to our community because we trust what they're doing and we trust why they are doing it.’”

JCZ38Z4GF7_NJVOUP4GN5FZN3Y,DeSantis might be the worst presidential candidate in recent memory,Brent D. Griffiths,"January 22, 2024 at 7:23 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-might-worst-presidential-candidate-222356551.html,"Ron DeSantis dropped out of the 2024 race on Sunday.
At one time, it would have been considered an unexpected ending for a promising candidate.
Now, DeSantis will go in history as one of the worst candidates in recent memory.
Turns out, Mickey Mouse is stronger than you thought.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his presidential campaign on Sunday, succumbing to the final realization of defeat in a candidacy that once held such promise.
The epitaph of his campaign is and will be intensely debated. Perhaps, any politician trying to be a replica of Trump when the original was readily available was doomed to fail.
And yet, it doesn't explain the glitchy rollout. The weird, definitely too online videos. And how the governor of one of America's largest states, just seemed well, odd on the campaign trail. It's true that as DeSantis himself complained, Trump's unprecedented criminal indictments upended the race. Still, it seemed like one man in America who could have humbled Trump just couldn't stop tripping over himself.
It's worth remembering as pundits, foes, and anyone else kick the Florida man while he's down that they remember DeSantis once cut a much different figure. After all, there's a reason the Biden White House once made it a point to tangle with him regularly.
DeSantis cut his teeth after narrowly winning a general election over then-Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a candidate who was virtually anointed as the future of the Democratic Party but who now looks at best like a deeply flawed challenger. And yes, it was then-President Donald Trump whose endorsement powered DeSantis to that very general election in the first place.
You know how the story goes. DeSantis pivoted away from his early governorship to becoming a pandemic-era culture warrior willing to take on Trump or anyone else who stands his way. He later added Disney, one of his state's largest employers, to his enemy list. After pundits point out this a bold strategy for a historic swing state, DeSantis pulls off a historic reelection rout.
Front pages proclaimed him the man of the moment. Very early polling showed DeSantis leading Trump in national polling. The Wall Street Journal had him up by double digits over Trump in a 2022 poll.
Of course, it didn't last.
It might be our fault too, more specifically the media. To juice early interest in the presidential race, the national media often declares frontrunners that age more poorly than a mid-2000s sitcom: just ask Rudy Giuliani, Scott Walker, and Kamala Harris (briefly). Some, namely Joe Biden, campaign long enough to go from frontrunner to also-ran back to winning the race again. But for the rest, they drop out before the Iowa caucuses or live on long enough to be humbled by roughly a couple hundred thousand Americans.
While DeSantis may often be compared to former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the Floridian's disappointing performance might be so bad that he has now risen close to the level occupied by Giuliani. As America's (former) Mayor, Giuliani dominated early polling in the 2008 Republican primaries. But Giuliani was ultimately doomed by cultural issues (evangelical conservatives couldn't stomach his then-pro-choice views) and his curious decision to skip the early states in favor of focusing on the delegate battle. He ultimately staked his campaign on Florida. After finishing third, he quickly dropped out.
Walker's failed candidacy is similar in that the Wisconsin Republican expanded his operation quickly to match the early hype for his bid. Just like DeSantis, Walker ended up being doomed by the sheer rate at which his campaign burned through contributions.
Maybe there's a different ending in another multiverse. But in this reality, a week ago DeSantis lashed out at ""worthless"" Republicans who back Trump.
""You can be the most worthless Republican in America, but if you kiss the ring, he'll say: 'You're wonderful,"" DeSantis told Iowans just a day before he finished the caucuses without carrying a single county.
DeSantis can only hope he'll return to a wonderful world as Florida's governor. It sure won't be Disney's.

Ceredigion-based Chuckling Goat has gone from selling its goat milk-based Kefir to launching a microbiome test kit with the University of Cambridge.
""We basically examine everything that's going on inside the microbiome,"" said co-founder Shann Jones.
It comes as one industry expert claims Wales has a ""huge"" opportunity to grow into the £2.8bn health tech sector.
Chuckling Goat advert banned over virus claim
How bacteria are changing your mood
Why you should always go to sleep at the same time
Ms Jones said that the ability to do a gut health test in ""the privacy and comfort of your own home has changed everything"".
Fermented foods, such as Kefir, contain a variety of ""good"" bacteria which, if they can survive the journey to our gut, can be beneficial for our health.
Ms Jones said the idea of gut health tests started when customers would ask her ask for solutions to medical problems, to which she was ""just having to guess"".
""When we saw that there was a microbiome test available that gave us an evidence based starting point to improve people's gut health, I was excited because I thought this is going to make my job a lot easier,"" she said.
The company, based in Brynhoffnant, Ceredigion, spent two years and £250,000 developing the microbiome test kit with the University of Cambridge.
Customers order the kit online and then send off a stool sample to the laboratories at the University of Cambridge.
""We give you answers about how you can improve your gut health from day one,"" Ms Jones added.
At Cambridge, the stool samples are analysed by Dr Anton Enright and his team of scientists, who work to discover what bacteria is living in each gut.
""We have a little poo post box... so the kits come in [and] the team will work through 20 or 30 samples and get to the bacterial DNA,"" he said.
After that is processed in a DNA sequencer, Dr Enright and his team are provided with ""lists of bacteria and how many times they've been seen"".
This data is then used by Chuckling Goat to determine what product they can recommend to help with any health issues their customers might be living with.
According to Dr Rhodri Griffiths from the Life Sciences Hub, a growth in Wales health technology sector, it will provide both economic and health benefits.
""Technologies are now coming into health and offer huge potential to be able to keep people more at home, to reduce the need for hospital care.
""It's not only beneficial to the public's health. There's an economic benefit also, with the life sciences industry worth £2.8bn to the Welsh economy in 2022.
""This market is worth billions around the world and is growing every year. So there's an opportunity to be able to take technologies from elsewhere and adopt them within Wales."""

When Consumer Reports spoke with Jeep Grand Cherokee owners, the magazine found a number of unhappy customers. Though Jeep generally inspires incredible devotion among its consumers, Cherokee owners complained about issues with the air suspension and steering linkage. Annoyingly enough, the in-car electronic system can experience freezes, randomly going blank for up to 24 hours. Some of the owners even reported needing to replace their in-car electronic systems entirely.
Though Volkswagen is typically a trusted manufacturer, the Volkswagen Taos left the car owners that Consumer Reports spoke with feeling disappointed in its overall reliability. They reported major problems, such as brake issues and transmission woes — and as anyone who has ever paced a car repair shop waiting room will tell you, fixing a transmission is a massive expense. On top of these already considerable problems, owners also described engine troubles.
The Mercedes Benz name still carries prestige, though Mercedes Benz GLE owners might have a quibble or two about its reliability. They report problems with the car’s body hardware, as well as random noises and leaks, which can do more than startle you when driving, possibly resulting in considerable repair fees. Drivers also experienced issues with the car’s electrical accessories and reported keyless entry malfunctions.
You might think you’re getting an eco-friendly vehicle that’s safe for families in the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan. But that’s not exactly the case, according to drivers who have experienced issues with the minivan’s charging capabilities and drive system. Drivers also share that the car’s battery system has problems with its heating and cooling.
Nissan is another valued name in auto manufacturing, but many buyers have their share of remorse. Only 48% of Nissan Altima owners say that they’d purchase their cars again. The Car Guide reports that this sedan comes with an uninspiring drive, a free-falling segment, and only part time all-wheel drive.

""This is heartbreaking and utterly unacceptable. The Middle East is a tinder-box, we must do all we can to prevent conflict from igniting across the region.""
Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the Islamist militant group Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which Israeli officials say more than 1,200 Israelis and foreigners were killed and 240 taken hostage.
Israel's campaign has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities on Sunday, and displaced most of the enclave's 2.3 million people from their homes.
Over the course of the war, the Israeli military has expressed regret for civilian deaths but it accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the group denies.
Guterres added that the refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians is totally unacceptable, saying denying Palestinians the right to statehood ""would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared on Saturday to push back against U.S. President Joe Biden's remarks about Palestinian statehood after the war against Hamas ends. His office said that in talks on Friday with Biden, Netanyahu ""reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty"".
Guterres was in Kampala to attend the summits of G77+China and the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). Leaders and senior officials from dozens of countries including South Africa, Iran, China, Turkey, Cuba, India, Vietnam and others attended the meetings.
The G77+China is a group of 134 developing countries that champions the common interests of countries from the global south.
A document released late Saturday at the end of the NAM summit included a condemnation of ""the illegal Israeli military aggression on the Gaza Strip, the indiscriminate attacks against Palestinian civilians, civilian objects, the forced displacement of the Palestinian population"" and called for an immediate and durable humanitarian ceasefire.

Morales stopped at the clerk’s office Friday to announce the grant, part of $2 million his office is awarding to 64 counties to improve their election processes.
“We need to be ready,” he said, referring to presidential elections that likely will spur heavy voting in addition to county, state and school board elections. “We want as many eligible voters to be part of the process.”
The state’s $2 million comes from the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002, which aimed to make improvements to voting systems and voter access after issues were identified in the 2000 elections.
County Clerk Amy Rolfes wasn’t specific about the security measures that would be added, to avoid risking that security. But she said that it has to do with their storage, including in a warehouse that Morales had toured on a prior visit when the county was applying for the grant.
She said there is good security now, but she noted that there were some issues with storage that needed improving. She said her office worked collaboratively with other election-oriented organizations for input on the security. That included a visit she and her staff made to a program at Ball State University that advises the Secretary of State and the Indiana Election Commission on the certification of voting machines and electronic poll books in Indiana. It’s known as the Voting System Technical Oversight Program.
Rolfes emphasized that, when she campaigned for office in 2022, she vowed to improve election security.
To be clear, Rolfes said, the new measures don’t have anything to do with the controversial investigation into a ballot storage room and keys after the 2022 primary elections, where no criminal wrongdoing was found.
The county’s funding will also purchase a new high-speed scanner that will be used on election night to count ballots in a “more timely” manner, she said. The county already has two scanners, but she expects the number of ballots to “almost double” this year.
Morales said the HAVA money has been used for different purposes in the past, including for advertising, but he wanted it to support counties in whatever they needed to improve their election processes.
It was offered to all of Indiana’s 92 counties, though only 64 applied, all of which are receiving grants. Other counties, Morales said, asked instead for his appearance or show of support at council or commissioner meetings.
He said there was a baseline amount of funding that was pegged per county, based on the numbers of voters, but the grants were also based on the costs of what each county was seeking.
The grants range from $1,080 to $123,501. They fill a range of needs, Morales said, from iPads used to register voters to signage.
St. Joseph County’s grant pays for the exact costs of the security and scanner, Rolfes said. The security measures didn’t fit into the Secretary of State’s funding categories of voting process and voting outreach and education. But, she said, Morales and the grant were “flexible” to make it happen.
Morales also stopped in Plymouth on Friday to announce that the Marshall County Clerk’s Office will receive $21,777 through the grant.
“It couldn’t come at a better time,” County Clerk Jenny Bennitt said. “We really needed to replace our equipment.”
The grant, Bennitt said, will cover the full cost of several pieces of equipment. An encoder will assign a number to each voter, which, she said, is more efficient and accurate than doing it manually. High-speed printers will replace outdated ones, used for printing a tally at the start and end of a day of voting. Portable folding partitions will replace the cubicles of various sizes where voters fill their ballots at the clerk’s office during early voting. And she said a trolley will help to transport certain heavy, cumbersome pieces of voting equipment.

JLTYBDEA7U_Z0E4Y95OK5MIYMR,Joe Biden supporters push write-in campaign in New Hampshire: What to know,"Karissa Waddick, USA TODAY","January 21, 2024 at 7:04 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/joe-biden-supporters-push-write-100435261.html,"President Joe Biden is skipping the New Hampshire primary. Sort of.
Biden’s name will not appear on the state’s Democratic ballot because of a dispute over the date of the contest. However, many New Hampshire Democrats are planning to vote for the president anyway.
A ragtag group of state party leaders have worked for months to organize a write-in campaign to ensure that Biden wins the first-in-the-nation primary. A loss by Biden − even after he decided not to compete in the state − could create an embarrassing narrative and lead to broad unease over his 2024 reelection chances.
Here’s a look at how the Biden write-in effort started and why it matters.
Last year, under Biden’s guidance, the Democratic National Committee reshuffled the primary calendar and put South Carolina at the front of the order. It said the goal was to elevate diverse voices early in the presidential nominating contest.
However, New Hampshire is required by law to hold the first primary in the country and its Republican-run legislature declined to accommodate the DNC’s rule change. Secretary of State David Scanlan waited to set the date of the primary until the candidate filing deadline ended last fall to leave the door open for Biden.
The president declined to participate in the state’s election, citing concerns that the national party would take away delegates from any candidate who participated in an unsanctioned contest.
Scanlan later set the date of the race for Jan. 23 – a week and a half ahead of South Carolina’s Democratic primary.
When the DNC officially changed its primary calendar last February, seasoned New Hampshire Democrats knew there would be trouble because of the state's election law. Many were frustrated at Biden’s decision to strip the state of its historic place in presidential politics.
As it became clear over the summer that Biden would not engage with the primary, party leaders in the state began floating the idea of a write-in campaign. At the time, Robert F. Kennedy was still running as a Democrat. Kathy Sullivan, former chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, remembered thinking that Democrats could not let him win in the state.
“To have Robert F. Kennedy Jr. win the New Hampshire primary, it would have been a bad day for President Biden,” Sullivan said. Kennedy later decided to run as a third-party candidate.
There are two main groups supporting the Biden write-in effort.
A grassroots group called Granite State Write-In has informally organized over 1,200 volunteers to vote for the president and convince their friends, family and acquaintances to do the same.
With only two paid staffers, and roughly $50,000 in its war chest, the group has mainly focused on putting up yard signs and deploying volunteers to spread the word at local Democratic town committee meetings.
The group also has organized a number of “visibility” events featuring national Democrats, such as Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, to spread the word the weekend before the primary.
Sullivan also kick-started a super PAC, called Granite for America, in mid-November. The organization has sent seven mailers to likely Democratic voters encouraging them to vote for Biden and explaining how to do so. While it has run some digital ads, television spots haven’t been in the cards.
The actual process of voting for Biden in New Hampshire is fairly easy. The Democratic ballot will have 21 names on it, including the president’s leading challengers Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and self-help author Marianne Williamson.
Below those names, there is an empty line that says “write-in.” Voters must fill in the oval on the line and legibly print Biden’s full name. The secretary of state’s office has said that as long as the “intent” of the name listed is clear, the vote will likely count for Biden.
Biden is widely expected to win the New Hampshire primary.
An overwhelming 64% of likely Democratic primary voters in a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University/Boston Globe survey said they planned to back the president on Jan. 23, compared to 6% who said they supported Phillips and 2% who supported Williamson.
But organizers of the write-in effort are setting low expectations for his margin of victory.
Write-in efforts of this scale are not without precedent in American politics. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski won a similar effort in the 2010 general election after she was defeated in the Republican primary.
“As I keep reminding folks, this is not easy,” Sullivan previously said. “It's not the typical election and so it becomes a bit of a heavy lift, because you are having to encourage people to get out and that when they go to vote, his name will not be on the ballot.”

Fityo noted that Ukrainian troops had been moved to prepared reserve positions to hold the defense and prevent Russia from advancing further. ""We simply don't report on the repulse of 100-200 meters, and for Russian propagandists, any victory must be presented to explain why they lost 7,055 soldiers at the front in the Khortytsia zone of responsibility in January alone,"" Fityo said during the live televised broadcast.He added that the front lines shift daily and that the loss of the small village, which had a pre-war population of 45, is a “temporary phenomenon.”Ukraine managed to repel 21 attacks near Synkivka, Petropavlivka, Kharkiv Oblast, and Stelmakhivka, Luhansk Oblast, the Armed Forces General Staff reported earlier in the day. 80 clashes took place on Jan. 20.

Asked by Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier in New Hampshire about when he will decide who could join him on the ticket if he secures the nomination, Trump said, “Well, it’s never really had that much of an effect on an election, which is an amazing thing, both election and primary. It’s never really had much of an effect.”
“I may or may not really [decide] something over the next couple of months. There’s no rush to that. It won’t have any impact at all. The person that I think I like is a very good person, a pretty standard. I think people won’t be that surprised, but I would say there’s probably a 25 percent chance that would be that person,” Trump continued.
Asked if Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) — who dropped out of the GOP primary race in November and endorsed Trump on Friday — is on the list, Trump described the senator as a “great guy” while highlighting other political figures from the Palmetto State.
“You know, [Scott] endorsed me. There’s an example, [Nikki Haley] comes from South Carolina, Tim Scott is from South Carolina. But if you look [at] the governor, great governor, another senator [Lindsey Graham]. We happen to like Lindsey,” Trump said. “But, [Gov. Henry McMaster (R)] knows it very well. He endorsed me. It’s very hard for a governor to endorse somebody when you haven’t … I mean, Henry McMaster was the lieutenant governor under her and he endorsed me … What does that tell you?”
In a Fox News town hall in Iowa earlier this month, Trump indicated he would be willing to consider any of the people who ran against him.
“I’ve already started to like [Chris Christie] better,” Trump said, in reference to the former New Jersey governor who dropped out of the primary race earlier this month. Christie and Trump have had a tumultuous relationship over the years, with Christie’s 2024 campaign largely squared on criticizing the former president.
Trump has largely kept his cards close to his chest when it comes to who might join him on the Republican ticket.
Several Trump allies have urged him to select a female running mate, suggesting names such as Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem.

With the right investments, you can turn a few hundred dollars per month into hundreds of thousands of dollars or more over time.
If you're new to the stock market or simply want a no-fuss investment that requires little effort, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) may be a smart bet.
There are countless ETFs to choose from, and everyone's investing preferences will differ slightly. But there's one Vanguard ETF that could turn $400 per month into nearly $800,000. Here's exactly how to get there.
There are never any guarantees when it comes to the stock market, but an S&P 500 ETF is one of the safest funds out there. This type of investment tracks the S&P 500 index itself, meaning it includes the same stocks as the index and follows its performance over time.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) contains 505 stocks across 11 different industries, and these stocks are from some of the strongest companies in the U.S. -- ranging from tech giants like Apple and Amazon to long-established brands like Coca-Cola and 3M.
There are several advantages to investing in an S&P 500 ETF. For one, because you're investing in hundreds of different stocks across a variety of industries, you have an instantly diversified portfolio with just one investment. This can help reduce your risk, especially during periods of volatility.
The S&P 500 itself also has a perfect track record of recovering from market downturns and recessions. While that doesn't guarantee that this ETF will survive whatever the future has in store, it's extremely likely it will rebound from future slumps.
Finally, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers a low expense ratio of just 0.03% per year, meaning that for every $10,000 in your account, you'll pay $3 per year in fees. This is far lower than many other funds, a fact that could save you thousands of dollars in fees over time.
Though the S&P 500 ETF is one of the safest, most reliable investments out there, it can still help you make a lot of money over time.
Since its inception in 2010, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has earned an average rate of return of just under 14% per year. However, because the market has been mostly thriving in that time, a more realistic return may be around 10% per year on average -- which is in line with the historic average returns of the stock market itself.
If you were to invest $400 per month while earning a 10% average annual return, here's approximately how much you could accumulate over time:
Number of Years
Total Portfolio Value
20
$275,000
25
$472,000
30
$790,000
35
$1,301,000
40
$2,124,000
Data source: Author's calculations via investor.gov.
To reach $790,000 in total savings, you'll need to invest consistently for around 30 years. While that's a long time to wait, keep in mind that this investment requires next to no effort on your part. You never need to choose stocks, keep up with industry trends, or decide when to buy or sell. Simply invest whatever you can afford, then sit back and wait for your money to grow.
One downside to consider with this investment, though, is that you can't earn above-average returns. The S&P 500 ETF aims to follow the market's performance, so it can't beat the market. If that's a priority for you, investing in individual stocks could help you earn much higher-than-average returns over time.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF can be a fantastic choice if you're looking for a low-maintenance investment that still packs a punch. With enough time and consistency, you could build a portfolio worth hundreds of thousands of dollars or more with next to no effort.

The situation unfolded at the Lawrenceburg McDonald’s at 203 West Park Drive Dec. 23, when officers with the Lawrenceburg Police Department were called because of a “verbal altercation inside the restaurant,” Kentucky State Police said in a news release Saturday night.
As Lawrenceburg officer David Goodlett pulled into the parking lot, state police said he was fired on by Daejon Rucker, 24. Goodlett and the other responding officer, John Myles, returned fire, hitting Rucker, according to state police.
“Officers administered life saving measures until Anderson County EMS arrived on scene,” state police said.
Rucker sustained life-threatening injuries and was taken to Frankfort Regional Hospital before being transferred to the University of Kentucky’s Albert B. Chandler Hospital, according to the news release.
Upon his release from the hospital Saturday, Rucker was arrested and taken to the Shelby County Detention Center, according to KSP Trooper Josh Satterly.
He’s charged with attempted Murder of a police officer, attempted murder, first-degree wanton endangerment of a police officer, wanton endangerment and violation of an emergency protective order.
Goodlett and Myles were both “placed on two-week paid administrative leave in accordance with the policies of the Lawrenceburg Police Department,” state police said. Kentucky State Police investigated the shooting.

JRBPHBJGBT_7UJH8F1N3OVDEXG,Inside the door-to-door battle to boost Nikki Haley in New Hampshire,Allan Smith,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 9:52 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/inside-door-door-battle-boost-212015698.html,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — When Ken Chase pondered whom he would vote for in Tuesday’s first-in-the-nation GOP presidential primary here, he didn’t see much of a choice at all.
“Well, [former President Donald] Trump seems to be the only choice,” Chase told a door-knocker from Americans for Prosperity Action.
That wasn’t what AFP wanted to hear. The conservative group is going door to door in early-voting states, hoping to convince primary voters to back former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley’s presidential bid.
But Chase didn’t see Haley breaking through in the Granite State.
“My wife doesn’t like her. I’m neutral,” he said. “Anybody would be better than [President Joe] Biden. I don’t know. I don’t think she can do it.”
One of the biggest moments of Haley’s campaign was when she earned AFP’s official backing late last year. It was an endorsement that, among other benefits, opened up a national network of canvassers who would immediately start knocking on doors across the country in an effort to get Haley, then rising in the polls, over the hump.
And perhaps nowhere was this bolstered ground game more important than in New Hampshire, considered the most favorable early state to her candidacy — though still one where she trails Trump by double digits in statewide surveys. It’s a state with a large number of undeclared voters who have the choice of voting in either a Republican or Democratic primary — the kinds of voters who may be more open to Haley’s brand of conservatism over Trump’s “MAGA” politics.
On Friday, NBC News joined AFP Action as it knocked doors on Haley’s behalf north of Manchester to get a sense of what the organization was up against. Most voters who answered their doors had already made up their minds to vote for either Trump or Haley in Tuesday’s election. About a half dozen voters AFP Action reached at their doors said they either were already backing Haley or were open to supporting her, a little more than half of those who answered at their doorsteps.
“Not f------ Trump,” said Chris Kordas, a military veteran who said he would support Haley, when asked at his door about the election. “Not Trump. Anybody but Trump.”
Kordas ultimately said he didn’t care whether it was a Democrat or Republican who won the presidency this fall so long as it were “a good person.” Trump didn’t fit that bill.
“He lies and lies more and lies more,” he said. “He’s in and out of the courts all the time, and everybody thinks it’s not” because of his own actions.
Kordas said in his neighborhood, he has received a lot of pushback from neighbors for not supporting Trump, adding that one person said he was a “disgrace to the uniform” for criticizing the former president. Pointing at this race, he took note of Trump changing his tune about Haley’s effectiveness, criticizing her now after earlier praising her as his ambassador to the United Nations.
“He said Nikki Haley does a great job,” he said. “Now look what he says about her. He trusted her.”
As she campaigns across New Hampshire, Haley seeks to convince the broader Republican electorate that she’s more than a choice for those who hold the former president in low esteem. Her backers at AFP Action sought to hammer that point home, too.
At a Friday-morning press conference, Greg Moore, regional director for AFP Action, said his organization sees her pulling from both conservatives and moderates.
“Some of the narrative is that it’s all moderates for Haley and all conservatives for Trump. I know that’s not true,” he said.
Elaine Lanoie, a Manchester voter who is voting Republican on Tuesday, said when reached at her door Friday that she viewed Haley as a credible conservative. But, she said, she was still “100% for Trump.”
“Based on what he did when he was in office,” she said in explaining her Trump support. “I know he’s egotistical. I know he’s very, you know, doesn’t speak well. But he got the job done.”
AFP Action, as Moore laid out, has contacted more than 210,000 people in New Hampshire since the group’s post-Thanksgiving endorsement, fanning out 100 volunteers across the state to hit doors and make phone calls.
But as Haley’s allies began talking about how a strong second-place finish would amount to victory for her here, Moore said, “If Trump wins by 1 point, I don’t think that knocks Haley out by any stretch of the imagination.”
“It’s game on,” he said.
Door-knocking has taken center-stage in this Republican presidential primary, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ primary outside backers, the super PAC Never Back Down, putting it at the center of its multimillion-dollar strategy to help elect him. But for DeSantis, it hadn’t produced the intended results. After a second-place finish in Iowa — ahead of Haley — he dropped out of the race on Sunday and endorsed Trump.
Trump has had advantages over both when it comes to the ground game. Trump’s aim is merely to turn out as many existing Trump supporters as possible, while his rivals must not only seek to turn out voters, but to convince them to shift toward their candidate. As Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump’s campaign, told NBC News last month, “Our opponents are put in this awkward spot of trying to get people to actually go and change their vote and go in a different direction, which is a much heavier lift.”
Just how effective Republican canvassing efforts are continues to come under scrutiny, too. A wide-ranging NBC News investigation this year found some large-scale conservative canvassing efforts were plagued with issues that included fraudulent and untrustworthy data entries, though Republicans insist on the practice’s usefulness when properly executed.
Justin Wilson, the grassroots engagement director for AFP Action New Hampshire who took NBC News on the door-knocking tour Friday, said he’s been really encouraged by the conversations he’s been able to have with voters across the state. He feels that enough voters are buying into Haley’s message about the need to limit “chaos” and give the party its best chance to win in November. (In Iowa, NBC News entrance polling found that just 11% of Iowa’s Republican caucusgoers felt the ability to beat Biden was their top consideration when backing a candidate.)
“At the end of the day, it’s about trying to win,” he said. “And I would say that for a very long time, Republicans have leaned towards not wanting to win. … I don’t think now is a great time to try and make anything as contested as it can possibly be. We really need to go all in on a good, solid candidate. And I don’t think that that candidate is Donald Trump.”
With Trump dominating primary polls nationally and across early states, some Haley supporters have contemplated the choice they may have to make this fall: Trump or Biden.
“Not happy,” Joanne, a Haley supporter, said of how she’d feel about a prospective Trump-vs.-Biden rematch when reached at her door Friday. “I will not vote for Biden. So I would have to vote for Trump, which I’m not happy about either. But it’s going to be [a] Republican.”

Wes Moore’s budget plan includes funding for Baltimore’s fight against vacant houses, Harborplace renovation","Sam Janesch, Baltimore Sun","January 22, 2024 at 5:16 AM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/maryland-gov-wes-moore-budget-201600084.html,"When Gov. Wes Moore packed up and moved from his North Baltimore home to the governor’s mansion in Annapolis this time last year, he left with a promise to his adopted hometown.
The health of Maryland’s future was contingent on the success of its largest city, and — after eight years of Baltimoreans often feeling cast aside by his predecessor — he’d be investing heavily in everything from the city’s lagging public transportation system and under-resourced law enforcement to its vacant homes and struggling businesses.
The Democrat’s latest $63 billion state budget plan — the first his administration has crafted solely — would make strides in each of those areas while leaving some essential questions for future years up in the air, Baltimore-area lawmakers said this week.
Some of the highlights, they said, are $50 million to demolish or rehabilitate vacant structures, $4 million for a Department of Juvenile Services program that launched in Baltimore City and Baltimore County last year, $27 million for the Baltimore Regional Neighborhoods Initiative fund, $30 million toward remaking the Inner Harbor promenade and $5 million to plan for the demolition and repurposing of the State Center complex where state offices have been located but desperately needed repair for decades.
Almost all of those are increases or new funds compared to prior years, though the final budget is subject to change as members of the General Assembly tweak the plan in the coming months.
A planned boost to the city’s outsized share of highway user revenues, which go toward improving local and state roads, is also still on the agenda after local leaders pushed back on a proposed cut that was designed to help reduce $3.3 billion in future transportation spending that the state can’t afford.
“Gov. Moore is showing that he’s ready to invest and continue to build Baltimore’s renaissance,” Democratic Mayor Brandon Scott said in an interview. “There’s conversations to be had but if you look at the message they’re sending, they’re saying Baltimore is a priority.”
The unresolved conversations have focused so far on the transportation funds.
A 2022 state law scheduled to go into effect starting in the 2025 fiscal year will increase Baltimore’s share of the highway user revenue by tens of millions of dollars — potentially up to $100 million more than current funding by the 2026 budget year, according to projections. The city maintains all roads within its borders, unlike other local governments that rely on the state, so it collects most of the share going to local disbursement, which the new law would increase from 15.6% to roughly 18%.
Moore’s administration had proposed pausing that planned increase as a cost-saving measure, provoking fierce opposition from area lawmakers.
Within hours of Moore announcing Tuesday that he would backtrack — for next year’s budget but not beyond — Scott and Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski Jr. both sat before lawmakers in Annapolis saying that decision helps but is far from enough.
“One-time funding means that we’re back at square one again next year,” Olszewski, a Democrat, told members of the House Appropriations Committee.
Olszewski and others put the cuts in the context of the last time highway user revenues were slashed, in 2009 during the Great Recession. The prior levels never were recovered, which meant Baltimore County losing out on about $450 million and Baltimore City losing $900 million over the last 15 years, Olszewski and Scott said. The county’s lost revenue, Olszewski said, is about the same amount that a recent county analysis showed is needed to get all of its roadways “back to just average condition.”
“The truth is many of us need not only the restoration but could use additional support,” Olszewski said.
Scott said three times in six minutes of testimony that he “appreciated” the move and understands the governor’s budget constraints — which, beyond the transportation budget, include a $761 million structural deficit in the general fund and billions of dollars owed for other policies.
But, “to be very blunt,” he said, Baltimore shouldn’t carry the burden after years of under-investment under former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan.
He rattled off a list of city projects that are at risk if the cuts are maintained in future years: resurfacing 170 lane miles of roads, rehabilitating the Hanover Street Bridge, addressing a seven-year backlog of sidewalk repairs and planning for the Red Line, the east-west public transit project that Moore revived last year. The Red Line in particular had been a sore spot between Democratic officials in the city and Hogan, who scrapped what was a $2.9 billion light rail plan in 2015.
“The stakes couldn’t be more high,” Scott told lawmakers, who are looking for alternative revenue options for the state’s transportation system like potentially new registration fees for electric vehicles or increasing tolls.
In an interview later, Scott said he would continue to focus on the issue. He also praised Moore for the noticeable influx in state funds for other high-priority issues like housing, public safety and economic development.
The mayor announced a sweeping $3 billion plan last month to demolish or refurbish the city’s thousands of vacant properties. A mix of public and private financing included a $900 million request from the state over 15 years.
Moore’s new budget would include $50 million for that effort through Project C.O.R.E., or Creating Opportunities for Revitalization and Equity. That’s an increase from $20 million in the current 2024 budget and it “puts us well on our way to fulfilling the 50-year plan,” Scott said.
“It could certainly get us to that $900 million or perhaps even more,” said Scott, adding that there already are conversations about making that $50 million an annual investment.
Another step toward a long-term project is $30 million going toward the Inner Harbor promenade to boost the redevelopment of Harborplace. Lawmakers previously authorized that funding, along with $37.5 million in the current year’s budget, to begin the project. But developer P. David Bramble has also estimated $400 million in public money will be needed for the promenade, parks, infrastructure and proposed road changes, and officials have not outlined a plan to reach that figure.
Scott said he was thankful for the initial state investments but did not specify how much will be needed in future years. He said the state contributed to the original construction of Harborplace more than four decades ago and “our hope is for the same thing as we rebuild it.”
“The promenade is critical,” said Del. Mark Edelson, a Baltimore Democrat who represents the Inner Harbor.
Edelson and other members of the Baltimore delegation were pleased with additional areas of the governor’s budget that deal with improving services for juvenile offenders and incentivizing technology company investments in the region.
That includes $4 million to expand the Thrive Academy, a Department of Juvenile Services gun violence prevention program that is serving 190 young people in the city and Baltimore County during its first year. And it includes $6.4 million to support the city’s “tech hub” and compete for up to $70 million in federal funding, according to budget documents.
The tech funding includes $500,000 to establish a grant program named after Pava LaPere, a 26-year-old Baltimore entrepreneur who was killed in September. The program will provide $50,000 grants to local technology-focused startups.
Nearly doubling the state’s assistance for the Baltimore Regional Neighborhood Initiative, to $27 million, is among other economic development efforts reflected in the budget plan. The program is designed to aid local businesses and neighborhood development in the city as well as in Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties.
Sen. Mary Washington, a Democrat who represents parts of North Baltimore and Baltimore County, said the boost could help areas like the York Road corridor in her district, where state aid has remained static for years but revitalization costs only have increased.
“Across the city there are commercial corridors that need to be reactivated,” Washington said. “Neighborhoods are what make Baltimore what it is.”

K0U8A75UZ0_BF983IMKO0A957K,Soaring euthanasia deaths in Europe raise fears for legalisation in Britain,James Crisp,"January 21, 2024 at 1:04 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/soaring-euthanasia-deaths-europe-raise-160402090.html,"Euthanasia deaths in Europe and Canada have leapt by almost a quarter in just 12 months, raising fears that legalising assisted dying in the UK will become a slippery slope leading to more and more people choosing to die.
Once the taboo is broken, regulations are often later relaxed further to allow patients with mental health issues, autism, and even children, to choose to die, campaigners have warned.
The 23 per cent hike is part of a trend of rising popularity in the three countries since it was legalised, according to the Sunday Telegraph’s analysis of the latest available data.
Deaths doubled over the past five years in Canada, which legalised in 2016, Belgium, and the Netherlands, which both legalised in 2002.
24,927 people died by euthanasia in 2022 in Canada, Belgium and the Netherlands which is a 113 per cent increase from 2017 when 11,729 deaths were recorded.
The findings come amid calls in Britain to legalise assisted dying for terminally ill adults from politicians and celebrities such as Dame Esther Rantzen, who has revealed she has joined Dignitas.
Assisted dying involves giving patients the means to kill themselves, usually lethal drugs, while euthanasia is carried out by a doctor, usually by lethal injection.
In Canada, which legalised euthanasia in 2016, cases jumped by an astonishing 30 per cent last year and have more than quadrupled since 2017.
Some 13,241 people were killed by doctors in 2022, the equivalent of 4.1 per cent of all deaths in Canada for that year.
In 2021, the law was widened to include serious and chronic physical conditions, even if they were not life threatening, after being initially offered only to the terminally ill.
Chef Tracey Thompson, 55, applied to be euthanised after being left unemployed, and bedridden by long Covid in December last year.
The Netherlands was the first country to legalise euthanasia in 2002. Euthanasia is only legal under certain conditions, including having an incurable illness causing “unbearable” physical or mental suffering.
In April last year, the Dutch government announced it would widen its “right to die” laws to include terminally ill children between one and 12 years old.
But numbers rose by almost 14 per cent in 2022, equivalent to one in 20 deaths in the Netherlands.
Twenty-nine couples were killed together among the 8,720 people killed, usually by lethal injection.
115 people with severe psychiatric illness were helped to die. In recent years five people younger than 30 with autism were euthanised.
Belgian law dictates that a patient must experience unbearable suffering as the result of an incurable illness and make repeated and considered requests for euthanasia before it is granted.
2.5 per cent of deaths in Belgium last year involved euthanasia, with almost 3,000 people undergoing the deadly procedure, an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to 2021 and 28 per cent since 2017.
Among them was a 23-year-old woman who survived the 2016 terror attacks on Brussels who was euthanised after years suffering from PTSD and depression.
Shanti De Corte was 17 when Islamic State terrorists detonated bombs at Zaventem airport.
Although she escaped physically unharmed, she suffered from anxiety and panic attacks and twice tried to take her own life.
Colombia and Luxembourg have also had legal euthanasia for more than half a decade. 133 people died in the two countries, an increase of 12 per cent on 2021.
Euthanasia is also legal in Spain, where 180 people died in 2022 during the first year the law came into force. Portugal has legalised euthanasia, which is also now allowed in some Australian states, but the law has not yet entered into force.
In the United States, euthanasia is not legal but assisted dying, when patients are provided with the means, usually lethal drugs, to kill themselves, is in five states.
Assisted dying is also legal in Switzerland, home to the Dignitas clinic, which now has record numbers of British members, and New Zealand after a referendum in 2020.
Across Oregon, California and Washington, assisted suicides have increased by at least 57 per cent. In California, they more than doubled from 423 in 2018 to 853 in 2022.
“When it comes to euthanasia, the slippery slope is not hypothetical,” said Robert Clarke, who was lead counsel on the landmark Mortier case against Belgium’s euthanasia laws at the European Court of Human Rights, which ended with a ruling that they violated the right to life.
“We see two things happen in every jurisdiction that has gone down this road. The numbers go up almost every single year. And there is pressure to expand the qualifying conditions,” the director at legal advocacy organisation ADF International said.
Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO of Care Not Killing, said the “massive increase in the numbers of people who are being euthanised” should be “a warning to those pushing for a change in the law in the UK.”
Dignity in Dying campaigns for assisted dying in the UK, which would only be open to terminally ill adults with the mental capacity to make the choice and be alongside access to high quality end of life care.
Chief executive Sarah Wooten said it was expected that numbers would increase as more people became aware of assisted dying and more clinicians were trained.
“Even so, the percentage of overall deaths that are assisted in these countries remains low; under 1 per cent in many areas of the US and Australia,” she said.
Ms Wootton said “What we cannot lose sight of is the devastating reality of the UK’s own outdated laws.
“Every year thousands suffer as they die despite end of life care and hundreds of terminally ill people take their own lives, often alone, using violent methods.”
She added, “The next Government must allow a free vote and make time for assisted dying. Assisted dying is a movement whose time has come.”

K1F0QJ70UP_LT7M5CMTQ73629U,Port Talbot is a victim of net zero madness,Telegraph View,"January 22, 2024 at 7:00 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/port-talbot-victim-net-zero-220000061.html,"In a world of untrammelled free trade, we would import goods we need from countries where they can be made more cheaply without worrying about security of supply.
We are not in such a world. Domestic production of food, for instance, cannot be entirely proxied out even if we wanted to do so. The same can be said of steelmaking. It is a strategic industry without which we are left at the dubious mercy of events beyond our control.
In recent days, there have been warnings both from Nato and senior ministers that these times are more dangerous than any since the end of the Second World War. This is not the moment to risk what remains of our steel industry in pursuit of unrealistic carbon reduction targets.
The fate of the Port Talbot steelworks is the most egregious example of this short-sightedness. The owners Tata are to close two blast furnaces and build a new “green” electric arc furnace plant, which is said to be more environmentally friendly.
The decision means the loss of nearly 3,000 jobs in an area that is already deeply deprived. But to what end? The closure will reduce British carbon output by only 1.5 per cent. As steel will have to be imported from countries like China, global emissions might rise as a consequence.
Does anyone in a position to influence these decisions appreciate how completely insane they appear to voters, or care if they do? Steel manufacturing has become uncompetitive because of high electricity prices, which successive governments have declined to address. The industry has been paying between 60 and 80 per cent more than counterparts in France or Germany.
Even as the price of gas was falling in the years before the Ukraine war, British electricity prices doubled. We have closed our coal industry while China opened more pits to produce the steel we will need to import. The whole exercise is madness and, as reported at the weekend, predicated upon insufficient data about the feasibility of reaching net zero by 2050 before the target was enshrined in law five years ago.
Labour, which would normally seek to protect the jobs at Port Talbot, is compromised by its own commitment to net zero and is reduced to making airy-fairy policy promises aimed at accelerating the drive to net zero, boosting jobs and keeping down energy prices. This is a false prospectus, and one that the electorate appears increasingly unprepared to follow.

K2K1FSE1MT_X2OO1WASDUVAK4B,Danish royals attend church service to mark King Frederik's first visit outside the capital,Associated Press,"January 22, 2024 at 1:50 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/danish-royals-attend-church-mark-165022236.html,"AARHUS, Denmark (AP) — Denmark’s royal family on Sunday participated in a special “celebratory church service” at Aarhus Cathedral as the new King Frederik X, accompanied by wife Queen Mary and mother Queen Margrethe, waved to crowds gathered outside the 12th-century building that is the tallest church in the country.
The royal family drove 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) through Aarhus, Denmark’s second-largest city, from royal residence Marselisborg Castle to Aarhus Cathedral.
The church service came exactly a week after Frederik, 55, was proclaimed king after his 83-year-old mother Margrethe signed her abdication during a meeting with the government.
Aarhus resident Christina Elmstroem said she expects Frederik and Queen Mary to change the Danish monarchy “in their way.” She brought her children to experience the “big, major event.”
“So, it was an opportunity to go and see the new king and my kids are very excited about it,” she said.
Henrik Wigh-Poulsen, bishop of the Diocese of Aarhus, told The Associated Press they had just a few weeks to plan the service, and Frederik had a hand in planning it.
“Normally, you would spend three months planning this, but we (had) two and a half weeks, something like that. So we have been very busy, I tell you,” he said. “I chose some of the hymns we’re going to sing, and the king said, I would like to sing these hymns.”
The hour-long service marked Frederik’s first official visit as king outside the Danish capital Copenhagen.
Police expected around 70,000 people to line the royal route.
“I think he’s going to be a king of the people,” said Aarhus resident Charlotte Houman. “I think he’s gonna embrace the people ... he’s going to be different in is his way of ruling. I think he’s going to be not too much top down, but he’s gonna be embracing the people, different kinds of people. And also being there not on this high pedestal somewhere.”"

Haley's jabs were in response to the former president appearing to confuse her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a Friday rally in Concord, N.H. During the speech, Trump incorrectly said Haley was in charge of Capitol security during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.
""They're saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he's talking about Nancy Pelosi,"" Haley said. ""He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario. The concern I have is -- I'm not saying anything derogatory -- but when you're dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can't have someone else that we question whether they're mentally fit to do this. We can't.""
Neither Haley nor Pelosi would have been in charge of Capitol security, but Trump regardless accused Haley of turning down 10,000 soldiers to protect the Capitol.
""By the way, they never report the crowd on January 6,"" Trump told supporters. ""You know, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley, Nikki Haley ... did you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it? All of it, because of lots of things, like Nikki Haley is in charge of security, we offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, national guards, whatever they want. They turned it down.""
Haley, 52, has called for term limits and mental competency tests for politicians over 75. The former South Carolina governor has criticized both Trump and President Joe Biden's mental fitness and argued Americans shouldn't ""leave our kids two presidential candidates who are in their 80s.""
She doubled down on her condemnations in Keene Saturday, telling voters ""Congress is now the most privileged nursing home in the country."""

Tuesday morning: Manhattan, New York, on trial for defaming a woman he sexually abused. Tuesday night: Atkinson, New Hampshire, campaigning for the US presidency. Wednesday morning: court in New York again.
Donald Trump, the former US president and frontrunner for the Republican nomination in 2024, has intertwined his political and legal calendars until they are all but indistinguishable. At rambunctious campaign rallies, he plays the victim and rails against a biased justice system. In sombre courtrooms, he creates a spectacle that guarantees airtime and fundraising to fuel his run for the White House.

The jarring juxtaposition seems to be working.
Trump’s 91 criminal charges across four cases did not stop him winning 98 out of 99 counties in Monday’s frigid Iowa caucuses, and interviews with his support base showed they accept his narrative of politically motivated prosecutions. He is leading opinion polls in New Hampshire and looks poised to become the Republican standard bearer.
“The court appearances are his campaign,” Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. “He’s spending much less time than the other candidates in the key states. He’s not spending as much on TV advertising. He’s doing all kinds of things that candidates for president usually don’t do because he’s got an ace card that none of the others have.
“This has convinced not just his supporters but in a broad-based way the whole Republican party that he’s being oppressed, that Joe Biden is using the judicial system to try and put a stake in the heart of his toughest challenger for November. And they buy it.”
Trump’s recent court appearances have been voluntary, not obligatory, at a time when his Republican rivals are crisscrossing states in search of votes. Last week the 77-year-old former reality TV star showed up for a hearing in Washington DC to hear his lawyers argue that he is immune from criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election. A day later he was in Des Moines, Iowa, for a Fox News town hall.
The duelling schedule evidently did him no harm in Iowa, where he romped to victory over the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, by nearly 30 percentage points, more than twice the biggest winning margin ever achieved by a Republican. During his speech in Des Moines, Trump nodded to his legal tribulations: “I go to a lot of courthouses because of Biden, because they’re using that for election interference.”
The following morning, he was in a Manhattan federal court – again by choice – to watch the selection of a jury that will decide whether he should pay damages for defamatory comments he made in office about the writer E Jean Carroll. Last year a jury concluded that Trump sexually abused her in a department store in 1996 and defamed her in 2022.
That evening he headed to Atkinson, New Hampshire, for a campaign rally where he boasted about his win in Iowa but told supporters: “If I didn’t get indicted all these times and if they didn’t unfairly go after me, I would have won, but it would have been much closer. I tell you, I don’t know if I would have made the trade. I might have just liked the position we’re in right now.”
Come Wednesday, it was back to New York and the Carroll case. This time Trump was animated, shaking his head at testimony he disliked, passing notes to his lawyers and speaking to them while jurors were in the room.
He was scolded by Judge Lewis Kaplan after a lawyer for Carroll complained that he was grumbling about the case so loudly that jurors could hear him. When the judge threatened to expel him, Trump retorted: “I would love it.” The judge admonished: “I know you would. You just can’t control yourself in this circumstance, apparently.”
Outside the courtroom, the Republican frontrunner then held a press conference, describing the trial as “rigged” and Carroll as “a person I never knew”. He complained that Kaplan, a Bill Clinton appointee, was “a nasty judge” and a “Trump-hating guy” who was “obviously not impartial”.
Somehow he had made the case about himself rather than his victim. Maggie Haberman, author of Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America, told CNN: “He showed up for her testimony and so instead of us talking about her testimony we are talking about the fact that he was making noises, he was overheard whispering to his lawyer.”
She added: “He would have liked to have gotten thrown out because he would then claim he was a victim. It’s heads he wins, tails the other side loses.”
Trump was not in court on Thursday so he could attend his mother-in-law’s funeral in Florida. He will soon head back to New Hampshire to hold rallies ahead of Tuesday’s primary election, where he could in effect seal the Republican nomination. As endorsements from senior Republicans pour in, it seems that the party has made a collective decision to carry the legal baggage of a man who now openly brags that he has been indicted more often than Al Capone.
Charlie Sykes, editor of the Bulwark website and a former conservative radio host, said: “He’s going to have a courtroom campaign because Donald Trump relishes the idea of being the martyr. He thinks that being associated with these trials will actually help him in the polls and so far he’s not wrong. Every time he’s been indicted, he’s gone up.”
But Sykes believes that Trump’s decision to attend the trial involving E Jean Carroll could be a mistake as he pivots to general election voters. “How many Americans actually know about this case? There’s been such a firehose of indictments, hearings, charges. Now Donald Trump himself has decided that he is going to draw attention to a case that he’s already lost, that has found him liable for sexual assault.
“It’s hard for me to imagine any swing voters in the suburbs of Philadelphia or Milwaukee hearing for the first time about this case and thinking, yeah, this is the guy that I want to support for president.”
Anna Greenberg, a senior partner at polling firm GQR, also sees limitations in Trump’s gameplan. She said: “He saw that when he got indicted he got a major boost, and you saw it in the primary polls, and so he may be thinking if I engage with these trials against me and I rail and I attack, that’s going to continue to give me some kind of benefit.
“I think he already got the benefit. I don’t think there’s any additive benefit for him but I think there’s a real downside for him, which is that’s how he’s spending his time and not out on the campaign trail and doing the campaigning.”
Trump has pleaded not guilty in four state and federal criminal cases, including two claiming he tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. This week his lawyers filed paperwork in another case – over his allegedly illegal retention of sensitive classified documents – arguing that intelligence agencies were politically biased against Trump.
Some observers fear that the scorched earth approach poses a far-reaching danger to civil society and American legal and political structures. Sykes, author of How the Right Lost Its Mind, added: “Donald Trump is waging a concerted campaign to de-legitimize the justice system in America.
“He is trying to discredit not just prosecutors, but also judges and juries and the entire process of legal accountability and the damage is going to be long lasting and it’s going to be profound.”"
K7Q06G4DIM_AJSHOR0E3SIHT95,Chimney Cake: A Barbecued Street Food With A Transylvanian Past,Maria Scinto,22 January 2024 at 7:15 am·6-min read,20240121,yahoo.com,https://uk.style.yahoo.com/chimney-cake-barbecued-street-food-221500676.html,"Chimney cake may not sound too appetizing, but the name doesn't refer to its being charred and soot-blackened, but rather to its tall, cylindrical shape. The chimney cake, or Kürtőskalács, is Hungary's take on the type of European pastry known as a spit cake — again with the off-putting monikers, we know. The spit, or, if you prefer, spindle, involved in the cooking is a horizontal rotisserie, and some of the more elaborate versions of these cakes include Poland's infamously difficult sękacz, Lithuania's similar sakotis, and Germany's multi-layered baumkuchen (""tree cake"").
Hungary's chimney cakes originated in Transylvania — which is today part of Romania — and aren't quite as complex as some of the above cakes, as these require constant attention from a baker who ladles batter over the cakes as they rotate. Kürtőskalács, however, is made from a strip of yeast dough that is wrapped around a spindle and baked.

If we trace the history of chimney cake back as far as we can, the earliest known mention of such a dish is in a 15th-century German manuscript. The first recipe, however, wasn't published for another 300 years or so, as it appears in a 1784 cookbook attributed to Countess Mária Mikes of Zabola, which is located in Transylvania. At the time, the region was part of Hungary, but after some back-and-forthing subsequent to the First World War, Transylvania (including Zabola) officially became part of Romania in 1947. Despite Transylvania's 20th-century split, it seems that Hungary got custody of the chimney cake in the divorce proceedings.
The original version of kürtőskalács, or ""kürtős kaláts' à la Mrs. Poráni,"" seems to have been a savory one because the recipe makes no mention of sugar. A different recipe that came out some 11 years later did offer the option of sweetening the cake after it was cooked, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that anyone suggested adding sugar before baking. As for the crushed nuts that are a typical kürtőskalács coating today, these date back only as far as a 1980 cookbook called ""Erdélyi Lakoma"" authored by Pál Kövi (later republished in 1985 as ""Paul Kovi's Transylvanian Cuisine."" This Hungarian-born restaurateur not only left his stamp on chimney cakes but also helmed New York's Four Seasons restaurant for over 20 years.
The actual chimney cake itself is nothing too fancy, at least if the ingredients are anything to go by. The dough is made from what appears to be a pretty standard array of cake ingredients. Butter, eggs, flour, milk, salt, sugar — yep, all of the usual suspects are present, although most recipes typically don't call for any spices, seasonings, or flavoring extracts like vanilla or almond. What sets the kürtőskalács dough apart from most cake batters is the inclusion of yeast, so the texture and flavor are more akin to that of sweet bread, while some people have compared it to babka.
Most of the flavor in a chimney cake comes from the coating. This may be plain sugar, which was the case with most chimney cakes baked in the 19th and early 20th centuries, although these days the sugar is often mixed with cinnamon, cocoa powder, or crushed walnuts. When the sugar melts, it provides the kürtőskalács with a caramel taste and crispy coating, while any mix-ins will, of course, lend their influence, as well.
What makes the chimney cake so special — not to mention, gives it its name — isn't what goes into it, but how it's cooked. As the title implies, one of the methods of cooking the cake is over an open flame, although this is something you may be more likely to see at a Christmas market or other outdoor festival, and then, too, only if you should happen to be traveling in Hungary at the time. Commercial kürtőskalács bakers, though, also have the indoor option of using a special rotisserie grill that bakes multiple cakes at a time on rotating spits.
Home cooks, too, have multiple options for baking kürtőskalács. While you could use a purpose-built mold made of metal or wood, you can also DIY such an implement by wrapping foil around a rolling pin or pint-sized aluminum can. Another even simpler, option involves rolling the dough strips up into spirals without using any kind of mold at all. These cakes are then baked standing on end in a standard oven, with no need to rotate them as the upright position should ensure even cooking.
Even though using crushed walnuts as a kürtőskalács coating didn't really kick off until the 1980s, these days they are considered to be fairly traditional, along with cinnamon sugar and cocoa powder. This leaves lots of room for bakeries to experiment with other, less-traditional toppings, though, including chocolate chips, coconut, poppy seeds, pistachios, almonds, hazelnuts, and colored sprinkles. Yet another way restaurants will change up a chimney cake is by using it as an extra-tall ice cream cone or filling it with whipped cream, Nutella, or fruit.
Savory kürtőskalács is also a thing, at least in Hungary where you may be able to find them stuffed with meatballs or even the tomato-pepper stew called lecsó. Homemade chimney cakes could also be made into a main dish by omitting the sugar from the dough and filling the bread-like cones with sausage, pulled pork, shredded chicken, or chili. You could also do breakfast kürtőskalács, too. One eatery in Australia is already offering eggs Benedict in a chimney cake, while chimney cake omelets, quiches, and huevos rancheros could all be pretty tasty, as well.
While one of the most enjoyable ways to experience kürtőskalács may be to travel to Budapest during the holiday season and buy one fresh off a street vendor's grill, Hungary's capital city also has a number of bakeries and restaurants specializing in this cake. Among these are Vitéz Kürtős, a bakery that sells not only chimney cakes but also kürtőskalács layer cakes and fondues; Kató Néni's, where some chimney cakes come in rainbow colors; and Hoppácska, where each week brings three new savory kürtőskalács that might include such options as a bacon cheeseburger served in a chimney cone.
Outside of Hungary, a mini-chain called Merika Café brings its array of chimney cakes to outposts in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Australia. If you're looking to try kürtőskalács without leaving the U.S., however, you can also find them at Kürtős Cakes in Sarasota, Florida, or Chimney Cake Island in Chicago (the latter appears to be a home baker with no outlet open to the public, so you may need to order via email or Facebook and then pick the cake up at their home). It does not look as if chimney cakes can be ordered online for nationwide delivery, although Amazon sells the similar baumkuchen in a box and a non-edible but adorable kürtőskalács plushie was being offered on Etsy last we checked.

Responding officers arrived just after 2 a.m. local time at an “active” and “chaotic” scene in Katy, a city located just west of Houston, in Harris County. Two people were found dead at the property, and another died at the hospital, Gonzalez said.
“We believe this was a small gathering that turned deadly,” Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said at an early morning news conference.
Investigators aren’t sure whether the suspected shooter or shooters were already inside the house, or if someone came uninvited to the house and began opening fire, Gonzalez said. There is also evidence of shots being fired outside the house along the street, he added.
Police are working to investigate the shooting and identify suspects and determine if other people were injured, Gonzalez said.

NATO said on Thursday it was launching its largest exercise since the Cold War involving some 90,000 troops, rehearsing how U.S. troops could reinforce European allies in countries bordering Russia and on the alliance's eastern flank if a conflict were to flare up with a ""near-peer"" adversary.
""These exercises are another element of the hybrid war unleashed by the West against Russia,"" Grushko told RIA.
""An exercise of this scale ... marks the final and irrevocable return of NATO to the Cold War schemes, when the military planning process, resources and infrastructure are being prepared for confrontation with Russia.""
NATO did not mention Russia by name in its announcement. But its top strategic document identifies Russia as the most significant and direct threat to NATO members' security.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 in what Kyiv and its Western allies have said was an unprovoked imperialistic land grab.
Moscow, and its chief diplomat Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, have since often accused ""the collective West"" of conducting a ""hybrid war"" against Russia by backing Ukraine through financial and military aid.

JD Vance (R-Ohio) made the case Sunday that former President Trump is a more electable candidate than former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, citing the former president’s resiliency after years of media criticism and controversy.
In an interview on “Fox News Sunday,” the Trump campaign surrogate was asked to respond to concerns from voters who say Trump brings “chaos” — an argument Haley makes frequently on the campaign trail.
“My response to that voter would be, Nikki does have baggage. She just hasn’t faced the onslaught of years of media attacks, of super PAC attacks that Donald Trump has faced,” Vance told host Shannon Bream.
“And, frankly, the fact that Trump is still standing and is still leading in the polls against Joe Biden suggests he has real political resilience,” Vance said.
Vance continued making the argument that Haley has simply not faced the same barrage of attacks that Trump has, and he claimed she might not be prepared for what’s coming if she wins the party’s nomination.
“I know a lot of people who are choosing Nikki Haley think she’s the low-baggage candidate. In reality, she’s the candidate the Democrats haven’t teed off on, but they will tee off on her if she’s the nominee,” he said. “She won’t be [the nominee], but if she is, she will face exactly what Donald Trump has faced for the past six years.”
“And I don’t think she’ll survive, and I certainly don’t think she’ll win the presidency through it. That’s why we need to elect the guy who’s shown some resilience. That’s why we need to nominate Donald Trump,” Vance added.
On Tuesday, New Hampshire voters will head to the polls for the first primary election of the 2024 presidential cycle. According to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ’s New Hampshire primary polling average, Trump leads by 11.4 percentage points, with 46.7 percent support compared with Haley’s 35.3 percent support.
Nationally, the polling average puts Trump ahead by 50.7 percentage points, with 63.3 percent support, followed by Haley’s 12.6 percent and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’s 10.6 percent support.

The attack with ballistic missiles on the al-Asad base represents an escalation of the dozens of attacks mounted by the militants since Israel's invasion of Gaza. Until Saturday, most of the attacks have been relatively minor and involved drones and rockets in Iraq and Syria. Ballistic missiles can carry heavier explosive loads.
The Biden administration has sought to contain the fighting to Gaza but has increasingly been drawn into skirmishes with Iranian-backed militants across the Middle East. In Yemen, the Pentagon on Saturday mounted its sixth attack on Houthi militants to destroy what U.S. Central Command said was an anti-ship missile that was poised for launch into shipping lanes in the Red Sea.
Militants launched Saturday's attack on al-Asad with ""multiple ballistic missiles and rockets,"" according to a statement by U.S. Central Command. Most of the missiles were intercepted, while others struck the base.
Two U.S. troops sustained minor injuries in the attack, according to a Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The number of troops wounded will fluctuate as service members report symptoms in the coming days. The missiles did not cause serious damage to the base, used by U.S. and Iraqi troops to counter ISIS militants.
Iranian-backed militias have launched 130 attacks against U.S. and coalition troops in Iraq and Syria since October, according to the Pentagon.
In January 2020, Iranians fired 13 ballistic missiles at al-Asad and more than 100 troops had suffered traumatic brain injuries.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 10 Least Developed Countries in the World in 2024.
2023 presented us with contrasting narratives, including the persistent international strains and regional humanitarian crises, particularly the ongoing Israel-Palestine war. In terms of economic development, the year showed resilience and progress on many fronts. Now looking ahead, according to a report by the World Bank, global growth is expected to be 2.4% in 2024, compared to 2.6% in 2023. The decline in growth can be attributed to strict monetary policies, frail global trade, and feeble financial conditions. The short-term economic forecasts present varied prospects, with major economies witnessing slower growth. Whereas, emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) show signs of improvement.
In 2023, the global trade growth was the slowest in the past 50 years, apart from global recessions. This led to a contraction in the global goods trade. However, the services trade continued to recover from the repercussions of the pandemic. According to the World Bank, trade growth is anticipated to increase by 2.3% in 2024, indicating a recovery of demand for goods and trade. Recent conflicts have accelerated geopolitical risks around the world. The ongoing war in the Middle East has not hugely impacted commodity prices, however, it is expected to result in high energy prices, affecting global trade and leading to high inflation.
The report forecasts EMDEs to grow at a rate of 3.9% from 2024 to 2025. Among these countries, economic development in China is projected to significantly decrease this year, as a result of weak consumer sentiment and a continued slump in the property sector. Apart from China, EMDE growth is expected to increase from 3.2% in 2023 to 3.5% in 2024. It is anticipated to grow further to 3.8% in 2025. This progress indicates a rebound in trade and evolving domestic demand in many large economies.
Low-income countries (LICs) are projected to grow at a rate of 5.5% in 2024, compared to 3.5% in 2023. The LICs are expected to maintain the growth and grow at a rate of 5.6% in 2025. This growth recovery can be attributed to metal exporters, and countries hit by conflict in 2023 such as Sudan. Despite the notable growth prospects, many LICs will still encounter challenges such as increasing debt-service costs, slow debt restructuring, and political instability.
According to a report by the United Nations, global inflation is expected to decline to 3.9% in 2024, compared to an estimated 5.7% in 2023. In 2023, global inflation fell from the highest recorded inflation of 8.1%, in almost 30 years. The decline can be attributed to moderation in global commodity prices and a decline in demand amid restrictive monetary policies. Developed countries have witnessed a noticeable decline in inflation. However, core inflation rates are still relatively high, due to increasing service sector prices and restricted labor markets. In most of the developing countries, inflation peaked in 2023 and is expected to moderate in 2024.
Despite the decline in inflation rates, food prices increased in the third and fourth quarters of 2023, especially in regions including Africa, South Asia, and Western Asia, due to delayed price adjustments from global to local markets, sluggish local currencies, and climate disasters. High food prices lead to food insecurity in developing countries, affecting the poorest households the most. An estimated number of 238 million people endured acute food insecurity in 2023, an uptick of 21.6 million people from 2022.
The inflationary trend in developing countries has washed away the efforts made in poverty reduction, leaving millions of people vulnerable. Poverty rates remained higher than pre-pandemic levels in many low-income countries, especially in Africa and Western Asia. A large chunk of the population in the least developed countries is poor and suffers from extreme food insecurity.
Due to poverty and the prevalence of inequality in the world, these countries lack opportunities to progress on the global front. According to another report by the United Nations, 14% of the world's population faces considerable challenges to economic development and growth. This not only limits their access to necessities but also hinders them from availing opportunities that could improve their economic situation. This results in countries falling into high debts and economic crises, which further aggravates due to the untenable debt burdens imposed by the global financial system. Apart from economic factors, issues such as poor governance, unequal distribution of resources, health crises, absence of proper infrastructure, and restrictive labor markets are some of the root causes leading to decreased development in these countries.
The road to economic prosperity bears plenty of risks, such as inflation, poverty, and political instability, for least developed countries. However, for investors with a risk appetite, the ETFs in these countries can offer appealing diversification opportunities. These ETFs can be used by investors to hedge against currency fluctuations and associated risks with international markets.

Now, let's have a look at the 50 least developed countries in the world in 2024.
50 Least Developed Countries in the World in 2024
Methodology
For our list of the 50 least developed countries in the world in 2024, we have defined a least developed country as one with lower HDI and GDP per Capita. HDI comprehensively captures various aspects of a country's human development such as life expectancy, education, and gross national income. The GDP per capita of a country is indicative of its infrastructure, resource distribution, and living standard. We have utilized these two metrics to compile our list, as they provide us with a comprehensive insight into a country's development.
Firstly, we sorted the countries based on HDI and collated a list of 100 countries, reporting the lowest HDI. Then, we sourced GDP per capita data for these countries. We then, assigned ranks to both GDP per Capita and HDI for each country from lowest to highest, 1 being least developed and 100 representing most developed. Then, we averaged their ranks to generate an 'Insider Monkey Score'. Countries with a lower score rank higher on our list and vice versa. The list is in descending order of the Insider Monkey scores of countries.

KH5EQPEXJP_SKTNQI5608CY79W,Why 2024 is the year of the tourist tax,Sophie Dickinson,"January 22, 2024 at 6:30 a.m.·8 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/why-2024-tourist-tax-213000088.html,"“Overtourism” is something of a buzzword already this year. We were beckoned back to seaside resorts and old favourites in the aftermath of the pandemic, before being assailed with stories of crowded restaurants and attractions. In Amsterdam, a new directive asked hedonistic Britons to stay away. In places like Athens, anti-tourist graffiti campaigns are being waged by locals, with the aim of letting visitors know they are unwelcome.
For other countries, tourist taxes are being implemented in response. Typically only small amounts of money, the fees are usually added onto hotel bills or payable at the airport. Here are the countries introducing a tourist tax in 2024.
Greece has introduced a new “climate crisis resilience fee” for tourists this year, replacing the previous hotel tax. According to the Greek government, charges will range from €1.50 (£1.30) to €10 (£8.60), depending on accommodation, quality and the time of year. In the low season, the fee is capped at €4 (£3.45).
It comes after a year of record rainfall and heatwaves, which destroyed over 1,500 square kilometres of land and led to 37 deaths.
A tourist tax has long been proposed as a solution to Venice’s overcrowding problem. This year, its entry fee system is finally being implemented. A trial will launch between April and mid-July, where on certain days – mostly weekends – visitors will have to pay €5 (£4.30) to access the city. This only applies from 8:30am to 4pm, meaning that those visiting the city in the evening will be exempt. Those staying overnight will also bypass the charge.
Few expect visitor numbers to go down. Instead, proceeds from the fee will be earmarked for maintenance projects in the city, plus “the quality of the tourist offer (services, events, museums etc.)”.
Visitors to Barcelona have had to pay both a city-wide and regional tax since 2012. Last year, the municipal fee increased to €2.75 (£2.37); from April 1 this year, this will rise to €3.25 (£2.80).
Tourists pay the fee as part of their accommodation bill. Again, the proceeds are used to fund city infrastructure like bus routes and roadworks.
Another Spanish tourist tax, this time in Valencia. Again, it will apply to visitors staying in official accommodation, including campsites, hotels and self-catering properties. The style of accommodation will impact the amount paid, which varies from 50 cents (43 pence) to €2 (£1.72).
It isn’t clear when the tax, known as the Valencian Tax on Tourist Stays (IVET), will come fully into force – officials have been trailing its implementation since late 2022. Once it is introduced, however, the proceeds will be used to provide more affordable housing for locals living in tourist areas.
The Indonesian province has been popular with backpackers for decades, and now the region is introducing a fee to “protect culture and nature”.
From Feb 14 2024, visitors will have to pay a fee of around IDR 150,000, or just over £7.50. It won’t make a radical difference to the overall cost of a holiday, but it is one of the steeper tourist taxes.
The tax is payable at the airport or via the Love Bali app, a process that will apparently take less than a minute.
Tourists have long been charged a taxe de séjour in France, with the price varying between cities. In anticipation of the Paris Olympics, however, fees will be increasing by around 200 per cent in the French capital.
Depending on the type of accommodation, visitors staying in hotel rooms in Paris can expect to pay a fee ranging from 75 cents (65 pence) to €15 (£12.90) per night. This is in addition to reported increases in the price of metro fares, museum tickets and hotel room rates.
The Netherlands has a well-established tourist tax policy, and Amsterdam has a well-established problem with certain types of tourist.
This year, the city’s toeristenbelasting, or tourist tax, will increase from 7 per cent of the cost of a hotel room to 12.5 per cent – applying to cruise passengers and overnight visitors alike. This makes it the highest of its kind in Europe.
Olhão, a Portuguese fishing town, has started charging a tourist tax of €2 (£1.72) a night between April and October. This is halved in the off-season and does not apply to children under the age of 16.
The charge is also capped at five nights, meaning a visitor can only be charged an additional €10 (£8.60) per trip.
During the pandemic, Iceland suspended its tourism taxes. They returned on Jan 1 2024, with hotels and guesthouses charging ISK 600 (£3.46), campsites ISK 300 (£1.73) and cruise ships stopping in Iceland’s ports ISK 1,000 (£5.76).
It comes after a remarkable year of inbound tourism in the country. There were nearly 800,000 international visitors last summer – up around a quarter from the same period in 2022, according to the Iceland Review. The European Travel Commission reports that both the number of nights stayed, and the number of arrivals, were higher last year than in 2019.
The tourism levy in Austria depends on the province a traveller is visiting. In Vienna, for example, it typically amounts to just over 3 per cent of an accommodation bill.
Tourist taxes vary between cities in Belgium, but they typically cost between €3 (£2.58) and €6 (£5.16).
Bhutan has been charging a significant sum of money to tourists since its opening in 1974. This fee currently sits at $200 (£157) per person, per day in the high season, with reductions in the low season.
Officials say the fees are used in part to maintain the country’s heritage and offset the carbon emissions of visitors.
Those staying in Bulgarian holiday resorts should expect a small additional fee, typically €2 (£1.72) per person.
People staying in the Hungarian capital are charged an additional 4 per cent fee, per night, to their hotel bill.
Taxes vary across Caribbean islands, with some charging upon departure, as an addition to the hotel bill, or both. Typically, tourist taxes average between 8 per cent (Grenada, St Lucia) and 15 per cent (Jamaica). Arrival and departure taxes also differ across the region, with the Bahamas charging $15 (£11.78), Jamaica charging $35 (£27.50) and Bermuda $50 (£39).
Visitors can expect to pay an additional 10 kuna (£1.10) per person per night.
Germany’s tourist taxes vary between cities. In Berlin, the amount equates to around 5 per cent of the total accommodation bill.
Taxes are set by individual municipalities in Italy. Generally, the amount varies from €2 (£1.72) to €5 (£3.90) per day, per person. Children, disabled travellers and their carers and patients admitted to health facilities are usually exempt.
Tourists visiting Japan pay a 1,000 yen (£5.40) departure tax to support the country’s infrastructure. As government officials worry about overcrowding in some of Japan’s largest cities, some prefectures have instigated additional taxes of their own (amounting to around 50 pence per visit).
In Malaysia, tourists are charged RM10 (or £1.70) per room, per night. In some regions, children and those travelling for medical reasons are exempt.
Most international visitors (excluding those from Australia) must pay a $35 (£17) levy to enter New Zealand. It “aims to address current challenges in the tourism and conservation systems”.
In Prague, the tourist tax typically costs around 50 Czech Koruna per night, or £1.74.
Like many tourist taxes, Slovenia’s varies between regions. Expect a higher rate – around €3 (£2.60) – in popular destinations like Ljubljana and Bled.
Depending on the region and accommodation quality, Switzerland’s tourist taxes are usually between CHF 2 (£1.84) to CHF 7 (£6.43) per person, per night.
In Abu Dhabi, hotels typically impose a tourism fee of 6 per cent on guests’ hotel bills, in addition to a fixed fee of AED 15 (£3.20) per room, per night. In Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah, the price varies on the quality of accommodation: fees range from AED 7 (£1.50) to AED 20 (£4.30) per night.
Tourist taxes are not federally legislated in the US; states and regions have the ability to charge varying fees. In San Francisco, for example, the hotel tax rate is 16.25 per cent, which includes a 14 per cent “transient occupancy tax” and a 2.25 per cent “tourism improvement” fee.

KI5JRAS74D_31F44WTXVPUDFGZ,Midwife who gave kids homeopathic pellets instead of vaccines fined $300K for falsifying records,Philip Marcelo,"January 21, 2024 at 9:10 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/midwife-gave-kids-homeopathic-pellets-001036196.html,"NEW YORK (AP) — A New York midwife who gave nearly 1,500 children homeopathic pellets instead of required vaccinations has been fined $300,000, the state’s health department announced this week.
Jeanette Breen, who operates Baldwin Midwifery on Long Island, administered the pellets as an alternative to vaccinations and then falsified their immunization records, the agency said Wednesday.
Missing 85-year-old man found dead in lake in Palm Harbor: PCSO
The scheme, which goes back least to the 2019-2020 school year, involved families throughout the state, but the majority reside on suburban Long Island. In 2019, New York ended a religious exemption to vaccine requirements for schoolchildren.
The health department said immunization records of the children who received the falsified records have been voided, and their families must now prove the students are up-to-date with their required shots or at least in the process of getting them before they can return to school.
“Misrepresenting or falsifying vaccine records puts lives in jeopardy and undermines the system that exists to protect public health,” State Health Commissioner James McDonald said in a statement.
Breen, a state-licensed healthcare provider, supplied patients with the “Real Immunity Homeoprophylaxis Program,” a series of oral pellets that are marketed as an alternative to vaccination but are not recognized or approved by state or federal regulators as valid immunizations, according to the health department.
She administered 12,449 of the fake immunizations to roughly 1,500 school-aged patients before submitting information to the state’s immunization database claiming the children had received their required vaccinations against measles, mumps, rubella, polio, chickenpox, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and a host of other diseases, the department said.
FBI raids multiple locations in Pasco County
Breen’s lawyer said Thursday that his client cooperated with investigators, paid her fine and intends to comply with all other requirements of her agreement with health officials.
“Suffice it to say, Ms. Breen has provided excellent midwifery services for many years to many families, especially on Long Island. She is now toward the end of her career,” David Eskew wrote in an emailed statement. “From her perspective, this matter is over, done with, and closed and she is now moving on with her life.”
As part of the settlement, Breen has paid $150,000 of the $300,000 penalty, with the remainder suspended contingent upon her complying with state health laws and never again administering any immunization that must be reported to the state, according to the health department. She’s also permanently banned from accessing the state’s immunization records system.
Erin Clary, a health department spokesperson, said Thursday that while parents and legal guardians had sought out and paid Breen for her services, they weren’t the focus of the agency’s investigation.
State health officials say they’re now in the process of notifying hundreds of affected school districts.

Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., told a mother who lost her daughter to fentanyl that she was being ""used"" by Republicans during a House Homeland Security hearing on Thursday.
Goldman's remarks to Josephine Dunn, whose 26-year-old daughter Ashley lost her life to fentanyl-laced pills, came during the committee's hearing titled ""Voices for the Victims: The Heartbreaking Reality of the Mayorkas Border Crisis.""
Dunn had been invited by Republicans to take part in the hearing and share the story of how she lost her daughter to fentanyl as Congress continues on with the impeachment proceedings against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
Expressing his ""sincere condolences"" to Dunn for the loss of her daughter, Goldman said that he wanted to ""apologize in some ways"" to Dunn because she was ""being used as a fact witness for an impeachment investigation.""
BORDER PATROL SEIZED ENOUGH FENTANYL TO KILL ENTIRE US POPULATION THIS FISCAL YEAR
""Obviously, given what your experience has been, you don't have the background to understand what a high crime and misdemeanor is and how it relates to this,"" he added in his remarks to Dunn.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
Goldman's remarks drew the ire of Dunn, who told the Daily Caller News Foundation on Friday that the lawmaker is ""unaware about what my understanding, about what my education, what my experience is in any of those areas when it comes to misdemeanors or high crimes.""
""I have my opinions, and for him to assume that I want to just put more money into a system that has had plenty of money placed into it and is still broken is incorrect. Please don’t think for me. I have a brain, I can think and speak for myself,"" she told the outlet.
During the hearing, Dunn grew visibly frustrated with Goldman as he attempted to question her.
""You would agree, would you not, that it would help to stop the fentanyl trade and fentanyl trafficking from coming into this country if we had more law enforcement officers at the border and more resources and technology to stop the fentanyl from coming in?"" he asked Dunn. ""Do you agree with that?""
Dunn rejected Goldman's premise, saying ""Border Patrol is now being used to make sandwiches and to screen people and let them into our country. So I disagree with you.""
Moments later, Dunn added: ""I would like the border patrol to be able to do the job that they were hired to do. Every border patrol officer that I have spoken to has told me that their hands are tied by this administration and Mr. Mayorkas. I’ve been to the border, sir, have you?""
Goldman responded that he was the one asking the questions at the hearing.
TEEN DRUG OVERDOSES HIT RECORD HIGH, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY FENTANYL POISONING, SAYS NEW REPORT
Further highlighting the moment in a post to Facebook, Dunn wrote, ""Pardon me sir, but you know nothing of my experience, my background or my understanding. Also, in all of my research, you have yet to travel once to the Southern Border of the United States. Is that why you avoided my question?""
""Are you unable to return to your constituency and explain your lack of understanding of the border, lack of experience at the border or was it something else? I would think you could have heard what I actually said. Not what you wanted me to say,"" she added.
Last September, Border Patrol Chief Jason Owens announced that agents had seized over 2,700 lbs. of fentanyl as part of the more than 69,000 lbs of narcotics seized between ports of entry. The seizures also included 40,000 lbs. of marijuana, 13,000 lbs. of methamphetamine and 11,000 lbs. of cocaine.
That amount of fentanyl, which does not include the amount seized at ports of entry, is more than enough lethal doses to kill the entire population of the United States. While significantly more is caught at ports of entry – with over 22,000 lbs caught at the ports of entry at the southern border this fiscal year – the stat highlights the danger of fentanyl moving between the ports and potentially past overwhelmed agents in the field.
Opioids were involved in more than 100,000 overdose deaths in 2022. Fentanyl is the most prominent opioid, which is produced primarily in Mexico, using Chinese precursors, and then trafficked across the southern border. The drug is 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine and is often cut with other drugs, meaning that the user doesn’t know that they are ingesting fentanyl.
While opioid deaths have risen sharply in recent years, the Biden administration has pointed to data suggesting that overdose numbers are slowing and has tied that flattening to its drug strategy, which involves going after smugglers, increasing technology at ports of entry and providing additional funding for treatment and prevention within the U.S.
But the administration has faced criticism from Republicans over its handling of the fentanyl crisis, particularly at the southern border, which they say has exacerbated the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Some Republicans, including those on the 2024 trail, have called for military action in Mexico to take out drug labs run by the cartels.
Fox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report.

KJQ8OUXSF2_1PV98SH6BHPRETJ,Blaming Israel is an outrageous inversion of reality,Telegraph View,"January 21, 2024 at 3:00 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/blaming-israel-outrageous-inversion-reality-060000168.html,"As the Chief Rabbi writes in his Comment piece today, truth is often the first casualty in conflict. Sadly, when the world’s only Jewish state finds itself at war, Israel is too often also the first to be blamed. So it has proved in the current struggle between Israel and Hamas.
Now, in the latest topsy-turvy framing, Israel is being accused of standing in the way of Palestinian statehood.
Yet the indiscriminate savagery of October 7, which the Hamas leadership has vowed to repeat again and again, made clear what the terror group thinks about living alongside the region’s Jews. Its founding charter declares Palestine an “Islamic land”, rejects peace deals and says that Islam will obliterate Israel. Similarly, the Houthis in Yemen, currently celebrated by anti-war protesters for their attacks on Red Sea shipping, chant “Death to Israel!” – and mean it. Behind both groups stands the implacable anti-Semitism of the Islamic Republic of Iran, a state on the verge of nuclear capability which is dedicated to wiping both Israel and its inhabitants from the map.
Even the so-called peace marchers, who are eager to denounce Israel week after week, do so under banners reading “From the River to the Sea”, a call for Israel’s erasure.
A two-state solution remains the obvious and ultimate answer to the tragedy of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. Yet for more than seventy years, every offer to make a deal of this kind has been rejected by the Palestinians’ representatives. It is not Israel that is intransigent, but Palestinian elites and their misguided Western supporters. Even the PLO, seen by some as a more tractable partner than Hamas, was founded on an eliminationist agenda. It refuses to condemn Hamas’s massacre, and the Palestinian Authority continues to pay bonuses to the families of “martyrs”.
The recent breakthrough of the Abraham Accords, which saw a number of Arab states belatedly accepting Israel’s right to exist, brought fresh hope. October 7 sought to bury that hope, and was launched by fanatics who refuse to accept any terms short of Israel’s annihilation. It is the fault of Hamas, and their Iranian paymasters, that peaceful coexistence is now further off than ever.
The path to mutual peace cannot be reached without defeating Hamas. Blaming Israel is an outrageous inversion of reality.

The city’s Russian-backed mayor and regional governor said that Ukrainian artillery hit a busy marketplace in what the Russian government called a “barbaric act of terrorism.” Russia typically condemns Ukrainian attacks that kill civilians in the Donetsk region and other areas it has annexed. Its own air strikes, heavy shelling, and ground invasion of its neighbor have killed thousands of Ukrainians since February 2022. The international community widely views Russia’s actions as violations of international law, and the bloody conflict shows no signs of stopping on the eve of its two-year mark.

KMNV7XS3PC_ORO9FZB38TFRZJH,A patchwork anti-Trump crew is rallying around Nikki Haley,Kelly Garrity,"January 22, 2024 at 3:02 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/patchwork-anti-trump-crew-rallying-180209071.html,"When former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson threw his support behind Nikki Haley in the GOP presidential race, his message was as much an indictment of the former president as it was an endorsement of Haley ahead of New Hampshire’s Tuesday primary.
“Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years. Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so. Go @NikkiHaley in New Hampshire,” Hutchinson wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Saturday afternoon.
Haley’s well-timed bump in the polls in the Granite State — bolstered by a timely endorsement from the state’s popular GOP governor, Chris Sununu — has elevated the first-in-the-nation primary as the event to watch this election season. It’s also drawn Haley, a former governor of South Carolina and former Trump administration official, the backing of several of the loudest anti-Trump voices still left in the Republican Party.
Around the same time Hutchinson called on New Hampshire voters to support Haley, GOP Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont did the same: “After years of controversy, violent rhetoric and growing polarization, the very last thing we need is four more years of Donald Trump,” Scott said in a statement, calling Haley “our only chance to ensure America has the choice it deserves in November.”
Just over a week earlier, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who’s been eyed as a possible third-party candidate, backed Haley ahead of Iowa’s caucuses, calling her “the strongest chance” for Republicans to put forward the best possible candidate in the general election.
And the most-prominent New Hampshire newspaper, the Union Leader, joined the chorus this weekend, endorsing Haley, touting both her character and her experience. Despite its conservative bent, the paper backed Joe Biden in the 2020 general election, defying its long history of supporting conservatives in the general election.
“If you can select a Republican ballot on Tuesday,” the editorial said, “we urge you to select Nikki Haley as your next president. New Hampshire is ready for a change. America is ready for a change. The world is ready for a change. We want a better option than we have had for the past eight years, and Nikki Haley is that option.”
The slate of late-breaking endorsements would normally be a boon for a candidate hoping to sway voters in the waning days of a campaign. But for Haley, it also brings risk.
The former U.N. ambassador has, like most of the GOP candidates, painstakingly avoided going after Trump head on. Only recently did she ramp up her criticism of the former president, and rule out the possibility that she would accept a job as Trump’s vice president.
While anti-Trump messaging may charm New Hampshire’s more moderate electorate — which includes a significant number of independent voters — it’s unlikely to appeal to the conservatives in other early voting states. And in recent campaign stops in New Hampshire, Trump has attempted to play up Haley’s independent support, claiming that liberals are attempting to ""infiltrate the Republican primary,” in New Hampshire.
Haley is also still missing the support of two of the most nationally recognizable Trump detractors: former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
Christie’s exit from the race earlier this month was poised to be a win for Haley, as polls indicated that likely Christie voters eyed Haley as a possible second choice in the race. But Christie, whose campaign hinged on taking on Trump, slammed Haley on his way out the door.
“She’s gonna get smoked,” Christie was caught saying of Haley — although he did not reference her by name. “And you and I both know it. She’s not up to this.”
Haley is still trailing Trump by double digits in recent polls of Granite State voters, her surge appearing to slow. Even Sununu, her top surrogate in the state, has tempered expectations for her on Tuesday.
""She doesn't have to win. I mean, look, nobody goes from single digits in December to 'you absolutely have to win' in January,"" he said Sunday during an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
Trump, meanwhile, has scooped up the support of three of the other also-rans: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Vivek Ramaswamy and most recently (and most stingingly) Sen. Tim Scott, Haley’s fellow South Carolinian, as well as two of his 2016 primary foes, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.
“It comes right down to, what does America need for the next president?” Scott said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
“The only conclusion,” he added later, “is Donald Trump.”"
KREJJSDQXU_VCLNLVEKZXIYDAP,"Chevron Stock: Buy, Sell, or Hold?","Reuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool","January 21, 2024 at 11:40 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-stock-buy-sell-hold-144000574.html,"Chevron (NYSE: CVX) is one of the largest energy companies on the planet, sporting a massive $270 billion market cap. It competes with integrated majors like ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), Shell (NYSE: SHEL), BP (NYSE: BP), and TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE).
Is there a reason why investors would want to own Chevron stock rather than its peers? The answer is a very clear ""yes."" Here's what you need to know.
Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and TotalEnergies all use the same basic business model. They produce oil and natural gas, transport it, process it, and sell it. This means their businesses span from the upstream (drilling) through the midstream (pipelines) and all the way to the downstream (chemical and refining). The key to this approach is that different segments of the energy sector perform differently at different times, which helps to soften the industry's natural peaks and valleys. For example, downstream businesses can benefit from low oil prices, which are a cost center for this segment of the industry.
Things tend to diverge a little from this point, however, which might help to give Chevron a leg up on its peers. But in the end, it is likely to be the nuances that matter most.
One of the first things that dividend investors are likely to note about Chevron is its dividend yield, which is around 4.2%. That's not the highest on offer in the peer group, with BP and TotalEnergies both offering larger income streams. But there's a little twist here that's important.
TotalEnergies, which has the highest yield of the group, is based out of France, and investors have to pay foreign taxes on its dividends. Those taxes can be claimed back come April 15, but it complicates your tax preparation, and there's a cap on the total amount you can claim. So TotalEnergies, despite a higher yield, isn't necessarily a better choice.
There's also another notable issue to consider. Chevron has increased its dividend for 36 consecutive years. That's second only to ExxonMobil's 41 years in the peer group. In fact, BP and Shell both cut their dividends during the coronavirus pandemic as they announced plans to increase their investments in clean energy (TotalEnergies made that same commitment without a dividend cut). So investors that favor stocks with growing dividends will probably prefer Chevron over its European peers. Notably, despite having a higher yield, BP's cut will probably take it out of the running for many dividend investors.
But Chevron also has a slight leg up on ExxonMobil as well. While it wouldn't be a mistake to buy ExxonMobil by any stretch of the imagination, Chevron's debt-to-equity ratio of 0.12 times is better than Exxon's 0.2 times. So for ultra-conservative dividend investors, Chevron might win the day -- it has more room to take on debt to support its business and dividend when there's another energy downturn.
So there are plenty of reasons to like Chevron, but there is at least one notable reason to dislike it -- the global shift toward cleaner energy options, like solar and wind power. Although this transition is likely to take decades, Chevron and ExxonMobil have both chosen to stick to their oil and natural gas strengths, if you will. They aren't exactly shoving their heads in the sand, but they also aren't moving aggressively to transition with the world. BP, Shell, and TotalEnergies have all been more proactive.
Yes, that resulted in dividend cuts at BP and Shell, and both of these companies have effectively walked back their plans to some degree, but if you think the future is going to get green quickly, then Chevron is probably not going to be the right stock for you. TotalEnergies, which didn't cut its dividend and hasn't walked back its clean energy plans, would probably be a better choice.
If you own Chevron, there's really no reason why you should sell it to buy another integrated energy major unless you feel strongly about the environmental issue. In fact, demand for carbon fuels is expected to remain strong through at least 2050, according to both the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), two of the most important industry watchers. And within that period, the use of coal is expected to decline, with oil and natural gas demand individually either holding steady or growing. So there's decades of energy demand ahead for Chevron to service and, at least at this point, no particular reason to worry about Chevron's future.
When you add it all up, Chevron is more likely to be a buy for most investors looking at the integrated energy space than a sell (and if you own it there's no immediate reason you would want to dump it). There are nuances, of course, which may push you toward one stock or another, but if you want a reliable dividend stock Chevron is a great starting point.

Romania's Alliance for Agriculture, which represents several farmers' organizations, sent a letter to Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, and Agriculture Minister Florin Barbu, demanding a European Union decision be made that would safeguard Romanian farmers from the alleged market impacts of an influx of agricultural imports from Ukraine to the European market.
Since the beginning of Russia's attacks on Ukraine's main agriculture port of Odesa, Ukraine has been forced to export large volumes of grain through the EU.As a result, grain imports in countries adjacent to Ukraine soared, distorting local markets and causing local farmers' grain to fall in price, which led to outcries and restrictions on both national and EU scales.
Protesting Polish and Romanian farmers and truckers have been at the centre of blockades at Ukrainian border crossings for months, protesting the economic impacts of a free trade agreement that have sparked worries about uneven competition and risks to domestic production.
The farmers' alliance demands that Ukrainian import limits be set based on the 2021-2022 annual or quarterly averages. The farmers are also proposing the creation of a tracking system that would determine the destination of Ukrainian agricultural products before their entry into the EU.
""Otherwise, all three of you (the president, the prime minister, and the minister of agriculture) should assume and bear the consequences of the intensification of the protests in Romania and in the other member states, which will grow much faster than anyone expects and that the next step is for the disgruntled farmers from most of the EU member states to move and block the activity in Brussels,"" the letter read.
The upcoming Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting is set for Jan. 23 where the Council will hold deliberations on the ""strategic dialogue on the future of agriculture in Europe.""
Earlier on Jan. 5, European Commissioner for Agriculture, Janusz Wojciechowski said he wants new restrictions on Ukrainian agricultural imports as the Commission mulls the extension of the free trade regime with Ukraine until 2025.

The centenary of the Bolshevik revolutionary's passing has largely been ignored by ordinary Russians, but Lenin continues to be venerated by those nostalgic for the USSR.
""I came here to honour the memory of Vladimir Lenin -- our leader, the founder of the Soviet state,"" said 47-year-old Yulia, one of many admirers who gathered outside Lenin's mausoleum in freezing temperatures.
""His ideas lit the way for many revolutionaries, fighters for the bright future of the people, for justice,"" she told AFP.
Attendees could be seen carrying portraits of the late leader and waving flags of the Russian Communist Party -- one of the few political parties allowed to take part in elections.
""He played a role not only for Russia, but for the whole world,"" Nikolai, 73, told AFP.
""After the revolution, the whole world bourgeoisie was afraid that their workers would also rise up and start a revolution,"" he said.
""Our country is on the brink,"" said 78-year-old pensioner Valentina Alexandrovna.
""It is basically turning into a colony. And only the Leninist doctrine can equip us to fight against this phenomenon,"" she said.
When Lenin died on 21 January 1924, Soviet authorities quickly embalmed his body and built a mausoleum -- a red and black polished stone temple at the heart of Red Square.
Huge crowds of people queued to pay their respects to the leader in Soviet times, but today, his embalmed body has largely become a tourist attraction.
President Vladimir Putin has publicly shunned Lenin for his supposed role in dividing the Russian Empire into nation states like Ukraine, and did not comment on the centenary.

""If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it. But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory.

DeSantis continued that despite previously having disagreements with Trump, he is throwing his support behind the 45th president in his run for the White House this year.
""It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" he said, adding: ""He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""

KZG7JORZFZ_EYOO7PD5HS4HSDQ,Abortion rights advocates rally for reproductive rights ahead of Roe v. Wade anniversary,Ashlee Banks,"January 22, 2024 at 2:58 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/abortion-rights-advocates-rally-reproductive-175823325.html,"The U.S. Supreme Court on January 22, 2023, enshrined the right to abortion in Roe v. Wade, which was overturned in 2022
As the 51st anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision approaches, reproductive rights advocates continue to fight on behalf of marginalized communities impacted by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the landmark ruling.
Rachel O’Leary Carmona, executive director of the Women’s March, on Saturday led one of several marches that took place across the country as she and others continue to fight for abortion rights.
She told theGrio that she was marching in Phoenix “as a commemoration and as a promise of the work that we intend to do over the next year.”
“In the 90s, Black women and women of color moved forward with the framework of reproductive justice understanding that this fight is bigger than just about abortion,” she said.
“This is about criminalization. But, it’s also about the conditions necessary for women to be able to have families when and how they choose,” she continued. “And to not have the state intervene with you making the right choice for you and your family.”
Since the 1973 ruling was overturned, nearly 24 states, including Florida, Texas, Ohio, Oklahoma and Louisiana, have implemented some variation of an abortion ban. The laws disproportionately impacted Black women and other marginalized groups.
“This was the first time in United States history that the Supreme Court has taken away a fundamental right that generations of people depended on,” Elisabeth Smith, director of state policy and advocacy with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told theGrio.
“In 2022, abortion was legal in every state in the country and today there are 14 states that have criminalized abortion. This means that nearly a quarter of the U.S. population is living in a state where reproductive autonomy is a crime,” she continued.
“Black people, indigenous people, people of color, young people and the like, we know, that those communities bear the brunt,” Smith said. “We’ve known for a really long time that abortion bans hit communities that have been the target of discrimination and face discriminatory barriers to health care.”
Smith stated that, in those cases where marginalized people live in states that penalize abortion, they have very few options and are forced to travel to nearby states that permit them to obtain one.
“If it’s possible, people can try to overcome financial and logistical hurdles, take days off and find childcare, to try to leave those states to access care,” she said.
Some are “ordering abortion medication and using that at home” because their “options for abortion care is really limited and really difficult to obtain,” she said.
O’Leary Carmona said that the “heaviest attacks on abortion are in states like Texas that have the highest cases of maternal mortality, particularly with Black women.”
“Black and Latinx women are heavily impacted in Texas as it pertains to the number of people who are being prevented from accessing abortion care,” she said.
Following the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, Texas implemented one of the strictest abortion bans in the country. The state law prohibits abortions if a fetal heartbeat has been detected.

Matters were made worse for women when a federal appeals court rendered a decision earlier this year that permitted the state of Texas to ban emergency abortions.
The three-judge panel prohibited the Biden-Harris administration enforcing the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 in the state. The law makes it mandatory for doctors to perform abortions if a woman’s life is in danger due to the pregnancy.
Anna Rupani, executive director of Fund Texas Choice, told theGrio that “Doctors and emergency room staff already have the enormous burden of providing lifesaving care at critical moments; this is no different.”
“They should not be encumbered by harmful laws that are being interpreted by non-medical professionals who do not understand the need for life-saving care and are possibly preventing or delaying this care with horrific consequences to the pregnant person,” she said.
“Because of this ruling, it is literally dangerous for people to be pregnant in this state because they cannot count on medical professionals to provide lifesaving care in grave emergencies,” she continued.
O’Leary Carmona also told theGrio that “Black and brown women are more likely to be criminalized” as it pertains to abortions.
In December 2023, Brittany Watts, a Black woman who had a miscarriage at her Ohio home, was charged with felony corpse abuse after investigators found the fetus lodged in the toilet in her home.
Warren Assistant Prosecutor Guarnieri informed the Municipal court judge that “how the child died” was not the issue, however it was “the fact the baby was put into a toilet, was large enough to clog up the toilet, left in the toilet, and she went on (with) her day.”
Despite the prosecutor’s efforts to have Watts indicted, a grand jury declined to do so.
“Luckily this case did not move forward, but it easily could have,” O’Leary Carmona told theGrio. “We know that Black and brown communities are the most at risk in terms of criminalization.”

L172URTR9Q_HDJ60OK9FMO5WOV,Topeka triple murder defendant seeks case's dismissal after body camera videos destroyed,"Tim Hrenchir, Topeka Capital-Journal","Updated January 21, 2024 at 10:46 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/topeka-triple-murder-defendant-seeks-095510460.html,"Topeka triple homicide defendant Yanez Sanford is seeking to have the case against him be dropped after 30 police body camera videos taken as part of the investigation involved were destroyed.
Sanford was charged with crimes that included capital murder in 2020 after new evidence emerged about the killings, committed in 2016 at a southwest Topeka apartment complex, court records say. Sanford is accused of shooting Dominique Ray, 23; Camrah Trotter, 20, who was pregnant in her third trimester; and Trotter’s unborn daughter.
The 30 videos, taken in 2016, were among evidence a judge ordered preserved in early 2021 in the case against Sanford, said a ""motion to dismiss based on the state's failure to preserve evidence"" filed Dec. 13 by Emily Barclay, a capital public defender with the state's Death Penalty Defense Unit.
When Topeka police asked for the videos in late 2021 from their body camera provider — Scottsdale, Arizona-based Axon Enterprise, LLC — they learned the videos had been destroyed at the end of their ""five-year retention period,"" court records say.
""There is no pathway for Mr. Sanford to receive fair trial with the deletion of nearly all of the body camera footage in this capital murder case,"" Barclay's motion said. ""The deletion of this invaluable video footage violates his due process rights.""
Barclay asked that the case against Sanford be dismissed ""with prejudice,"" in which case it couldn't be refiled. Motion hearings in the case are scheduled to take place beginning Jan. 30.
As part of the discovery process in which the two sides in a court case share information, the state has provided 1,500 pages of reports as well as jail phone calls, dispatch recordings, YouTube videos, phone downloads, surveillance tapes and interviews recorded at Topeka police headquarters, Barclay's motion said.
""There is an abundance of discovery in light of this being a capitally-charged triple homicide,"" it said. ""Notably missing are the Axon police body camera videos that would ordinarily accompany every single Shawnee County felony case, especially one of this magnitude.""
After the videos and other evidence were ordered preserved in February 2021, Shawnee County District Attorney Mike Kagay notified then-Interim Topeka Police Chief Bryan Wheeles of that order, according to Barclay's motion. Wheeles became permanent police chief later in 2021.
Topeka police apparently didn’t ask Axon not to delete the videos and didn’t realize the company intention to do so until after it had happened, court records said. Police learned in November 2021 that 30 Axon body camera videos taken as part of the investigation had been ""deleted"" and couldn't be recovered.
The videos were destroyed before they could be shared with the district attorney's office, Barclay's motion said.
""The Topeka Police Department provided an explanation that these videos were marked as 'evidence' which had a retention period of 5 years, ending in August 2021,"" it said.
When the crimes involved were committed and the videos were shot in 2016, ""There was not a standardized way of labeling videos,"" Barclay's motion said.
Axon subsequently put in place the standardized labeling system it now uses, but that system was not made retroactive, said an email accompanying Barclay's motion that was dated Nov. 30, 2021, and written by Charles Kitt, now Shawnee County's chief deputy district attorney.
""Furthermore, the videos in this case were on a 5-year retention schedule, so they were automatically purged from TPD's account a month or two ago,"" Kitt's email said.
He asked that Topeka police complete a full audit of the ""Axon issues"" in the case. The Capital-Journal submitted a Kansas Open Records Act request Friday to Topeka's city government seeking copies of documents related to any such audit.
Kitt's email said if the videos couldn't be recovered, he expected Sanford's attorneys would seek to have the charges against him dismissed.
Kitt's email suggested similar circumstances were involved in a 2019 Douglas County case in which a defendant was charged with aggravated battery and driving under the influence.
""In that case, the court dismissed the prosecution (with prejudice) for late discovery of evidence that was 'potentially exculpatory"" or even 'explanatory,'"" Kitt wrote. ""I expect we will have to fight that fight if videos are lost here.""
""Exculpatory"" means ""to clear from guilt.""
Sanford, 41, faces charges that include capital murder linked to the 2016 killing of a man, a woman and an unborn child at Fairlawn Greens Apartments, immediately south of Topeka West High School at 5235 S.W. 20th Terrace.
Shawnee County District Attorney Mike Kagay said Sanford fatally shot Dominique Ray, 23; Camrah Trotter, 20; and Trotter’s unborn daughter, who was to have been named Ariyah Trotter. Evidence showed Camrah Trotter had also been raped, Kagay said.
Sanford was charged with crimes that included capital murder linked to the killings in September 2020, after new evidence emerged, court records say.
Capital cases require prosecutors to file a notice of intent if they plan to seek the death penalty, which court records show hasn't been done in the case against Sanford.
Dan Dunbar — a retired Shawnee County chief deputy district attorney working as a special counsel on the case  — filed a response Jan. 12 to Barclay's motion seeking to dismiss it.
Dunbar wrote that for the case to be dismissed, Sanford's attorneys must satisfy the standards set out by a past U.S. Supreme Court ruling requiring them to "" prove the missing axons have potential exculpatory value; and the absence of any comparable evidence; and the destruction was done in bad faith, i.e., the destruction was done knowing the potential exculpatory value of the recordings.""
While Barclay's motion contended there is no comparable evidence to what was present on the body camera videos, ""comparable"" does not mean ""identical,"" Dunbar wrote.
""The State anticipates presenting evidence regarding the axons that were deleted,"" Dunbar wrote. ""Most of the officers either have prepared a report of their participation and/or have a recollection of what transpired while wearing their body camera.""
Dunbar said, ""The State anticipates the Court will hear testimony explaining the innocent nature of the destruction of those videos and the process that was in place when the destruction occurred and how it has been remedied.""
Barclay then filed a response Tuesday to the prosecutor's response, arguing that:
• Video evidence, especially when it contains footage of the eyewitnesses in the immediateaftermath of a homicide, is potentially exculpatory or explanatory.
• The state cannot produce comparable evidence to live, simultaneous videos taken of theevents close in time to the triple homicide.
• Courts have found ""bad faith"" to exist in past situations that involved failure to preserve evidence.
• ""The government had knowledge of exculpatory value before the deletion of the videos.""
She concluded: ""Mr. Sanford submits that the destroyed video in question contained exculpatory value, that no comparable evidence exists, that it was destroyed in bad faith after being provided notice to preserve such videos, and that it was done with knowledge of the exculpatory value.""

Tensions in the Middle East remain front and center with no let-up in attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi militants in the oil-rich region despite US-led airstrikes. Still, crude futures are taking little notice as the crisis has yet to take a direct hit on production in a world of ample supplies. West Texas Intermediate futures traded in a $4.41 range last week, while the global benchmark Brent remains below $80 a barrel. Oil edged higher Monday, following the broader market.
Shipping
Attacks on vessels in the Red Sea have raised concern about an escalating situation in the region, but charter rates for massive oil tankers to at least one destination are painting a slightly different picture. So far, those ships don’t appear to have been purposely targeted and that’s putting a lid on transport costs for the key Arab Gulf-to-China route. While the cost to charter Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) spiked after Hamas’s attack of Israel in early October, rates are now below $40,000 a day and heading back down toward the five-year average, according to data from Galbraiths. The Middle East produces about a third of the world’s crude and most is sent to Asia.
Electric Vehicles
Spot prices of lithium carbonate — a refined form of lithium — continue to slide. After surging to a record in late 2022 on the promise of electrification in the automotive sector, prices have plunged more than 80% as the market grappled with shortage fears to oversupply. That has forced Albermarle Corp. — the world’s biggest lithium producer — to reduce project spending and costs. Even so, the appetite for the indispensable metal in the making of EV batteries is set to grow. Investors will be keenly watching fourth-quarter results from Tesla on Wednesday for insight on sales and the demand outlook. The automaker’s profitability continues to be eroded by vehicle price cuts.
Agriculture
Chilled US stockpiles of pork bellies, the cut used to make bacon, are trending below average. That comes amid a decline in overall pork production that’s helping push up wholesale prices, which are at the highest since late September. Traders will be focused on the USDA’s monthly cold storage report for the latest on pork demand, as well as other meats, dairy goods, poultry, fruits and vegetables.
Natural Gas
At a time of frigid temperatures in the US, one would expect to see soaring prices of natural gas — the heating and power fuel. Not so. Unusually high inventory levels and shifting forecasts to warmer weather have kept prices in check. Futures tumbled 24% last week, capping the biggest weekly selloff since December 2021, after a lower-than-expected storage withdrawal renewed concerns over a supply glut. Still, volatility will likely remain with two months of winter remaining in the Northern Hemisphere. Natural gas traded lower on Monday.

L42S8QFRQO_7GX8S3RC4L44T8E,At least 27 people are reported killed in an attack on Donetsk in Russian-occupied Ukraine,Associated Press,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 4:51 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/officials-report-least-13-dead-091000169.html,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Moscow-installed officials said Ukrainian shelling killed at least 27 people and wounded 25 on Sunday at a market on the outskirts of Donetsk, a Russian-occupied city in the eastern part of the country.
Among the injured in the suburb of Tekstilshchik were two children, said Denis Pushilin, the local leader.
Ukrainian officials in Kyiv did not comment on the incident, and the claims could not be independently verified by The Associated Press. Both sides have increasingly relied on longer-range attacks this winter amid largely unchanged positions on the 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line in the nearly 2-year-old war.
The artillery shells that hit the area had been fired from the area of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west, Pushilin said, adding that emergency services responded to the scene.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today’s shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine,” according to a U.N. spokesperson, adding that all such attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law.
Donetsk is one of four regions in Ukraine that Russia annexed illegally in 2022, months after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.
Russia's Foreign Ministry also blamed Ukraine and described the strike as a “terrorist attack.”
Also on Sunday, a fire broke out at a chemical transport terminal at Russia’s Ust-Luga port following two explosions, regional officials said. Local media said the Baltic Sea port, 165 kilometers (about 100 miles) southwest of St. Petersburg, had been attacked by Ukrainian drones, causing a gas tank to explode.
The blaze was at a site run by Russia’s second-largest natural gas producer, Novatek.
In a statement to Russian media outlet RBC, the company blamed the fire on an “external influence,” saying operations at the port were paused.
Yuri Zapalatsky, the head of the Kingisepp district on the Gulf of Finland where the port is located, said there were no casualties but the area was on high alert.
News outlet Fontanka reported that two drones had been detected flying toward St. Petersburg on Sunday morning, but were redirected toward the Kingisepp district. AP could not independently verify the reports.
Russia's Defense Ministry did not report any drone activity in the Kingisepp area in its daily briefing. It said that four Ukrainian drones had been downed in Russia’s Smolensk region, and that two more were shot down in the Oryol and Tula regions.
Russian officials previously confirmed a Ukrainian drone had been downed on the outskirts of St. Petersburg on Thursday.
In fighting on the front line, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Moscow’s forces had taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. Ukrainian forces confirmed the settlement had been occupied, but described its capture as temporary.
Ukrainian Ground Forces Command spokesman Volodymyr Fityo said Kyiv’s troops had been pulled back to reserve positions from the village, which had a population of about 45 people before the start of the war.
“That’s five houses, probably,” he was quoted as saying by Ukrainian news outlet Hromadske. “Our main goal is to save the lives of Ukraine’s defenders.”
Recent Russian attacks have tried to find gaps in Ukraine’s defenses by using large numbers of missiles and drones in an apparent effort to saturate air defense systems.
The massive barrages — more than 500 drones and missiles were fired between Dec. 29 and Jan. 2, according to officials in Kyiv — are also using up Ukraine’s weapons stockpiles.

To contribute, click here.
•••
Pretend with me for a few sentences, please, that you're a DFL member of the Minnesota House.
You are thinking — more likely obsessing — about your bid for re-election this year. You're worried that weak enthusiasm for your party's president, Sen. Amy Klobuchar's non-contest for a fourth term, and the absence of any other high-profile statewide races will translate to low DFL turnout. You fear that poor turnout may land you back in the minority in 2025.
Are your thoughts turning to constitutional amendments? You're thinking like a legislator already!
The notion of ginning up turnout by turning crowd-animating issues into proposed amendments to the Minnesota Constitution is not a new one. Republicans tried that very thing — and failed spectacularly — with their same-sex marriage ban and voter ID amendments in 2012.
With their trifecta control of the State Capitol, DFLers have a ripe opportunity in the session that convenes on Feb. 12 to try their hands at this game. Not that DFLers need a trifecta to put constitutional amendments on the 2024 ballot, mind you. The Legislature is empowered to do that all by itself, without a governor's say-so or signature.
Gov. Tim Walz can only offer encouragement, which he did at an event on Jan. 8. That day's venue was Planned Parenthood headquarters in St. Paul, leaving no doubt about which issue the DFL governor has in mind.
It's ""important that we keep [abortion] at the forefront of people's minds,"" Walz said that day. ""We need to make sure the public is active"" in efforts to protect reproductive rights from future changes in state political tides.
That's the argument for adding protection for abortion rights to the state Constitution. It's not that the legality of abortion is at risk under current state law. Minnesota's statutory foundation for abortion rights was strengthened by the Legislature and Walz just a year ago, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 Dobbs decision.
Rather, it's that statutes can be changed with relative ease by future governors and Legislatures. Constitutional provisions are harder to dislodge.
The obliging folks at ERA-MN are preparing just what Walz ordered. They've been revising the language of their long-sought state Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to explicitly include protection for reproductive rights, including abortion.
There's some irony in that move. For decades, advocates for federal and state bans on gender-based discrimination have rejected the charge that the ERA is really a stalking horse for abortion. They are separate issues, the pro-ERA forces insisted, pointing to the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court found ample justification in 1973 to make abortion legal without an ERA in the federal Constitution.
Now that SCOTUS has changed its tune about abortion, so has ERA-MN, acknowledged its founder, former state Rep. Betty Folliard.
""The ERA question is much bigger than abortion. It says discrimination is not OK, and we want protections for all people, especially in the workplace,"" Folliard told me.
But ""after Dobbs, we've seen that rights can be given and rights can be taken away unless they are embedded in our constitution."" Those rights include bodily autonomy, she said, and she'll be at the Capitol pushing to put on the 2024 ballot a version of the ERA that says so.
ERA-MN won't be alone in an amendment quest. In fact, one amendment has already landed on this November's ballot. Last session, legislators agreed to ask voters to give the state's lottery-funded Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund, due to expire in 2025, another 25-year lease on life.
Joining the ERA advocates in hot amendment pursuit will be a housing coalition called Our Future Starts at Home. Composed of more than 50 nonprofit organizations, the coalition will be asking for a 3/8ths percent increase in the state sales tax, to be dedicated to housing assistance for low-income Minnesotans. The request is modeled after the Clean Water, Land and Legacy Amendment that led the ballot in 2008.
Anne Mavity, executive director of the Minnesota Housing Partnership, says the data are clear: The state's housing market for lower-income people is broken, and other societal ills can't be remedied unless housing needs are met.
Inconsistent funding, one legislative session at a time, can't solve the problem, she added. ""One and done is not how housing development works. We need funding in an ongoing way.""
Mavity and Folliard both say their organizations are ready to run robust Vote Yes campaigns this year. Both will argue that the constitutional changes they favor have wide support and can boost turnout, particularly among the progressive voters that DFL legislators want to attract to the polls. Both plan rallies at the Capitol early in the new session — the ERA on Feb. 12, the housing coalition on Feb. 20 — to punctuate that point.
Are you still thinking like a DFL legislator? If you are, you can hear both Mavity and Folliard singing sweet music in your ear.

The two pedestrians, both in their 60s, were walking the dog in Thurnham Lane, Bearsted, when the black SUV collided with them at about 1.40pm on Saturday.
Kent Police officers attended the scene along with South East Coast Ambulance Service, where the two pedestrians were pronounced dead.
The force said the man driving the BMW stayed at the scene and spoke to officers. No arrests have been made.
Steven Edwards, who rents a commercial yard off Thurnham Lane, said some drivers use the road as a rat run, adding that recent icy conditions turned parts of it into a “skid pan”.
He said: “Some people race up there but as a rule the locals do go quite slow.
“It’s 30mph through the built-up area and then it goes into a national speed limit, which is ridiculous because you should never be doing that up there.”
The road, between Pilgrims Way in Thurnham, and Ware Street in Bearsted, was closed for several hours but has since re-opened.

LCT2I229VN_6NHX2LOIUET22KH,Ron DeSantis drops out of 2024 Republican presidential race,Aaron Navarro,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 6:44 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ron-desantis-drops-2024-republican-200800626.html,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his presidential campaign on Sunday, posting a video on X saying he could not ask his campaign staffers to give their time ""without a clear path to victory.""
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis said.
He added that he had signed a pledge to support the eventual nominee. As he left the race, DeSantis took a parting shot at opponent Nikki Haley. Trump, he said in his video, ""has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear — a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism — that Nikki Haley represents.""
Who's running for president?
Soon after DeSantis announced he was dropping out of the race, Haley told reporters, ""He's been a good governor and we wish him well,"" and noting that the race is now down to ""one fella and one lady,"" she added, ""May the best woman win.""
After placing a distant second in Iowa, losing to former President Donald Trump by 30 points, DeSantis has failed to articulate his path to the nomination and what states he would be able to win against Trump, dropping out of the race two days before the New Hampshire primary.
He had invested large amounts of time and money in trying to win Iowa, as he and his super PAC bet that an aggressive approach of retail politics and building a ground game operation would result in an upset or a closer race.
On the campaign trail, DeSantis, 45, pitched himself as a more effective figure to implement some of Trump's policies on immigration or curbing government spending, and that Trump's legal cases could cost Republicans the White House in a general election.
DeSantis' record in Florida was an anchor of his candidacy, often pointing to his response during the COVID-19 pandemic and legislative record on taxes, his handling of the state's budget taxes and his six-week abortion ban. He pointed to his 20-point re-election win in Florida as a data point of electoral success he'd have as the Republican nominee.
But since his glitchy launch on X (formerly Twitter) ""spaces"" in May 2023, DeSantis' campaign had struggled to create a convincing argument for voters to pick him over Trump.
He saw his polling gap with Trump in the early states widen as the former president went on the attack against him, claiming he was disloyal and disparaging him ""DeSanctimonious."" Trump's campaign and allies spent millions on anti-DeSantis ads and trolled him on his personality, his footwear and internal dysfunction with his campaign.
His campaign appeared to be overspending early on, straining its financial resources and cutting staff heading into fall of last year.
The campaign struggled to generate high fundraising numbers throughout the campaign —  especially as Haley won support from GOP donors looking for a non-Trump candidate.
Throughout his run, a pro-DeSantis super PAC, ""Never Back Down,"" had an outsized role not traditionally seen in presidential campaigns, running the grassroots operations and door knocking in the early states. The super PAC hosted DeSantis as a ""special guest"" for a majority of his campaign events because his presidential campaign was low on funds.
Never Back Down saw a high-profile turnover of leadership in November and December, after conflicts over advertising strategy, increased involvement on the PAC's board from DeSantis loyalists from Tallahassee, and overall frustration with the governor's position in the polls.
Legally, campaigns and super PACs cannot coordinate because super PACs are not subject to any fundraising limits. The heavy involvement by Never Back Down prompted a formal complaint to be filed by the Campaign Legal Center.
While DeSantis argued that he could whittle the race down to a two-person matchup against Trump, DeSantis failed to establish himself as the clear Trump alternative, especially as Haley saw a rise in the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire after her strong debate performances in the late summer and fall.
Asked in January on New Hampshire radio whether he believes he should have waited until 2028 — when he likely wouldn't be facing Trump — to launch a run, DeSantis replied, ""I don't know what [20]28 is gonna look like. I may not have the calling then. I had the calling now. I think the party supporting me would lead to great results over an eight year period.""
""Obviously with Trump in, it's more difficult,"" he added.

Around three explosions were heard in the early afternoon, according to a local correspondent for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Crimean service.
Soon after, the head of the Russian-installed city authorities Mikhail Rozvozhaev reported that an airborne target had been shot down over the sea nearby.
Later in the day, the Russian Defense Ministry claimed that two Ukrainian missiles had been shot down over the western coast of Crimea.
As the full-scale war has developed, military facilities and infrastructure in Russian-occupied Crimea has become increasingly vulnerable to long-range Ukrainian drone and missile strikes.
Most spectactularly, separate Ukrainian strikes in September 2023, reportedly with British-made Storm Shadow missiles, destroyed a Russian landing ship, submarine, and the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol.

Australia’s Superannuation System, established in 1992, mandates employers to contribute 3% of employees’ earnings to individual retirement funds. Over time, this guarantee has risen to 10% and will increase to 11.5% on July 1, 2024, and 12% on July 1, 2025. This mandatory long-term savings system in Australia helps employees accumulate funds for their retirement and achieve financial freedom during their golden years.
The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a monthly and taxable benefit that could replace part of your income when you enter retirement. If you’re eligible, you could receive the CPP retirement pension for as long as you’re alive. But to qualify, you must be at least 60 years old and have made at least one valid contribution to the CPP. Valid contributions can be either from work you did in Canada or as the result of receiving credits from a former spouse at the end of the relationship.
According to the government of Canada, the maximum monthly pension amount you could receive if you start your pension at age 65 is $1,364.60 in 2024.
Find Out: This Is the Minimum You Need Saved for Retirement in Every State
Sweden’s Pension System is a multipillar model comprising three parts: public pension, occupational pensions and private savings. The national public pension is based on your total income. Each year that you work and pay taxes in Sweden, you earn toward your national public pension. In other words, the longer you work, the higher your monthly pension payment will be once you retire. Most people in Sweden also receive an occupational pension from their employer and can choose to save privately for their pension through a bank. Sweden’s three-tier system ensures retirees receive a basic income, supplemented by employer contributions and additional private savings for a secure retirement.
Singapore’s Central Provident Fund (CPF) is a comprehensive social security system that allows working Singapore citizens and permanent residents to set aside funds for retirement.
Employees and employers contribute a percentage of the employee’s income to the CPF. These contributions are then allocated to different accounts, including the Ordinary Account (for housing, insurance and education), Special Account (for retirement and investments) and Medisave Account (for healthcare).
If you’re under 55 years old, you earn up to 5% interest on the first $60,000 of your combined CPF balances. And if you’re 55 and older, you earn up to 6% interest on the first $30,000 of your combined CPF balances and up to 5% on the next $30,000.
Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) is funded by the country’s oil revenues, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management. This fund was initially established in 1990 after Norway discovered oil in the North Sea and now serves as a long-term savings plan to ensure Norway’s current and future generations can benefit from the country’s oil wealth. As of Jan. 16, 2024, the fund’s market value is around 16,000 billion Norwegian Krone (1.5 trillion USD).
The Riester Pension is a government-sponsored private pension scheme in Germany that provides tax benefits and subsidies to employees. It aims to supplement state pensions, promoting Germany’s long-term savings for retirement.
Here’s how the Riester Pension works: During your working years, you pay contributions into a private pension contract or bank savings plan. As a reward for socking away money for retirement, you receive state subsidies and tax breaks. The subsidy consists of a basic allowance of €175 per person and €300 for each child per year. Once you reach retirement age, you’ll then receive life-long monthly benefits paid in the form of a pension or a disbursement plan.
The Netherlands’ Collective Defined Contribution (CDC) schemes are pension plans where contributions are pooled and invested, and investment risks are shared. In a CDC scheme, both the employer and employee contribute to a collective fund which provides an income in retirement. However, instead of promising a fixed pension amount, the plan aims for a target. If investments do well, great. If not, adjustments are made later.
New Zealand’s KiwiSaver is a voluntary retirement savings program where employees contribute a percentage of their income, and employers match. The program is available to all New Zealand citizens and permanent residents, and you’re automatically enrolled into KiwiSaver if you’re starting work with a new employer and are between ages 18 and 65. Besides the minimum employer contribution match of 3% of your before-tax pay, the government may contribute up to $521.43 into your account each year as well.
Japan’s Public Pension System consists of two tiers: a basic, flat-rate scheme and an earnings-related plan. Contributions are mandatory for all employees and self-employed individuals ages 20 to 59 years old who have an address in Japan. As of January 2024, the contribution amount for the National Pension is ¥16,520 per month, and the maximum pension payment in retirement is ¥795,000 per year.
United Kingdom’s Pension Auto-Enrollment program requires employers to enroll employees into a workplace pension scheme if they’re eligible for it. This system is designed so that eligible employees can start building their nest eggs without having to take any action themselves. Employers must automatically enroll an employee into a pension scheme and deduct their pension contribution from their salary if they meet all of the following requirements:
They’re classed as a worker.
They’re between ages 22 and State Pension age.
They earn at least £10,000 per year.
They ordinarily work in the U.K.

These projects are being implemented in cooperation with Western countries, including the United States.
Among the tasks for 2024, the ministry named decentralisation and increasing the capacity of distributed electricity generation, in particular through the installation of gas turbines, as well as continuing the repair campaign and replacing high-voltage power converters at substations and protection systems.
As is known, Ukraine plans to build a total of nine new nuclear power units based on the American AR1000 technology.
Reminder:
Energoatom and Westinghouse signed an agreement on the purchase of the first AR1000 reactor unit on 17 December 2023.
It was reported that a Westinghouse reactor for the new power unit at Khmelnytskyi NPP will cost Ukraine US$437.5 million.

The figures cover April 2019 to March 2023 and saw 54 officers investigated with 11 dismissed and three prosecuted.
The information was released following a request by councillors in North Tyneside.
Northumbria said it was ""relentless"" in rooting out employees who do not uphold the law.
The force disclosed the numbers amid a call for greater police transparency by Independent councillors and they were made public at a borough council meeting on Thursday.
The councillors had also asked the force why it had not handed over the data as part of a Liberal Democrat Freedom of Information (FoI) request submitted to every force in the UK last year.
Deputy mayor of North Tyneside, Carl Johnson, of Labour, said the force had told him it had not received the request.
An article by The Observer in December said the FoI data revealed 1,100 officers across England and Wales were under investigation for sexual or domestic abuse.
Northumbria Police was one of 28 out of 43 forces that had not responded to the request, the article added.
Following a request for comment by the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Northumbria re-issued a statement from November by Det Supt Donna Rose, its head of professional standards.
She said it was ""an honour and a privilege to be a police officer, and upon joining we take an oath to serve with fairness, integrity, diligence and impartiality"".
She added: ""Sadly, as we have seen both nationally and locally, there are times when individuals fail to meet these qualities.
""We absolutely recognise the impact such incidents can have on the communities we are here to protect.
""As we have previously made clear, this includes being relentless in our pursuit to root out those individuals who don't share our values - and who ultimately have no place within policing.""

LHXH3FHNCK_GSIYQRDY7TI5T1K,Why is wool itchy?,Jennifer Nalewicki,"January 21, 2024 at 7:00 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/why-wool-itchy-100012177.html,"A knitted wool sweater may be one of the warmest pieces of clothing to grab when temperatures turn chilly, but this insulating material can often be downright itchy when wearing it.
So, what is it about wool that triggers us to itch uncontrollably?
One of the main reasons an otherwise cozy piece of clothing can go from being comfortable to unbearable is the thickness of the wool fibers used to make the item.
""The thicker the fiber, the itchier the wool will be,"" Ingun Grimstad Klepp, an ethnologist and professor of clothing and sustainability at Oslo Metropolitan University in Norway, told Live Science. ""That's one factor. Another is the softness of the fibers used to make the yarn.""
In other words, a thicker fiber spun by humans will likely be more abrasive and less flexible, which can lead to itching and irritation on the skin, while thinner, softer fibers, such as merino wool and downy-like alpaca fleece, can help ""ditch the itch.""
Related: How many animals have ever existed on Earth?
While it's easy to assume that all wool is derived from one source — sheep — the word ""wool"" actually applies to shorn animal fibers that are woven into yarn to make clothing. So goats, alpacas, camels and rabbits can also provide wool, according to Science Norway, an online science news magazine. The underhair that makes up wool, which is soft, thin, curly and flexible, never stops growing, which is why these wooly animals need to be periodically shorn.
Another less common cause of itchiness is the presence of lanolin, a waxy substance secreted by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. Also called wool wax or wool grease, lanolin is great for repairing dry, chapped skin, but it can also cause an allergic response in some people, according to Healthline.
""Wool isn't an allergen in and of itself, but it is possible to be allergic to lanolin,"" Grimstad Klepp said. ""However, most wool today doesn't contain much lanolin because the majority of it has been washed and dyed out during production, so there's not much lanolin left in the yarn.""

Despite the occasional discomfort, wool is one of the best materials to wear when it's cold and wet outside. That's because it has natural capabilities that can wick away sweat and moisture from the surface of our skin, according to Science Norway.
""The difference between cotton and wool is that when cotton fibers get wet, they tend to get damp and collapse,"" Grimstadd Klepp said. ""You can see this happening with people at the gym who are wearing cotton T-shirts that cling to their bodies as they sweat. Wool T-shirts have more breathability and are able to absorb quite a bit of sweat and pull it away from your body."""

DOHA/GAZA (Reuters) -Israeli attacks and street battles raged across the Gaza Strip on Sunday as Palestinian health officials said the death toll from Israeli strikes since war broke out in October had passed 25,000.
Gaza's health ministry said 178 Palestinians had been killed in the past 24 hours, one of the deadliest days of the war so far. Israel's military said a soldier was killed in fighting.
Israeli forces and Hamas fighters clashed in several places, from Jabalia in the north to Khan Younis in the south, the focus of recent Israeli operations.
Israeli planes resumed heavy bombing on Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip and explosions echoed throughout the city.
Explosions lit the skies in parts of the Khan Younis refugee camp, and Palestinian health officials said one Palestinian was killed and seven wounded in one air strike as night fell.
Israel said its troops had cleared much of northern Gaza of Hamas' military network and more than 1 million residents of that enclave have moved south to flee the bombardments. Fighting, however, has continued in the Jabalia refugee camp and other areas around Gaza City.
Israel unleashed its campaign to eliminate Iran-backed Hamas after the militants burst into Israel on Oct. 7 and rampaged through southern towns and bases, killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking 253 hostages back to Gaza. Israel says it is fighting a threat to its very existence.
The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said 25,105 Palestinians - many of them women and children - had been killed and 62,681 have been wounded in Israeli strikes since Oct. 7. It does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but says most of those killed have been civilians.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Sunday denounced Israel for what he called the ""heartbreaking"" deaths of Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
""Israel's military operations have spread mass destruction and killed civilians on a scale unprecedented during my time as secretary-general,"" Guterres said.
Israel says it takes steps to avoid civilian casualties, but accuses Hamas of operating in densely populated areas and using civilians as human shields, a charge the Islamist group denies.
Guterres also said it was unacceptable for Israel to resist statehood for Palestinians and such a stance would indefinitely prolong a conflict.
HAMAS CONDITIONS REJECTED
His comments followed remarks by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that appeared to rule out the so-called two-state solution to the decades-long Israel-Palestinian conflict - as urged by the U.S. and other governments.
Netanyahu's office said that in talks with U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday, he ""reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.""
On Sunday, Netanyahu rejected conditions presented by Hamas to end the war and release hostages that would include Israel's complete withdrawal and leaving Hamas, an Islamist group dedicated to Israel's destruction, in power in Gaza.
On Monday, the Israeli and Palestinian foreign ministers are to meet their European Union counterparts in Brussels as the EU considers potential steps toward a comprehensive peace.
Hamas said Washington was ignoring Palestinian suffering and deaths while supporting Israeli actions financially and militarily. Hamas called its Oct. 7 assault a ""necessary step"".
""It was a defensive act in the frame of getting rid of the Israeli occupation, reclaiming the Palestinian rights and on the way for liberation and independence,"" Hamas said in a statement.
The Oct. 7 attacks, in which many women and children were murdered and bodies mutilated, drew worldwide revulsion and condemnation.
Most of the Gaza Strip's 2.3 million people have since been displaced from their homes. With large areas razed to the ground and hospitals and humanitarian agencies struggling to cope, Palestinians described dire conditions.
""We struggle to survive bombs, but frankly we try to survive hunger more,"" Amer, 32, a father of three from northern Gaza, told Reuters. ""Finding food for the family, for the children, has become a more challenging adventure than surviving war.""
Israel's military said soldiers had killed 15 Palestinian gunmen in the north while snipers, backed by air support, had killed a number of militants in Khan Younis. Hamas dismissed this account.
Palestinians said fighting has raged in Jabalia for the past three days. Some buildings caught fire and smoke rose where bombs had fallen.
Along Gaza's southern coast, witnesses said Israeli warships shelled the beach.
In the southern city of Rafah, where more than 1 million displaced people are concentrated, three Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on a car. Another car was hit in Gaza City, killing three people, health officials said.
Violence has also surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Hamas' rival, the Palestinian Authority, has limited self-rule. The Palestinian Health Ministry there said Israeli forces have killed 360 Palestinians since Oct. 7.

Ron DeSantis (R) ended his presidential bid.
“It is my privilege to provide my complete and total endorsement for Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States. President Trump was the greatest President of my lifetime, and we need him to reinstate the policies that were working so well for America,” Good wrote in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
Good’s endorsement comes just after DeSantis announced he was withdrawing from the presidential race. Good had initially endorsed DeSantis — a decision that initially drew anger from some high-profile figures in the conference.
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), who was ousted from the Freedom Caucus, recently railed against Good, calling him a “disloyal MAGA traitor” and saying, “President Trump is going to win in 24, and he needs loyal America First warriors NOT Congressmen on a power trip who will stab him in the back.”
Good said in his endorsement that he would do whatever he could to get Trump elected and encouraged others to do the same.
“I am committed to doing everything I can to help ensure he is reelected President,” Good said.
“I call on all Republicans, independents, and Democrats who love America and are concerned about her current direction, to join me in supporting Donald J. Trump!”
DeSantis’s withdrawal sets up an essentially two-person race for the GOP nomination between former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Trump.

Gretchen Whitmer is nudging President Joe Biden to lean harder into abortion rights as he seeks to win another term in the White House.
“I think it would be good if he did,” Whitmer said, when asked during an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” whether Biden should be talking about abortion more. “I know that one tenet of his belief system is that women and only women, with their families, and healthcare professionals are the ones who know what decision is right for them.”
Whitmer, a Democratic governor of a purple state and a co-chair of Biden’s reelection bid, has credited the abortion rights with helping Democrats win up and down the ballot in Michigan — helping her win reelection in 2022, and helping Democrats win majorities in both branches of the state legislature, the first time in decades the state’s government flipped entirely blue.
Top Biden campaign officials have flagged abortion rights as a top issue for the president, but Biden himself has been more restrained in talking about the issue than other Democrats.
The president, who is Catholic, has described himself as personally not “big on abortion” because of his faith, but the landmark Roe v. Wade decision “got it right,” he said over the summer. Since then, he’s slammed court rulings limiting abortion access and fought efforts to restrict the availability of abortion pills.
Biden has been poised to run on what has been described as the strongest abortion rights platform of any general election candidate as he and his allies look to notch a victory in the first presidential election since Roe was overturned in 2022.
But having Biden tout that message himself wouldn’t hurt, Whitmer said in the interview, which aired Sunday.
“I think people want to know that this is a president that is fighting. And I think he has said that, to use maybe more, you know, blunt language, maybe that would be helpful,” Whitmer said."

Sled dog racing is a winter dog sport that involves the timed competition of teams of sled dogs that pull a sled with the dog driver or musher standing on the runners.
The 2024 Idaho Sled Dog Challenge has attracted teams from six states, including its first-ever racer from Texas - Trace Drake from San Angelo.
Drake is competing in the 100-mile race on Jan. 29-30 and the Warm Lake Stage Race on Jan. 24-25 in Cascade, Idaho. The musher field also includes a mother and daughter, a father and son, and two brothers.
""Sled dog racing is a challenging sport often run in extreme weather conditions, but the absence of weather this winter has been an even greater challenge,"" race founder and organizer Jerry Wortley said. ""Although we are experiencing record low snow levels, trail conditions in Valley and Adams counties for the 2024 Idaho Sled Dog Challenge currently appear adequate to run the race, potentially with some modifications to the routes.""
According to Drake's Biography on the Idaho Dog Sled Challenge website, his kennel is TSA Kennels and his lead dog's names are Ovando and Chinook.
Drake got started in mushing by working for Alaska Icefield Expeditions on the Denver glacier, the website stated.
When asked about his mushing highlights, this is how he answered:
""Easily the glacier this far, the views are amazing, the people were wonderful, and the dogs absolutely magnificent and beautiful,"" according to the website.
He said his future goals are to be the first Texan to win the Iditarod, an annual long-distance sled dog race held in Alaska in early March.

LQ5LF767O5_GQKNM8GXW0957G7,‘I was so naïve to think the UN would help us uncover Hamas’ rape atrocities’,Louise Carpenter,"January 21, 2024 at 4:00 PM·14 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/hope-families-don-t-hamas-070000170.html,"This article contains some details that readers may find disturbing
It has been over three months since Hamas’s attack on Israel, during which terrorists moved through a music festival and 20 villages and towns, murdering men, women and children. Unequivocal evidence has since shown how entire families were burned, people were beheaded, how there was the systematic raping and mutilation of girls and women, along with the dragging away of 240 hostages. Hamas filmed in real time and streamed it on social media. The death toll currently stands at 1,200.
When the news flashes appeared on Israeli television on Oct 7, 40-year-old Dr Cochav Elkayam-Levy was at the hospital bedside of her 69-year-old father, who was deteriorating with Alzeimher’s. She was just back from a family holiday in Egypt with her husband and children, two boys and two girls, aged two through to 13. She had read and swam, practised yoga and meditated, a last break before her new semester at the Davis Institute for International Relations at Hebrew University, Jerusalem, where she teaches international law, gender and the protection of human rights.
But with Oct 7, her life was to change overnight. “We couldn’t understand what was going on at first,” Elkayam-Levy remembers, “but within those first three days [afterwards] I took it upon myself to get as much information as I could. I often say now that I knew too much too soon.” International media was showing much more of the horror than Israeli media. She watched everything.
“[Then] I wasn’t thinking about an international community [response], I was thinking about this existential threat for my family, my friends. I lived in such fear. I said to my husband ‘I need to get a weapon’. As a feminist scholar, that is against everything that I believe in. It’s against not only everything that I believe in, but everything that I teach, everything that I know.” They blockaded the back of their home.
Within eight days of Oct 7, she was propelled onto the global stage in response to what she – and 160 other peers, all specialists in gender politics and part of a WhatsApp group created in response to the attack – saw as silence from the United Nations (UN) and other international agencies who, despite video evidence of gender-based violence as a weapon of war, asked questions such as ‘what is your proof?’, delaying their condemnation of Hamas.
“I was so naïve,” says Elkayam-Levy. She had not questioned the fact that agencies such as the UN might not issue immediate statements honouring the murdered women and children.
On Oct 15, Elkayam-Levy stepped into what she and her WhatsApp group perceived as the void by establishing Crimes by Hamas against Women and Children, an independent civil commission of which she is the chairman. Its aim is to gather information and meticulously log for posterity the war crimes committed against women and children.
In many ways, it was born out of the desperation and anger of those WhatsApp members, many prominent feminists, principally at UN Women and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The commission was – and is – a human rights response to “rape as genocide”, explains Elkayam-Levy. The silence, she has pointed out, is an echo of the way similar war crimes against women in Bosnia were ignored.
“We have a historical mission,” Elkayam-Levy explains to me. “We are not a prosecution [vehicle]. We are not an investigation. We have a different role. We are keeping all accounts, even the smallest piece of information, just a sentence perhaps that comes in about a young woman, [logged on a form] for historical purposes, to make sure that the voices of women will be heard, that this information will be kept diligently, in the most dedicated way. [The aim] is to establish an archive under the [strictest] international standard.”
It is not beholden on the commission to prove anything in a court of law, as is the case with the international war crimes tribunal. Its remit is confined to logging and verifying testimonies. This mission to build such an archive of crimes against humanity in a country founded after the Holocaust echoes a similar collective responsibility never to forget.
Elkayam-Levy, who completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania, is impeccably qualified for such a task: she had already founded her own independent think tank, the Institute for Gender and Sustainability Studies, established to promote the inclusion of women in national security decision-making processes and peace-making negotiations (the civil commission is under the auspices of this institute). She was the co-author, too, of a ground-breaking report for the Israeli National Security Council that had examined the consequences of national crises and extreme events on women.
Elkayam-Levy and I speak as the commission is about to release its first preliminary report:  “a summary,” she says, “of the most important things that we know at the moment. It’s not going to expose something new. That might take months, years.”
She never wanted the limelight. It’s ironic that when she set up her think tank, she stipulated that she was not to be its public figurehead. Still, in the last three months since Oct 7, she has been to the White House, spoken at the UN alongside Sheryl Sandberg and Hillary Clinton and travelled the world, taking the commission’s commitment to remember the lost women and children to new audiences:  “[in the early stages] I never realised it was going to get such international attention.”
She is a mother of four, her youngest child only two-years-old. Her father is sick, her job in academia is high-level on its own terms, and she has a husband who works in the field of cyber security. Today, Elkayam-Levy is palpably exhausted. At one point, as we talk, she is overcome with emotion. “I’m sorry,” she says, “I’m sorry.” There can be no doubt that it is taking its toll.
“I rise at 5am and I go to bed at midnight, but I can’t sleep. I haven’t exercised since it happened. I don’t really see my children anymore.”
She has received death threats from pro-Palestinian individuals and organisations. There have been threats to the lives of her children. “I live in fear.” But still she carries on: “I have so many meetings, so many people who feel this is important. I need to find a balance and at some point, I will find a balance, not to completely drain my powers but I feel things are so important and [I worry] that in a few months people might not be as interested as they are now. I feel like I need to do this, I feel obligated.”
The commission’s work is built on oral, video and written accounts; trawling through evidence, every video, every Hamas live stream, every detail of reported torture, eyewitness accounts, second-hand pieces of information, the recollections of first responders, morgue workers and forensic pathologists handling the bodies. Some report crushed pelvic bones from multiple rapes, genitals mutilated with nails and bullets, breasts cut off, legs broken, limbs charred. In the months and years to come, the commission’s information-gathering will move towards interviewing surviving victims although it is far too early for that, explains Elkayam-Levy. The trauma is too deep.
“The most difficult part is when people start sending photographs of girls to my phone saying, ‘This is a picture of the girl before she died’. There is a difference between pieces of information coming in [about an atrocity] and then we start to get names [and identities] of those women and girls. We started to get pictures coming in of 21-year-old Girl Scout leader, and my daughter is in the Girl Scouts,” Elkayam-Levy says.
“Journalists ask me, ‘Should we tell the families [of victims] what we know?’ and I really hope, I really hope that families will not find out [the horror] of what was inflicted on their loved ones unless they want to know. We do not recommend anybody approaching families.”
There are plans to move beyond just documentation. “We are going to have a research unit that is able to communicate what we have in our archives and a global policy unit, because we already have 1,600 requests from academic institutions and human rights institutions wanting to support us and learn from us.” Fundraising is vital. Financial support is coming in from a variety of human rights organisations. On a very basic level, Elkayam-Levy needs to know her small children will be cared for in the coming months.
Since its inception, the commission has evolved into an official non-profit organisation with a small number of employed staff as well as a core team of dedicated volunteers in the fields of human rights and gender policy.
In the commission’s very early days, Elkayam-Levy understood that its non-partisan status was vital, even though not accepting government-backing made the workload heavier. Establishing the full picture will be a slow process; “months, years”, she says. Any survivors of the attack are deeply traumatised. Material collected by the commission, vital in establishing what happened, carries in its re-telling necessary trigger warnings.
There are eyewitness accounts of people hiding in bushes while girls and women were raped and shot in the head. There is evidence of a dead woman at the festival with rigor mortis, stripped from the waist down, legs spread apart, her body partly burned.
There has been testimony from a crying grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, who watched her granddaughter abused and murdered; testimonies of those retrieving victims with their heads cut off, teenagers found in puddles of blood, legs spread out, semen on their back with gun shot wounds to the back of their heads.
A couple tied together, clothes down, the woman clearly the victim of rape. And information emerging too from the Israel Defence Force interrogations of captured Hamas terrorists, who revealed they had manuals about how to rape, that the capture of children and babies was “to rape them” and of the women to “whore them, rape them, hurt them and interrogate them”.
“The footage I have seen… is something I can never unsee,” says Elkayam-Levy. “Any human who has seen these images will wake up with them in the morning and go to sleep with them at night. Some Hamas live videos were sent to the families of the victims using the victim’s own phones.”
“I feel this huge weight of responsibility on my shoulders. Not only do I want to represent the voices of the victims in the most respectful way possible, in ways that does them honour and brings justice for what they have suffered, but also that they will be our pledge for a really radical transformation in the international systems and one that ensures our children have the most functioning human rights system. I want to leave the next generation with a system that is able to protect human rights.”
On Nov 12, Elkayam-Levy gave her own testimony to the Maimonides Society, the Jewish Student Association of Harvard’s medicine and dental schools: “What we’ve seen in Israel were rape and gender-based crimes under clear orders and under full control. It was rape until death, rape as massacre, rape and crimes made to kill and torture women, using them and their bodies as an instrument to force exile of those communities in Israel. It was rape to be seen and heard by others – women’s and girls’ bodies used as spectacles of victory, trophies of war… Hamas might be now denying these war crimes, but during the attack and immediately after, Hamas and its terrorists released horrific visuals.”
Do you still teach? I ask her. She seems astounded by the question. “Wow. Wow. Thank you. Thank you for asking. Yesterday, I gave the first class of the semester,” she says. She pauses. “It was like going back to myself.”
It is such a basic question, but in Elkyam-Levy’s mission, in her total immersion in the horror in order to bring honour and some future change, there has been loss too: “I have lost control of my life in many ways,” she says quietly.
‘Secondary trauma’ has been identified as a risk, for those seeing the images, those dealing with the corpses. Some of the young female dentists volunteering in the morgues, for example, are handling the shards of teeth of women their own age. Many are like Elkayam-Levy, propelled by a calling, setting aside their own feelings, to be dealt with at a later date. Rabbi Haim Weisberg, working to identify the bodies, told the commission: “We see evidence of torture and savagery. We have babies with their heads cut off, bodies without hands, without legs, without genitals.”
The commission has ongoing challenges. A substantial one, Elkayam-Levy explains, is the use of artificial intelligence to create deep fake images. Such unstable ‘evidence’ might then be used to undermine the commission’s work by a subsequent revelation. The commission has already been contacted by people posing as being from the UN, needing help, “wanting to get information from us”.
“We are always super cautious with people approaching us with information. I am currently meeting with tech companies that have the ability to authenticate information and to help us in the process of checking, by establishing whether a video was AI modified. It’s such a complex task.”
The flow of information into the commission – with its attendant need to be verified – and the also very urgent need to provide an easy route for survivors to reach them is much on Elkayam-Levy’s mind.
“I will find a way,” she says. The death threats have prevented her from making the commission’s email address public. Information flows in, some very stable, some not. Sometimes information comes in, like a young woman’s identity, that completes the picture of a body in the morgue. Other times, new information complicates.
By way of example, she explains how the commission came to hear of the story, first through foreign media, of a pregnant woman, butchered, her baby cut from her stomach. “How can this be true?” Elkayam-Levy had thought. “And then we had a [testimony] from first responders who said they had found a slaughtered pregnant woman. And now we have been sent another piece of information that we [now] need to authenticate.”
It was a video of the slaughter. “It was the last piece of information.” Elkayam-Levy could not watch it. She asked an academic colleague to do it for her, and to make a written account. The woman was bound and gagged while she was alive, her stomach cut open, her male foetus removed and stabbed, her breast cut off while she was beaten.
“Within a few days we found out that this video might be from another place. So we have people saying, ‘This is fake. This is not true’. And I want to say I hope, with everybody else, that it is not true. It is an example of how cautious we are trying to be in dealing with this information. [But] it’s also important to make sure that people understand that even if one piece of information is not true, it does not mean that this did not happen.
“Usually, the more information we get, the truer it is. It’s not the other way round, unfortunately.
“But people are traumatised. Usually, with war trauma, the first six months are the worst. And after that there is a transition. We will see much more coming to the surface in the coming months. Specifically with sexually violent crimes, it could take decades. But I will not lose hope. I am committed to [documenting] the voices of all women in Israel.”

Moscow blamed Ukraine for the attack, while Kyiv denied responsibility.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that a market and shops in the city’s Kirovsky district were targeted with multiple launch rocket systems, with the shelling reportedly coming from the direction of Avdiivka. Kyiv “once again committed a barbaric terrorist act against the civilian population of Russia,” the Russian ministry said. “There are a large number of victims.”
CNN is unable to independently verify this claim.
Ukraine’s armed forces said they were not responsible for the shelling attacks. “The Russians are spreading [mis-]information about the strike on a market in Donetsk. We responsibly declare that the forces under the control of the Tavria military formation did not engage in combat operations in this case,” a statement on the Facebook page of the armed forces’ Tavria command said.
“Russia must be held accountable for the lives of the Ukrainians taken,” it added.
Russia has responded with outrage to previous Ukrainian attacks but has been responsible for thousands of civilians deaths following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russia’s Investigative Committee has launched an investigation and “all those involved and responsible for this and other terrorist attacks on our soil will suffer inevitable punishment,” the ministry said.
Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, said that the attack came on the busiest day of the week for the area and that search teams were looking for fragments of weapons.
At least 27 civilians were killed and at least 25 were injured in the area of a market and shops in the Kirovsky district of the city of Donetsk, Pushilin said in a Telegram post.
Another man was also killed on Sunday in another part of Donetsk city as a result of shelling, Pushilin said. Five additional people were wounded in the city and elsewhere in Russian-occupied parts of the region on Sunday, he said.
Residential buildings, a school and shops in different Russian-occupied parts of the region were also damaged, he said.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemned the deadly attacks on Russian-controlled parts of Donetsk region, a UN spokesperson said on Sunday.
“The Secretary-General strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today’s shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine,” the spokesperson said in a statement.
“Attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law, are unacceptable and must stop immediately,” the statement continued.
Donetsk is one of four Ukrainian regions that Moscow said in 2022 it would recognize as Russian territory – an annexation process which is illegal under international law.
The region, which is partially but not fully controlled by Russian forces, is on the frontline of fighting in the east.
The Donetsk attack comes with the frontlines of the war largely static.
Ukraine’s counteroffensive failed to deliver major gains and its troops are now under pressure from Russia at several points along the 1,000 kilometer-long frontline.
Kyiv’s troops have withdrawn from the village of Krokhmalne in the northeast of the country, close to the border between Kharkiv and Luhansk regions – with an army spokesman saying on Ukrainian TV that its troops’ position have been moved to “where it is more advantageous for them to destroy the enemy.”
In another indication of increasing Russian pressure, Ukraine’s military says it expects to see Russia’s forces step up operations around the embattled town of Avdiivka, as well as nearby Nevelske and Pervomaiske – which all lie to the immediate northwest of Donetsk city.
“The enemy is regrouping, and we are preparing for an increase in their activity,” a Ukrainian army spokesperson said.
In recent months, Avdiivka has become a focus of Russia’s fight, in much the same way that Bakhmut was in the first half of 2023. The Ukrainian army spokesman said Russia now had about 40,000 Russian personnel in the area.
In a separate development, a Ukrainian defense source told CNN that Ukraine carried out a drone attack on a Russian oil terminal about 100 kilometers (62 miles) west of Saint Petersburg, the latest example of Ukraine’s capacity to strike deep inside Russia.
A night-time video posted by Leningrad regional boss Alexander Drozdenko showed what appeared to be a significant fire at the Novatek facility in Ust-Luga, which sits on the Gulf of Finland. Later videos showed fire-fighters tackling the blaze. Authorities said there were no injuries.
According to Novatek’s website, the Ust-Luga complex sees the processing of liquified natural gas products into various types of fuel, including naptha, jet fuel, fuel oil and gasoil.
The Ukrainian defense source said the products are used to supply, among others, the Russian military, adding: “The successful attack on this facility will complicate the enemy’s logistics.” .
The attack comes three days after a Ukrainian intelligence source claimed another drone operation targeting the St. Petersburg region. “This is a new stage,” the source told CNN. “Our targets are military facilities and oil depots.”
Elsewhere, Ukraine also carried out drone strikes in the Tula, Smolensk and Belgorod regions.

DeSantis's withdrawal, after months of weakening support, leaves only low-polling Nikki Haley standing between Trump and nomination as the Republican Party's candidate for the US presidential election in November.
In a video message, DeSantis said that following his second place finish last week in the Iowa caucuses he could not ask ""supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.""
The decision came less than two days before the New Hampshire primary, where polls showed him far behind front-runner Trump and former UN ambassador Haley.
""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,"" DeSantis said, noting he has had differences with the former president, notably over the coronavirus pandemic.
""He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear or a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.""
Trump stormed to victory in Iowa last Tuesday, with 51 percent of Republican voters choosing the twice-impeached former president over DeSantis, who gained only 21 percent, and Haley at 19 percent.
No candidate has ever lost the race after claiming the first two states, and Trump would almost certainly declare the Republican nomination over with a win in New Hampshire.
His campaign said in a statement Sunday that he was ""honored"" by DeSantis' endorsement, and called for Republicans to rally behind him, dismissing Haley as ""the candidate of the globalists and Democrats.""
""It's time to choose wisely,"" the statement said.
In her own statement, Haley warned that the United States is ""not a country of coronations.""
""So far, only one state has voted. Half of its votes went to Donald Trump, and half did not ... Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road,"" she said.
- Once a rising star -
Many Republicans had pinned their hopes on DeSantis, who at just 45 was embraced by some as a rising star of the right.
But his candidacy, announced at the end of May, struggled to establish itself as a threat to 77-year-old Trump.
A former naval officer, DeSantis was elected in 2018 as governor in Florida after receiving Trump's valuable endorsement in the Republican primary.
Since then, he often distanced himself from Trump and gained notoriety for hard-right stances on education, immigration and LGBTQ issues.
His state management of the pandemic, pushing for a rapid reopening of the economy during then-president Trump's term and opposition to policies of President Joe Biden's administration, made him an instant hit.
He then sought a national platform, but appeared stiff and uneasy at candidate debates, media interviews and voter events.
""I'm glad that he's dropped out. I think that it was inevitable,"" Lynne Mason, 60, who runs a small business in Keene, New Hampshire, told AFP.
""We need a strong leader right now, with the state of the United States at this point.""
At an event in Seabrook, New Hampshire, Haley said DeSantis ""ran a great race, he's been a good governor, and we wish him well.""
""Having said that, it's now one fella and one lady,"" she continued. ""This comes down to 'what do you want?' Do you want more of the same or do you want something new?""
Having previously avoided direct invectives against Trump, Haley later leaned into the frontrunner, telling CNN she's ""not thin-skinned"" like him and that she views him and 81-year-old Biden as ""equally bad.""
""I don't think we need to have two 80-year-olds sitting in the White House ... we need to know they're at the top of their game.""

LTE8741JKR_35V3MUQG3VK1A2N,Home Secretary pushed to end jobs for migrants scheme by former cabinet ministers,Charles Hymas,"January 22, 2024 at 5:30 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/home-secretary-pushed-end-jobs-203023477.html,"James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, will face demands on Monday to scrap the right of asylum seekers, including Channel migrants, to work.
Two former Cabinet ministers and the New Conservatives group of MPs are calling for an end to the scheme under which asylum seekers can work in shortage occupation sectors including care, construction and agriculture if they have been waiting for their claims to be processed for more than a year.
They say it is providing a “pull factor” to encourage migrants to come to the UK, while also undercutting British workers as they are paid 80 per cent of the going rate.
It follows the disclosure by The Telegraph on Saturday that nearly 16,000 asylum seekers, including those who crossed the Channel in small boats, have been allowed to work in a single year, according to data obtained under Freedom of Information (FoI) laws.
David Davis, a former Brexit secretary and a former shadow home secretary, said: “It converts illegal migration - the worst sort of migration - into the second worst, which is migration that undercuts the pay of workers.
“It acts as an incentive for people to come here illegally. It’s clear that at least some of the individuals will send money home. That is as strong a telegraph for others to do the same as anything that I can think of.”
Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, said he believed the policy was wrong.
“I don’t agree that asylum seekers should work,” he said.
“There is a very long-standing policy that dates back to the Labour government in 2005 to allow people who’ve been here for years to work in certain occupations where there are supposedly shortages, but it just creates a pull factor to the UK.
“And almost everyone who comes here is either an economic migrant or a sort of asylum shopper, because they’re coming from safe countries like France and choosing to come to the UK because they think life is better here or a softer touch. And so I don’t think that’s the right approach.”
The New Conservatives group of about 20 MPs is writing to Mr Cleverly on Monday asking how the Home Office can justify such a “pull factor” for illegal migration and whether asylum seekers taking up jobs affects the likelihood of their asylum claim being successful.
“We cannot solve the significant problems associated with irregular migration unless we deter people from crossing to the UK illegally, and this is the opposite of a deterrent,” said Miriam Cates, co-chair of the group.
The FoI data show that 19,231 migrants applied for work permits in 2022 and 15,706 applications were granted. That represented nearly one-third of all the 51,000 asylum seekers in the one-year backlog of claims in 2022. Fewer than 5,000 were waiting more than a year in 2016.
The scheme allowing asylum seekers to take jobs after a year is a legacy of an EU law from 2005, which reversed a measure introduced by Sir Tony Blair in 2002 barring illegal migrants from any right to work.
The then-Labour leader instituted the crackdown to tackle a migration crisis similar to that being faced by the current Government.
Some ministers and immigration advisers have argued that the Government should consider going further in the opposite direction and follow some other European countries that allow asylum seekers to work after six months.
They have cited the potential economic benefits in boosting growth and savings from migrants no longer receiving state benefits and free accommodation and instead paying income tax on their earnings.
Peter Walsh, a senior researcher with the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, said he was surprised at the numbers granted, but suggested it could be linked to the widening of the shortage occupation list to include care workers, where there was acute demand for staff.
He said there were economic benefits in that it would reduce the cost of accommodation and asylum support as well as generating money for the Exchequer via taxes. “There are psychological positives because it is not very good for people to be out of the labour market,” he said.
“The longer people are out of the labour market, the harder it is for them to get back into the labour market. There is also another practical advantage that if you allow people to work legally, they are less likely to work illegally. It is potentially protecting against that.”
Government sources claimed there was no evidence that the prospect of working in a shortage occupation after a year in the UK was a “pull factor”.
They said in the past year the Government had cleared the “legacy” backlog of asylum cases pre-dating June 2022, apart from 4,500 “complex” applications, which would have reduced the number eligible to work.
A Home Office source also noted that the scheme had been introduced under Labour, but tightened by the coalition government, under Lord Cameron, to limit it to shortage occupations.
A Home Office spokesperson said: “Allowing individuals who have an asylum claim outstanding for more than a year to apply for jobs limited to the Shortage Occupation List strikes the balance between protecting taxpayer money and ensuring people are not incentivised to come to the UK illegally.
“Once employed the individual may have their taxpayer support withdrawn, whilst boosting the economy by addressing skills shortages.”

LUZUO22A1N_PVN6SCE94PC0VSF,Will New Hampshire primary see extreme weather like Iowa caucuses?,Andrew Wulfeck,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 9:57 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/hampshire-primary-approaches-less-extreme-004643362.html,"CONCORD, N.H. – Just over a week after Iowans faced record-cold temperatures to attend the first-in-the-nation caucuses, New Hampshire voters will head to precincts Tuesday and face the opposite side of the weather spectrum.
According to the FOX Forecast Center, warmer air will start to filter into the Granite State, but it will not preclude chances of ice or snow from being present on election day.
A storm system that created an ice storm in parts of the mid-South and Midwest on Monday could approach the Granite State before polls close on Tuesday, but any precipitation is expected to remain relatively light through most of the day.
""The cold weather suppressed turnout in Iowa, but I don’t think it changed any results,"" said Dr. David Richards, an associate professor and political chair at the University of Lynchburg in Virginia. ""They were pretty much in line with polling suggestions.""
According to the FOX Forecast Center, temperatures will be in the upper 30s for most of New Hampshire on Tuesday, with the possibility of snow showers in cities including Manchester, Concord and Lebanon.
Typically, turnout for primary contests in New Hampshire is at least double that of Iowa, so the forecast for what could be labeled as a reasonable weather day will likely contribute to higher turnout.
""I think a lot of people are going to show up,"" Richards said. ""Instead of at a caucus where you sit in a room and negotiate and take a couple of different votes through the evening – this will be just like voting in any election. You go there and vote, and the polls will be open all day.""
WEATHER CAN IMPACT VOTER TURNOUT
Past weather events may foreshadow what to expect for Tuesday’s Democratic and Republican presidential primaries.
New Hampshirites have never faced blizzard conditions on primary day, and that will remain the case for at least another four years.
In at least three-quarters of all the contests held since 1952, daily high temperatures in populated regions of the state have been at or above average. According to studies, warmer weather could have a role in voter turnout.
Research published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology found that some voting groups’ turnout increased by 0.14% for every 1.8-degree jump in temperature.
One location in the Granite State that won’t participate in any warmup is Mount Washington, which sits at some 6,288 feet above sea level.
The mountaintop is home to North America’s most extreme weather, with a reported wind chill of -108 degrees in 2023 and a 231-mph wind gust in 1934.
The mountain peak is not a home for any permanent residents and is about a half-hour drive outside the town of Gorham.
Gorham sits at an elevation of about 800 feet and is expecting a high near 30 degrees Tuesday, with isolated snow showers possible after sunset.
HOW TO WATCH FOX WEATHER
""Voters in New Hampshire take presidential elections very seriously, and that’s part of the reason the turnout could be as big as it will be,"" Richards said.
After New Hampshire, the next contests will be held in Nevada, the Virgin Islands and South Carolina, so chances are high that voters and candidates will face warmer weather than during the first two events.

The opossum is not a misunderstood critter. The diseases they carry harm a great deal of animals and people: leptospirosis tuberculosis, relapsing fever, tularemia, spotted fever, toxoplasmosis coccidious, trichomonasis and Chana’s diseases. They are usually infested with fleas, ticks, mites and lice. They also may carry rabies, and under no circumstances should a human touch one without protective equipment.
Opossums are known to play dead as a survival technique, but caution — they are not dead and can be very dangerous. They may help some to some degree eliminate bugs and small pests, but they themselves are pests. The opossum's feces and urine contain EPM which is a parasite that causes Sacocystis neurona which has caused many horses debilitating pain and the horse has to be euthanized or it will suffer pain, crippling and lameness and die. They are considered by most as nuisance pests.

The city of Dearborn has committed to having all city buildings run on 100% renewable energy by the end of 2026, making it the largest municipality in the state of Michigan to participate in DTE Energy's MIGreenPower program.
Not only will this have a positive environmental impact, but it will save taxpayers money as well. The average Michigan household uses 650 kilowatt hours of energy per month. By choosing to add 85% renewable energy by participating in MIGreenPower, a customer would save $1.85 per month. Since municipal buildings use more power, these savings would be significant.
All of this goes to show that, while change on the federal or state level can be difficult, it is very possible on the local level and can create a snowball effect. If Dearborn is up to the task of running on all renewable energy by 2026, there is no doubt in my mind that other cities are as well, especially if their residents speak up and write to their city council members.

Kidney failure is not a death sentence. With the right healthcare, Americans on dialysis can live energetic, productive lives. Unfortunately, paying for dialysis in America has become a Herculean task. Medicare only covers 80%, and the remaining 20% can cost thousands per year. Private insurance usually covers the first 30 months of dialysis before patients’ transition, by law, to Medicare.
However, a Supreme Court decision last year could allow private insurance companies to deny certain treatments to dialysis patients and deplete their coverage during that period. I urge Congress to pass legislation amending the Medicare Secondary Payer Act and securing coverage for dialysis patients in that 30-month period. Members of Congress should put themselves in our shoes and imagine what it’s like to begin dialysis without sufficient financial resources.

It’s no surprise that greenhouse gas emissions are giving Earth a fever. We all suffer, but health impacts are especially dire for Michigan’s estimated 70,000 migrant farmworkers — and other outdoor workers, including those who “fix our damn roads.” They face temporary dehydration, heat strokes, accelerated rates of chronic kidney disease and mental health issues beginning with irritability and evolving into anxiety and depression.
To incentivize a shift away from a fossil-fueled energy economy, we should add a fee to fossil fuels, returning the funds to families in a monthly payment. We’ll need to strengthen the grid so energy from renewable sources can be integrated — and speed up the permitting process for energy transmission infrastructure projects, integrating impacted communities in the approval process from the earliest stages. All this is possible when we let our legislators know we want them to focus on the real problems.

Several wooden buildings, including saloons, went up in flames on Main Street at the Pullman City amusement park in Eging am See, in Bavaria, police said on Sunday.
The cause of the fire was not immediately known, and no injuries were reported. The guests of a nearby hotel were taken to a safer location.
Pullman City, which fashions itself on the horseback-riding cowboys of the 19th-century American West, covers around 200,000 square metres in Eging am See.
""The fire was discovered by employees at around 6 am,"" said a police spokeswoman. ""They tried to put it out with a fire extinguisher. But that didn't work.""
As of 9 am (0800 GMT), the fire was still burning.
According to the website, a family day was planned on Sunday featuring magic and light shows. Depending on the weather, pony rides were also supposed to be on offer.
The police spokeswoman did not think Pullman City would open on Sunday. Park officials were unable to be reached by telephone."
LYDJG67XFM_AJQ0KAQCUCRPIPY,Churchill plotted from Western Front trenches to oust First World War PM Herbert Asquith,Craig Simpson,"January 22, 2024 at 6:21 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/churchill-plotted-western-front-trenches-212133086.html,"Winston Churchill plotted from the trenches on the Western Front to oust Herbert Asquith, the First World War prime minister, from power, unpublished letters show.
The future British premier served as an Army officer in 1916 when he was frozen out of government following the fiasco of the Gallipoli campaign he had spearheaded.
However, he conspired in politics, sending a series of letters to a prominent minister urging the removal and replacement at the head of government of Herbert Asquith.
His intrigues worked and the eventual toppling of Asquith paved the way for the premiership of David Lloyd George, and Churchill’s own return to government.
The unpublished correspondence from Britain’s wartime leader to Sir Edward Carson, the Irish unionist minister and power-broker, is to be sold for an estimated £60,000.
In a letter sent in 1916, Churchill complains of the “ill-starred coalition” governing the country and managing the war, adding:  “Shall we ever make a comprehensive plan? Asquith’s failure is not lack of decision, but lack of design.
“On that all turns, and the helplessness of gallant effort at the front is pathetic.”
He insisted, foreshadowing his own determination in the Second World War, that Britain needed a government ready to win the war at “any expense”, and urged the removal of Asquith.
In one letter, he writes: “Any arrangement [that] succeeded the Asquith regime must be between you & Lloyd George. I trust you will keep in touch with me.”
Churchill had recently resigned from his position as First Lord of the Admiralty following the failure of the Gallipoli campaign, and sought to atone by joining the ranks on the Western Front.
He was given command of a battalion of the 6th Royal Scots Fusiliers and often ventured into no man’s land wearing his preferred French-issue helmet.
It was while in France that he corresponded with Sir Edward, whose Unionists were the effective opposition to Liberal Asquith’s wartime coalition.
His efforts at the end of 1916, the year in which he wrote to Churchill, helped topple Asquith and bring about the leadership of Lloyd George, who promptly brought him and Churchill back into government.
The First World War letters of Churchill are being sold by Peter Harrington Rare Books in New York, in a rare sale of Churchillain treasures, which has already seen proofs of the Churchill’s literary work The Second World War sell for £600,000.
Along with largely unpublished letters, the writing desk Churchill used to pen his historically significant memoir of the Second World War, and his Nobel Prize winning History of the English-Speaking Peoples, is being offered for sale.
Experts have noted what they believe to be cigar burns on the desk’s leather surface.
The desk was installed at his home at Hyde Park Gate, and was kept in a converted downstairs office Churchill used as a bedroom, and in which he died in 1965.

M1AF1XVH8T_OUE1QHS3PWGHY71,Larry Sabato: Haley attacks on Trump ‘too little too late’,Filip Timotija,"January 21, 2024 at 1:23 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/larry-sabato-haley-attacks-trump-042316702.html,"Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said that former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley’s (R) attacks on former President Trump came too late for it to potentially make a difference in the GOP primary.
During his appearance on CNN Saturday night, Sabato said that Haley’s diggs against Trump were long overdue and noted that the only other candidate in the Republican field who took on Trump directly was former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who dropped out of the race two weeks ago.
“It is definitely too little too late,” Sabato said, referencing Haley’s recent digs at Trump, including her questioning Trump’s mental fitness when he appeared to mix her up with former House Speaker Nanci Pelosi (D-Calif.) when talking about the Jan. 6 attack during a rally Friday.
“Chris Christie is the only Republican candidate running for president, no longer running now, but in the campaign, he was the only one who really took out after Trump,” Sabato said.
He noted that even with Christie’s approach, all other Republican candidates, including Haley, have a difficult job distinguishing themselves from the former president while still being able to gather enough support to secure the party’s nomination.
“Of course, he’s no longer in the campaign, which tells you the very difficult situation that all of these candidates, including Nikki Haley, found themselves in,” Sabato said. “This is the MAGA party. This is the Donald Trump party and so to get the nomination against Donald Trump, you have to somehow convince people that Trump is no longer up to the job or can’t win in November, but not offended so much that they won’t vote for you. And it’s a near impossibility.”
Sabato’s analysis comes after Trump won the Iowa Caucuses by over 50 points and is bringing that momentum to New Hampshire, where he is looking to win the first-in-the-nation primary on Jan. 23.
The editor-in-chief of the “Crystal Ball,” a nonpartisan political analysis newsletter, cautioned that New Hampshire is “different” and that it might be one place where Haley, who has slowly climbed up in the polls, might be able to pull “an upset” victory.
“We know New Hampshire is very different,” Sabato said. “It’s the one place where someone like Haley might be able to pull an upset —might — but it isn’t looking like it yet,” he added.
Trump is currently leading in the Granite State with 46.7 percent, outpacing second-placed Haley by 11.4 percent. The former South Carolina governor has 35.3 percent, far ahead of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) who is at 5.8 percent, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ aggregate of polls.
“There are times when they [New Hampshire voters] will shock everybody, you never know for sure until you see the votes coming in there,” Sabato concluded.

M39QE98PY0_CVGAE9TTHDJMVT3,Editorial: Brandon Johnson’s upcoming CTU negotiation should scare taxpayers. Will he surprise us with tough love for his friends?,"The Editorial Board, Chicago Tribune","January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/editorial-brandon-johnson-upcoming-ctu-110000208.html,"When Chicago elected Brandon Johnson mayor last year, most knew they were taking a chance on one of the least experienced candidates ever to lead the city.
They also knew which special interest was most responsible for his unlikely victory. In bankrolling the Johnson campaign and putting its formidable organizing muscle to work, the Chicago Teachers Union could be described as the city’s most potent political force today. The new Machine, you might say.
Having propelled a former member and former CTU lobbyist into the city’s highest office, the timing couldn’t be better for the union. The teachers contract expires at the end of this school year. One of the biggest jobs of 2024 for Johnson and his team will be the negotiation of a new pact that recognizes the fiscal realities facing CPS — and Chicago.
The mayor doesn’t represent CTU anymore. He represents the city’s beleaguered taxpayers. Does he understand that? It won’t be long before we find out.
More than half of the property tax bill residents and businesses pay goes to Chicago Public Schools. CPS consistently raises its tax levy by the maximum amount allowed every year.
And, still, the school system faces a daunting monetary cliff beginning next fiscal year, which starts July 1, as federal pandemic-related assistance runs its course. The deficit that will have to be plugged in the next fiscal year will approach $400 million — and that’s before any increased expenses stemming from the new contract.
We believe that, given Johnson’s extraordinarily close ties to the union and CTU President Stacy Davis Gates personally, he ought to fully recuse himself from this coming negotiation. Good governance demands nothing less. Any reasonable person can see that Johnson has an irrefutable conflict of interest.
He shows no signs of doing so. We’ll assume he takes a leadership role in the talks — and ends up the final decision-maker on any proposed contract.
Before we go on, a reminder of why this is so problematic. Prior to becoming mayor, Johnson was a lobbyist for CTU in addition to serving as a Cook County commissioner. The union paid him tens of thousands each year.
Davis Gates remains one of Johnson’s closest political allies. She’s part of his inner circle and a regular political adviser.
In what universe would any taxpayer be comfortable being “represented” at the bargaining table by someone so compromised?
That said, we think this contract represents an opportunity for the mayor.
The mayor’s administration thus far has struggled to gain its footing on a host of issues (e.g., migrant crisis) and shown questionable decision-making skills (e.g., the now-abandoned migrant tent camp on toxic land, barring the public from City Council chambers before reversing course). He certainly hasn’t reassured those who voted against him, or even voted reluctantly for him, that he can be a mayor for the entire city rather than just the interests who financed his run.
What better way to turn around that narrative than to tell his friends in CTU the city must live within its means and there’s not a bottomless well of resources to finance their wish list?
Among urban public school teachers, Chicago’s are among the best compensated in the country. The CPS budget over the past five years has increased 28% to $9.4 billion from $7.4 billion. Total outlays for salaries have climbed about a third in that time. Few private sector professionals have been so lucky.
This is despite sharply falling enrollment. CPS students numbered just over 400,000 a decade ago. The total in fiscal 2023 was less than 322,000, a 20% decline. That’s even as the overall population in Chicago was more or less stable over that period.
Yes, the influx of migrants is adding to demand for public schools. But the overarching trends are strikingly and dismayingly clear. More parents with choices are opting to educate their kids outside of CPS.
They include Davis Gates herself, who sends one of her children to a Catholic school and had the audacity when that bombshell news broke in September to disparage essentially all of the CPS high school options on the South Side. That was just two weeks after she responded this way to South Side Weekly in response to a question about whether she was concerned about “school-choice and privatization supporters” running for seats on the Chicago School Board: “Yes, we are concerned about the encroachment of fascists in Chicago.”
If the union had its way and did away with selective enrollment and charter schools, only parents like Davis Gates, who could afford it, would have a choice other than traditional CPS. We wouldn’t call that “fascist” because that term shouldn’t be thrown around. We would call it overly prescriptive — and hypocritical for the leader of the city’s most politically potent union.
The CPS budgetary and enrollment trend lines scream for better allocation of resources. Like it or not, they cry out, too, for a more efficient — and likely scaled-down — physical footprint. No one wants their neighborhood school closed. But, until CPS provides a more attractive option for parents, those are the hard realities it has to face.
Recent changes to state law will give the union the legal right to bargain over a wider array of issues than before, including class sizes and the hiring of nurses and other adjunct staff. Johnson will be handed a long list of demands, no doubt. He’d better get comfortable quickly with telling his friends they can’t have everything on that list — or even a majority of it.
Unfortunately, the tea leaves are there for everyone to read. Johnson’s deal last year with the Chicago police union included pay raises that doubled what the union already agreed to previously for 2024 and 2025. If Johnson was so generous with the police union, which endorsed his opponent in the election, how will he treat his CTU besties?

M5FX8CMBOH_TWFNSNDE0EF0WQT,Mass migration has been a disaster for Britain. It’s time to cut the numbers,Sam Ashworth-Hayes,"January 21, 2024 at 4:00 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/mass-migration-disaster-britain-time-070000268.html,"Whenever it’s suggested that Britain could manage without importing 1.2 million people every year, out come the usual voices with the usual lines.
The NHS would collapse overnight, care homes would go unstaffed, our best universities would implode into a financial black hole, the ravens would leave the Tower of London and the last trumpet would sound as Britain sank slowly, gracelessly into the frigid waters of the North Sea.
This is scaremongering. Britain would be fine with massively reduced immigration; the only thing standing in the way is the Government.
Let’s start with the NHS. 2022, it hired some 12,148 foreign doctors. Over the 2022-23 financial year, they were joined by an additional 24,000 nurses. You could cut the numbers arriving by over a million before touching this tiny group. The health service is not a barrier to reform.
Even if it was, we could work around it. Every year, hundreds of qualified students are turned away from medical school due to the Government capping places. This has left Britain significantly more reliant on overseas staff than its peers, and hasn’t necessarily increased quality, either.
Doctors trained overseas are significantly more likely to face serious complaints than their domestic counterparts, and it is notable that the countries providing the most – Nigeria, Pakistan, and India – have two universities in the top 500 worldwide between them, compared to 54 in Britain. We might find it worth looking at what’s obstructing supply at home.
The university sector, on the other hand, does rely on funding from overseas students. It’s not hard to work out why; frozen domestic tuition fees have seen their real value fall £3,000 per student. Fees for foreign students, meanwhile, are uncapped.
The result has been an explosion in student visas, driven by huge numbers from poor countries attending the least selective, cheapest universities. These institutions are not selling education; they’re selling the right to work on the post-study visa.
Nobody is suggesting that the likes of Oxford, Cambridge or Imperial should be forced to turn away talented students. But at the lower end of the scale, we should either raise fee caps, or let failed institutions fail. Allowing what amounts to a backdoor work visa fee is absurd.
The social care sector, too, could probably function without massive immigration. It’s true that large numbers are recruited from overseas - 101,000 last year. But this isn’t because British workers aren’t capable of doing the job. It’s because it doesn’t pay enough. The median care home worker earned just £10.11 an hour in March. Aldi and Lidl pay £11.40, and Amazon warehouses around £13. It’s no wonder people are leaving.
The primary issue, again, is the government. Local authorities are responsible for publicly funded care; their real terms budgets have fallen 29 per cent between 2010 and 2022. The Treasury could dig into its pockets, and let wages rise. It wouldn’t cost that much; the full time equivalent social care workforce is about 1.2 million people, so giving every single worker a £2/hour pay rise would cost about £5 billion. The net cost would be even less if we could shift some of the 5 million on out of work benefits into employment.
Rather than do this, the Government is bringing in people willing to work for less. This looks great in the short run; the Chancellor can stand at the despatch box and promise tax cuts, with the OBR dutifully plugging in fancifully low spending assumptions for the larger population.
The problem is that it’s a ponzi scheme. People on care visas are eventually eligible for permanent residency, and free to work elsewhere, requiring more migrants to replace them. Meanwhile, studies have shown time and time again that these low skilled, non-EU workers almost inevitably turn out to be a long run fiscal drain.
But by the time those costs show up, the politicians have moved on and the mess is someone else’s to fix. It’s a pattern repeated from sector to sector. Britain deserves better than this reliance on immigration to cover the government’s incompetence.

M9IPXREZQC_5JQA34N9EV8AY0C,"Thirty years after quietly vanishing, an original Pioneer Press Treasure Hunt bronze medallion resurfaced. That’s only the start of the mystery.","Jared Kaufman, Pioneer Press","January 21, 2024 at 8:09 PM·7 min read",20230121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/thirty-years-quietly-vanishing-original-110900254.html,"They say the identities of the Pioneer Press Treasure Hunt clue writers are the best-kept secret in St. Paul.
But tracking down the life stories of the medallions those writers hid during the hunt’s early decades has proven to be nearly as intractable — and has led to a historic reunion for the Pioneer Press.
Earlier this month, an item believed to be an original treasure hunt medallion that was hidden in a majority of hunts between 1958 and 1987 popped up for sale on eBay. The initial asking price? $66,000.
And on Jan. 16, former Pioneer Press promotions manager Diane Moser, who helped run the treasure hunt for nearly two decades between the 1970s and 1990s, donated another original medallion back to the Pioneer Press as a result of this reporting. This may be the first time in 25 or more years that the Pioneer Press is officially in possession of any of the six original bronze treasure hunt medallions.
“I saw this and just about fell off my chair,” said Bill Gough, about the eBay listing. Gough found the hidden medallion as a college student in 1977, and he never expected to see the coin again after handing it over to the paper in exchange for a $1,500 prize, he said.
Comparing nicks and blemishes on the eBay medallion to an archival photo, both Gough and devoted treasure hunter Jake Ingebrigtson, who have met with the seller’s representative and have seen the medallion in person, are all but certain it’s the exact coin that was unearthed in a cigar box at Irvine Park 47 years ago.
A representative for the anonymous seller said the medallion had been purchased by someone in Texas approximately a decade ago, for $10, at a flea market there. That person then gave the medallion to the seller as a gift. The representative said neither he, the seller, nor the person in Texas knows how the medallion ended up there.
The representative declined to make the seller available for an interview, and the Pioneer Press was unable to independently identify the seller. Both the seller and his representative live in or near St. Paul, though neither is particularly familiar with the treasure hunt. This reporter met with the representative and examined the medallion in person in January.
The eBay listing has raised a similar question among treasure hunters and newspaper employees alike: Wait — the Pioneer Press is not still in possession of our original medallions? Where’d they all go?
No, evidently, we’re not. And we don’t exactly know.
Until now. Sort of.
Unraveling the medallion mystery feels like a wintertime treasure hunt in itself.
The St. Paul Dispatch started the treasure hunt in 1952 by hiding a slip of paper in a small wooden toy chest. They did not commission medallions until a few years later, once the hunt had proven its popularity.
In 1958, the paper’s promotions illustrator Roman Baltes sketched out a design, which hunt organizer Marshall Genshow gave to the now-defunct Carnes Stamp Co. There, as metalworker Frank Martin explained in the documentary “No Time for Cold Feet,” he cast six medallions: Five, he delivered to the newspaper, and one, he kept for himself.
The medallions were in use until 1987, when hunt organizers switched from bronze to plastic medallions to stop hunters from using metal detectors, treasure hunt historian Jesse Anibas said. And winners were expected to immediately return the metal token to the newspaper, so it could be reused the next year. While modern plastic medallions are occasionally given as gifts to clue writers and hunt winners, the original set of five medallions was not intended to leave the Pioneer Press’ ownership.
However, the medallions appear to have all vanished by at least the mid-1990s, according to conversations with more than a dozen former Pioneer Press employees, many of whom were either directly involved with or adjacent to the treasure hunt.
So what happened?
In the mid-1970s, the treasure hunt’s early leaders, Marshall and Ethel Genshow and Bob and Yvonne Momsen, passed the responsibility of hiding the medallion and writing cryptic clues to a new group of leaders: Bill Schneider and Jack and Diane Moser. Each of them except Diane Moser has since passed away. Others involved in hunts past, like Jim Ragsdale, have also died.
By that changing of the guard, Diane Moser believes the Pioneer Press only had two medallions left, she said. In fact, Moser was surprised to learn just this month that the metalworker said five medallions — not two — had initially been given to the paper. How those three medallions went missing much earlier remains unclear.
When Jack Moser retired in 1990, he took home a ‘backup’ metal medallion that hadn’t actually been hidden in several decades, Diane Moser said. It’s not unexpected, former staff recalled, that committed employees would keep obsolete newspaper memorabilia.
This is the medallion that Diane Moser elected to give to the Pioneer Press.
The second medallion in the newspaper’s hands during the Moser era was the primary one, which she said was used for at least every hunt under her purview until 1987, if not many more before her. This would therefore be the coin Gough found in 1977, which he believes is the same medallion as is currently listed on eBay.
As for the others: Ingebrigtson, a longtime hunter and two-time finder, owns a medallion he believes to be a third original one. Gough said a friend owns what could be the fourth; that person did not agree to an interview. The fifth medallion’s whereabouts remain unknown. The sixth medallion was kept by Martin, as the metalworker attested in a notarized 2006 affidavit reviewed by the Pioneer Press. It still remains with the family, as confirmed by a close relative who requested their privacy be protected.
When Diane Moser retired in 1991, she left the primary medallion in her desk drawer so it could stay with the paper. But a series of shorter-tenured staffers subsequently took over Moser’s desk, said former research director Jeanine Pearson, who worked at the paper from 1977 to 2012. If any of them noticed the medallion — or kept it — they didn’t speak up, she said.
As promotions department leadership changed somewhat frequently in the early to mid-’90s, the coordination of the hunt’s logistics was a bit unstable, former employees said. By the time the late columnist Don Boxmeyer and architecture critic Larry Millett were tapped to write clues in 1994, the medallion was likely gone.
“I don’t recall ever seeing it,” said Millett, who hid the medallion with Boxmeyer until 2001 and retired in 2002. “That’s not to say it wasn’t there, but I don’t recall seeing it. But newspapers aren’t very good at hanging on to stuff. It’s not our strong suit.”
Current treasure hunt coordinator Lori Swanson said she’s not aware of any bronze medallions being in the Pioneer Press’ hands during her tenure, which began in 2000. She does possess what she understands to be a set of letterpress blocks that match the bronze medallion’s design.
Besides the medallion’s murky disappearance, how it ended up making a surprise reappearance some 20 years later in Texas is also still a mystery.
Many longstanding or senior employees across nearly all departments in the 1990s have each said they do not remember seeing the medallion nor hearing discussions about where it went. Kathy Boxmeyer, Don Boxmeyer’s widow, said she doesn’t believe her husband knew the whereabouts of any metal medallions when he was running the hunt, either.
As of Jan. 20, the medallion’s listing on eBay is still active, and offers are being considered.
As the seller’s representative learned more about the treasure hunt and got to know Ingebrigtson and Gough, he became convinced the medallion should stay in St. Paul. He persuaded the seller to entertain lower offers in order that the medallion might be sold to someone local, rather than going to a high-rolling collector on the other side of the globe.
The representative and the seller are currently evaluating a credible offer for $10,000, he said.
“It’s important to stay here. It’s too meaningful to the city,” he said.
And to fill in the missing details of the whereabouts of the other medallions, former Pioneer Press research director Pearson tossed out one final idea with a laugh:
“Do you know any good mediums?”

Carlos Alvarez/Getty
Crown Princess Mary of Denmark is about to make royal history.
Queen Margrethe of Denmark shockingly announced on New Year's Eve that she will step down as monarch on Jan. 14. Her eldest son, Crown Prince Frederik, will become King Frederik X, making his wife, Crown Princess Mary, his queen consort who will be known as Queen Mary.
While there have been famous Queen Marys in the past, this one will have a distinct first as the only queen consort to have been born in Australia.
Born Mary Donaldson, the soon-to-be Danish queen was an Australian advertising executive before a chance encounter changed her life. She found herself chatting to Prince Frederik, although he introduced himself simply as ""Fred,"" at the Slip Inn on Sydney's Darling Harbor in September 2000. The pub was filled with people from around the world who were in town for the Olympics.
""Something clicked,"" Crown Princess Mary said in a 2005 interview. ""It wasn't the fireworks in the sky or anything like that, but there was a sense of excitement.""

Shortly into their conversation, Mary found out that she was talking to the Crown Prince of Denmark, heir to the 1,000-year-old Danish throne.
""The first time we met, we shook hands,"" she said of their introduction. ""I didn't know he was the prince of Denmark. Half an hour later, someone came up to me and said, 'Do you know who these people are?' ""
For a year, the pair got to know each other through a long-distance relationship that flew under the radar of the media.
""She got to know and love Frederik as the man he is, not as the Crown Prince,"" Mary's friend Chris Meehan later told the authors of Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark.
In 2002, Mary moved to Copenhagen, converted to the Lutheran Church and learned Danish, a notoriously tricky language to master. The couple announced their engagement in 2003 and married the following year at Copenhagen Cathedral.
Crown Princess Mary's father, John, walked her down the aisle in a Scottish kilt. Mary's parents were Scottish but moved to Australia before her birth — and while she spent most of her life in Australia, she also lived in Texas for a short time during her childhood!
Crown Princess Mary, 51, and Crown Prince Frederik, 55, now have four children.

Unlike King Charles last year, King Frederik and Queen Mary will not be crowned in a coronation service. Instead, a proclamation of the new reign will be made at Christiansborg Palace on Jan. 14. According to Royal Central, the prime minister has proclaimed each new monarch on the balcony of the Danish palace since the early 1900s.
Queen Margrethe, 83, was announced as monarch in a similar proclamation on Jan. 14, 1972, following the death of her father, King Frederik IX. This month's change of reign will come on the 52nd anniversary of her accession. But since Queen Margrethe abdicated and the change of reign didn't come as a result of a death, it will be a much happier occasion.
Queen Margrethe cited health concerns in her New Year's speech where she announced her abdication.
""In February this year, I underwent extensive back surgery. Everything went well, thanks to the competent health personnel, who took care of me. Inevitably, the operation gave cause to thoughts about the future – whether now would be an appropriate time to pass on the responsibility to the next generation,"" she said, per an English translation of the official speech transcription. ""I have decided that now is the right time. On 14 January 2024, 52 years after I succeeded my beloved father, I will step down as Queen of Denmark. I leave the throne to my son Crown Prince Frederik.""

There is speculation that the unexpected move came to bolster Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary’s bond amid gossip of an affair. In November 2023, reports swirled that Frederik was having an affair with Mexican-born socialite Geneveva Casanova after they were photographed together in Madrid. Casanova denied allegations of a romantic relationship with Frederik, and the royal couple continued to display a united front in recent months.

Author and royal commentator Phil Dampier spoke to The Telegraph about Queen Margrethe's surprise decision.
“It’s possible that the Queen took this action because she would have been terrified of the marriage breaking up and the royal family losing Mary. It would have caused major problems. The Queen has always seen Mary as a tremendous asset,” Dampier said.
“It just seems an extraordinary coincidence that she should make this unexpected announcement just a couple of months after stories emerged of the Crown Prince supposedly having an affair,” the author added. “In two weeks’ time, the prince and princess will be pitched together as king and queen and they will have to get on with it. The Queen may be thinking that they will patch up their differences and it will save their marriage.”

I grew up in a proudly Southern Italian/Sicilian pocket of New York where seemingly everybody’s family had their own passed-down recipe for tomato sauce. Contrary to what the domestic icon Ina Garten says, store-bought was not fine.
Today, ready-to-heat sauces — particularly by restaurants — are all the rage, thanks, in part, to spots like Rao’s and Carbone’s in New York. But decades before the nation went wild over these internet-famous, critically acclaimed sauces, my native suburb was quietly buying up glass jars by another NYC original. I’m talking about Vincent’s Clam Bar, first of Little Italy and now best known as a local gem in nearby Long Island.
Its greatness begins with a colorful back story. According to co-owner of the now-classic Long Island restaurant, Anthony Marisi, the original Vincent’s Clam Bar established in 1904 was “a street cart selling clams, scungilli, mussels, and calamari with mild, medium, and hot [tomato] sauce.”
“That’s all they did!” he says. And boy did they do it exceptionally well. This simple menu was enough to convert the cart into “a little corner space on Mott and Hester Streets;” 10 locations followed, including a small one in Carle Place, NY.
Decades later, Marisi (a server at the time), his brother, and a few fellow servers “begged, borrowed, and stole” to buy the restaurant from the “interesting characters” who owned it. That scrappy wiseguy-turned-gentleman braggadocio (they didn’t have managers and continued to wait tables) is still the core of the business today. It’s widely considered one of the most lauded and beloved Italian restaurants on the island, synonymous with celebration and huge family-style portions, enormous desserts, and LI accents heavier than a loaded lasagna.
Available for sale since the late 1970s, Vincent’s Clam Bar was one of the earliest restaurants to offer customers a jarred taste of its restaurant and, as Marisi puts it, “way ahead of its time.” The mild, medium, and hot tomato sauces are different from its — or any other brand’s — classic marinara and its own chunky (and even more outstanding) tomato basil sauce.
Vincent’s Clam Bar’s signature sauces are more reddish orange than crimson, and because they’re tomato paste-based, have a smokier, sun-dried tomato sweetness to them. They’re smooth, silky, and concentrated — more like a taste bud-coating, satiny tomato gravy, Marisi confirms; the better to cover and cling to seafood, as they were intended to.
You won’t find chunks of tomatoes or visible herbs in the original trio as you will in Vincent’s other, more traditional plum tomato-based sauces. What you will find is a smooth, subtle heat that discreetly comes in at the back of the bite, thanks to a process where red pepper flakes are sauteed in oil and gradually layered in increments.
Because of this, it has its own specific flavor profile and texture that’s gained a loyal following for those in the know.
The most obvious way is to drench mussels, scungilli, clams, and calamari in it, whether individually or all together as a frutti di mare — how Vincent’s originally intended. This can be with or without pasta, which is the second-most obvious way to use this sauce. (I suggest bronze-cut like Barilla’s ultra-textured Al Bronzo Mezzi Rigatoni.) Picky kids love the mild for its sweetness and lack of surprises.
I also literally beef it up with Pound of Ground beef crumbles or use thin-skinned cheese-stuffed pastas like Woodstock Organic Four Cheese Tortellini for a no-thaw meal in minutes. (Bonus: It also brings out the umami in the sauce.) For something lighter, fresh egg-based pasta and zoodles or spaghetti squash work, too.
I add it to soups and veggies, and spoon it over frozen pizzas to give them more oomph and up the tomato factor. Because of its consistency, I can also use it to dip mozzarella sticks, garlic bread, pizza rolls, or chicken tenders. It’s also heavenly in an Eggs in Purgatory brunch.Buy: Vincent’s Medium Tomato Sauce, starting at $4.99 for 16 ounces at LaMonica Fine Foods, plus Uncle Giuseppe’s, North Shore Farms, King Kullen, Stop & Shop, ShopRite and other regional grocers; also available in bulk at Amazon and at Vincent’s Clam BarWhat’s your favorite jarred tomato sauce brand?

The level of death, destruction and displacement from the war already is without precedent in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Yet Israeli officials say the fighting is likely to continue for several more months.
The slow progress and the plight of the hostages held in Gaza has divided ordinary Israelis and their leaders even as the offensive threatens to ignite a wider war involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that support the Palestinians.
The United States, which has provided essential diplomatic and military support for the offensive, has had limited success in persuading Israel to adopt military tactics that put civilians at less risk and to facilitate the delivery of more humanitarian aid. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has rejected U.S. and international calls for postwar plans that would include a path to Palestinian statehood.
The war began with Hamas’ surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, during which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostages back to Gaza.
Israel responded with a blistering three-week air campaign and then a ground invasion into northern Gaza. Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation.
Israel continues to carry out airstrikes throughout the besieged territory, including areas in the south where it told civilians to seek refuge. Many Palestinians have ignored evacuation orders, saying nowhere feels safe.
Since the war started, a total of 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, while another 62,681 have been wounded, the Health Ministry reported Sunday. The death toll included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza’s hospitals since Saturday, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said. Another 300 people were wounded in the past day, he said.
The overall toll is thought to be even higher because many casualties remain buried under the rubble from Israeli strikes or in areas where medics cannot reach them, Al-Qidra said.
The Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures but says around two-thirds of the people killed in Gaza were women and minors.
The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but its casualty figures from previous wars were largely consistent with those of U.N. agencies and even the Israeli military.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense neighborhoods, often near homes, schools or mosques.
The military says 195 of its soldiers have been killed since the start of the Gaza offensive.
The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza’s residents from their homes, with hundreds of thousands packing into U.N.-run shelters and tent camps in the southern part of the tiny coastal enclave. U.N. officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as only a trickle of humanitarian aid reaches them because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions.
Netanyahu has vowed to keep up the offensive until Israel achieves “complete victory” over Hamas and returns all the remaining hostages. But even some top Israeli officials have begun to acknowledge that those goals might be mutually exclusive.
Hamas is believed to be holding the captives in tunnels deep underground and using them as shields for its top leaders. Israel has only managed to rescue one hostage since the war began, and Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations.
A member of Israel’s War Cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, said last week that the only way to free the remaining hostages was through a cease-fire. In an implicit criticism of Netanyahu, he said claims to the contrary amounted to “illusions.”
Hamas has said it will not free more hostages until Israel ends its offensive. The group also is expected to make any further releases conditional on securing freedom for thousands of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, including high-profile militants involved in attacks that killed Israelis.
Israel’s government has ruled that out for now, but it faces rising pressure from families of the hostages, who are pushing for another exchange, and from Israelis frustrated by the security failures that preceded the Oct. 7 attack and by Netanyahu’s handling of the war.
Thousands of people gathered in Tel Aviv over the weekend to call for new elections.
Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners are meanwhile pushing him to step up the offensive, with some calling for the “voluntary” emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from the territory in 2005, two years before Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces."
MG9KFJIZ6Q_R7JIHHT6TAVAXML,Huckabee Sanders hints she’s not interested in being Trump’s VP,Sarah Fortinsky,"January 22, 2024 at 2:28 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/huckabee-sanders-hints-she-not-172853954.html,"Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R) on Sunday suggested she is not interested in being vetted as former President Trump’s vice presidential pick.
In an interview on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” Sanders said she preferred to stay in her current role.
“Look, I absolutely love the job I have. I think it’s one of the best jobs I could ever ask for, and I am honored to serve as governor, and I hope I get to do it for the next seven years,” Sanders said, suggesting she would not want to leave the job early to run with Trump.
Sanders served as Trump’s press secretary and has been a consistent backer of the former president, praising his time in office and defending him against criticism. She endorsed Trump’s current bid in November 2023.
Some in Trump’s inner orbit have predicted Trump is likely to pick a woman to serve as vice president, and Sanders’s name has come up as a possibility.
Trump more recently has signaled he’s already decided whom he would pick but has so far refrained from providing detail into who they might be.
Trump has recently garnered support from many prominent GOP politicians. On Friday, he secured an endorsement from Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), who suspended his own presidential campaign, which had emphasized a message of hope and positivity.
Scott on Sunday left the door open to being Trump’s vice presidential pick when asked in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” saying, “The only thing I want is four more years of Donald Trump and a Republican majority in the Senate, a majority in the House and the White House.”
“That’s what I really want,” Scott continued. “And if I can help achieve that through my endorsement by being on the campaign trail in my home state of South Carolina for the next four or five weeks, and then beyond, that’s the goal.”

MGRWE9BMEB_OUU7E8UKGDNIDHE,McDonald’s brings back beloved Strawberry & Crème Pie for a limited time as fans rejoice: ‘These are so good!’,Fox Business,"January 21, 2024 at 12:56 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/mcdonald-brings-back-beloved-strawberry-035610890.html,"McDonald’s customers should be prepared to leave room for dessert on their next visit to the Golden Arches.
Now that the holidays are over, McDonald’s has said goodbye to its seasonal McDonald’s Holiday Pie — but the fast food chain is bringing back a fan favorite treat to replace it.
For a limited time, the Strawberry & Crème Pie is back on the menu at participating restaurants, McDonald’s USA confirmed to FOX Business.
“Start the year off sweet at McDonald’s with the return of the Strawberry & Crème Pie! This tasty treat is made with strawberries and vanilla flavored crème and baked side by side in a sugar-coated flaky crust,” a McDonald’s spokesperson said.
“The Strawberry & Crème Pie is a regional menu offering currently available at participating locations for a limited time while supplies last in markets including, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City and more,” the company said.
McDonald’s baked Apple Pie is a menu staple, although some fans wish the pies were still fried instead of baked. Its strawberry cousin swaps out the apple filling for a mix of strawberry and sweet crème that some customers say is superior.
The return of McDonald’s delightful strawberry snack was first publicized by snackolator on Instagram last week.
“These are rolling out now to replace the Holiday Pies and have popped up in a bunch of markets already and are one of the limited time favorites,” the snack-centric account posted on Jan. 10.
The news was enthusiastically welcomed by excited users on social media.
“These smack so hard y’all can’t tell me NOTHING,” one person commented on snackolator’s post.
“These are so good!!!” another Instagram user wrote.
McDonald’s first introduced the Strawberry & Crème Pie in 2012 and it was available nationally until 2014. The fast food chain brought it back briefly in 2022 but only in the spring or winter and only at select locations, according to AllRecipes.com.
Unfortunately, the limited edition pie won’t be available at every McDonald’s location. Customers can check the McDonald’s app to see if the Strawberry & Crème Pie is at a restaurant near them.
Though McDonald’s will offer special limited items from time to time, the company’s strongest sales come from core menu items like the Big Mac and Egg McMuffin.
During the company’s third-quarter earnings call in October, McDonald’s CFO Ian Borden said the company’s strategy focuses on emphasizing its core menu items at an affordable price point.
“The D123 Everyday Value Menu in the U.S. takes a similar approach to affordable bundles with nationally promoted products at locally relevant price points. The platform features products such as the McDouble or four-piece McNuggets. With a bundle offered at each day part, customers can visit McDonald’s for an affordable meal no matter the time of day,’ Borden said.
“And while prices have evolved over time, the featured products have remained the same, providing customers with their familiar favorites from our core menu,” he added. “This consistency in our value offerings means customers know exactly what to expect every time they visit us, driving our strong position as the affordability leader in the market.”"
MHIKGCD0DS_EOLI7DTZ28DH02Z,Much of US still gripped by arctic weather as Memphis deals with numerous broken water pipes,TRAVIS LOLLER,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 4:56 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/much-us-still-gripped-arctic-163320811.html,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Subfreezing conditions and treacherous roadways have contributed to dozens of deaths this month across the U.S., where states as far south as Texas and Florida remain gripped by deadly arctic weather Sunday. But the numbing cold is expected to ease up in the coming days.
Nationally, winter storms have claimed at least 72 lives around the U.S. this January, many involving hypothermia or road accidents.
On Sunday, crews in Memphis, Tennessee, continued to work around the clock to find and fix broken pipes that were causing low water pressure throughout the system. Memphis Light, Gas and Water President and CEO Doug McGowen told reporters Sunday afternoon that crews are making progress and he expects most of the 700,000 people the utility services to have water restored over the next 24 hours.
“If we remain on this very positive path, and we are on a positive path, I believe that by Wednesday we will have pressure sufficient for us to take samples of our water system,” he said. “Assuming good results, we think that means a Thursday for lifting of the boil water advisory.”
McGowen also asked people to stop dripping their faucets to help build pressure in the system.
Memphis Light, Gas and Water was repairing 10 water main breaks on Sunday afternoon, and McGowen said he expects to see more as the ground continues to thaw. The utility said it previously repaired 41 broken water mains and located more than 4,000 leaks at homes and businesses.
Rhodes College, in Memphis, began sending students living there home on Saturday and moving those who could not return home to hotels. The school was planning virtual classes on Monday and Tuesday.
“We ask that you NOT come to campus either day due to the ongoing water situation and the hazards that creates,” the school announcement said.
Sam Roth is a junior majoring in politics, philosophy and economics who drove back home to Nashville rather than staying in a hotel where he would still be required to boil water.
“Our faucets stopped working, and they said not to use any of the restrooms on our floor, and our showers were not working very well either,” he said of the situation in his dormitory.
Restaurants and bars were using bottled water to serve customers on Sunday. Some restaurants remained closed, citing the water issue, while others had a modified menu.
Memphis was the largest, but not the only, water system in Tennessee to experience problems from the unusually cold weather. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said on Saturday night that 28 water systems have issued boil water notices.
In Tipton County, the fire department in Mason warned residents on Saturday to be prepared for a multiday water outage. Fire officials said in a Facebook post that water crews were working at all hours to try to isolate and repair leaks.
The mayor acknowledged in an interview with WMC-TV that the town has had water issues in the past due to a system that “nobody took care of for a long time” and is need of updates.
“The whole town has been without water for five days,” said exasperated Mason resident Christina Ray. The fire department is handing out water throughout the town of 1,300 residents, but is limiting it to one case per day, per household. That’s not enough for her family, which was collecting snow to flush the toilets.
“It’s hard to cook. It’s hard to flush toilets. It’s hard to do dishes. We can’t wash laundry,” she said.
With warmer temperatures predicted this week, Ray now says she's faced with another worry: the potential of bursting pipes.
The continued cold weather is also responsible for at least 27 deaths in Tennessee, according to the Tennessee Department of Health.
Just south in Mississippi, the state's Emergency Management Agency said Sunday that 11 people have died of causes related to frigid weather since Jan. 14.
Elsewhere, freezing rain, sleet and high wind gusts later Sunday would make traveling in parts of Kansas and Oklahoma particularly treacherous, the National Weather Service said. Wind chills in Iowa made it feel like minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 7 degrees Celsius) in some parts.
But the end of subzero temperatures — which blasted into the U.S. on Friday — was in sight for parts of the country. The daily high temperatures in Iowa’s capital of Des Moines, for example, were expected to stay above freezing starting Monday.
“With no additional replenishment of arctic air from Canada, a steady warm-up is in store for the mid-section of the country,” the weather service said.
In western New York, Buffalo Bills fans were getting ready for another home playoff game Sunday evening against the Kansas City Chiefs, with temperatures forecast around 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 7 degrees Celsius), winds around 10 mph (16 kph) and a slight chance of snow showers. On Friday and Saturday, hundreds of people showed up at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park to help shovel snow out of the stands for the second week in a row, earning $20 an hour.
The Erie County Sheriff’s Office was urging fans Sunday to not throw snowballs in the stadium or trespass on the new stadium construction site.
In Vermont, temperatures in the single digits to low teens didn’t stop ice anglers and snowmobilers from their sport, and young ski jumpers braved the cold as they competed in northern New Hampshire. But 23 skiers and snowboarders had to be rescued in frigid temperatures on Saturday after becoming lost in the backcountry in Killington, Vermont, police said.
On the West Coast, more freezing rain was forecast in the Columbia River Gorge and the area was expected to remain near or below freezing through at least Sunday night. Trees and power lines already coated with ice could topple if they get more, the National Weather Service warned.
“Stay safe out there over the next several days as our region tries to thaw out,” the weather service said. “Chunks of falling ice will remain a hazard as well.”
Heavy rain forecast for Southern California on Sunday and Monday prompted the Los Angeles County Office of Emergency Management to issue an evacuation warning near Topanga Canyon effective through Tuesday morning due to possible mud or debris flows.
The Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service reported possible rain totals up to 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) and up to 2.5 inches (6.3 centimeters) across the area's foothills through Monday night.

Former journalist Ian Bailey, 66, who was originally from Manchester, died after he collapsed at home in west Cork on Sunday.
He had a severe heart condition and had been a candidate for surgery.
His solicitor Frank Buttimer, who has known Bailey since March 1997, said he was ""very upset"" to hear of his death.
""I knew Ian was very unwell. We were in communication in the past five days, but I didn't know he was terminally unwell,"" he told the PA news agency.
Ms Toscan du Plantier's badly beaten body was discovered by neighbours in a laneway near her holiday home in Schull, County Cork, on 23 December 1996.
Nobody has ever been charged in Ireland in connection with the 39-year-old's death.
Bailey, who lived two miles away, was twice arrested for questioning by gardaí (Irish police) but released without charge.
The murder, and subsequent investigation, has received significant media attention in the years following Ms Toscan du Plantier's death, becoming a notorious and protracted case of unsolved murder.
In May 2019, a court in Paris convicted Bailey in absentia for the murder. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
He denied any involvement in Ms Toscan du Plantier's murder and, as he was not present in court for the French proceedings, he could not appeal the verdict.
Ireland's High Court blocked his extradition to France, where the law allows suspects to be tried for murdering French citizens abroad, on multiple occasions."

Paul Choate, 41, has received a citation for petty theft for stealing more than 200 printed copies of the Ouray County Plaindealer from a dozen racks in the area, the newspaper said in an online article Saturday.
""Someone didn't like this edition of the Ouray County Plaindealer,"" co-publisher Mike Wiggins said on social media on Thursday, the day the thefts occurred. ""Guess which article.""
The newspaper had reported the account of a 17-year-old girl in the town of Ouray who said she was raped more than once at the home of the town's chief of police, Jeff Wood. Three suspects were arrested for her alleged rape, including the chief's stepson Nate Dieffenderffer.
""So they stole nearly every newspaper out of our racks in Ouray County. If you hoped to silence or intimidate us, you failed miserably,"" Wiggins said Thursday. ""We'll find out who did this. And another press run is imminent.""
In its online article, the newspaper reported that investigators tracked Choate down using surveillance footage. He owns the restaurant Kate's Place in the nearby town of Ridgway.
Choate reportedly admitted he took the newspapers because of the front-page story. The newspaper reported that it was not disclosing Choate's relationship to the sexual assault case and that the theft was not tied to the defendants in that case, their families or the local police department."

Asa Hutchinson endorsed Nikki Haley on Saturday, days before she tries to take on frontrunner Donald Trump in the New Hampshire primary.
Hutchinson is a conservative whose opposition to Trump became central in his longshot bid for the GOP primary before he dropped out Tuesday.
In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Hutchinson said: “Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years. Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so.”
Hutchinson added: “Go @NikkiHaley in New Hampshire.”
Haley's campaign did not immediately return a message seeking comment.
After finishing third in the leadoff contest in Iowa earlier this month, Haley has been looking to appeal to independent and unaffiliated voters in New Hampshire's Jan. 23 primary to garner a strong finish and turn the race against Trump into a two-person contest.
Hutchinson dropped out after finishing sixth in the caucuses.
His backing comes a day after another of their former rivals in the GOP presidential contest, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, endorsed Trump. Another former candidate, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has also backed Trump.
Haley last weekend won the support of former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who had fueled speculation that he was preparing for his own third-party bid.

MPNPI6FADD_XFDR4A4GSSA4LQ7,Irish elites are much less nice than they think they are,Zoe Strimpel,"January 21, 2024 at 4:00 PM·2 min read",20240114,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/irish-elites-much-less-nice-070000723.html,"Last time I wrote about Ireland, I said its performance as a newly progressive and wholesome nation was undermined with a rotten, IRA-era stance on Israel-Palestine, and I received the worst abuse of my life.
Unfortunately, however, the picture has only darkened, with Ireland under Leo Varadkar continuing a long tradition of troubling political allegiances. Last week he elaborated on comments that had been reported by Chinese state media as showing Irish support for a forced reunification of democratic Taiwan with the mainland. “Our long-standing policy hasn’t changed,” he said, “and it is a one-China policy, and we recognise China, and that Taiwan is part of China.” Pictures showed Varadkar laughing and smiling with Chinese premier Li Qiang during a state visit.
In this context, “one-China” is not quite as bald a call for reunification as it sounds – it is diplomatic term used by the US and the EU to reassure China that it only has formal relations with the mainland, not with Taiwan, even if there are ‘robust’ informal relations with Taiwan, as in America’s case. Nonetheless, ‘one-China’ is not a position most leaders enjoy proclaiming and Varadkar’s comments drew embarrassment and ire. Some of his more sensible countryfolk were understandably horrified that he appeared to be choosing obsequiousness to a nasty communist dictatorship – widely seen as one of the great threats to the West – over the integrity of defending, or at the very least, acknowledging Taiwan.
Ireland isn’t the only country to panic at the prospect of losing out on business with China, and fired by a desperation to keep the country sweet. But that doesn’t make it OK, and all the less so in a country that has imbibed the rhetoric and gestures of progressiveness – including draconian censorship of non-woke speech. Whether cosying up to China or vilifying Israel, Irish elites are much less nice than they think they are.

MQD99A0M3O_JC1MNDLG4GWPVHO,"100 years after his death, Russians shrug at Lenin's legacy",AFP,"January 21, 2024 at 3:37 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/100-years-death-russians-shrug-063709471.html,"For almost a century after his death, Vladimir Lenin's carefully preserved body has lain in a purpose-built mausoleum on Red Square -- a glaring reminder of Russia's communist past.
But the father of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution that founded the Soviet Union -- and the 100th anniversary of his passing -- have largely been ignored by ordinary Russians.
Few official events have been scheduled to mark the centenary on Sunday, beyond a Communist Party ceremony at his tomb in the shadow of the Kremlin.
For President Vladimir Putin, who has publicly chided Lenin for his supposed role in dividing the Russian Empire into nation states like Ukraine, this is convenient.
Putin, now mired in an almost two year assault against Kyiv, has instead championed Joseph Stalin -- the man who led the USSR to victory in World War II, and who purged all his political opponents in a years-long reign of terror.
- Tourist attraction -
When Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov (Lenin) died on 21 January 1924, Soviet authorities at the behest of Stalin began embalming his body and building a mausoleum.
The red and black polished stone temple has stood at the heart of Red Square since October 1930, and briefly housed Stalin's remains until 1961.
Huge crowds of people queued to pay their respects to Lenin in Soviet times, but today, ceremonies honouring the revolutionary are attended mainly by those nostalgic for the communist era, flags and red carnations in hand.
His embalmed body has become, primarily, a tourist attraction. Once every 18 months, the mausoleum is closed to allow scientists to re-embalm his body and repair the damage caused by time.
Only 23 percent of Lenin's body remains intact, housed in a glass sarcophagus at a constant temperature of 16 degrees Celsius, the TASS state news agency has reported.
Since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, a debate about whether to close the mausoleum and bury his body has regularly cropped up in Russian media.
But the proposal has been met with fierce resistance from communists and has never seriously been considered by the authorities.
- Putin, Lenin and Ukraine -
Putin rarely mentions Lenin. So his attack on the instigator of the October Revolution, days before ordering his troops into Ukraine on 24 February 2022, was notable.
In a vitriolic speech questioning Ukraine's statehood three days before the attack, the Kremlin leader accused Lenin of having ""invented"" Ukraine when he founded the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).
By giving the Soviet republics a degree of autonomy, Putin argued, Lenin allowed the emergence of nationalism and the eventual implosion of the USSR.
""It was because of Bolshevik policy that the Soviet Ukraine came into being, which (one) would be perfectly justified to call Lenin's Ukraine,"" Putin raged.
""He is its inventor, its architect,"" he continued.
""And now,"" Putin said, ""grateful descendants have torn down Lenin's monuments in Ukraine.""
But Lenin has not been completely erased. His likeness still dominates many city centres in Russia, even though most of the statues were removed when the USSR collapsed.
In Moscow, a 22-metre (72-foot) Lenin monument still looms over Kaluga Square. In Ulan-Ude, in Eastern Siberia, a head of the revolutionary stands on a pedestal 14 metres high.
And in Antarctica, at the Pole of Inaccessibility, there remains a bust of Lenin outside a defunct Soviet research station -- now mostly buried in the snow.
- Kremlin 'needs a Stalin' -
Of all the Soviet leaders, it is Stalin that the Kremlin chief refers to most often -- not to denounce his appalling record of repression, but to praise the statesman and wartime leader who defeated Adolf Hitler's Germany.
Putin has always sought to frame his military campaign against Ukraine through the lens of World War II, comparing Ukrainian authorities to the Nazis and presenting the conflict as an existential struggle for Russia's survival.
For the Kremlin, Stalin remains a model of victory and power, while Lenin is a loser.
""The current leadership needs Stalin because he is both a villain and a hero,"" Alexei Levinson, a sociologist at the independent Levada institute, told AFP.
""He won the war, so all his atrocities are erased,"" he said.
In contrast, Lenin's achievements have been undone or never materialised, he explained.
""Lenin is the leader of the world revolution -- it never happened. Lenin is the leader of the world proletariat -- it doesn't exist. Lenin is the creator of the socialist state -- it is no more,"" he said.
""And no-one wants to build it anymore either.""

""Obviously, that's something that we take very seriously,"" Shapps told the Sky News channel.
Counter-terrorism bodies and other institutions would ""be  looking very carefully at that"", he said.
UK counter-terrorism chief Matt Jukes said Friday that the espionage threat from foreign states -– such as China, Russia and Iran –- is greater now than it has been  ""since the days of the cold war"".
He said the police had set up a new unit to counter the threats of interference ahead of the election, which is expected to be called later this year.
The unit would use powers granted by the National Security Act passed in July to  make it harder for countries to spy and interfere in the political process, he said.
""We are talking about parts of the state apparatus of Iran, China and Russia,"" Jukes said.
A report by US software company Microsoft in November last year said Russia, Iran and China were likely to engage in sophisticated influence and interference efforts ahead of the 2024 US presidential election and in other pivotal elections worldwide.
All three countries were expected to seek to shape geopolitical outcomes in their favour amid major ongoing or potential regional conflicts, the report said.
Interference efforts were  likely to take place on different online platforms than those targeted in elections in 2016 and 2020.
The counter-terrorism chief also warned that conflict in the Middle East had led to a surge in Islamist activity and that the United Kingdom was facing ""a radicalisation moment"".
He said there had been a 25 percent increase in information flowing through police systems about terrorism and violent extremism, ""a significant increase"" on ""usual levels"".
""We always see spikes after terrorist incidents but what we've seen since October 7 has been a spike which is higher and more sustained than ever before,"" Jukes said in comments to local media.

MSJHATUI8X_3UZMXH9415TH3M9,‘Abbott Elementary’ — does it hold the secret for network sitcom success?,Meg Walter,"January 21, 2024 at 1:06 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/abbott-elementary-does-hold-secret-040623744.html,"Quinta Brunson just won an Emmy for her role as an earnest elementary school teacher in the ABC sitcom “Abbott Elementary.” Her colleagues Tyler James Williams (who plays a fellow teacher and Janine’s love interest) and Janelle James (who plays the self-absorbed principal) were also nominees, as well as Sheryl Lee Ralph, nominated for her role as a wise kindergarten teacher.
“Abbott Elementary” was also nominated for the “outstanding comedy” award. It was the only network program nominated in the category.
There has been much hand-wringing in the past few years over the future of network television as consumers increasingly move to streaming platforms, where many programs are original series that are produced by the platforms and have never aired on legacy networks.
For example, “The Bear” — which won the Emmy for outstanding comedy series — is exclusive to Hulu.
I know many people who watch that show, as well as “Barry,” “Jury Duty,” “Only Murders In The Building,” “Ted Lasso,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and “Wednesday,” all nominees in the outstanding comedy category, and all exclusive to their given platforms.
However, I don’t know anyone who is watching sitcoms on network television right now other than “Abbott Elementary.”
“Abbott Elementary” seems to be the only network comedy currently airing that is finding any success, both critically and in ratings. In its second season, the series averaged 9.1 million viewers an episode, according to Nielsen ratings — up 12% percent over its first season and up 30% for viewers ages 18-49.
It leads one to wonder what Brunson — the creator, producer and star of “Abbott Elementary” — and her team are doing differently than their network peers.
These things are hard to pinpoint exactly. If every showrunner knew the secret to success, every pilot would be a hit. As with most things, there is no perfect formula for creating a comedy series, and there is no telling what the public will respond to. But “Abbott Elementary” does have a few notable things going for it.

Quinta Brunson went from BuzzFeed writer to an Emmy nominee
The faux-documentary format that “Abbott Elementary” employs is well-trod territory with shows like “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation,” but not so well-trod as to feel stale. It’s a formula that works well for exploring a character’s inner dialogues, which in the case of “Abbott Elementary” adds to the deadpan delivery of many of its best jokes. And the story of a group of teachers in an underfunded inner-city school is not one I’ve seen before.
The show pokes plenty of fun at the cliches surrounding public education in major cities but is never too sharp-elbowed. It addresses the challenges of public education but does so with a lot of hope, humor and heart. At its center is a group of teachers who are committed to their profession and to the success of their students. Even the most incompetent and selfish character — Ava — does what’s best for her school and students whenever she can. The show manages to highlight the hard work of the people in one of society’s most undervalued and underappreciated professions without being patronizing. It’s refreshingly optimistic in a media landscape often populated with messages of despair and nihilism.
The series is also accessible and appropriate for almost anyone. My parents watch “Abbott Elementary.” My daughter watches “Abbott Elementary.” I feel comfortable watching the show with them. And I feel comfortable recommending the show to anyone of any age.
Perhaps most importantly, the show is deeply funny. Each of the main characters has their own delightful quirks. A young, white teacher named Jacob is the walking embodiment of an antiracist Instagram infographic. Melissa, played by Lisa Ann Walter, often alludes to her family’s possible criminal activity. Barbara can’t keep celebrities’ names straight. Ava knows nothing about education and everything about TikTok trends.
The third season premieres on Feb. 7 after a delay due to the writers strike. It’s worth noting that last season, most viewers of the show watched it through streaming. The future of network sitcoms as a whole remains unclear. But the success of “Abbott Elementary” shows that great comedy is great comedy, whether it airs on legacy television, Hulu or elsewhere, and that there’s always an audience for a show with hope, humor and heart.
The first season of “Abbott Elementary” can be seen on Hulu or Max; the second season is only on Hulu. People with cable subscriptions can also check streaming options through their cable provider. The series has a TV-PG rating and contains some adult language."

NWS meteorologists warned that streets and roads in low-lying areas could remain inundated with water and ice. Flooding levels hovered at 9.9 feet Sunday morning but had previously hit more than 13 feet.
“We’re not necessarily seeing water levels significantly drop or recede right now,” said meteorologist David King.
On Wednesday, officials announced a disaster declaration in unincorporated Will County and Wilmington. Water levels exceeded previous extreme flooding events in 2021, 2019 and 1985, according to a news release.
“Our team will remain on the ground with local officials to monitor conditions until the ice fully melts,” Allison Anderson, the director of the county’s Emergency Management Agency, said in a statement.
Will County officials also said Thursday that Dresden Energy Center, a nuclear power plant in Morris, would activate siphons to release warm water into the river. The siphons could help accelerate the melting process and alleviate flooding.
“By opening all three lines of warm water into the river, we can begin melting the historic levels of ice that has created a public safety risk for nearby residents,” County Executive Jennifer Bertino-Tarrant said in a statement. “This is a crucial step to safeguard lives and protect property in communities along the river.”
The most significant ice jam appeared to be located upstream of the Grundy-Will county line near Wilmington, according to the weather service. An additional ice jam is located in Kankakee County near the village of Sun River Terrace, King said.
Residents along the river, particularly in low-lying areas, are advised to be prepared to evacuate until the ice jams fully clear. It’s still unclear how long the flood warnings and ice jams will remain in place, especially because it’s difficult to estimate the depth of ice, King said.
“Through the course of the week, we might have high temperatures in the low 40s which will help it,” King said. “But for the foreseeable future, we expect it to remain in place.”

The CDC said that the recall had been expanded to include all lots of the ""Busseto Foods Charcuterie Sampler"" sold at Sam's Club which originally saw one lot code recalled and added all lots of ""Fratelli Beretta brand Antipasto Gran Beretta"" sold at Costco.
The CDC announced that the outbreak saw 23 new illnesses and five new hospitalizations, bringing the totals up to 47 and 10 respectively across 22 states. The Center warned that these numbers are likely undercounts.
The illnesses linked to the Fratelli Beretta brand were discovered by the Washington State Department of Health.
The CDC recommends that all packages of the affected products should be thrown away and that any surfaces that have come into contact with the package be washed with hot water and soap.
CDC investigators are investigating any further items that could be affected by the recall. Currently the recall covers:
Busseto brand Charcuterie Sampler
Has prosciutto, sweet soppressata, and dry coppa
Sold at Sam’s Club
Comes in a twin-pack (2 x 9oz)
Any lot code
Fratelli Beretta brand Antipasto Gran Beretta
Has black pepper coated dry salami, Italian dry salami, dry coppa, and prosciutto
Sold at Costco
Comes in a twin-pack (2 x 12oz)
Any lot code
Salmonella is a bacteria that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems, according to the FDA. The signs of salmonella poisoning include:
Bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that lasts more than three days without improving
Diarrhea and fever over 102 degrees Fahrenheit
Excessive vomiting, especially if it prevents you from keeping liquids down
Signs of dehydration, including dry mouth and throat, infrequent peeing and feeling dizzy when standing up
Stomach cramps
These symptoms most commonly occur between six hours and six days after exposure. Though most people recover in four to seven days, those with weakened immune systems, including children younger than 5 and adults over 65, may experience more severe symptoms that require medical treatment or hospitalization.

MVWAUU5L22_SUG7H1O6D7CBX43,"Biden exhausting abortion actions, but sees prime target in Trump",Joseph Choi,"January 22, 2024 at 4:00 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-exhausting-abortion-actions-sees-190000406.html,"President Biden and Democrats want to make abortion a signature issue of the 2024 election, but the White House is exhausting its already limited powers on reproductive rights.
With few tools to protect abortion access at the federal level, Biden and his party are ramping up warnings about a national abortion ban if Republicans return to the White House and win control of the House and Senate.
On Friday, the Biden-Harris campaign doubled down on abortion as a key election issue, tying the end of Roe v. Wade directly to former President Trump, the likely GOP nominee.
“When Americans go to the polls on Election Day this November, they will go knowing that the fate of every American woman’s freedom to make her own health care decisions is on the line,” campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a memo.
“They will also know that the horrific alternative — the chaos, confusion, and uncertainty women whose rights have been ripped away are experiencing right now — falls squarely at the feet of Donald J. Trump.”
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra spoke with reporters this week about the administration’s efforts on abortion, ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s ruling that effectively guaranteed abortion rights.
He highlighted recent administration efforts to confront the country’s maternal health crisis, which disproportionately impacts Black women, but avoided specifics when asked what other avenues the White House was looking at to expand abortion access.
“We continue to work on any opportunities we have through the existing authorities that Congress has given us,” Becerra said, noting recent efforts to support maternal health in the U.S.
“But in terms of any additional regulatory authorities, we continue to explore that, and we continue to defend all that we currently have,” he added.
Experts said the perception that Biden is running low in his arsenal of new actions could be partly due to the barrage of actions after the Dobbs decision in 2022.
“I think that they have done what they can to kind of keep this issue central to the work across HHS and other agencies as well,” said Alina Salganicoff, KFF senior vice president and the director of the Women’s Health Policy Program.
“With the current restrictions, to do a very broad, meaningful change in terms of abortion access, it’s extremely challenging on the federal level,” Salganicoff said.
However, Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, told The Hill that more can always be done to support abortion access.
One step is finalizing the many proposed rules that federal agencies have put forth. Among the proposed rules she believes should be finalized is an HHS-proposed rule to modify HIPAA standards regarding protected health information on reproductive health care.
These rules, however, have faced intense legal pushback from anti-abortion groups and legislatures.
The Biden administration has also taken on the fight in courts, trying to exert federal authority to protect access to abortion pills and lifesaving abortion care at the state level.
The federal government is currently engaged in a legal battle to uphold the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which protects doctors who provide emergency, lifesaving abortion care.
The Supreme Court recently ruled that Idaho could continue enforcing its abortion ban, though the government argues it violates EMTALA.
The Department of Justice has also asked the Supreme Court to end a challenge that could limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone, which has been used widely for decades.
Outside of rules and legal battles, Friedrich-Karnik said the president’s annual budget was another opportunity to send a strong signal in support of abortion access — though the GOP majority in the House would block any provisions.
Republicans have regularly used spending bills to send the opposite message, such as adding abortion restrictions to must-pass spending bills such as the annual National Defense Authorization Act.
Friedrich-Karnik warned of a “treasure trove” of methods that the anti-abortion movement could use in attempt to further restrict reproductive health access.
Salganicoff said the Comstock Act of 1873 could become a focus of future efforts, since it makes it illegal to send “immoral” or “indecent” items through the mail, which originally included items having to do with contraception or abortion.
Roe prevented the Comstock Act from being used to block contraception and abortion materials from being mailed, but now that Roe’s been overturned, Salganicoff said the old law is back in play.
“If we were to have a different administration … it’s possible that they could decide to use whatever. Even a law that’s so antiquated could be revived and enforced,” said Salganicoff.
As the calendar turns to 2024, Vice President Harris has taken a leading role in sounding the alarm over the future of abortion access — if voters don’t elect Democrats. During an appearance on “The View” this week, she said she was “scared as heck” about a second Trump term in the White House and sounded a dire warning about abortion.
“Many of us often think about the future of our country in the context of our children, and so they talk about their concern that if their daughter is going to college, will she go to a state where she will have access to the health care she might need including reproductive health,” Harris said.
“So many of us actually grew up when Roe was intact, and we would absolutely say, ‘We must protect it, a woman’s right to choose.’ But we kind of believed it was always going to be there. And look what happened,” she said. “And I say that in the context of this democracy also. Don’t take anything for granted.”

MY0SZ6RAYP_3BBINSCMSBDCT75,Parents buy suspect's car to investigate daughter's mysterious death,"Guest Author, Michael Loftus","Updated January 22, 2024 at 2:01 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/parents-buy-suspects-car-investigate-172400646.html,"Cayley Mandadi was a 19-year-old sophomore at Trinity University when she arrived at a hospital in Texas on Oct. 29, 2017. She was nearly naked, bruised and not breathing. Her sometime boyfriend Mark Howerton told doctors they'd taken ecstasy at a music festival, and she passed out after consensual sex in his car. She died at the hospital.
Mandadi's mother Alison Steele and stepfather Lawrence Baitland believed something far more sinister happened and set out to prove it. ""48 Hours"" correspondent Peter Van Sant reports on the case in ""For the Love of Cayley Mandadi"" now streaming on Paramount+.
At 4 a.m. on Oct. 30, 2017, Mandadi's parents woke up to an alarming phone call. They were told Cayley had been life-flighted to Kyle, Texas and had been involved in an incident.
They raced from their home in Houston to the hospital. ""I saw my daughter's body smashed,"" Steele recalled. Mandadi was unconscious and covered with bruises. The doctor told them there was no hope for recovery.
On Oct. 31, Mandadi was taken off life support. Steele and Baitland gave their final goodbyes before Mandadi was taken into surgery for organ donation.
The medical examiner ruled that Mandadi died from blunt force face and head trauma and ruled her death a homicide. Howerton was charged with her murder.
Howerton maintained his innocence and in December 2019 his trial began. Prosecutors alleged that Howerton beat Mandadi in his car, causing a fatal brain bleed.
Howerton's defense attorney, John Hunter, said Howerton did not cause Mandadi's injuries. He argued that her injuries were caused by resuscitation efforts by hospital staff and medical complications from taking MDMA.
After 10 hours of deliberations, the jury could not reach a verdict and the judge declared a mistrial.
While prosecutors planned to retry Howerton, Steele and Baitland decided the jury needed more information about what happened to their daughter inside Mandadi's car. Steele, a scientist, and Baitland, a NASA engineer, got to work.
""We are not prosecutors, we are not medical doctors, but we know people who have those skills and maybe we could develop a way to crowdsource some answers into this thing. And so that's what we did,"" Steele told ""48 Hours."" ""We started making phone calls, we started making inquiries.""
Steele said they were overwhelmed with offers from experts, including medical doctors, forensic scientists and even a medicolegal death investigator to help them examine evidence in Mandadi's case. They got all the evidence they could.
""What we did was to take that evidence and to make sense of it in a way that was not done in the first trial,"" Steele said.
The couple focused their attention on one autopsy photo showing a bruise in the shape of a small dot above Mandadi's right ear, and on another photo showing a larger bruise above her left ear. Steele says they landed on a theory that Mandadi's fatal injury took place when Howerton ""reached from his driver's seat, hit her in the left ear and drove her head into the window and onto the lock button of the car."" Now they had to prove it.
So they went to a used car lot where Baitland took photos of Steele posing in a car similar to the Mercedes Howerton drove the night Mandadi was fatally injured.
Baitland told ""48 Hours"" he ""photographed [Steele's] head in different positions while … holding the autopsy images, trying to see if they match up with the door and it's a near perfect match.""
Encouraged by their findings, Baitland used a software program to construct a 3D model of Mandadi's head. He layered in photos of Mandadi and the autopsy photo showing that dot above Mandadi's right ear. He used a measurement from Mandadi's eyeglasses to help determine the size of the 3D head. Baitland then consulted a biomechanical expert in injury causation who examined the evidence and Baitland's research and supported his theory.
""So this gave me the confidence to go to the next step, which was to seek out [Mark Howerton's] car,"" Baitland said.
Baitland tracked down the Mercedes that Howerton sold in 2018. ""I … reached out to some friends on social media who were … on an automotive forum and they were able to look up the VIN number of [the] car for me,"" he said.
At first, the new owner was hesitant to sell Baitland the car, but after learning about Mandadi's story, he agreed. Baitland said driving the car home was ""torturous"" but necessary for their investigation. ""We had to have the vehicle to show how she was assaulted.""
Baitland and Steele then commissioned a reenactment video of what they believe happened in the car. Using evidence photos, they focused on every little detail, including what Mandadi and Howerton were wearing and what items were in the back seat. They even hired actors similar in size and weight to Mandadi and Howerton.
The reenactment video is simple: showing three angles of what Mandadi's parents and their experts believed caused the fatal injury to her head.
Prosecutors in the case told ""48 Hours"" they've never seen a victim's family go to such lengths before. Howerton's defense attorney, John Hunter, believes the parents' investigation is ""unscientific"" and fails to prove his client's guilt.
Will the parents' investigation be a game-changer for Mark Howerton's second trial?

N2RNSQANA9_5D1XKZRQC4LR6VF,Wounded Gazans get medical care on French hospital ship,AFP,"January 22, 2024 at 11:46 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/wounded-gazans-medical-care-french-205428221.html,"On a French warship off the Egyptian coast, wounded Palestinians receive the healthcare that has become largely unobtainable in the besieged Gaza Strip after months of war.
Sitting in a wheelchair, Abdulrahman Iyad wrings his hands in his lap, resting them gently near pins protruding from his thighs.
He scrolls through his phone, looking at photos of his family, all killed in the blast that tore his own face apart.
""I was sent flying through the air and hit the wall of our neighbour's house, my leg was trapped under the caved-in ceiling,"" Iyad told AFP on the French helicopter carrier Dixmude, which is being used as a hospital to treat wounded Palestinian civilians.
""When I woke up in hospital, my uncles told me they had visited me, but I couldn't remember a thing.""
Iyad's home, like much of the Palestinian territory where Israel has waged war against Hamas militants since early October, has been reduced to rubble.
The fighting began on October 7, when Palestinian armed group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel from the Gaza Strip.
The attack resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Israel responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 25,105 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza.
Search-and-rescue missions have become nearly impossible in the territory, meaning thousands have been left trapped and presumed dead under the rubble, medics say.
The healthcare system has almost entirely collapsed, with hospitals overwhelmed and doctors having to treat a growing number of casualties with dwindling resources.
- 'Shocked' by wounded civilians -
The French warship began treating patients in November, off the coast of the port of El-Arish, 50 kilometres (30 miles) west of the Egyptian border with Gaza.
In the hull of the vessel, a handful of patients and their families gathered around a table, listlessly playing a card game.
Among them was Nesma Abu Gayad, a bright-eyed Palestinian who was seriously injured when her home was shelled.
""I was treated at a few hospitals in Gaza, before arriving in Egypt,"" she told AFP, the stump of her right foot floating above the ground from her wheelchair.
""The next step will be a prosthetic, but I have to get a referral and travel to get it abroad.""
French doctor Marine, who is serving aboard the Dixmude and only gave her first name, said the warship has so far received 120 patients, all serious cases who needed long periods of hospitalisation.
That is just a tiny minority of the more than 62,000 people who have been injured in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.
Another French doctor on the Dixmude, Salle, said she was shocked by the injuries that she had come across.
""I'm in the military, so I deal with the war wounds of our French and allied servicemen,"" she said.
""But what shocked me was to find them on civilians.""

N5FOH3MLP0_LHLUSPO9XH3DK58,Is Japan Foods Holding Ltd.'s (Catalist:5OI) Stock Price Struggling As A Result Of Its Mixed Financials?,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 10:06 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-foods-holding-ltd-catalist-010609056.html,"Japan Foods Holding (Catalist:5OI) has had a rough three months with its share price down 23%. It seems that the market might have completely ignored the positive aspects of the company's fundamentals and decided to weigh-in more on the negative aspects. Fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes so it makes sense to study the company's financials. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Japan Foods Holding's ROE today.
Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.
See our latest analysis for Japan Foods Holding
Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:
Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity
So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Japan Foods Holding is:
6.0% = S$1.9m ÷ S$31m (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).
The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every SGD1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of SGD0.06.
We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.
At first glance, Japan Foods Holding's ROE doesn't look very promising. Yet, a closer study shows that the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 6.5%. Even so, Japan Foods Holding has shown a fairly decent growth in its net income which grew at a rate of 7.8%. Taking into consideration that the ROE is not particularly high, we reckon that there could also be other factors at play which could be influencing the company's growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.
When you consider the fact that the industry earnings have shrunk at a rate of 9.5% in the same 5-year period, the company's net income growth is pretty remarkable.
Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is Japan Foods Holding fairly valued compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.
While Japan Foods Holding has a three-year median payout ratio of 100% (which means it retains 0.2% of profits), the company has still seen a fair bit of earnings growth in the past, meaning that its high payout ratio hasn't hampered its ability to grow.
Additionally, Japan Foods Holding has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 67% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Japan Foods Holding's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 9.1%, over the same period.
On the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Japan Foods Holding can be open to many interpretations. Although the company has shown a pretty impressive growth in earnings, yet the low ROE and the low rate of reinvestment makes us skeptical about the continuity of that growth, especially when or if the business comes to face any threats. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals? Click here to be taken to our analyst's forecasts page for the company.

N79DNL1Q0T_FOFHG9Q6SLY00ND,Here are the questions about accountability that remain after the DOJ Uvalde report,"Ray Sanchez and Rachel Clarke, CNN","January 21, 2024 at 9:42 PM·11 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/questions-accountability-remain-doj-uvalde-124215775.html,"More than a year and half after the school massacre in Uvalde, Texas, a US Justice Department report detailing failures at every level of the law enforcement response may have a provided a small measure of hope for the victims’ families in their quest for accountability.
While the lengthy report released Thursday did not address their demands for a criminal investigation and possible charges against law enforcement officers involved in the botched operation, it seems that process indeed has begun.
A special grand jury was reportedly empaneled Friday to investigate what the nation’s top law enforcement official described as a disorganized and chaotic response by hundreds of local, state and federal agencies.
The timing appeared to be unrelated. A pool of potential grand jurors had previously been summoned to appear Friday, reported The Uvalde Leader-News. CNN has reached out to the local prosecutor and court officials for comment.
Read the FULL REPORT
“The community now has the kind of report necessary to make sure accountability occurs,” US Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday. “I think it’s now up to the community, the state and local officials to make the appropriate determinations.”
A grand jury investigation would represent the first publicly known criminal proceeding related to the highly scrutinized response to the May 25, 2022, shooting that left 19 children and two teachers dead.
The selection of a grand jury had been highly anticipated. But families of the victims have been frustrated by the delay in convening the panel.
“I feel like everyone’s just been pointing fingers at each other,” said Berlinda Irene Arreola, whose 10-year-old step granddaughter, Amerie Jo Garza, was killed at the school. “No one wants to take responsibility. Nobody wants to take accountability.”
District Attorney Christina Mitchell told the San Antonio Express-News the grand jury would review evidence related to the mass shooting, but declined comment on the focus of the investigation. Jurors are expected to spend at least six months investigating the case, according to The Uvalde Leader-News.
“Let the DA know we’re not going to go anywhere,” Jesse Rizo, whose 9-year-old niece Jacklyn Cazares was killed, told CNN Friday. “We’re going to stay here until charges are filed.”
The DOJ report is the fullest official accounting of what happened, though much had already been reported by CNN. Still, the assessment was limited in its scope.
“These families didn’t need a 400- or 500-page government report to learn that law enforcement failed them in a historic way,” Joshua Koskoff, an attorney representing some of the victims’ families, said Thursday.
The report does not make recommendations for punitive steps and its examination of the actions of federal officers at the scene is limited. The review was requested by the then-mayor of Uvalde, Don McLaughlin, who within weeks of the horror said he feared a “cover-up” and being shut out of other investigations amid changing narratives of what happened that day and who took on key decisions.
The Critical Incident Review said the continued gunfire, reports that a teacher had been shot, and a desperate call from a student trapped with the gunman should all have prompted law enforcement officers to move to stop the bloodshed far sooner.
Instead, it took 77 minutes from when the 18-year-old shooter walked into Robb Elementary School until he was stopped. The carnage remains among the deadliest episodes in America’s ongoing scourge of campus shootings.
“Law enforcement can learn what happened in Uvalde to make sure something like this never happens ever again,” Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta told CNN Friday. “The first step of accountability – any basis for accountability – has to be truth and transparency, and that’s what we’ve tried to do.”
The DOJ said the victims “experienced unimaginable horror” and “witnessed unspeakable violence” as a result of the lack of courage and “cascading failures of leadership, decision-making, tactics, policy, and training” on the part of law enforcement officials.
“The report concludes that had the law enforcement agencies followed generally accepted practices in an active shooter situation and gone right after the shooter to stop him, lives would have been saved and people would have survived,” Garland told reporters Thursday.
Uvalde County Sheriff Ruben Nolasco was one of a handful of law enforcement officers named in the DOJ report, in which he was heavily criticized for not taking a leadership role. The report also confirmed CNN reporting that Nolasco knew the name of the gunman and that he had shot his grandmother before going to the school, but did not share that information.
“Sheriff Nolasco did not seek out or establish a command post, establish unified command, share the intelligence he learned from [the shooter’s] relatives, nor did he assign an intelligence officer to gather intelligence on the subject,” the DOJ report said.
“At one point, Sheriff Nolasco and UPD Acting Chief Pargas were within 10–15 feet of each other outside the exterior door of the northwest hallway; however, they were not coordinating with one another and continued to act independently.”
Then-school Police Chief Pete Arredondo, then-acting Uvalde Police Chief Mariano Pargas and Nolasco are singled out in the report for failing to lead. Arredondo was described by the Justice Department as the de facto on-scene commander.
Pargas resigned as acting police chief in November 2022 as the city was preparing to terminate him. A CNN report found he was aware students were alive in the classrooms and needed to be rescued but failed to organize help. Families of the victims have demanded that Pargas quit as a Uvalde county commissioner, a position he still holds.
CNN has reached out to Pargas for comment.
Arredondo, who was fired, has said he did not see himself as the incident commander and instead was “responding as a police officer.”
Nolasco should have questioned the decisions and lack of urgency shown by both Arredondo and Pargas toward entering the classrooms, the report said.
“I entrusted in the man with the gold badge,” Nolasco told CNN after the release of the report, referring to Arredondo. “I acted based on the information that was given to me.”
He told CNN he has already implemented some of the recommendations in the DOJ report, including increased training for his deputies.
Nolasco is running for reelection this year as county sheriff.
“We’re going to wait and see what the voters say. They have the last word,” he said.
Arreola said Thursday: “They have the audacity to run for reelection … knowing that they failed. And it’s there in black and white.”
State Sen. Roland Gutierrez, who represents Uvalde, said the reckonings had to go beyond the local officers, particularly to the state Department of Public Safety.
“There has been no accountability at the Department of Public Safety,” Gutierrez told CNN. “Nothing has been done to keep this from happening again.”
Asked about the possibility of the local justice system helping to deliver accountability, Gutierrez was scornful.
“This district attorney has had this case for 20 months,” he said. “There’s been nothing new. There’s no smoking gun. The shooter is dead. There’s no accomplices. There’s no nothing.”
He added, “Cops should have been indicted a long time ago for failure to render aid, for possibly criminal negligent homicide, so many different things. For 77 minutes those kids waited. … The errors that occurred were many. It wasn’t just against the local cops, the local police chief and the sheriff. We need to look at the Department of Public Safety and their head officers that were there on the scene that absolutely did nothing to safeguard these children.”
Some police officers have been convicted for their actions during encounters that resulted in death. But prosecutions and convictions of law enforcement personnel for failing to protect the public during mass shootings are uncommon.
Scot Peterson, the former school resource officer who stayed outside during the February 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was found not guilty last year of seven counts of felony child neglect, three counts of culpable negligence and one count of perjury.
“That is going to be hard,” John Miller, CNN’s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst, said of the likelihood of criminal charges related to the law enforcement response in Uvalde. “Being afraid is not a crime, having bad tactical judgment is not a crime, and neither is incompetence under pressure.”
President Joe Biden, who said Thursday he had not yet read the full report, added that he didn’t “know that there’s any criminal liability.”
The DOJ report also questioned the actions of the Texas Department of Public Safety. For instance, the initial crime scene investigation, which was the responsibility of the DPS, was hampered by too many people walking into the two classrooms.
Col. Steve McCraw, DPS director, told CNN in September 2022: “I’ll be the first to resign. I’ll gladly resign. I’ll tender my resignation to the governor if I think there is any culpability in the Department of Public Safety. Period.”
McCraw was responding at the time to minutes of a meeting obtained by CNN that quoted him telling highway patrol captains “no one is losing their jobs” over the inept law enforcement response.
A month later, McCraw told angry families of slaughtered Robb students calling for him to resign: “If DPS as an institution failed the families, failed the school, or failed the community of Uvalde, then absolutely, I need to go. But I can tell you this right now: DPS as an institution right now did not fail the community, plain and simple.”
In a statement Thursday, DPS thanked the Justice Department for its report. “As DPS Director Steven McCraw first stated in the weeks after the shooting, the law enforcement response that day was an abject failure, and this report’s observations underscore those failures,” the DPS said.
DPS has not responded to requests for comment on the findings in the Justice Department report.
Seven of 91 DPS officers who responded to Robb Elementary were referred for investigation to the agency’s inspector general for their actions the day of the massacre. At least two have left voluntarily. The department did move to fire a Ranger, but he is still on the payroll as he challenges the termination.
Separately, DPS and the county district attorney continue to fight a request by CNN and other media organizations to release public records related to what happened at Robb Elementary.
Gutierrez said accountability should also include stricter gun control legislation. He said the law enforcement officers were afraid of the power of the assault-style rifle used by the gunman, and bought legally days after his 18th birthday.
“Politicians need to stop being cowards. They need to see the videos that I’ve seen, they need to see what this gun does,” he said.
Politicians “need to fully and finally pass an assault weapons ban in this country so that we do not see this happen again to another child,” said Gutierrez, who is running in the Democratic primary to be the challenger to Republican Texas US Sen. Ted Cruz this fall.
Koskoff, the attorney representing some of the victims’ families, said: “The questions that are not answered in this report are significantly more important than the questions that are.”
On Wednesday night, the frustrated parents of Khloie Torres, who was 10 when she survived the 2022 massacre at Robb Elementary, walked out of a meeting with Garland and other families before it was over.
Ruben and Jamie Torres left the meeting after about an hour. They expressed disappointment at what they heard ahead of the official release the next day of the DOJ report. They hadn’t heard anything new, the parents said.
Veronica Mata, whose 10-year-old daughter Tess was killed in the shooting, said the families will not stop their demands for accountability.
“I think we’re going to continue fighting,” she said. “We’re going to continue fighting that some type of change is made in honor of our kids.”

Trump last week appeared mix up Haley, a former United Nations ambassador who served in his Cabinet, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) while speaking about the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.
Asked by CBS “Face The Nation” anchor Margaret Brennan if the apparent gaffe is the first time she’s questioned Trump’s mental fitness, Haley listed off a series of recent incidents where the former president appeared to mix up names or events.
“He claimed Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II, I’m assuming he meant World War III. He said that he ran against President Obama, he never ran against President Obama. He says that I’m the one that kept security from the Capitol on Jan. 6, I was nowhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6,” Haley said. “Don’t be surprised if you [have] someone that’s 80 in office, their mental stability is going to continue to decline, that’s just human nature. We know that.”
Haley then pointed to the likely Democratic presidential nominee, President Biden, who at 81 is the oldest sitting U.S. president, and argued he is “very different” than he was two years ago when he first took office.
The White House hopeful said Biden should serve as a “warning sign” for 2024.
Brennan then asked Haley if she ever questioned Trump’s mental fitness when working in his Cabinet.
“I called him out if he was doing something wrong. I mean, I would show up, pick up the phone and say, ‘You can’t do this. Instead you could X, Y, or Z, you know.’ So I always told him what I thought was in the best interest of the country when I was in his Cabinet,” Haley said. “But this is different. I mean, we’re seeing he’s just not at the same level he was at 2016. I think we’re seeing some of that decline.”
Trump on Saturday pushed back on claims of mental missteps after he appeared to mix up Haley and Pelosi in reference to Jan. 6, telling a crowd in New Hampshire that he often relies on sarcasm during speeches.
“A lot of times I’ll say that President Obama is doing a lousy job, meaning that Obama is running the show,” Trump said during his rally. “They’ll say, ‘Donald Trump doesn’t know who our president is.’ No, no. A few months ago I took a cognitive test my doctor gave me, I said give me a cognitive test … and I aced it. I also took one when I was in the White House.”
Despite the former president’s age and his opponents’ doubts about his ability to serve as president, Trump, who is 77, continues to lead in GOP primary polling. He easily won during last week’s Iowa caucuses and has a 11.1 point lead over Haley in New Hampshire, which will hold its primary on Tuesday, according to The Hill and Decision Desk HQ’s polling index.

The secretary of state for Wales said that he would ""make the case for more"" if necessary.
This week Tata Steel announced plans to decarbonise which included 2,800 job losses, mainly in Port Talbot.
Mr Davies said that every single one of the workers ""will have access to any training they need or want"".
Tata workers left stranded, say campaigners
Tata job cuts 'devastating' for UK steel - union
What Tata's plans mean for UK's carbon footprint
As part of a deal announced in September, the UK government set up a transition board to manage a £100m fund to help workers affected by restructuring at Tata Steel.
Mr Davies said the main focus of the fund was reskilling workers, but some of the money may be used for infrastructure projects to attract investment.
""We're already meeting informally and formally with businesses to find out what their training requirements are going to be, Mr Davies said.
""I understand how difficult it must be for [workers] at this moment. That £100m is there to help you get any training, any help at all that you need after this devastating news.""
Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government's economy minister told the programme: ""We will always help people who are facing redundancy.
""So that may mean I need to move around other parts of my budget, which I would absolutely be prepared to do to make sure we can support workers - as we always have done - who are facing redundancy.""
However, Mr Gething insisted the primary focus is on maintaining the jobs at the steel works.
""I do think, though, there is hope. The final whistle has absolutely not gone because the proposals around blast furnace closures envisaged the last blast furnace closing towards the end of this year.
We need to understand, practically, whether that's possible... whether the company is in a position to do that with all of their own responsibilities for their customers and the future.""
He said that if Labour win the next election a £3bn green steel fund is ""on the table to assist in a transition that is a generally just transition"".
Joe Rossiter from the Institute of Welsh Affairs warned workers could be left behind if plans to create green jobs aren't expedited.
""There needs to be a co-ordinated plan that's joint-owned by the UK and Welsh governments and the investment to back that up,"" he said.
""If we don't act now to invest in the green economy then Wales will feel left behind in the global race for these industries of the future.""

Mike Lee.
Wilson and Hatch are running for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney. They face several other GOP candidates in the state’s primary, including 3rd District Rep. John Curtis and Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs. Staggs has already endorsed Trump, as has conservative activist Carolyn Phippen, while Curtis has said he’ll vote for Trump if he is the Republican nominee,
Wilson and Hatch both announced their support for Trump on X, shortly after news broke that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was ending his run for president and endorsing Trump.
“It is evident that President Trump is the right nominee for our party,” Wilson wrote. “I look forward to working in the Senate with President Trump to unite our party, secure a stronger future for America, and continue the fight for conservative leadership. ... President Trump has my full endorsement.”
Meanwhile, Hatch, whose father the late Sen. Orrin Hatch, supported Trump after he was elected, said he would continue his family’s support of the former president.
“My father was one of @realDonaldTrump‘s closest allies in the U.S. Senate,” he wrote on X.   “I will be the same as we work to reduce government spending, secure the border, and cut through red tape. Frankly, we all know President Biden is not capable of being the leader of the free world and needs to retire and get the care he obviously needs.”
Hatch ended his social media post with “Make America Great Again. #MAGA”.

Utah Sen. Mike Lee endorses Donald Trump for president
In recent weeks, the presidential race had whittled down to a contest between three candidates — DeSantis, Trump and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. With DeSantis out, and Trump still commanding large majorities in polls, several senators and candidates have come out in support of Trump in recent weeks.
Only one state so far has had a chance to vote in the Republican primary. In the Iowa caucuses, Trump won 51% of the vote, while DeSantis finished with 21% and Haley with 19%.
The New Hampshire primary is this Tuesday, where the latest CNN poll showed Trump with 50% support and Haley with 39% among likely Republican voters. DeSantis was far behind his competitors with only 6% support.

The US military's Central Command said an Iran-backed militia targeted the Al Asad airbase, which hosts American troops, with ballistic missiles and rockets on Saturday evening.
An unspecified number of US personnel were ""undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries"".
At least one Iraqi service member was wounded in the attack.
The strike against the base was claimed by a group calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. According to the US-based Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated armed groups operating in Iraq.
It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks. And Al Asad base has been attacked repeatedly in recent years.
The US military said most of the missiles fired on Saturday were intercepted but some evaded air defences and hit the base, adding that an assessment of the damage is ongoing.
It is the latest in a series of attacks on US positions in Iraq and Syria by Iran's proxies in the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza conflict last October.
Understanding a week of missile strikes across Middle East
The US military and allies have also intervened to stop Houthi missile attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea.
US forces carried out another airstrike on Saturday against the Houthis - an Iran-backed rebel group controlling much of western Yemen. The US military said it targeted a launch site, after identifying an anti-ship missile ""that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and prepared to launch"".

NAENPEGR3Q_8XXWGQZDFGAQQWB,Is It Too Late to Buy Eli Lilly Stock?,"David Jagielski, The Motley Fool","January 22, 2024 at 12:30 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-buy-eli-lilly-stock-153000550.html,"Shares of Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) can't seem to stop rallying. For investors thinking about whether to buy the stock, it can be both exciting and discouraging to see it rise. While it's encouraging to see the stock going in the right direction, it's also potentially discouraging to not see it dip in value, where there might be a potential buying opportunity.
Given the stock's impressive gains -- it's up around 80% in just 12 months -- is it too late to invest in Eli Lilly right now? Should investors continue waiting for what may be an inevitable sell-off, or is today still a good time to invest in the healthcare giant?
The biggest reason investors may be turned off rom Eli Lilly's stock is its valuation. These are some of its key value multiples today, and they look downright awful for any value-oriented investors:
Trailing price-to-earnings ratio: 116
Forward price-to-earnings ratio: 53
Price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio: 1.6
Price-to-sales ratio: 18
Price-to-book ratio: 54
There's no denying that Eli Lilly is an expensive stock to own. The risk is that investors are paying for a huge amount of future growth. Excitement around the company's recently approved weight-loss drug Zepbound is through the roof. According to analyst projections, peak sales for the drug could hit $68 billion.
But when it comes to miracle weight-loss treatments, the healthcare industry has been here before. And the danger for investors is getting caught up in that hype and excitement. Zepbound has shown it can help people lose more than 26% of their body weight in clinical trials.
However, it's also a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist, and there are growing concerns about GLP-1 drugs and their side effects, including serious gastrointestinal issues, some of which require hospitalization. It's too early to tell if this could derail Zepbound or other GLP-1 drugs, but it's a risk that investors should consider when investing in Eli Lilly given that the stock is priced for perfection. Any bad press surrounding Zepbound could make Eli Lilly vulnerable to a correction.
Weight loss is undoubtedly a big part of the hype around Eli Lilly's stock today, but it's by no means the entire business. The company is diverse, and while it has been expanding and investing more into weight loss, it has also been working on other growth opportunities.
One of its most promising opportunities outside of weight loss is in Alzheimer's. The company has an early-stage Alzheimer's treatment, donanemab, which regulators are expected to make a decision on early this year. In clinical trials, donanemab performed similarly to Leqembi, which is a treatment from Biogen that regulators approved last year. Donanemab likely won't have as much potential as Zepbound, but it could bring in billions in sales for Eli Lilly.
The company has also been expanding via acquisitions. Last year it acquired Sigilon Therapeutics, which has a cell therapy in the works as a possible treatment for type 1 diabetes. Eli Lilly also acquired Dice Therapeutics in an effort to bolster its portfolio of drugs that treat autoimmune diseases.
Eli Lilly's operations are highly profitable, with the company earning a profit of just under $5 billion in the trailing 12 months on revenue of $32.1 billion, for a margin of 16%. The business is in good shape to continue to pursue more acquisitions to expand and grow its operations.
While there's no doubt weight loss is its most promising opportunity today, there are still more growth opportunities on the horizon. For investors who are looking far beyond just this year and next year for an investment they are willing to hold for a decade or longer, Eli Lilly can still make for a great stock to buy.
Eli Lilly is a stock I expect will eventually hit the $1 trillion mark given its growth opportunities.
Investors shouldn't be overly concerned about risks and side effects related to GLP-1 drugs, as it's far too early to tell if that will be a problem for Eli Lilly. No drug is perfect, and there will always be challenges along the way. And if there are, a company as diverse and financially strong as Eli Lilly will adapt, as it has over the past 140+ years it has been in existence.
Eli Lilly has been a great stock to own for years, and I'm confident it will remain that way for the foreseeable future. Long-term investors shouldn't wait for a dip, because they may end up waiting a long time, and missing out on gains along the way.

Here’s how | Opinion,Serhiy Samborskyi,"January 21, 2024 at 10:00 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/modesto-residents-impacted-lives-ukrainians-130000796.html,"As someone who was born and raised in Khmelnytskyi — one of Modesto’s seven sister cities throughout the world — I would like to express my sincere and heartfelt gratitude on behalf of all Ukrainians. Last year, our sister city of Modesto raised $70,0000 for Khmelnitsky. That money went to purchase generators for the Children’s Hospital, allowing them to keep the hospital running and patients warm when Russia’s genocidal forces attacked and destroyed 50% of Ukraine’s power grid.
Donations from many Modestans also helped buy skylights to protect the city from Russian drone attacks at night, food delivered to the front of the war effort prepared by local volunteers as well as tourniquets and other life-saving necessities.
The sister city agreement of cooperation and friendship was signed in 1987, four years before Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union. All my relatives, friends, former colleagues and numerous acquaintances thank you for your unwavering support since Russia’s full-scale and aggressive invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022.
Opinion
After almost two full years of this devastating war, Ukrainian children have been hit especially hard. According to the United Nations, nearly two-thirds of Ukrainian youth have been forced to leave their home. Forced to leave their homes and relocate within the country or go abroad, this war has separated children from their parents who either wanted to stay and defend Ukraine or could not seek shelter with their children abroad.
Those inside the country are in constant danger due to massive Russian attacks which have damaged energy systems, ruined water supply, caused a loss of heating, destroyed schools and hospitals and riddled cities with explosive devices.
An estimated 5 million Ukrainian children have been dislocated from their homes since the war began. Due to Russian artillery and air attacks, approximately 575 children have died and at least 1,148 children total have been injured in the war. The number of total Ukrainian civilians killed has now reached more than 10,200.
On the Russian occupied territories of Ukraine, thousands of Ukrainian children have been kidnapped by Russian forces — forcefully stolen and carried off to all parts of Russia.
“Hundreds have been returned, hundreds are in Russian foster care, but many more are still missing,” the Guardian reported last October.
Last March, following an investigation of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights for the alleged war crime of “unlawful deportation of children” and the “unlawful transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.” Just three months later, in June, the Secretary General of the United Nations added Russia’s armed forces to a list of parties that have committed “‘grave violations affecting children in situations of armed conflict’ for reportedly killing and maiming hundreds of Ukraine’s children, using them as human shields and attacking schools and hospitals,” according to the U.S. Department of State.
Putin, who has been nicknamed “Put-ler” in Ukraine because of his treacherous crimes, has since limited his rare visits abroad. Could this be because he fears being arrested?
The fiendish purpose of abducting children? To brainwash them and turn them against Ukraine so that Russia effectively erases their Ukrainian identity, culture and family. The majority of Russian camps that house stolen Ukrainian children engage in “pro-Russia re-education efforts,” according to the U.S. State Department.
Meanwhile, in Western Ukraine, my cousin Oksana’s first grade class was meeting in the basement of their school which had been turned into a bomb shelter. It was bitterly cold in the bomb shelter — not to mention very dark and dreary. A local priest saw photos of the young children studying in heavy coats and mittens and volunteered his church’s 19th Century seminary which has walls that are 5-feet thick. The class was subsequently moved from the dark, freezing bomb shelter and allowed to meet above ground.
This last December 6, the children got a visit from St. Nicholas. The class made reindeer pillows for Ukrainian soldiers at the front of the war effort. However, in a diabolical move, Russian forces sent drones and missiles to disrupt their joyful celebration, forcing the children to don their coats and go back down into the bomb shelters.
Of course, it was not by accident that the celebration was disrupted. The Russians have a plan to not only disrupt St. Nicholas celebrations, but to prevent all education from happening in Ukraine. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, more than 3,000 education institutions have been damaged or destroyed.
Ukrainian schools that do not have equipped bomb shelters or basements work online. In wartime, Ukraine’s children are maturing very fast. Even the small ones understand what is happening around them. My grand-nephews and grand-nieces spend many hours — both during the day and at night — in bathrooms without windows to avoid injuries from shattered glass.
The other day, I asked 8-year-old Artem what he did on the night of December 13 when Russian forces attacked Kyiv with 10 Shahed drones and 10 ballistic missiles.
“I finished reading (a) book in the bathroom,” he said. “I had three hours.”
Artem started stuttering 15 months ago and is undergoing psychological treatment now.
One of Russia’s favorite times to sadistically send drones is when school children are having their daily nap time. While lying on their rugs, small children must listen to bombs exploding all around them. Despite this, Ukraine’s education efforts have not stopped.
My cousin, Oksana, told me that one of her six-year-old students has a father missing in action. He was wounded in the war effort, and his family hasn’t been able to locate his body. The student, Ostap, and his 4-year-old sister live with only their mother as their sole caretaker. I wanted to send the family money, so I wired it to my cousin. She gave Ostap the money, telling him he and his family could use it anyway they wanted to. Two days later, my cousin called to tell me what the boy had decided: He had Oksana take him to the local military post where he distributed money to the soldiers for food and supplies.
My cousin was surprised. She thought he would get something for himself. But the boy told her that the soldiers needed the money to find his father and defend his country. What a lesson for us all in patriotic civility.

Although initially unaware of its significance, I could tell it felt both natural and out of place at the same time — a feeling I knew all too well.
“Faggot.” I was 12 years old, using social media as a means to understand my identity when I first encountered those six, seemingly innocent letters. Initially oblivious, I looked up the word’s meaning — a simple action that altered my perception of myself. I realized I was not only abnormal but my very existence was offensive.
In a society where LGBTQ+ education is not only scarce but actively censored, I was forced to learn about my community — and myself — through less reliable means: social media. With Instagram and YouTube as stand-ins for teachers, I matured without fully understanding who I was becoming and why I strayed from the status quo. My life became plagued with conflict catalyzed by an absence of LGBTQ+ inclusive education and representation.
Despite this lack of representation, the LGBTQ+ community has been present throughout history. Starting as early as 9,600 BCE, its acceptance then extended into the Roman Empire and beyond — exemplified most notably by Renaissance champion Leonardo da Vinci. However, the first push for LGBTQ+ inclusive education didn’t occur until directly after the Stonewall riots of 1969. Although initially unsuccessful, this push prompted further movements — the first successful one occurring 42 years later.
As a part of the FAIR (Fair Accurate Inclusive and Respectful) Education Act of 2011, California became the first state to enact legislation “requiring that the curriculum include information about the contributions and roles of LGBTQ Americans.” However, in the 12 years since, only five other states have followed suit: Colorado, New Jersey, Oregon, Illinois and Nevada. While that progress is inspiring, many other states are deliberately censoring this education.
Most notably, in 2022, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, signed the “Parental Rights in Education” bill (more commonly known as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill). This piece of legislation, which only 40% of Floridians support, prohibits classroom discussions regarding sexual orientation or gender identity through third grade — although, in April 2023, it was extended to the 12th grade. Additionally, presidential candidate Nikki Haley — who most view as a moderate alternative to former President Donald Trump — even stated that the law does not go “far enough.” Further, since the Florida legislation, 30 similar anti-LGBTQ+ education bills have been passed in 16 states.
Legislation is not the only barrier, though; many teachers are hesitant about LGBTQ+ inclusive education as well. Specifically, a 2021 Education Week poll found that 43% of teachers, district leaders, and principals believe that LGBTQ+ matters should not be taught in schools — even in an age-appropriate manner. This hesitation could stem from several factors: Teachers might fear parental backlash, face limited curriculum options or simply lack the necessary training. However, other teachers and faculty members believe that, at a time in which LGBTQ+ rights are being targeted throughout the country, it is more important than ever to promote LGBTQ+ education — especially since 20.8% of Generation Z self-identifies as LGBTQ+.
According to the American Bar Association, “an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum promotes a positive school environment and student well-being.” Further, research indicates that a positive school environment for LGBTQ+ students increases academic motivation and decreases feelings of sadness, disconnectedness and even suicidal ideation. In fact, these indicators saw a drastic reduction when LGBTQ+ students felt as safe at school as their straight, cisgender peers. Considering that LGBTQ+ inclusive education directly improves the quality of life for one in five of our nation’s students without harming the other four, I find it difficult to comprehend the reason for its censorship — and so should you.
The general public is also hesitant to endorse LGBTQ+ inclusive education. In fact, a recent study from the University of Southern California revealed that only a mere quarter of respondents stated that they support such education at the elementary school level. However, this reluctance was largely based on blind, uninformed conclusions as half of the respondents stated they were “unsure” whether LGBTQ+ matters were even being addressed in educational curricula. Although a higher number supported LGBTQ+ inclusive education at the high school level, I contest that it is imperative to begin as early as possible.
Drawing from personal experience, I know that, by the time LGBTQ+ students reach high school, the adverse effects of the absence of inclusive education have already taken their toll. To remedy this, I propose age-appropriate education. Many believe that more inclusive education means that primary school students would learn about detailed sexual education or complex theory, but that is simply not the case. Instead, according to teacher Sara Springer, primary school students might learn that “no one should be treated unfairly because they are different” and that “families come in all shapes and sizes.” Then, as students progress to middle school, they can learn about prominent LGBTQ+ figures, gaining insight into the challenges the community had to overcome to get to where it is today.
Another criticism of LGBTQ+ inclusive education is that it will distract students from other aspects of education. In fact, in support of the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, DeSantis stated: “Schools need to be teaching kids to read, to write, they need to teach them science, history.” While I completely agree with this sentiment, I believe compromise is possible and necessary.
In English classes, teachers can assign books with LGBTQ+ characters — even if they simply serve supporting roles (after all, it is the representation that matters). In history classes, curricula can highlight prominent LGBTQ+ figures (e.g. Marsha P. Johnson, Harvey Milk and Pete Buttigieg) and events (e.g. the Stonewall riots, Pride and the AIDS crisis). Finally, in science classes, students can learn about prominent LGBTQ+ scientists. For example, elementary schools currently revere astronaut and physicist Sally Ride as the first American woman in space without disclosing that she was, in fact, bisexual. Although these suggested curriculum changes seem minor, it is education like this that fosters more accepting school environments. In fact, California students who studied LGBTQ+ matters at school reported less bullying overall.
Finally, by fostering age-appropriate LGBTQ+ inclusive education and dispelling misconceptions, we can create positive learning environments that not only inform students of an important community but also allow LGBTQ+ students the comfort and bravery to begin embarking on their journeys of self-discovery.
So now, as you consider your stance on implementing LGBTQ+ inclusive education into national curricula, I urge you to think of the approximately 15 million American LGBTQ+ students who face bullying every day, just for being themselves. I urge you to think of the students who are forced to learn about their identity through unreliable — typically damaging — means. I urge you to think of the students who long for representation.
I urge you to think of me.

NDYPVFHB2K_DY0BJEH5KRUTDVX,North Korea stresses alignment with Russia against US and says Putin could visit at an early date,KIM TONG-HYUNG,"Updated January 21, 2024 at 7:31 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-stresses-alignment-russia-035234300.html,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed his willingness to visit the North at an unspecified “early date” as the countries continue to align in the face of their separate, intensifying confrontations with the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Ministry highlighted Putin’s intent for a visit following North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui’s meetings with Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow last week. The ministry said in a statement published by state media that the two countries agreed to further strategic and tactical cooperation with Russia to establish a “new multi-polarized international order,” a reference to their efforts to build a united front against Washington.
Putin had already confirmed his willingness to visit the capital, Pyongyang, at a convenient time during his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Russia’s Far East in September. One of the few world leaders openly supporting Putin's war on Ukraine, Kim has been actively boosting the visibility of his ties with Russia in an attempt to break out of diplomatic isolation and strengthen his footing, as he navigates a deepening nuclear standoff with Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.
In a separate statement on Sunday, the North’s Foreign Ministry condemned the U.N. Security Council for calling an emergency meeting over the country’s latest ballistic test, which state media described as a new intermediate-range solid-fuel missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead. The ministry said the test-firing on Jan. 14 was among the country’s regular activities to improve its defense capabilities and that it didn’t pose a threat to its neighbors.
South Korea on Thursday urged the Security Council “to break the silence” over North Korea’s escalating missile tests and threats. Russia and China, both permanent members of the council, have blocked U.S.-led efforts to increase sanctions on North Korea over its recent weapons tests, underscoring a divide deepened over Russia’s war on Ukraine.
The alignment between Pyongyang and Moscow has raised international concerns about alleged arms cooperation, in which the North provides Russia with munitions to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine, possibly in exchange for badly needed economic aid and military assistance to help upgrade Kim’s forces. Both Pyongyang and Russia have denied accusations by Washington and Seoul about North Korean arms transfers to Russia.
North Korea’s Foreign Ministry, in comments published by state media, said Choe and the Russian officials in their meetings expressed a “strong will to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in defending the core interests of the two countries and establishing a new multi-polarized international order.”
Russia expressed “deep thanks” to North Korea for its “full support” over its war on Ukraine, the North Korean ministry said. It said Choe and the Russian officials expressed “serious concern” over the United States’ expanding military cooperation with its Asian allies that they blamed for worsening tensions in the region and threatening North Korea’s sovereignty and security interests.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, after Kim in recent months used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to ramp up his weapons tests and military demonstrations. The United States, South Korea and Japan have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises, which Kim portrays as invasion rehearsals, and sharpening their deterrence plans built around nuclear-capable U.S. assets.
In the latest tit-for-tat, North Korea on Friday said it conducted a test of a purported nuclear-capable underwater attack drone in response to a combined naval exercise by the United States, South Korea and Japan last week, as it continued to blame its rivals for tensions in the region.
Choe’s visit to Moscow came as Kim continues to use domestic political events to issue provocative threats of nuclear conflict.
At Pyongyang’s rubber-stamp parliament last week, Kim declared that North Korea is abandoning its long-standing goal of a peaceful unification with war-divided rival South Korea and ordered the rewriting of the North’s constitution to cement the South as its most hostile foreign adversary. He accused South Korea of acting as “top-class stooges” of the Americans and repeated a threat that he would use his nukes to annihilate the South if provoked.
Analysts say North Korea could be aiming to diminish South Korea’s voice in the regional nuclear standoff and eventually force direct dealings with Washington as it looks to cement its status as a nuclear weapons state."
NFPDI95TVT_XQLS8IJC28F22DC,Perspective: An ode to my BYU major,Mariya Manzhos,"January 21, 2024 at 1:03 PM·4 min read",20230121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/perspective-ode-byu-major-040345351.html,"During the four years I spent getting a bachelor’s degree at Brigham Young University, my befuddled parents asked me more than once what I was actually studying. What did this major called “humanities” entail and why was it worth paying tuition for? It didn’t help that my parents are Ukrainian and we struggled finding an equivalent to “humanities” in Russian and Ukrainian to help me explain what to them seemed like an irresponsible academic choice.
What exactly would be my job upon graduation? they wondered. A marketing job, or maybe a job teaching languages? The truth is, I did not know myself.
In my classes, I learned about literary theory, read Plato and Shakespeare for the first time, listened to classical pieces and memorized the title and composer of each one. For my “Philosophy of Art” class, the first assignment was to write an essay answering: “What is Art?” While the practical application of these studies seemed abstract and distant, I was sure of one thing — I delighted in nearly every class and assignment. Humanities felt like a playground to explore and understand my own incoherent thoughts.
My college days of studying humanities almost 20 years ago sprang to mind this week when I read Martha Nussbaum’s essay about her visit to Utah Valley University last year.
Nussbaum, a philosopher and professor at the University of Chicago, had been invited to give a lecture on justice for nonhuman animals, the topic of her new book “Justice for Animals: Our Collective Responsibility.” She wrote in The Chronicle of Higher Education that at UVU, she witnessed “one of the most heartening scenes in higher education that I have ever witnessed in my long career.”
An overflow crowd of about 150 people attended her lecture, where students contested her approach and thoughtfully engaged in the discussion, she wrote in the piece. She spoke as part of a required course, “Ethics and Values,” that’s supported through a National Endowment for the Humanities grant and is funded by the state government.
Over the past few years, budget cuts have shrunk humanities programs. West Virginia University laid off 76 people, including 32 tenured faculty members in areas of language and the arts, according to The New York Times. Other schools, such as the University of Alaska, North Dakota State University, Iowa State University and the University of Kansas, proposed cuts to their humanities programs.

How religious universities can restore the promise of American education
Looking back at her experience at UVU, Nussbaum makes the case for humanities education and identifies three benefits of the “Ethics and Values” course (which includes the history of ethics, ethical theory and applied ethics) and humanities education in general.
First, students learn “skills essential for good citizenship in our polarized society: how to debate about fundamental matters with civility and respect, and how to examine themselves in Socratic fashion, asking why they hold the beliefs they do, and how strong the foundation for those beliefs is.”
Secondly, Nussbaum writes, students become more desirable employees, “because they have confidence in their own mental capacity and are relatively free from deference to mere fads.” Other benefits include “general problem-solving skills” applicable in a variety of fields and resulting in long-term success, she writes.
Finally, humanities students “exude confidence and pride in their lives.” The benefits go beyond the public sphere: “Their curiosity and newfound self-mastery is likely to sustain them through life’s vicissitudes and give them a deep inner world into which to delve when the going is tough,” Nussbaum writes. At her lecture, Nussbaum saw students filled with “inner joy” that, she writes, comes from “discovering yourself.”
After graduation, I leaned into that joy of self-discovery. I got a job in the fundraising office of an international nonprofit in Washington, D.C., which meant doing a lot of spreadsheets and going to a lot of parties. I met fascinating people from across the world and felt that I could get along with many of them right off the bat. I was curious about where they came from and what drove them to do their work.
This kind of outward orientation, I believe, was shaped by closely studying and analyzing  the plots and characters, and their different perspectives and motivations, in my college humanities classes. I eventually became a journalist and I continued to ask questions that attempt to get at what’s most important and true — the kinds of questions that shaped our conversations in BYU humanities classes.
While my parents remain puzzled by my choice to study humanities, they seem pleased by where that path has led me. I’m fully on board with Nussbaum’s case: Humanities education has immense value. It teaches us how to be thoughtful, a necessary skill today amid the noise of the internet, and how to be generous toward the viewpoints of others. Humanities invite us to set our egos aside so that we can begin to inhabit the joys and struggles outside of our own."

NITAQFKDSS_POXCTF0WTQCT6JZ,Why 2024 is the year of the tourist tax,Sophie Dickinson,"January 22, 2024 at 6:30 a.m.·8 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/why-2024-tourist-tax-213000088.html,"“Overtourism” is something of a buzzword already this year. We were beckoned back to seaside resorts and old favourites in the aftermath of the pandemic, before being assailed with stories of crowded restaurants and attractions. In Amsterdam, a new directive asked hedonistic Britons to stay away. In places like Athens, anti-tourist graffiti campaigns are being waged by locals, with the aim of letting visitors know they are unwelcome.
For other countries, tourist taxes are being implemented in response. Typically only small amounts of money, the fees are usually added onto hotel bills or payable at the airport. Here are the countries introducing a tourist tax in 2024.
Greece has introduced a new “climate crisis resilience fee” for tourists this year, replacing the previous hotel tax. According to the Greek government, charges will range from €1.50 (£1.30) to €10 (£8.60), depending on accommodation, quality and the time of year. In the low season, the fee is capped at €4 (£3.45).
It comes after a year of record rainfall and heatwaves, which destroyed over 1,500 square kilometres of land and led to 37 deaths.
A tourist tax has long been proposed as a solution to Venice’s overcrowding problem. This year, its entry fee system is finally being implemented. A trial will launch between April and mid-July, where on certain days – mostly weekends – visitors will have to pay €5 (£4.30) to access the city. This only applies from 8:30am to 4pm, meaning that those visiting the city in the evening will be exempt. Those staying overnight will also bypass the charge.
Few expect visitor numbers to go down. Instead, proceeds from the fee will be earmarked for maintenance projects in the city, plus “the quality of the tourist offer (services, events, museums etc.)”.
Visitors to Barcelona have had to pay both a city-wide and regional tax since 2012. Last year, the municipal fee increased to €2.75 (£2.37); from April 1 this year, this will rise to €3.25 (£2.80).
Tourists pay the fee as part of their accommodation bill. Again, the proceeds are used to fund city infrastructure like bus routes and roadworks.
Another Spanish tourist tax, this time in Valencia. Again, it will apply to visitors staying in official accommodation, including campsites, hotels and self-catering properties. The style of accommodation will impact the amount paid, which varies from 50 cents (43 pence) to €2 (£1.72).
It isn’t clear when the tax, known as the Valencian Tax on Tourist Stays (IVET), will come fully into force – officials have been trailing its implementation since late 2022. Once it is introduced, however, the proceeds will be used to provide more affordable housing for locals living in tourist areas.
The Indonesian province has been popular with backpackers for decades, and now the region is introducing a fee to “protect culture and nature”.
From Feb 14 2024, visitors will have to pay a fee of around IDR 150,000, or just over £7.50. It won’t make a radical difference to the overall cost of a holiday, but it is one of the steeper tourist taxes.
The tax is payable at the airport or via the Love Bali app, a process that will apparently take less than a minute.
Tourists have long been charged a taxe de séjour in France, with the price varying between cities. In anticipation of the Paris Olympics, however, fees will be increasing by around 200 per cent in the French capital.
Depending on the type of accommodation, visitors staying in hotel rooms in Paris can expect to pay a fee ranging from 75 cents (65 pence) to €15 (£12.90) per night. This is in addition to reported increases in the price of metro fares, museum tickets and hotel room rates.
The Netherlands has a well-established tourist tax policy, and Amsterdam has a well-established problem with certain types of tourist.
This year, the city’s toeristenbelasting, or tourist tax, will increase from 7 per cent of the cost of a hotel room to 12.5 per cent – applying to cruise passengers and overnight visitors alike. This makes it the highest of its kind in Europe.
Olhão, a Portuguese fishing town, has started charging a tourist tax of €2 (£1.72) a night between April and October. This is halved in the off-season and does not apply to children under the age of 16.
The charge is also capped at five nights, meaning a visitor can only be charged an additional €10 (£8.60) per trip.
During the pandemic, Iceland suspended its tourism taxes. They returned on Jan 1 2024, with hotels and guesthouses charging ISK 600 (£3.46), campsites ISK 300 (£1.73) and cruise ships stopping in Iceland’s ports ISK 1,000 (£5.76).
It comes after a remarkable year of inbound tourism in the country. There were nearly 800,000 international visitors last summer – up around a quarter from the same period in 2022, according to the Iceland Review. The European Travel Commission reports that both the number of nights stayed, and the number of arrivals, were higher last year than in 2019.
The tourism levy in Austria depends on the province a traveller is visiting. In Vienna, for example, it typically amounts to just over 3 per cent of an accommodation bill.
Tourist taxes vary between cities in Belgium, but they typically cost between €3 (£2.58) and €6 (£5.16).
Bhutan has been charging a significant sum of money to tourists since its opening in 1974. This fee currently sits at $200 (£157) per person, per day in the high season, with reductions in the low season.
Officials say the fees are used in part to maintain the country’s heritage and offset the carbon emissions of visitors.
Those staying in Bulgarian holiday resorts should expect a small additional fee, typically €2 (£1.72) per person.
People staying in the Hungarian capital are charged an additional 4 per cent fee, per night, to their hotel bill.
Taxes vary across Caribbean islands, with some charging upon departure, as an addition to the hotel bill, or both. Typically, tourist taxes average between 8 per cent (Grenada, St Lucia) and 15 per cent (Jamaica). Arrival and departure taxes also differ across the region, with the Bahamas charging $15 (£11.78), Jamaica charging $35 (£27.50) and Bermuda $50 (£39).
Visitors can expect to pay an additional 10 kuna (£1.10) per person per night.
Germany’s tourist taxes vary between cities. In Berlin, the amount equates to around 5 per cent of the total accommodation bill.
Taxes are set by individual municipalities in Italy. Generally, the amount varies from €2 (£1.72) to €5 (£3.90) per day, per person. Children, disabled travellers and their carers and patients admitted to health facilities are usually exempt.
Tourists visiting Japan pay a 1,000 yen (£5.40) departure tax to support the country’s infrastructure. As government officials worry about overcrowding in some of Japan’s largest cities, some prefectures have instigated additional taxes of their own (amounting to around 50 pence per visit).
In Malaysia, tourists are charged RM10 (or £1.70) per room, per night. In some regions, children and those travelling for medical reasons are exempt.
Most international visitors (excluding those from Australia) must pay a $35 (£17) levy to enter New Zealand. It “aims to address current challenges in the tourism and conservation systems”.
In Prague, the tourist tax typically costs around 50 Czech Koruna per night, or £1.74.
Like many tourist taxes, Slovenia’s varies between regions. Expect a higher rate – around €3 (£2.60) – in popular destinations like Ljubljana and Bled.
Depending on the region and accommodation quality, Switzerland’s tourist taxes are usually between CHF 2 (£1.84) to CHF 7 (£6.43) per person, per night.
In Abu Dhabi, hotels typically impose a tourism fee of 6 per cent on guests’ hotel bills, in addition to a fixed fee of AED 15 (£3.20) per room, per night. In Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah, the price varies on the quality of accommodation: fees range from AED 7 (£1.50) to AED 20 (£4.30) per night.
Tourist taxes are not federally legislated in the US; states and regions have the ability to charge varying fees. In San Francisco, for example, the hotel tax rate is 16.25 per cent, which includes a 14 per cent “transient occupancy tax” and a 2.25 per cent “tourism improvement” fee.

NKNE80ITVN_JQHXRXWUYWIG8OC,A shorter leash: Lawmakers push for shorter terms for Arizona’s government agencies,"Mary Jo Pitzl, Arizona Republic","Updated January 23, 2024 at 9:55 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/shorter-leash-lawmakers-push-shorter-140030103.html,"Nearly three dozen state agencies face uncertain futures, with consequences for the citizens they serve.
But unlike previous years, where lawmakers typically extended an agency's lifeline for eight to 10 years, this year lawmakers want a tighter leash.
The road ahead for the Department of Transportation could be four years. Or maybe six. The Department of Homeland Security should get a two-year extension, a Senate committee recommended. But its House counterpart couldn't pin down a number, although members concluded the agency should not be ""sunsetted,"" or recommended for termination.
As for the Arizona Resource Advisory Council, which advises the federal Bureau of Land Management on the use of the 2.1 million acres of BLM land in Arizona? It should die as of July, yet another legislative review panel said.
These and other recommendations will be debated in the coming months as part of the Legislature's duty to periodically review agency performance. Without a continuation, no matter how short, an agency will cease to operate as of July.
The proposed shorter terms are an abrupt departure from past practice. Critics see partisanship in the shift as the Republican-controlled Legislature copes with the first Democratic governor in 14 years.
But lawmakers say they're simply doing their job, shining a light on bureaucratic machinations that don't always serve the public and demanding improvement.
Count Sen. Priya Sundareshan among the skeptics who see the sudden change in practice as a response to divided government. She, like lawmakers of both parties, supports scrutiny of state agencies. But she said this round of proposals is too stringent.
“We are essentially weaponizing the audit process as a way to go after state agencies,"" Sundareshan, D-Tucson said as she voted against a proposal to ""revise and consolidate"" the duties of the Arizona Commerce Authority, the state's economic development arm.
Gov. Katie Hobbs appoints the agency directors, and they report to her. To Sundareshan, the audit process is this year's version of the Senate's director nomination committee, which heavily scrutinized Hobbs' appointees before the whole process dissolved into a legal dispute now in court.
Lawmakers, primarily Republican members, defend the shorter timelines as a way to ensure agencies do their job.
""We believe in responsible government, we believe in effective government,"" Sen. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek said. The Senate Government Committee, which he chairs, recommended two-year terms for the nine boards, committees and agencies it reviewed as a way to set a starting point for future negotiations. For two other entities, the committee recommended revisions to their mission or consolidations.
Hoffman said the two years will buy time for the Office of the Auditor General to do the detailed performance audits required by law.
The founder of the Legislature's Freedom Caucus, Hoffman acknowledged the terms will likely be longer after the full Legislature debates, noting House panels were going for ""very long continuations.""
Not all agencies received shortened extensions.
The Arizona and Prescott historical societies were recommended for eight-year continuations. The Cotton Research Council and the Arizona Power Authority, which manages water distributions from Hoover Dam, also got eight years.
But many others landed in the two- to four-year range after public hearings. That includes Hobbs' Office of Tribal Relations, which received a four-year recommendation from a House panel and two years from the Senate.
""I think four-year continuations for any state agency are a waste of resources,"" Hobbs said after the House vote, noting the process includes an audit and multiple legislative hearings. ""That wasn't really how the system was set up to be. Legislators use these to carry out their political agendas, and it just interferes with government continuation.""
Critics question how an agency can operate well if it's under constant audit. Besides, the Office of the Auditor General is short-staffed, Sen. Juan Mendez, D-Tempe noted.
A full performance audit takes 20 months, according to legislative guidelines. Multiply that by nearly three dozen agencies and the task would seem impossible, he suggested.
Yuma County Sheriff Leon Wilmot drove to Phoenix to promote the state Department of Homeland Security, calling it indispensable for his office's work on border safety.
He urged the Senate Government panel to continue the agency ""for as long as possible.""
In a later interview, Wilmot said the two-year extension recommended by the committee seems fruitless given concerns about the auditor general's ability to handle dozens of audits in a two-year timeframe.
“The reality is it’s not going to happen in two years,"" Wilmot said of the formal, deep dive review done by the auditor general. Plus, he added, his office, as well as the Homeland Security Department, are audited annually by the federal government, due to federal grant oversight.
Sen. Ken Bennett's Education Committee gave 10-year extensions to the agencies it had to review: The state Board for Charter Schools and the Arizona Commission for Post-Secondary Education.
Bennett, R-Prescott, said there was no directive to push for shorter terms, although after his committee's vote, Senate President Warren Petersen asked him to consider eight years instead of 10. Bennett said he was OK with eight years, but nothing less.
Bennett attributed the shorter terms to ""individual members who don’t like stuff happening at agencies, or don’t like agencies themselves.”
A former Senate president, Bennett doubts the auditor general has sufficient staff to do its deep-dive audits every two or four years.
“The best way to keep tabs on an agency is through its annual budget,” he said. If something starts to go awry, lawmakers can put conditions on how its money is spent, he said. If problems persist, lawmakers can dig into individual programs and assert more control.
“You don’t threaten them with terminating,"" Bennett said.
Rep. Matt Gress, R-Phoenix, made a similar observation as a House panel pushed for a four-year continuation for the state Department of Child Safety. Several lawmakers backed a suggestion from Rep. Rachel Jones, R-Tucson, to limit the child welfare agency to two years.
A full-blown audit is not the only tool lawmakers have, Gress said. A better solution is to put stricter controls on the budget and to bring in agency officials to testify before lawmakers.
Sundareshan sees this year's debates as an echo of the arguments over the Arizona Schools for the Deaf and Blind. The agency had received a fairly clean report from the auditor general, and early recommendations were for an eight-year renewal.
But Hoffman intervened, pushing for a shorter timeline in the name of ensuring better educational performance. That set off a series of contentious and high-profile hearings attended by former students and advocates for deaf and blind children. In the end, lawmakers approved a four-year extension.
This year, Senate Democrats introduced a bill to give the school a 10-year extension, although it has yet to be assigned to a committee.
Gil Orrantia and Tim Roemer, two former directors of the Department of Homeland Security, defended the agency they ran under two Republican governors.
“Now is not the time to dismantle and sunset this agency,” Orrantia told a House panel. He cited cyber security concerns as one of the key reasons to keep the agency up and running.

NLJMH215SS_B500TXIHUV5M29H,How YouTube’s climate deniers turned into climate doomers,Kate Yoder/Grist,"January 22, 2024 at 2:00 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/youtube-climate-deniers-turned-climate-170000252.html,"This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.
Imagine if you could walk from your house to anywhere you needed to go in less than 15 minutes: the pharmacy, the bakery, the gym, and then back to the bakery. In a certain, conspiracy-addled corner of the internet, this urban planning concept of “15-minute cities” gets a shady, sinister gloss. Conspiracy theorists evoke COVID restrictions and tout efforts to create walkable cities as steps toward “climate lockdowns.” They warn of a plot by the World Economic Forum to restrict people’s movements, trapping and surveilling them in their neighborhoods.
“They want to take away your cars,” claims Clayton Morris, a former Fox News host, in a YouTube video that’s been viewed 1.7 million times.
YouTube is riddled with false claims like these, so it’s the place to document the evolution of arguments against taking action on climate change. A new report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit based in London and Washington, D.C., working to stop the spread of disinformation, analyzed 12,000 videos from channels that promoted lies about climate change on YouTube over the last six years. Over that time, the reality of climate change long predicted by scientists has become increasingly difficult to dismiss. The report, released on Tuesday, found a dramatic shift from “old denial” arguments—that global warming isn’t real and isn’t caused by humans—to new arguments bent on undermining trust in climate solutions.
“The success is that the science has won this debate on anthropogenic climate change,” said Imran Ahmed, the nonprofit’s founder and CEO. “The opponents of action have shifted their attention.”
The report suggests that, rather than doing a victory lap, climate advocates may want to focus on defending climate policies and renewable energy as necessary and effective. As the world was besieged by intense heat, expansive wildfires, and catastrophic floods in recent years, YouTubers promoting disinformation increasingly embraced “new denial” narratives, such as that solar panels will destroy the economy and the environment, or that the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a “fraud.”
“What it is doing is creating a cohort of people who believe climate change is happening, but believe there’s no hope,” Ahmed said. People start watching YouTube at a young age—in 2020, more than half of parents in the U.S. with a child 11 years old or younger said their kid watched videos on the platform on a daily basis. New polling from the center, released alongside the study, found that a third of U.S. teens say that climate policies cause more harm than good.
Six years ago, these “new denial” claims made up 35 percent of denier’s arguments on YouTube; now, they make up 70 percent of the total. The fastest-growing assertions were that the climate movement is unreliable and that clean energy won’t work.
To get this data, the Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed video transcripts from nearly 100 YouTube channels that spout climate denial, using an artificial intelligence tool to categorize the arguments.
One popular source is the channel of Jordan Peterson, a Canadian psychologist and culture warrior with 7 million followers. In an interview with Alex Epstein, the author of The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, Epstein makes the case that climate advocates can’t be trusted. “Listening to a modern environmentalist is like listening to a doctor who’s on the side of the germs, somebody who doesn’t have your best interests at heart,” Epstein says in a video entitled “The Great Climate Con” that’s been viewed a million times, reiterating a point once made in the 1990s by the economist George Reisman in an article titled “The Toxicity of Environmentalism.”
The report also points to the libertarian think tank The Heartland Institute and the media company BlazeTV, created by the former Fox News host Glenn Beck, as prominent sources of lies about climate change on YouTube. Videos from PragerU, a right-wing media outlet also known for spreading disinformation, paint solar and wind power as dangers to the environment and compare environmental activists to Nazis. Despite what the name may imply, it’s not actually a university, nor does it offer any degrees.
John Cook, a researcher at the Melbourne Centre for Behaviour Change in Australia, has documented a similar rise in attacks on climate solutions by conservative think tanks and blogs. “It’s surprising to see misinformation on YouTube shifting so quickly,” Cook said in an email. “The future of climate misinformation will be focused on attacking climate solutions, and we need to better understand those arguments and how to counter them.”
Some research has shown that climate disinformation is compelling: A recent study in Nature Human Behavior found that it’s often more persuasive to people than scientific facts. And once people latch onto a falsehood, they find it hard to let go. That’s why stopping disinformation at the source is so important, according to Ahmed. “The key right now is ensuring that we aren’t flooding our information ecosystem with nonsense and lies that make it more difficult for people to work out what’s true or not,” he said.
Together, the YouTube channels that the center focused on garnered 3.4 billion views last year. And all those views means there’s money involved: The report found that YouTube is potentially making up to $13.4 million a year in ad revenue from channels that post climate denial.
Google, which owns YouTube, promised in 2021 to ban ads on its platforms alongside content that contradicts the scientific consensus that climate change is happening and caused by humans (though it hasn’t enforced it well). To counter the latest wave of disinformation, the Center for Countering Digital Hate recommends that Google should also prohibit advertisements on content that pushes misinformation about climate solutions, so that YouTubers won’t be incentivized to publish more of it. (Content creators who partner with YouTube receive a share of the ad revenue.)
“If it wasn’t profitable, would so many people see it as being a business to produce bullshit?” Ahmed said. “We’re asking platforms to not reward liars with money and attention.”

NLJOR47CCW_R8C3099JWQIBV3R,Palestinian restaurant Ayat to throw free sabbath dinner after backlash over ‘river to the sea’ menu listing,Jennifer Gould,"January 22, 2024 at 1:26 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/palestinian-restaurant-ayat-throw-free-162634114.html,"A Palestinian restaurant chain owner who took flak for his inflammatory “river to the sea” menu header is hosting a free sabbath dinner on Friday in part to thank his Jewish customers for their support and to foster community.
Restaurateur Abdul Elenani, 31, owns Ayat, a chain of popular Palestinian eateries named after his wife, a 34-year-old lawyer, and the daughter of Palestinian immigrants.
The restaurant caused a stir in the wake of the Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel with its “from the river to the sea” fish options on the menu.
The Anti-Defamation League calls the phrase antisemitic because it implicitly calls for the destruction of the state of Israel and the annihilation of Jews.
Elenani, however, insists the phrase has a different interpretation.
“This mantra stands for Palestinians to have equal rights and freedoms in their own country. In no way does this advocate any kind of violence. It signifies peace, and freedom,” he told Side Dish.
The explanation has been added to the new menus at his latest location in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, which will host the free dinner. It will soon appear on menus at other Ayat outposts.
Elenani’s controversial messaging led to him being targeted with death threats and, almost as bad, the popular chain was hit with bad reviews. But he has remained firm in trying to control the narrative.
“You can’t come to me and translate my verse,” he said. “You should ask me and I will give you my translation. I’m not going to change it because you want to change the meaning to feed your story.”
Perhaps surprisingly, he has received strong support from his Jewish customers, he said.
The sabbath dinner is a way for him to show thanks, though he is still working out details like hiring a kosher caterer.
“I’ve always wanted — even before this shabbat dinner concept — to create something that brings Jews and Muslims together under one roof, and there is no better way than through food,” Elenani said.
The Middle East conflict “shouldn’t impact people here in New York. It doesn’t make any sense. It should unite us more and not separate us.”
Elenani, who grew up in Brooklyn, launched the first Ayat restaurant in 2020, during the pandemic. They’re now in the East Village, Ditmas Park, Bay Ridge, Industry City, Staten Island, and Allentown, Pa.
On social media, Elenani and his wife, Ayat Masoud, posted: “In the spirit of togetherness and understanding, we invite all our incredible neighbors, especially our Jewish neighbors, to a heartfelt shabbat dinner at Ayat Restaurant. It’s not just about breaking bread; it’s about breaking barriers, fostering dialogue, and connecting on a human level…Let’s create a space where differences unite us, where conversations flow freely, and where bonds are forged. Together, let’s weave a tapestry of understanding and compassion that strengthens our beloved community.”
Born in New York to Egyptian immigrants, Elenani says the dinner is also a step towards his ultimate restaurant vision of having both Jews and Arabs eating alongside each other.
“The larger concept I want to roll out is a massive warehouse, with a kosher kitchen on one side, a halal kitchen on the other, and communal tables in the middle,” Elenani said. “Everyone would then sit together at the communal tables to discuss life and normal human things that people discuss with each other.”
The concept is “really needed right now,” he said. “Everybody is going against each other, and no one is thinking about bringing people together. Enough with the negativity! I want to bring opposites together and they aren’t even opposite. We all have a lot of things in common. The separations are stupid, because of politics.”
Elenani also works as a building contractor, and owns a farm in central New Jersey. But his passion is the restaurant business. Pre-pandemic, Elenani launched Cocoa Grinder, a chain of coffee shops in Brooklyn, where they roast their own beans.
Elenani and Massoud are also new parents. They have a 2-month-old daughter.
“She changed everything,” Elenani said. “I’m more soft, less tough — living for another person, and taking care of myself so that I can take care of her.”
Having a child, Elenani said, “makes you question life and question yourself more. The first thing I said to myself when I saw her was, ‘Am I a good person?’ How will she judge me? How will the world judge me?”"

Novatek's gas-condensate plant caught fire at the port of Ust-Luga in Russia's Leningrad Oblast following a possible coordinated effort by Ukraine to strike key targets on deep inside Russian territory, Ukrainian media reported. Ukrainian officials have yet to comment on the alleged attacks that caused explosions and large fires in several Russian cities overnight on Jan. 21.
On Sunday, Russia's Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of launching multiple drone attacks and claimed that one drone was shot down over Tula, four over Smolensk, and one over Oryol.
No casualties were reported by local authorities but other Russian media sources suggested that 150 people had to be evacuated.
Novatek is the largest independent natural gas producer in Russia. According to Bloomberg, the plant processes stable gas-condensate - a byproduct of natural gas - into oil, while also exporting oil products to international markets.
On Jan. 18, Ukrainian intelligence sources alleged that an overnight drone attack that hit an oil depot near St. Petersburg was carried out by Ukraine's military intelligence agency. Ukraine does not always directly claim responsibility for attacks inside Russian territory.

The three-minute ad, scheduled to run a day ahead of the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, shows Cindy Warmbier, Otto Warmbier’s mother, speaking during the launch of Haley’s campaign in Charleston, S.C.
Otto Warmbier was a University of Virginia student who was imprisoned after visiting North Korea on an organized tour.
“My son, Otto, was invited to North Korea on an organized tour. He was taken hostage, tortured, and murdered by the government of North Korea,” Otto’s mother said in the ad, confirmed to The Hill by Haley’s campaign. “When we were begging the Obama administration for help, they told us to be quiet and be patient. Nikki told us the opposite. She told me it’s OK to be afraid, like I am now, but I had to push through the fear.”
While serving as the U.N. Ambassador, Haley built a strong bond with Cindy Warmbier. In the ad, Warmbier touted Haley’s “strength” and “compassion” during the difficult time for the family.
“She told us to be loud and fight back,” the ad says. “To fight for justice. To fight for ourselves. And to fight for Otto. We passed laws in Otto’s name, seized North Korean assets, and helped close down illegal businesses run by the North Koreans.”
The ad seeks to differentiate Haley’s stance on North Korea from that of former President Trump, who has boasted about exchanging letters with dictator Kim Jong Un. Trump did criticize the dictator after Otto Warmbier’s death but later mentioned that he did not believe Kim knew about Warmbier’s mistreatment.
“He tells me that he didn’t know about it, and I will take him at his word,” Trump said. “I don’t believe that he would have allowed that to happen, it just wasn’t to his advantage to allow that to happen.”
The ad is part of an advertising effort by Haley’s campaign and allied PACs who have doubled the amount spent on those expenditures compared to Trump’s political network. The former president’s network has intensified ad spending in the Granite State, hoping to secure the win in the state where he is polling 11.4 percent higher than second-placed Haley, according to the latest The Hill and Decision Desk HQ aggregate of polls. Trump sits at 46.7 percent, while Haley is at 35.3 percent.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Thousands of Ethiopian Orthodox followers gathered in the capital Addis Ababa on Friday and Saturday to celebrate Epiphany, also called Timket, a religious festival commemorating Jesus' baptism in the Jordan River.
The annual festival is recognised by UNESCO as an important intangible cultural heritage.
Followers marched from churches to Jan Meda, an open field in the capital, while priests carried tents called tabots, replicas of the Ark of the Covenant that are sacred in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, one of the world's oldest churches.
Students sung hymns as youth ran ahead of the tabots to cover a street with red carpets to show their respects as priests spread incense and sprinkled holy water.
The faithful wearing white traditional fabrics chanted, sang and bowed down before the tabots.
At the gathering on Saturday, Abune Mathias, patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, underscored the significance and symbolism of the day and called for peace, unity and forgiveness.
He also urged Ethiopia's leaders to work and advocate for peace.
""At the moment our fellow citizens: children, elderly, mothers and sisters are waiting to die because of hunger. Our Christian faith will be in question if we keep quiet,"" he said.
A two-year conflict in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region that ended in November 2022 drove people from their homes, destroyed harvests, leaving widespread hunger in the area.
Although the religious festival was celebrated across the country, in some areas it was disrupted by conflict in the Amhara region.
Gondar, Amhara region's second-biggest city, usually attracts many people during the Timket festival.
But a few days prior to the festival clashes broke out between government forces and Fano, a local militia.
""Many who planned to attend Timket in Gondar have already cancelled their plan,"" a resident of Gondar told Reuters.
Fano has been battling the army since late July, leading the government to declare a state of emergency in the region.

AYODHYA, India (Reuters) - A grand temple to Hindu god Lord Ram opens on Monday on a site in India millions believe is his birthplace, in a religious spectacle led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi months before he seeks a rare third term in elections.
The construction of the temple is a 35-year-old, central promise of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a contentious political issue that helped catapult the party to prominence and power.
Hindu groups are portraying the inauguration ceremony in the northern city of Ayodhya as the peak of Hindu awakening after centuries of subjugation by Muslim and colonial powers.
It is also being seen as the virtual launch of the deeply religious strongman Modi’s re-election campaign for general elections due by May.
The temple site was bitterly contested for decades with both Hindus and Muslims laying claim to it and was a flashpoint for violence after a Hindu mob in 1992 destroyed a 16th century mosque which stood there.
India's majority Hindus say the site is the birthplace of Lord Ram, and was holy to them long before Muslim Mughals razed a temple at the spot and built the Babri Masjid or mosque there in 1528.
In 2019, the Supreme Court handed over the land to Hindus and ordered allotment of a separate plot to Muslims.
On Monday, Modi will take part in the culmination of rituals to inaugurate the temple, for which thousands of members of BJP and its affiliates, religious leaders and devotees from across the country are expected to gather in Ayodhya.
Some of India’s top business leaders, movie actors and sportspersons have also been invited for the consecration, organisers said.
RELIGIOUS OUTPOURING, POLITICAL CONTROVERSY
“The Lord has made me an instrument to represent all the people of India during the consecration,” Modi said on X as he began 11 days of special rituals ahead of the inauguration.
Calling it a “historic moment” when Lord Ram will take his place in his grand temple, Modi has urged Indians to light lamps in their homes and neighbourhood temples on Monday evening and once again celebrate Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights which usually falls in October-November.
“The consecration of the temple feels more like the launching of the general election campaign rather than a religious ritual,” said Prithvi Datta Chandra Shobhi, a political commentator who teaches at Krea University in southern India.
“The prime minister appears to inhabit the role of an emperor who is undertaking a major ritual sacrifice,” he said.
The temple has been built on a 2.67-acre (1.08 hectares) site inside a 70-acre (28.33 hectares) complex and only its first phase is ready. The second and final phase is expected to be completed in December 2025.
The project is estimated to cost 15 billion rupees ($181 million) and is entirely funded by donations from within the country.
India has witnessed an emotional outpouring among Hindus ahead of the consecration, with residential colonies and markets flying holy flags, organising special prayers and making plans to show the live telecast of Monday’s event on giant screens.
The inauguration has also sparked a political controversy with major opposition parties, including the main opposition Congress, declining invitations to attend saying it had been converted into a political, Modi event.
Muslim groups were not happy with the 2019 court verdict which gave the site to Hindus but said they would accept it “with humility”. Nearly five years on, they indicated they had moved on.
“The construction of the temple is going on as per the direction of the Supreme Court, so we welcome it. I don't think there's any feeling of ill-will in the Muslim community,” said Zufar Ahmad Faruqi, head of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation that is building a new mosque in Ayodhya about 25 km (15 miles) from the temple.

NSSWDKZ46C_RBG82F45JLI8XJV,A Hindu temple built atop a razed mosque in India is helping Modi boost his political standing,SHEIKH SAALIQ,"January 21, 2024 at 2:10 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/hindu-temple-built-atop-razed-051045621.html,"NEW DELHI (AP) — Three decades after Hindu mobs tore down a historical mosque, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the consecration of a grand Hindu temple at the same site on Monday in a political move to boost his party ahead of a crucial national vote.
Experts say the temple, dedicated to Hinduism’s most revered deity Lord Ram, will cement Modi’s legacy — enduring but also contentious — as one of India’s most consequential leaders, who has sought to transform the country from a secular democracy into an avowedly Hindu nation.
“Right from the beginning, Modi was driven by marking his permanency in history. He has ensured this with the Ram Temple,” said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, an expert in Hindu nationalism and author of a book on Modi.
Many see the temple's opening as the beginning of the election campaign for Modi, an avowed nationalist who has been widely accused of espousing Hindu supremacy in an officially secular India. Modi’s Hindu nationalist party is expected to once again exploit religion for political gain in the upcoming national elections in April or May and secure power for a third consecutive term.
Made into a national event by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, the temple’s opening in Ayodhya — a small city in northern India that has been a historical flashpoint — is expected to resonate deeply with Hindu voters.
Many of Modi's supporters see him as responsible for restoring Hindu pride in India, where Muslims make up a little more than 14% of the population.
“What is being done in Ayodhya, the kind of scale at which it is being built at the moment is actually going to make it look like the Hindu Vatican, and that is what is going to be publicized,” Mukhopadhyay said. “Modi is not going to lose a single opportunity to try to sell the accomplishment of having built a temple.”
Built at an estimated cost of $217 million, Ram Temple is central to Hindus who believe the Lord Ram was born at the exact spot where Mughal Muslims built Babri Mosque in the 16th century on top of temple ruins. The mosque was demolished by Hindu mobs in December 1992, sparking nationwide riots that killed more than 2,000 people, mostly Muslims. It set in motion events that redefined the politics of social identity in India and catapulted Modi’s BJP from two parliamentary seats in the 1980s to its current political dominance.
In the early 1990s, then a little-known local leader in his native Gujarat state, Modi also helped organize public agitation that aimed to shore up support for the construction of what is now Ram Temple at the former Babri Mosque site.
Muslim groups waged a decadeslong court battle for the restoration of Babri Mosque. The dispute ended in 2019 when, in a controversial decision, India’s Supreme Court called the mosque’s destruction “an egregious violation of the rule of law,” but granted the site to Hindus. The court granted Muslims a different plot of land in an isolated area.
That fraught history is still an open wound for many Muslims, and some say the temple is the biggest political testament yet to Hindu supremacy.
“There is a fear that this government and all the affiliates, they want to wipe out all traces of Muslim or Islamic civilization from the country,"" said Ziya Us Salam, author of the book “Being Muslim in Hindu India.”
Indian Muslims have increasingly come under attack in recent years by Hindu nationalist groups, and at least three historical mosques in northern India are embroiled in court disputes due to claims made by Hindu nationalists who say they were built over temple ruins. Hindu nationalists have also filed numerous cases in Indian courts seeking ownership of hundreds of historic mosques.
""On the one side, they want to change names of all cities which have a Muslim-sounding name. On the other side, they want to get rid of virtually every mosque, and the courts are happy to accept petitions on whatever pretext,” Salam said.
Rebuilding the temple at the disputed site has been part of BJP's election strategy for decades, but it was Modi — rising to power in 2014 on a wave of Hindu revivalism — who finally oversaw that promise after attending its groundbreaking ceremony in 2020.
In the lead-up to its opening, Modi asked people to celebrate across the country by lighting lamps at homes and in local shrines, saying the temple will be a symbol of “cultural, spiritual, and social unity.” His government has also announced a half-day closure of all its offices Monday to allow employees participate in the celebrations. Modi has released postage stamps on Ram Temple, and live screenings of the ceremony are planned across the country.
In many cities and towns, saffron-colored flags, a symbol of Hindu nationalism, have become ubiquitous. A number of other politicians, high profile movie stars, and industrialists are also expected to attend.
But the event will also be marked by some conspicuous absences.
Some opposition leaders are boycotting the ceremony, while denouncing it as a political gimmick and accusing the government of exploiting religion for political gain. Four key Hindu religious authorities have refused to go the opening, with two of them saying consecrating an unfinished temple goes against Hindu scriptures, and that Modi is not a religious leader and therefore not qualified to lead the ceremony.
Salam said Modi has erased a line between the state and the religion by making his faith a public exhibition that has energized his hardcore supporters.
“When was the last time he acted as a prime minister? There have been so many instances where he has just behaved either as a BJP leader or as a Hindutva mascot, seldom as the prime minister of India,” Salam said."

Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his wife were spotted arriving at the Philippine Arena via helicopter on Friday.
Critics have called this a misuse of government resources.
Mr Marcos Jr's office defended the move, citing ""unforeseen traffic complications"".
The head of Mr Marcos' Presidential Security Group (PSG), Brig Gen Jesus Nelson Morales, said in a statement published on Saturday that the ""unprecedented influx of 40,000 individuals eagerly attending a concert"" resulted in traffic complications, and that this posed a security threat to the president.
Brig Gen Morales went on to ask for the public's understanding, adding that the ""continued understanding and support for these measures are crucial in maintaining the safety and well-being of our nation's leadership"".
The Philippine Arena, located deep in the suburbs, is usually around 40 minutes by car from the presidential palace - absent the capital's notorious traffic jams. By public transport, the same route can take one to two hours.
Mr Marcos Jr and his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos were among the thousands of fans who attended Coldplay's concert at the Philippine Arena, the world's largest indoor arena.
Videos and photos of the first couple drew ire from social media users, who criticised the use of taxpayer money by Mr Marcos, who is the son and namesake of the late strongman president whose rule ended nearly four decades ago in a historic ""people power"" revolution.
""Using official resources, like the presidential chopper, for personal and non-official activities is generally considered an abuse of power or misuse of government resources,"" Facebook user James Patrick Aristorenas said in a post on Saturday.
""We paid for the use of the chopper, fuel and security, who knows even for the tickets for everyone,"" Facebook user Arvine Concepcion said.
In a survey published on Friday, Metro Manila topped the 2023 TomTom Traffic Index list of metro areas with the slowest travel time, taking an average time of 25 minutes and 30 seconds to travel 10km in the region. This has been blamed on creaking infrastructure and an inadequate public transport system.
Filipino office workers in the Metro Manila area often spend hours stuck in traffic. Many wake up before dawn in order to get to work on time.
According to news site Rappler, Coldplay's front man Chris Martin also remarked on the Philippine traffic, thanking fans for braving it to see the band live.
""We've seen some traffic. But I think you have the number one [traffic] in the world. Thank you for making the effort...to be here,"" he said."

NYTR17TR59_FWMZBM4VRV9AJHM,We must fight this creeping anti-Semitism,Danny Cohen,"January 22, 2024 at 3:00 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/must-fight-creeping-anti-semitism-180000185.html,"Picture the scene. A café in a prosperous part of a city. Three men are enjoying coffee and pastries. They know each other well, enjoying the company.
Then one of them starts talking about “The Jews”, telling his friends about their malign influence on the local area. He speaks loudly, he is uninhibited. Lots of people hear him. No one intervenes.
Across the city, two young women are chatting on a crowded bus. They are 19 or 20 years of age. They discuss shopping for a while and then move on to their next topic.
“Don’t the Jews make you feel sick? People are finally seeing them for what they are … They are getting their comeuppance …”
The women are not whispering. They are not quietly conspiratorial. They are brazen in their racism. They clearly feel it is OK to express these views loudly, clearly and in public.
That same week, two men are walking down a busy street, talking loudly within earshot of passers-by. The conversation is led by a smartly dressed man in his late 40s. He too is talking about “The Jews”. He is unabashed. “The Jews, the Jews … it’s because the Jews …”.
The city where all of these incidents took place is not Berlin in 1936. It is London in 2024. The conversations were heard by Jewish people I know.
Something is shifting in our country. The open abuse of Jews is being normalised. This hatred is not just to be found at the pro-Palestine marches that dominate central London on Saturdays. It is finding its way more widely into life in Britain’s towns and cities, our schools and universities, our places of work, and it is increasingly taking place without challenge, without consequence.
This change has taken place since the pogrom in Israel on October 7. Despite the fact that it was Jewish people who were the victims of a racist, genocidal attack, it is Jews who are facing a level of racism in the UK that many of us have not experienced in our lifetimes.
It is the openness of this anti-Jewish racism that feels new, and that tells us something significant and troubling. It is becoming increasingly permissible to express anti-Semitic sentiments in public spaces. It is becoming increasingly frequent for young Jewish students to feel unsafe on university campuses. It is becoming increasingly common for Jewish employees to feel ostracised in the workplace.
Doubtless, Jew-hatred existed in the UK before October 7 but it tended to be more the occupation of the far-Right, of anti-Semitic Islamists, of Left-wing academics and Corbyn outriders.
Now, it’s seeping into the soil of everyday life, what you hear on the train, what you pass by on the street, the conversation in the café. It is as dangerous – if not more dangerous – than those marches with their genocidal chants and calls for the destruction of Israel.
The question is what can be done about it. This should matter to all of us. What begins as hatred of Jews does not end there. The prejudice spreads, the discord grows, our social cohesion comes under ever more pressure. Liberal democracy begins to fray.
I believe very strongly that there is a silent majority in Britain – of all ethnicities and backgrounds – who do not subscribe to these anti-Jewish prejudices. They deplore the racism and hatred they have seen on the marches. They are horrified by the massacre in Israel in October and understand that the genocidal terrorists of Hamas must be defeated. They know that the Jews of Britain – small community that it is – are typically hard-working, committed citizens who contribute a great deal to public life.
So, I respectfully call today for the often quieter voices of tolerance, reason and respect to become louder.
If you see anti-Jewish prejudice being experienced by your colleagues at work, speak up. If you are a university lecturer who can see that Jewish students do not feel safe, do something about it. If you are a police officer, take Jew-hatred as seriously as any other form of racism. If you are a politician, make it clear where you stand on anti-Semitism.
And, whoever you are, if you have a friend or acquaintance who starts talking about “The Jews”, make sure they know that their prejudice will not be tolerated. It simply has no place in our country.

NZLVLZONYP_6YVU1IVJJ09N3RW,U.S. raids Chinese auto parts maker in Ohio,Mark Moran,"January 22, 2024 at 5:13 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/u-raids-chinese-auto-parts-201338301.html,"Jan. 21 (UPI) -- U.S. Department of Homeland Security officers have searched a Chinese auto parts maker that a congressional committee has accused of trade fraud.
DHS officers executed the search warrant at Harco Manufacturing Group in Moraine, Ohio, on Thursday, according to the Dayton Daily News. Harco is a subsidiary of Sunsong, the Chinese parts manufacturer. Sunsong acquired Harco in 2015. The address for Harco is the same address Sunsong North America lists on its website.
There is growing concern among U.S. lawmakers that some Chinese companies are evading U.S. tariffs, the news portals Axios and Bloomberg have reported.
The search was ""part of an ongoing federal investigation,"" a DHS spokesperson told Dayton Daily News.
In September, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party in September wrote a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas accusing Qingdao Sunsong of moving some of its production to Thailand to evade U.S. tariffs.
The letter identified Qingdao Sunsong's public filings, which say the company's products are subject to U.S. import tariffs of 25% imposed on certain goods made in China and that ""in order to reduce tariff costs, the issuer has accelerated production in Thailand.""
In the letter to Mayorkas, Republican congressmen Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and Darin LaHood of Illinois called Sunsong's actions a ""case of blatant trade fraud that is having a catastrophic impact on American manufacturers.""
""The use of transshipment to evade United States tariffs is a serious violation of U.S. law and undermines American economic and national security,"" the lawmakers wrote.
The Biden administration has kept many of the tariffs that the Trump administration imposed on China beginning in 2018.
China has not met its commitment laid out in a 2020 trade deal with the U.S., which required the country to increase its purchases of U.S. goods and services."
NZXOU3V4Z9_U14PVCQMSKM8MQL,President Sisi says Egypt will not allow any threat to Somalia or its security,Reuters,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 3:09 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/president-sisi-says-egypt-not-120038831.html,"CAIRO (Reuters) -Egypt will not allow any threat to Somalia, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Sunday after Ethiopia said it would consider recognising an independence claim by Somaliland in a deal that would give it access to a sea port.
The remarks were the strongest yet made on the issue by Egypt, which already has frosty relations with Ethiopia, and were a sign that Cairo may get involved in a dispute that has raised fresh tensions in the volatile Horn of Africa.
Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991 but has not won recognition from any country. The port lease deal, which was agreed earlier this month but not yet finalised, would be a boon to landlocked Ethiopia and has enraged Somalia.
""Egypt will not allow anyone to threaten Somalia or affect its security,"" Sisi said, speaking at a news conference with visiting Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud.
""Do not try Egypt, or try to threaten its brothers especially if they ask it to intervene,"" he added.
In a Jan. 1 memorandum of understanding, Ethiopia said it would consider recognising Somaliland's independence in return for the port access. It would lease 20 km (12 miles) of coastland around the port of Berbera, on the Gulf of Aden, for 50 years for military and commercial purposes.
Ethiopia's current main port for maritime exports is in the neighbouring country of Djibouti.
""My message to Ethiopia is that ... trying to seize a piece of land to control it is something no one will agree to,"" Sisi said, saying cooperation on development was a better strategy.
Ethiopia on Sunday rejected criticism from Egypt over the deal, saying it was merely a commercial agreement aimed at securing access to the sea and not an attempt to annex land.
""It isn't annexation or assumption of sovereignty over the territory of any state,"" Redwan Hussien, national security advisor to Ethiopia said in a post on X.
Egypt's foreign minister last week called Ethiopia a source of instability in the region, which the country's foreign ministry said was ""irrelevant"".
Relations between Egypt and Ethiopia, which share use of the Nile River, have been tense for years over a major dam Ethiopia has built on the Blue Nile.

O1CPTRS33D_CWJ5ILO3DPN7SY1,Tucker Carlson And Fox News' History Of Lies,Candace McDuffie,"January 22, 2024 at 1:00 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/roundup-fox-news-most-racist-203000866.html,"There’s a very real possibility of Donald Trump selecting former Fox host Tucker Carlson as his vice president if he secures the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. During an interview with Newsmax’s Rob Finnerty, Donald Trump Jr. stated that Carlson becoming Trump’s VP “ clearly would be on the table.” The disgraced media personality rose to fame on a network that promoted white supremacist rhetoric and falsehoods. As a reminder, here’s a brief history of Fox’s most heinous lies.
Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, who hosts the show Tucker Carlson Tonight, has pushed the heinous notion of “great replacement” theory for years. It states that white people are in danger of becoming a minority in the US due to immigration policies and social movements. This racist rhetoric was connected to the motive behind the violent Buffalo massacre that target Black people last year.

Pete Carroll is spilling hot tea all over the Emerald City
Fox News host Tucker Carlson couldn’t help himself when he said that the 2020 police brutality protests were “definitely not about Black lives.” He didn’t stop there as he added: “Remember that when they come for you, and at this rate, they will. Anyone who has ever been subjected to the rage of the mob knows the feeling. It’s like being swarmed by hornets.” The backlash Carlson faced was imminent.
The reason Dominion Voting Systems’ is currently suing Fox News is for saying that the election technology company helped rig the 2020 presidential election (a claim that Donald Trump notoriously asserted). Recently, Rupert Murdoch’s testimony was made public as part of the lawsuit. The chairman of Fox News’s parent company admitted in a deposition that “some of our commentators were endorsing” the lie that the election was stolen.
Last year, Tucker Carlson went on a tirade on how the hiring rules have become altered under the Biden administration and that Karine Jean-Pierre, like Kamala Harris and Ketanji Brown Jackson, was picked for the role of White because she satisfies a Democratic diversity quota—and nothing else. “It’s really simple. Show us your picture, and we’ll tell you if you’re qualified for the job,” he stated.
In 2019, Laura Ingraham—host of Fox News show “The Ingraham Angle”— rallied behind white supremacists who she believed were unfairly censored on social media. This included the likes of Alex Jones, Candace Owens and Milo Yiannopoulos. Although hate should always be de-platformed, Fox rallied behind Ingraham. “Anyone who watches Laura’s show knows that she is a fierce protector of freedom of speech,” the network said.
A lot of ridiculous things have come out of Megyn Kelly’s mouth—she notoriously defended blackface after all. Back in 2013 during her show “The Kelly File,” she declared that Jesus is white. “I just want the kids watching to know that,” she said. “How do you revise it in the middle of the legacy, of the story, and change Santa from white to Black?” Even though evidence has shown that Jesus was born in Palestine, racism always defines logic.
Shortly before he was fired by Fox News in 2017, Bill O’Reilly spent years saying that racism is not a real problem in America and that if it is, it’s white folks who suffer. During his “Talking Points Commentary” in 2016, O’Reilly said that “the left in America is demanding that the Electoral College system put into place in 1787 be scrapped” since “the left wants power taken away from the white establishment.” He also said that the biggest desire for Democrats is that “white working-class voters [becoming] marginalized.”
In 2016, Michelle Obama gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention in which she talked about the progress American society had made by referring to the fact that the White House was built by slaves. In response, the opportunistic racist that O’Reilly is couldn’t help but say that those same slaves “were well-fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government.” In addition, he said that “Michelle Obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the White House” but “there were others working as well.”
In 2022 during a broadcast, Fox News host Harris Faulkner told viewers that migrants at the southern border “make our country look like what they left” and “our people” are now forced to clean up their “excrement.” “The Faulkner Focus” often mimics the views of Tucker Carlson, pushing the horribly racist ideology that immigrants make America “poorer and dirtier.”
Fox host Jesse Watters has always used his platform to promote racist stereotypes of Asian people. In 2016, he did a series of mocking interviews in New York’s Chinatown. It was so horrible that New York Mayor Bill de Blasio condemned the segment. Two years later, Watters used his show to make jokes about a New York Times editorial board hire, Sarah Jeong. Watters later apologized.
In 2019 during his impeachment trial, Donald Trump tweeted: “All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here—a lynching. But we will WIN!” Of course, Fox News couldn’t wait to side with the delusional former president. Host Lisa Boothe agreed with the statement, saying: “I think the context and the point that President Trump was trying to make is that this is a terribly unfair process. Objectively, it is. I mean, you have Democrats holding this impeachment inquiry in secret, selectively leaking certain information.” The network always manages to grossly outdo themselves whenever it gets the chance.

Community members are still grieving the loss of innocent lives, including Kevin Leung, a Kung Fu instructor at Star Ballroom who had to explain the tragedy to his young students.
Devastated families of hit-and-run victims in Southern California seeking justice
A year later, he says the students are doing well thanks to the help of their families.
“We’ve been very fortunate to have a lot of support from the families and also the different members of the community,” Leung told KTLA 5’s Annie Rose Ramos. “We actually were taken in by some of them [who gave] us a home, and it helped us have that conversation and help [the students] feel safe, and that was really important.”
Star Ballroom has remained closed since the massacre, and Leung believes it will stay that way for now.
Rainfall, winter weather arrives in Southern California
“I think that, especially for a lot of Asian folks, it’s still a sensitive spot,” he said. “Even though they had the Buddhist ceremony to let the dead move on, [people] look at this place and still feel that little sense of uneasiness, and I think that still weighs heavily on people’s minds.”
A candlelight vigil remembering the victims is scheduled for 6 p.m. Sunday at the Monterey Park City Hall Front Lawn.  For more information, click here.
The perpetrator of the deadliest mass shooting in Los Angeles County history was identified as 72-year-old Hemet resident Huu Can Tran.
Tran entered the Lai Lai Ballroom in nearby Alhambra 20 to 30 minutes later armed with a semi-automatic pistol that had an extended large capacity magazine “probably with the intent to kill more people,” L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna said at the time.
A 26-year-old man named Brandon Tsay disarmed him when he entered the dance hall, saving countless lives.
After a standoff with law enforcement, Tran died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound roughly 25 miles from the scene.

O4IEI9GSUU_5VU0I3KP79ZE4I6,Inside the pressure campaign ahead of Ron DeSantis dropping out,Shelby Talcott,"January 22, 2024 at 5:07 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/inside-pressure-campaign-ahead-ron-200725160.html,"The pressure campaign for Ron DeSantis to drop out of the presidential race reached a fever pitch — both publicly and internally — as he prepared his exit. He made it official Sunday afternoon in a post on X, and endorsed Donald Trump.
“Clearly the base is not ready to move past Trump,” said a DeSantis supporter close to his campaign, who noted even his staunchest Florida-based backers wanted him to drop out sooner rather than later. “Iowa was critical for DeSantis and he did everything right in the state, but he couldn’t pull off a win in even one county. It’s bad for America. DeSantis would have been an outstanding president, but unfortunately it is the current state of this primary.”
Bloomberg first reported Sunday that the Florida governor’s team was beginning exit discussions, trying to figure out the best time and place to drop out. While he endorsed Trump immediately in his video, it doesn’t appear that there was coordination with Trump’s team on that announcement.
Once seen as the conservative darling who could take on Donald Trump, the Florida governor’s supporters have widely recognized the bitter reality over the past few weeks: That it just might not be Desantis’s time. The seeds of doubt among his allies and some donors began months ago, when Nikki Haley began gaining momentum in the race. Even back then, DeSantis began facing quiet pressure to drop out, sources say.
But after a second place finish in Iowa (30 points behind Trump) and seemingly no path to win New Hampshire or South Carolina, the push for him to suspend his campaign reached its height. Publicly, top conservative pundits like Laura Ingraham and The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board have called on him to suspend his campaign. Meanwhile, he also faced a barrage of internal pressure, with donors and top Floridians who want him to be viable in 2028 quietly urging his campaign to give up.
Trump’s team has said they’d welcome DeSantis dropping out — and his endorsement — despite the bitter rivalry between the two over the last year.
“I think we should welcome Gov. DeSantis and all of his supporters into the warm embrace of MAGA,” Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz told Semafor on Saturday. “He’s got a lot of successful years ahead in Florida. We’ve got to pull together and win this thing. Joe Biden’s the enemy, not each other.”
Trump’s team saw DeSantis’s remaining voters as likely converts — conservatives who disagreed with Haley on foreign policy, and who’d been told by their candidate and conservative media that Haley was a corporate shill.
“The majority of his voters come to us,” Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita told Semafor. Polling from CNN and the University of New Hampshire released Sunday morning found Trump hitting 50% for the first time, as supporters of Vivek Ramaswamy came over en masse.
Tim Scott, another Trump rival, endorsed the former president ahead of the New Hampshire primary. Even before his victory in Iowa, the overwhelming majority of House and Senate endorsements were for Trump."
O767M4NHYX_VA9W9K7KGEY14BX,Watch: Donald Trump 'honoured' by DeSantis endorsement,Tony Diver,"January 22, 2024 at 7:04 PM·15 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-suspends-2024-presidential-campaign-201239198.html,"Donald Trump’s campaign said he was “honoured” to be endorsed by Ron DeSantis, after the Florida governor dropped out of the Republican primary race on Sunday and admitted he did not have a “clear path forward to victory”.
In a surprise move, Mr DeSantis suspended his campaign two days before the New Hampshire primary vote, where he was expected to suffer heavy losses to both Mr Trump and Nikki Haley.
In a statement posted on X on Sunday afternoon, Mr DeSantis gave Mr Trump his endorsement for the presidency, referencing his earlier promise to support any Republican nominee in the general election.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” he said, adding that while he had “disagreements” with the former president, he was a better choice than Joe Biden.
He criticised Ms Haley, who polls show is currently in second place in the state, declaring that her “corporatism” would make her a poor president.
Mr DeSantis thanked his family and campaign staff, and repeated the themes of his campaign.
“We launched this campaign to bring accountability to government, regain sovereignty at our border and restore sanity to our society,” he said.
“We cannot succeed as a country if we allow our nation to be invaded, our currency to be debased, our cities to crumble and our kids to be indoctrinated.
“The DC elites who facilitated this mess, do not care about you, and they do not work for you.”
Welcoming the endorsement, Mr Trump’s campaign said: “With only a few days left until President Donald J. Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, we are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates.
“It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.”
Mr Trump himself added that his derogatory nickname for his rival - “Ron DeSanctimonius” - was “officially retired”.
Ms Haley said Mr DeSantis has “run a great race” and repeated her campaign message that the primary was now a contest between her and Mr Trump.
She said: “All the fellas are out, and this comes down to: What do you want? Do you want more of the same? Or do you want something different?”
Read all the updates below to see how the news unfolded
We’re closing this blog now, but here is a reminder of what has happened this evening.
Ron DeSantis announced he was suspending his presidential campaign, in a surprise move that leaves Nikki Haley the only contender left to beat Donald Trump in the primary.
The Florida governor praised Mr Trump in a lukewarm endorsement, telling supporters that he would be a better president than Joe Biden. He reminded Republicans he had promised to support whichever nominee the party chose.
Mr Trump welcomed the endorsement and promised to stop ridiculing him. Ms Haley said his decision to withdraw reinforced her message that the campaign is a “two-horse race”.
Just two days remain before the New Hampshire primary, which analysts say is the last opportunity for Ms Haley to demonstrate she could beat Mr Trump to the nomination. If she performs poorly here, the party will hold a coronation for Mr Trump at this summer’s Republican National Convention.
As Ron DeSantis’s presidential dream comes to an end (for now), it’s a good time to share this interview from last year, with Allister Heath.
In the piece, the Florida governor talks wokery, Disney and why Britain feels like a second home to him.
You can read it here.
Ron DeSantis was seen as a distant third-place finisher in New Hampshire even before ending his campaign today.
The Florida governor visited the state for the first time as a major 2024 primary candidate in June. After his 30-point drubbing in Iowa, where he had committed most of his time and resources, he surrendered New Hampshire before a single vote was cast.
Mr DeSantis actually spent the weekend campaigning in South Carolina, which hosts its primary election in five weeks.
But dismal poll numbers don’t mean DeSantis had no support at all in New Hampshire.
With him having aimed for the most conservative factions in the GOP coalition and then endorsing Donald Trump, it’s possible his formal departure adds votes to the former president’s vote totals.
Could that be the difference between Trump managing a narrow victory over Haley or garnering a clear majority that he then uses to declare the nomination a done deal before Haley gets her home-state shot at him?
Ron DeSantis had reckoned on a Republican Party that had tired of the 77-year-old, criminally indicted Mr Trump, but it took just one state to vote in the party’s nomination contest to shatter that illusion.
He staked all on Iowa, a state where evangelical Christians decide its victors. He championed family values with his central casting wife and children in tow, and a dedication to service as he stressed his military career.
Read Rozina Sabur’s take on how the Florida governor went from chief Trump challenger to yesterday’s man in one vote.
Bob Good, the chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, has issued a statement endorsing Donald Trump just minutes after Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign.
I want to thank Ron DeSantis for the outstanding campaign that he ran, and for being such a tremendous conservative leader. We all owe him our appreciation for putting the country first, and recognizing that it is time to rally behind President Trump as our 2024 nominee.

In his only direct reaction to the news - other than a statement from his campaign - Donald Trump has posted a poll showing he would be more likely to beat Joe Biden in a head-to-head race.
The graphic is designed to dispel one of Mr Haley’s main campaign lines - that she would beat Mr Biden by a landslide, while Mr Trump and Mr Biden are even and “within the margin of error”.
Here is the full statement released by the Trump campaign just now:
“With only a few days left until President Donald J. Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, we are honoured by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates. It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.
“Nikki Haley is the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement. From higher taxes, to decimating Social Security and Medicare, and to open borders, she represents the views of Democrats more than the views of Republicans.
“It’s time to choose wisely.”
Nikki Haley has said Ron DeSantis “ran a great race” as she told a crowd in New Hampshire: “There’s now one fella, and one lady left”.
Speaking to supporters on a campaign stop, she said: “He ran a great race, he was a good governor, and we wish him well.
“Having said that, there were fourteen people in this race. There were a lot of fellas.
“All the fellas are out, and this comes down to: What do you want? Do you want more of the same? Or do you want something different?”
The Trump campaign swiftly turned its fire onto Nikki Haley and what it described as her “dopy chief surrogate”, New Hampshire governor Chris Sununu, writes David Millward.
“If Nikki Haley loses in New Hampshire - there are only two options,” the campaign said in an email to supporters.
“Option A:  Nikki Haley drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden (where, in the latest Harvard-Harris poll, Trump bests Biden by double the margin a now-fictional Haley vs. Biden match-up would be).
“Option B:  Nikki Haley prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARASSED in her home state of South Carolina after she gets zippo votes or delegates in Nevada, because Haley entered the Nevada Primary, rather than the Nevada Caucus, where 100% of the state’s delegates are actually awarded.”
Never Back Down - the Super PAC supporting Ron DeSantis’s presidential bid - has released a statement on his withdrawal from the race.
Like him, they note that he had promised to support the successful Republican nominee, and appear to suggest this is the only reason he is now backing Donald Trump.
The group also refers to Mr DeSantis as “THE conservative candidate”, in a swipe at the former president.
Ron DeSantis continues to do for Republicans across America what he has done for everyone in Florida - keep his promises.Governor DeSantis kept every promise he made to Florida voters, and as THE conservative candidate for President, he promised to support the #GOP nominee.… https://t.co/IHrooB6ikG

It is “kind of amazing how poorly” the DeSantis 2024 campaign went, Christopher Galdieri, professor of politics at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, told my colleague David Millward.
“He spent from the start of Covid into his second term as the one true Trump alternative, he would offer everything people liked about Trump without the chaos, but it just didn’t come together.
“A lot of the hard core culture war stuff  he was doing was not appealing to mainstream Americans. It gave Trump the opportunity to appear more  reasonable.”
This afternoon’s video on X came with a short message from the Florida governor, apparently quoting Winston Churchill.
“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,” he wrote.
While the campaign is obviously not continuing, the quote may be a nod at a possible run for Mr DeSantis in the 2028 presidential race.
There are already Republican strategists who believe he wasted his campaign this time, and should have waited until Donald Trump was out of the frame.
Alas, the quote appears to be apocryphal. The International Churchill Society says on its website that the former prime minister never said those words, after “careful research in the canon of fifty million words by and about Churchill, including all of his books, articles, speeches and papers”.
The surprise exit of Ron DeSantis, two days before the Republican primary, is a boost for Nikki Haley.
For days she has been telling audiences that the primary is a “two-horse race” between her and Donald Trump - but now that is actually true.
However, there is unlikely to be much crossover between her supporters and his, and this result is more likely to entrench Mr Trump’s lead even further.
The battle for her campaign will now be to convince Trump sceptics in the Republican Party, and maybe even some of his supporters, that she would do a better job.
Ron DeSantis had become known for his love of aggressive slogans about woke culture and the Washington elite, and his video withdrawing from the Republican primary race provided a few more of them.
He took some time to tell his supporters that he was dropping out - first delivering a short speech about what he believed he achieved and the purpose of his campaign.
“We launched this campaign to bring accountability to government, regain sovereignty at our border and restore sanity to our society,” he said.
“We cannot succeed as a country if we allow our nation to be invaded, our currency to be debased, our cities to crumble and our kids to be indoctrinated.
“The DC elites who facilitated this mess, do not care about you, and they do not work for you,” he continued.
“They work for themselves. They seek to accumulate power at your expense, to pursue an agenda that is harmful to the American people. Citizens do not serve politicians. It is the duty of politicians to serve you.”
The latest polling from New Hampshire was not looking good for Ron DeSantis. Although he came second in Iowa -- by a whisker -- his campaign had dedicated almost all of its resources to the first state in the hope of gaining some momentum.
The dominance of Donald Trump in Iowa and his poor polling numbers in later states has clearly forced the Florida governor’s hand.
Here is how the polls looked as of this morning:

Ron DeSantis’s statement supporting Donald Trump is hardly a ringing endorsement of his old rival.
“While I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden,” he said.
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honour that pledge.
“He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican Guard of yesteryear, or repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.
“The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology, are over.”
The first sign that Mr DeSantis was planning to withdraw came on Saturday night, when he cancelled two scheduled media interviews on CNN and NBC, while Never Back Down, his Super PAC, cancelled events in New Hampshire, citing scheduling issues.
Mr Trump’s campaign seized on the apparent turmoil in Mr DeSantis’s camp, with staff posting online that the “end is near”.
Mr DeSantis’s decision came as polls showed he was expected to receive around six per cent of votes in the New Hampshire primary, where Mr Trump and Ms Haley are competing for first place.
His campaign has suffered in recent days following a disappointing performance in the Iowa caucuses last Tuesday, where he secured 21 per cent of the vote and only narrowly beat Ms Haley.
Mr DeSantis had poured significant resources into Iowa, hoping to be in contention to win the vote or close that gap between himself and Mr Trump, who won a landslide.
Ron DeSantis has withdrawn from the Republican primary race, leaving just Donald Trump and Nikki Haley battling for the nomination ahead of New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday.
The Florida governor said he did not have “a clear path to victory” and was suspending his campaign to endorse Donald Trump.
In a video posted on X, he said that while he had “had disagreements with Donald Trump”, he was “superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden”.
“He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear,” he said.
“Following our second place finish in Iowa, we’ve prayed and deliberated on the way forward,” he said.
“If there was anything I could do to produce a more favourable outcome – more campaign stops, more interviews – I would do it.
“But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory.
“Accordingly, I am now suspending my campaign.”

Lord Walney has submitted a report to Rishi Sunak setting out new measures on policing protests amid growing concern at the way masked activists have chanted anti-Jewish slogans, waved pro-Hamas material and clashed with officers at recent pro-Palestinian demonstrations.
There are fears over the spread of the US-style tactic adopted by “black bloc” anarchist protesters intent on violence who wear dark clothing, ski masks, scarves, sunglasses and motorcycle helmets to hide their identities.
The new powers proposed in the review by Lord Walney, the former Labour MP John Woodcock, would give police powers to make a ban on masks an explicit condition before a march could go ahead. The same condition would apply to fireworks and flares.
If the organisers refused to agree, police would be able to ban the march - and bar future demonstrations if they failed to abide by the conditions.
The move goes beyond current police powers in the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act where police officers can demand the removal of masks by protesters.
Section 60 of the Act enables police to issue an order allowing them to demand the removal of masks in a specific area where they believe there is a threat of violence or disorder.
The move is backed by former Home Office ministers Robert Jenrick and Dame Priti Patel. “Face coverings are being deliberately used by law-breakers to disguise themselves and intimidate the public. The impunity for extremists on our streets must end,” Mr Jenrick told The Sun.
Ms Patel said the public was “incensed by the selfish and disruptive actions of these groups”.
The review is also understood to recommend that Pro-Palestine march organisers should be charged to help cover the costs of policing. Lord Walney believes there is a case for charging because of the “great amount of police resource” being absorbed by the protests.
Since the October 7 attack by Hamas and Israel’s military response in Gaza, London and many other UK cities have been convulsed by pro-Palestine marches. The total cost of policing the protests is estimated to have reached more than £20 million.
Appearing before MPs in December, Matt Twist, the assistant commissioner for the Metropolitan Police, said that between Oct 7 and Dec 8 his force had spent £17 million on the protests.
Describing it as the “greatest period of sustained pressure on the Met since the Olympics in 2012”, he said the Met had used 28,000 officer shifts to deal with the protests along with 1,600 shifts provided by other police forces.
He also revealed that 5,500 rest days had been cancelled and that over 6,000 hours of officer time was being used to investigate 800 open hate crimes.

O9CH2RBRX1_94UBXK4QUSVHB9K,Was Sturgeon just following WhatsApp guidelines by hitting delete?,David Wallace Lockhart - BBC Scotland political correspondent,"January 21, 2024 at 10:47 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/sturgeon-just-following-whatsapp-guidelines-134758042.html,"Questions about Scottish government WhatsApps from the pandemic era have rumbled on for months.
There have been claims that some messages were handed over too slowly, and even accusations of exchanges being deleted.
Right now, the figure in the spotlight is Nicola Sturgeon.
Last week the counsel to the UK Covid Inquiry said the former first minister appeared to ""have retained no messages whatsoever"" from the pandemic.
In a statement issued yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon said messages communicated through ""informal means"" were handed to the inquiry last year.
She conceded that messages had not been ""retained"" on her own device, but said she had obtained copies which she'd passed over.
Ms Sturgeon stressed that she acted in line with Scottish government policy.
Covid Inquiry has my informal messages, says Sturgeon
Sturgeon's Covid WhatsApp messages 'all deleted'
Deleting WhatsApp messages was 'pre-bed ritual'
This has prompted some to ask how guidance can have been followed if messages were not kept on the former first minister's phone.
Here things get a bit complicated. Government guidelines in this area are complex.
The Scottish government brought in new mobile messaging guidance in November 2021 - in the midst of the pandemic. This spells out how ministers should approach informal messaging systems, such as WhatsApp.
Officials and ministers are allowed to use these apps to conduct business, with the guidance stating ""you must transcribe the salient points of any business discussions and/or decisions in a mobile messaging app into an email or text document"". This should then be saved centrally.
In other words, you can make decisions and have government discussions on WhatsApp, provided you then copy that information and save it.
This will then be stored exactly as official minutes, records etc would be. Crucially, it will be accessible to the public under Freedom of Information laws.
Once this has all been done, the guidance states ""you must delete business conversations in the mobile messaging app"".
So the Scottish government policy therefore actively encourages the deletion of conversations on apps like WhatsApp.
The thinking is that the relevant information has now been saved centrally, and so it's safe to get rid of the original conversation.
What's the logic here? Well, bearing in mind phones can be lost or stolen, you could make the argument that it's sensible to regularly clear them of government conversations.
This potentially explains how Nicola Sturgeon can say she hasn't retained messages on her own device, but was able to submit ""copies"" to the inquiry.
This could also explain her statement - issued on social media yesterday - that she has always ""acted in line with Scottish government policy"".
Though there are still important questions to be asked about all of this.
Why does there appear to be a difference in how ministers have approached retaining messages? Humza Yousaf insists he kept all of his from the pandemic. As does the former Finance Secretary Kate Forbes.
The explanation for this may be that this guidance is… guidance. It's not hard and fast rules, and therefore some ministers may have taken a different approach.
Many will also question guidance that essentially allows ministers and officials to mark their own homework.
After all, it looks like it's left up to them to determine which messages are relevant and should be saved for posterity, and which should be chucked into a digital wastebasket, never to be seen again.
And some would say that a looming public inquiry should have led to all ministers keeping everything on their phones intact.
As this guidance is put under the spotlight, it's likely that opposition politicians will question how fit for purpose it is.
When it comes to how civil servants and ministers interpreted all of this, and how assiduously they followed it, that's something known only to each individual.
Nicola Sturgeon will get the opportunity to spell all of this out when she appears in front of the UK Covid Inquiry in the coming weeks."

OB2VSN72WO_8S1OX827WW3O6NY,Opinion: Microschools Take Center Stage with New Opportunities for Learning for 2024,Andrew Campanella,"January 22, 2024 at 1:01 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/opinion-microschools-center-stage-opportunities-160100479.html,"Last year, the landscape of K-12 education transformed as a record-breaking 20 states expanded school choice options. However, that is not the only school choice story to come out of 2023. As the nation steps into 2024, a fresh emphasis on innovation has emerged, along with new options for families. This is particularly true within the realm of microschooling.
Microschooling is an education model that is small by design — typically with 15 or fewer students of varying ages per class. It fosters a personalized and community-centric approach to learning that is especially effective in addressing the unique educational needs of diverse student populations. Programs like Education Savings Accounts are helping to fuel these microschools.
ESAs are instrumental in democratizing education. By providing direct funding to parents, they empower families with the financial means to make educational decisions that best suit their children while helping schools outside the conventional system truly flourish.

For example Black Mothers Forum Microschools, a growing network in Arizona that focuses on culturally nuanced and inclusive education, is thriving in large part because of the state’s ESA program. It serves over 70,000 students statewide in nearly 400 learning environments and makes innovative schools like Black Mothers Forum Microschools far more accessible to families, while inspiring parents to explore the full breadth of education options available for their children.
Opening doors for such exploration is at the heart of the school choice ethos. Whether for a microschool, traditional public school, public magnet school, public charter school, private school, online school or home school, the more options a family can pursue, the better. These will be on full display during National School Choice Week, an annual nationwide celebration hosted by the National School Choice Awareness Foundation in collaboration with Navigate — The National School Choice Resource Center.
For National School Choice Week, our team is partnering with microschools and organizations across the country to celebrate these new options. For example, Positively Arts Microschool will host a school fair in Nevada to showcase microschools and other choice options. Meanwhile, Microschool Florida will host a fun-filled microschool/hybrid/homeschool showcase event with guest speakers, vendors and activities. And in Georgia, Black Microschools ATL will recognize the work parents and volunteers do to make these options possible.
National School Choice Week is, however, far more than just a packed calendar of unique events and activities. The week serves a vital dual purpose: raising awareness about the critical need for increased educational options and providing practical, jargon-free online resources for parents. With 57% of families saying they will likely be searching for new schools for their children in 2024 and 64% wanting more information about how to exercise their choices, the week acts as a crucial juncture for empowering parents with the knowledge and tools to make informed decisions.
A fundamental shift is taking place in education, and National School Choice Week is shining light on every possible option. As more than 27,000 schools and organizations celebrate all that has been accomplished in school choice this past year and embrace this new era of educational innovation in microschooling, ESAs and other school choice programs, the future beams bright with promise. Everyone who supports greater opportunity in education – –from parents to grandparents, educators, advocates, organizational and community leaders to state policymakers– – should recommit to doing all they can to keep this momentum going in 2024 so that, one day, all families will have the full breadth of educational freedom they so rightfully deserve."

The 2024 frontrunner discussed beating GOP rivals Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who came in second, and former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who came in third in the Iowa primary.
Trump hit back at Haley after she questioned the former commander-in-chief’s mental capacity after he appeared to mix her up with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during a rally this week.
""She’s just trying to get a little nasty because she came in third place. She wanted to come in second. And she wasn’t even that close, actually, to second. You know, I have to give that to Ron De-sanctimonious,"" Trump said, referring to his penchant for coming up with nicknames for his opponents. Most recently, Trump referred to Haley – the daughter of Indian immigrants – as ""Nimbra,"" referring to her birth name of ""Nimrata.""
FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEY SAYS IT'S ‘ABSOLUTELY’ POSSIBLE FORMER PRESIDENT IS CONVICTED
Haley earned 21,085 caucus votes, or just under 20% in Iowa, putting her behind second-place finisher Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who had 23,420 votes, or 21.2%. Trump trounced all of his challengers, winning an outright majority at 51%, with 56,260 votes in a historic caucus victory that resoundingly confirmed his frontrunner status.

That frontrunner status was further cemented later Sunday when DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Trump.
Responding to Haley’s assertion that Trump’s political indictments have become a liability on the campaign trail, Trump dismissed them as ""Biden indictments.""
""He is bad for democracy … He is very dangerous,"" Trump said of his Democratic rival in the White House. ""He can’t win fair and square. The guy can’t put two sentences together.""
Trump also took shots at Fani Willis, the Fulton County District Attorney who was accused of having an improper romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she appointed to prosecute the election interference case against the former president.
""They did this. This is all political stuff, and it’s a very bad thing for our country,"" Trump said. ""And remember, that goes the other way too. If a Republican gets in … they can do the same thing to a Democrat.""
On the question of a potential pick for vice president, Trump said: ""There’s no rush to that.""
New Hampshire’s first-in-the nation primary comes Tuesday, January 23 – just two days after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he was suspending his campaign.

A British man studying at an unidentified US university has revealed the three stupidest things he’s heard his classmates say, prompting disbelief about the seemingly poor state of education in America.
The English student, who has not disclosed his real name, took to TikTok to list the moronic remarks in a viral video that has been viewed more than 1.7 million views.
First, the TikTokker claimed he’d had an American peer say to him: “Considering you’re European, your English is really good.”
When the Brit tried to explain that it was because he hailed from England, the classmate appeared confused as to whether or not England was considered a part of Europe.
Additionally, it appears some US students seem to think Australia and England are the same place.
“A lot of Americans get the Australian and English accent mixed up,” the TikTokker stated, saying it was “fair enough” if they weren’t used to hearing either dialect.
But the Brit claimed that someone once asked him: “Oh, you’re from the UK? That’s like Australia, right?'”
“When I said ‘No, that’s like the UK,’ she said: ‘Are those two things [England and Australia] not the same thing?'” he recalled.
Thirdly, the TikTokker said he had once spent an hour trying to convince an American friend that English villages still exist and aren’t just a fictional concept that appear in the computer game “Minecraft.”
Thousands of viewers flocked to the comments section to shame the American students for their uneducated remarks.
“You have to remember college in the US is like elementary school in England,” one snarked.
“Going to the US from the UK is a real step down,” another savagely stated.

OEYYQHCHQW_TAMNHQA40C7KVBN,A Divided Congress Is About to Let Poor Families Fall Off a Hunger Cliff,Grace Segers,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·9 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/divided-congress-let-poor-families-110000028.html,"The Biden administration has warned that a key nutrition assistance program will face a significant funding shortfall this year, potentially preventing millions of low-income women and children from receiving necessary benefits. Unless Congress provides an additional $1 billion, participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC, may be pushed onto waiting lists, or could lose their benefits altogether.
On Thursday, Congress passed a stopgap funding measure to keep the government funded through March; however, it did not include additional funding for WIC. It’s still unclear whether Congress will be able to finalize the appropriations bill for the U.S. Department of Agriculture before the new deadline of March 1—or whether that measure will include the $1 billion needed to make up for WIC’s funding shortfall.
Senator Patty Murray, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, indicated that keeping WIC funded would be a priority as lawmakers continue to finalize spending bills in the coming weeks. “As I’ve said repeatedly: Failing to fully fund WIC for the first time ever is not acceptable to me—and as we continue working to negotiate and pass full-year spending bills, I am fighting to ensure WIC has the resources it needs to keep serving eligible families and help kids thrive, just as it has for decades,” Murray said in a statement.
The program, which is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary this year, has historically been a bipartisan priority. Because it is not an entitlement program, WIC needs to be funded annually. Congress has passed sufficient WIC funding on a bipartisan basis every year since 1997, meaning that the current struggle over the program is unprecedented in the twenty-first century.
“For the first time in this millennium, WIC is in danger of having to turn families away from the program,” said Nell Menefee-Libey, the senior public policy manager at the National WIC Association. “Congress kicking the can down the road twice now means that there would be a much smaller portion of the fiscal year left to make up a funding shortfall.”
The previous short-term government funding measures passed in the fall of last year granted USDA additional flexibilities to ensure WIC remained fully funded; this came after USDA told Congress that more funding was needed. As the agency and states are spending money at a faster rate to keep the program afloat through March, USDA has warned the shocks will be even greater at the end of the fiscal year when those resources are expended. The $1 billion shortfall would be equivalent to around a month and a half of benefits for all WIC recipients, and six months of benefits for all pregnant women and infants.
Without the funds to keep up with current demand, many states will likely implement waiting lists. The move would have a staggered impact on different populations of recipients: It will initially affect postpartum mothers who are not breastfeeding, followed by children ages 1 through 5 who don’t have serious health issues, and finally pregnant and breastfeeding women and their infants. But even these cost-reduction measures may not be enough to close the funding gap; certain participants could see their benefits suspended or even discontinued. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning policy research organization, estimates that roughly two million eligible parents and children could be turned away from the program by September if the current funding levels for WIC are not extended.
The seeming lack of bipartisan urgency on keeping WIC fully funded could be attributed in part to larger struggles over government funding. Many hard-line conservative Republicans in the House have complained that the continuing resolutions keeping the government funded have not made more dramatic cuts to non-defense programs. Additional funding for WIC has now also been entwined in the public consciousness with pandemic relief spending, said Kelly Horton, the chief program officer at the Food Research and Action Center. As coronavirus relief measures approved by Congress included flexibilities to streamline WIC enrollment and an increase in cash voucher amounts, politicians may associate new funds for WIC with continuing emergency pandemic funding—a particularly unpopular prospect on the right, which believes there should be a return to pre-pandemic spending.
“The vital nutrients that are provided with WIC, particularly through the fruits and veggie voucher program, they’re really essential, and they make the program palatable and of interest to moms and their kids,” said Horton. “Unfortunately, that’s gotten caught up in the … rollback of everything that was happening during the pandemic. And I think folks have lost sight of the fact that we’re talking about hunger with moms and kids.”
WIC is a critical program for the nation’s low-income mothers and young children; in 2022, nearly 40 percent of all infants in the United States received WIC benefits. Research has found that maternal WIC participation is associated with a lower risk of preterm delivery and infant mortality, increased preventive care and better cognitive development for children, and purchasing of healthier foods for mothers and children. The program helps participants buy certain food items, and provides vouchers for pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding parents to purchase fruits and vegetables. It also offers breastfeeding support and health care screenings and referrals.
Emily Church, a mother living in Millfield, Ohio, has relied on WIC in the infancy and early childhood of both of her children: her son Kayson, now 19, and her 3-year-old daughter, Myles Mae. “The package includes $26 in cash [vouchers], fruits and vegetables, eggs, milk, cheese, and peanut butter—I often say, it’s close to probably at least an $80 value, if not more, when all is said and done,” Church said.
But Church, who is employed at a local creamery and is currently working on her bachelor’s degree, relies on WIC for more than financial assistance. It provides resources such as recipes and health and wellness tips, and tracks her daughter’s milestones. When her son was born, WIC specialists taught her how to breastfeed.
As she is no longer breastfeeding, Church worries that her family would be “first on the chopping block” if WIC is not fully funded. “It makes me feel fearful. It makes me feel angry,” Church said. “I’m already working and doing everything I can to make ends meet, and trying to better myself along the way. And you know, that’s a lot for my budget to be gone.”
Despite its importance, WIC is often underutilized by the population that needs it most. A recent report by USDA found that WIC served just over 51 percent of those eligible in 2021. (However, preliminary data shows an increase in WIC participation in 2023.) There are already some challenges to participating in WIC, including the inability to buy WIC-approved items online, although some states have launched pilot programs to allow for electronic purchase. There are also stringent requirements for stores to participate in WIC, including some larger stores, which may not carry WIC-approved brands or meet program criteria.
Moreover, nine states—including Ohio—are “offline” states, meaning that participants must physically visit a WIC office to load their benefits onto their cards. (Those states also tend to have a lower participation rate compared to the national average.)
There are efforts in Congress to improve access to WIC, including bipartisan legislation that would allow participants to certify their eligibility for the program online. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, the bill’s Republican lead co-sponsor in the House, said that he hoped the bill could be attached to a larger legislative vehicle in the future. “It’s the right thing to do, but also it makes sense from an economic standpoint as well, because it’s the most efficient way to take care of this problem,” Fitzpatrick said about the efficacy of WIC in serving low-income families.
However, while advocates outside of Congress would like to expand and streamline WIC to make it easier to access, keeping the program afloat is the first priority. “As long as the house is on fire, we can’t really think about renovating,” Menefee-Libey said.
The states that have the highest participation rates could run out of resources more quickly. In North Carolina, for example, where more than 60 percent of those eligible participated in WIC in 2021, state Health and Human Services Secretary Kody H. Kinsley said, “federal funding has already forced us to implement cost-saving measures to manage the WIC program under continuing resolutions.”
“If funding for this program continues to be starved, implementation of additional cost-savings measures may be necessary, including the possibility of a waitlist for some participants or making immediate program cuts,” Kinsley said in a statement. “WIC services are critical for ensuring a healthy start for North Carolina children, and not fully funding it would have long-term fiscal impacts to the program and long-term consequences for families and children that will not be able to access healthy food.”
Horton also noted that many WIC agencies were still understaffed in the wake of the pandemic, which has contributed to an increased waiting time for applications to be processed. “We’ve heard of various states where people are waiting for hours on the telephone line to get an appointment to get in to get their benefits,” said Horton.
Lack of funding could also contribute to lower rates of participation in the WIC: If mothers knew they could be placed on a waiting list, it may further discourage eligible people from enrolling. However, while the threat of being pushed onto a waiting list may discourage some enrollment, it could also push many families into relying ever more on food banks while they wait to obtain benefits.
“We think when somebody is trying to feed their family, they’re going to do everything they can. So they may get on the waitlist, and then they’re going to do what they can to get their family food, and it’s just going to be more frustrating for them,” Horton continued.
Church, the WIC participant in Ohio, speaks publicly about what the program means to her family because she wants lawmakers to understand its importance—and encourage them to take the impending shortfall seriously. “I would just implore them to look at why WIC exists, and the impact that it makes in so many people’s lives,” she said."
ON0JNPGD8A_Z10SZ56ILWWJ9YY,DeSantis supporters more likely to back Trump as second choice in New Hampshire: Poll,Lauren Sforza,"January 22, 2024 at 6:42 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-supporters-more-likely-back-214256149.html,"Supporters of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are more likely to support former President Trump as their second-choice candidate in New Hampshire than former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, according to a new poll.
The poll from CNN/University of New Hampshire (UNH) was released just hours before DeSantis announced he would be dropping out of the 2024 presidential primary and endorsing Trump on Sunday. The poll found that 62 percent of likely GOP New Hampshire voters who selected DeSantis as their first-choice candidate chose Trump as their second-choice candidate, while 30 percent chose Haley as their alternate candidate.
The poll comes just days before New Hampshire voters cast their ballots in the GOP primary election on Tuesday, where Haley is hoping to pull off an upset in the Granite State. Haley has gained on Trump in the state in recent weeks and is now trailing the former president by 11 percentage points, according to the CNN poll.
The CNN poll showed Trump with 50 percent support and Haley with 39 percent as DeSantis polled significantly behind.
The results of this poll suggest DeSantis’s supporters in New Hampshire may help boost Trump in the state. However, the poll also found that just 6 percent of voters selected the Florida governor as their first-choice candidate.
DeSantis endorsed Trump for the nomination in a video message Sunday.
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear: a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents,” DeSantis said.
The CNN/UNH poll was conducted between Jan. 16 and Jan. 19 among 2,348 respondents, including 1,242 likely 2024 Republican primary voters. The poll has a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points among likely New Hampshire GOP primary voters.

Handberg announces the continued success of the Middle District of Florida’s relentless fight against fraud related to COVID-19.
>>> STREAM ACTION NEWS JAX LIVE <<<
The collaborative efforts of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and the United States Attorney’s Office’s (USAO-MDFL) Criminal, Asset Recovery, Appellate, and Civil Divisions have successfully identified, investigated, and prosecuted fraud schemes.
“The Middle District of Florida United States Attorney’s Office continues to pursue, investigate, prosecute, and recover money from those who were engaged in major or sophisticated fraud schemes designed to steal benefits intended for Americans coping with the myriad impacts of the pandemic,” said U.S. Attorney Roger Handberg.
Since March 2020, the Middle District of Florida COVID-19 Fraud Task Force has actively prosecuted 77 defendants involved in fraud schemes exploiting federal programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL), Unemployment Insurance (UI), Main Street Lending Program (MSLP), Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP), and government Healthcare programs like Medicare (HCF). The collective aim was to defraud the United States of over $85 million, with 56 defendants already found guilty and 21 awaiting prosecution.
In fiscal year 2023, the Task Force indicted 26 COVID-19 fraud-related cases seeking more than $15 million from various federal programs. Notable convictions include Denis Casseus, sentenced to two years for bank fraud, and Vitalii Chychasov, sentenced to eight years for conspiracy to commit access device fraud and trafficking in unauthorized access devices.
The Asset Recovery Division and federal seizing agencies have completed the forfeiture of over $20 million in fraudulently obtained EIDL, UI, and PPP funds, recovering proceeds for victims. An additional $18 million in pandemic fraud proceeds are pending civil or criminal forfeiture.
The U.S. Attorney General has established the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force to enhance efforts in combatting and preventing pandemic-related fraud. For more information on the department’s response to the pandemic, visit justice.gov/coronavirus.
The Middle District of Florida COVID-19 Fraud Task Force investigations have been conducted by various law enforcement agencies, with cases prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys throughout the Middle District of Florida.

ONMFSWCUB4_TOVNVIVKA38W9B8,South Africa's Zuma a no-show at rally but fans keen for comeback,Zama LUTHULI,"January 22, 2024 at 1:19 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/south-africas-zuma-no-show-161942100.html,"Supporters of South Africa's embattled former president Jacob Zuma's newly-formed radical left-wing party said Sunday they hope he might soon be the country's leader again, even though he failed to show up at their rally.
In a small stadium in Tembisa township, some 40 kilometres northeast of Johannesburg, a small crowd of about 300 gathered in anticipation of seeing their hero, singing anti-Apartheid struggle songs and sporting T-shirts with the ex-leader's face.
""I am here to see Zuma... he has always been a part of my life from the time I was also a student activist to formally joining the liberation movement,"" Mandla Khoza, an MK party supporter told AFP.
The 59-year-old father of four said he hoped the party could ""make a difference"", in a South Africa troubled by failing infrastructure, a weak economy and violent crime.
Last month Zuma announced he would be campaigning for the recently formed Umkhonto We Sizwe (MK) party, named after the former armed wing of the ruling African National Congress (ANC).
The southern African country is expected to hold its general elections in the next few months, but Zuma, a former ANC stalwart who has already served two terms as president and has a conviction for contempt of court, so is theoretically barred from standing for elected office.
His supporters dismiss this, and his new movement could influence the result if it recruits voters from President Cyril Ramaphosa's ANC, which has been in government since 1994.
Under a scorching sun, marshals ushered a sea of excited and chatty supporters wearing the party colour, green, into a shaded pavilion.
The leftist party was formed in September last year by ""concerned"" former soldiers of the previous MK, according to Khayanga Setlatjile, a coordinator for the event and himself a one-time anti-Apartheid combatant.
""There's no person who's got love for his nation like a soldier,"" he said, adding that there was ""no better person"" than Zuma, a former leader of the ANC armed wing, to head the movement.
But, perhaps concerned by the small turn-out in Tembisa, he added: ""We want to get rid of this notion that this is Zuma's party"".
- 'Zuma will be president'-
After hours of waiting, the former president did not show.
But Siphamandla Zondi, a politics professor at the University of Johannesburg, told AFP that the small-size of the heavily-trailed event does not mean the party has no potential to build support.
""It indicated that there was inadequate organisation, particularly with those on the ground... as a result this is a bit of an embarrassment,"" he told AFP.
Organisation is ""a skill they should learn very quickly"", Zondi said, but ""in politics a day is a very long time. They've shown they have massive support in other provinces like KZN, and they've done it in Mpumalanga"".
Recently there has been controversy around the idea that Zuma, who has been elected as president twice before, might run office again, this time as a challenger to the former comrades in the ANC.
According to the constitution ""no person may hold office as president for more than two terms"".
But the party is not phased.
""President Zuma can run, there is nothing stopping him,"" party spokesman Nhlamulo Ndhlela told AFP.
Ndhlela called for constitutional reform, arguing: ""If the will of the people is such that President Zuma must be president then we must change the constitution to ensure that that happens.""
According to Setlatjile, the party is yet to hold a conference to elect a permanent leader and leadership committee, which is likely to happen after the elections, and thus Zuma is an interim party leader.
""Zuma will be president,"" Ndhlela declared.

OSDZAFO3EY_PVPNT1TUELCTDDD,When will snow finally melt? It could in the next few days depending on these factors,"Ryan Wilusz, Knoxville News Sentinel","January 22, 2024 at 6:19 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/snow-finally-melt-could-next-211914831.html,"Snow has remained on the ground amid freezing temperatures, but the cold air is not the only factor when it comes to East Tennessee's winter precipitation melting away.
Temperatures are not expected to rise above freezing until Jan. 22 when there's a projected high of 42 degrees in Knoxville. But the current sunshine could begin to accelerate melting even before temperatures rise, meteorologist Jeanie McDermott of the National Weather Service in Morristown told Knox News.
While icy driving conditions are among the top concerns, the roadways could be one of the first surfaces to melt.
""The traffic makes a big difference,"" McDermott said. ""You're getting friction from the tires, and you're getting warm exhaust.""
Depth also plays a role, McDermott said, but that can be deceiving. Shallow snow might just be more dense and compact due to recent freezing rain.
The good news is no more freezing rain is expected, though there's a 30% chance of rain during the day Jan. 23 and a 60% chance that night in Knoxville − both times when temperatures are projected above freezing. Typical rain also can accelerate the melting process, McDermott said.
But the rain won't matter if the snow melts Jan. 22, which is a possibility due to continued sunshine and above-freezing temperatures.
If it doesn't all melt Jan. 22, McDermott said, it's likely to melt Jan. 23.
Any moisture on the road when the sun goes down Jan. 21 could refreeze overnight, so drivers should be cautious.
Knoxville crews were still reporting ice patches the morning of Jan. 21 − even on some main roads − as they continued to treat them with calcium chloride.
""The additive helps the salt to do its job more effectively when temperatures plummet,"" the city of Knoxville said in Facebook post Jan. 20. ""However, as temperatures drop into the single digits tonight, even CaCl has its limitations.""
City spokesperson Eric Vreeland told Knox News that after roads froze again overnight, crews would start salting and plowing hosital routes, transit routes and problem spots ""and then will spread throughout the city and clear more streets.""
Police warned drivers residential and side streets are still hazardous: ""If you must go out, take it slow.""
Jim Snowden, Knox County Engineering and Public Works' chief engineer, told Knox News the county had started on residential streets, but snow and ice are taking longer to melt than he'd like.

OSZWQNS4E9_AZMBUI0RC77M66P,Aryan Nations would not qualify as ‘domestic terrorism’ under this new Idaho bill,Ian Max Stevenson,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/aryan-nations-not-qualify-domestic-110000349.html,"Idaho lawmakers have introduced bills that civil rights organizations say weaken state laws aimed at combating homegrown, organized violence and extremist groups.
The two bills would remove Idaho’s ban on private armed militias and institute a definition of “domestic terrorism” that excludes most American groups conducting organized violence.
Senate Bill 1220, from Senate Majority Leader Kelly Anthon, R-Burley, would add a definition for “domestic terrorism” but would require such activities to be “done in cooperation with any foreign terrorist organization,” according to the bill. The legislation would also add a similar requirement for the definition of “terrorism.”
Anthon told lawmakers that his motivation for introducing the bill, which has failed to pass in three prior years, is to prevent Americans “exercising their rights” from being labeled as domestic terrorists.
Anthon noted a controversy in 2021, when the National School Boards Association sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking him to look into threats and intimidation of school board members. Threats against local elected officials rose in prevalence amid fierce debates about school curricula and COVID-19 policies. The association said at the time that some of the threats could be classified as domestic terrorism, and the U.S. attorney general later issued a memorandum that federal law enforcement would investigate criminal behavior directed at school staff members.
Anthon said the bill would prevent federal authorities from telling a local sheriff that a person who has not been charged or gone to trial is a domestic terrorist, and “you need to go round him up.” Anthon did not provide examples of Americans being labeled domestic terrorists and arrested without cause, but told the Idaho Statesman “you don’t have to be put in prison to have your life ruined by a label of domestic terrorism.”
“I think there have been policy decisions, particularly on the part of the federal government, that threaten our rights as American citizens,” Anthon told a legislative committee.
Amy Marshak, legal director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law, said that the altered definition of domestic terrorism flips the federal definition “entirely on its head.”
While federal law can punish people for providing “material support” to a foreign terrorist organization, there is no comparable crime for domestic terrorism. But federal law nonetheless defines domestic terrorism, and the term can be used to increase the sentence of a person convicted of a related crime.
The federal definition of “domestic terrorism” includes acts that are “dangerous to human life” and appear to “intimidate or coerce a civilian population,” “influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion,” “affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping” and occur primarily within the U.S.
Homegrown extremist groups could still potentially be penalized under Idaho’s Terrorist Control Act for “conspiring” to injure or threaten other citizens, Marshak said. But the proposed changes would make organized violence from groups like the Ku Klux Klan or the neo-Nazi group Aryan Nations, which was based out of North Idaho, subject to the statute’s lowest penalties — up to 10 years in prison versus up to life in prison — because they would no longer meet the definition of “domestic terrorism.” Only if the violence were in coordination with a foreign extremist group would the law’s harshest penalties apply.
“It would really fundamentally alter that law” and “turn it into the opposite definition from what it is generally understood as,” she said. In doing so, it would restrict “the prohibitions on dangerous, violent behavior that have been prohibited in Idaho for a long time now.”
The bill would also rescind a provision in the law aimed at combating “civil disorder” through organized violence that has been a part of Idaho law since the 1980s. Twenty-six states have laws on the books that prohibit such “civil disorder,” which the Anti-Defamation League, an organization founded in the early 1900s to combat antisemitism, pushed for to combat extremist violence. Idaho passed its own law in the late 1980s, when state officials were hoping to restrict the Aryan Nations. A splinter group later assassinated a Jewish radio host in Denver and bombed a synagogue.
“It’s stunning to me that we’re 40 years away and our memory is so short,” Stephen Paolini, the ADL’s associate regional director for the Pacific Northwest, told the Statesman. “This statute was designed to address groups like the Aryan Nations.” He added that the ADL has tracked a rise in extremist violence in recent years.
He said the altered definition would not only be inconsistent with federal law but also other law enforcement entities nationwide, which acknowledge terrorism grown in the U.S.
“You’re really just saying there is only one kind of terrorism, and it’s foreign terrorism,” he said.
Anthon specified that, in cases where extremist organizations like white supremacist groups commit organized violence, other state laws already criminalize that behavior.
Paolini argued that terrorism statutes are designed to bring additional penalties to bear on efforts to dismantle the government, or to terrorize minority groups, which the law change would undo.
Republican lawmakers Friday voted to recommend the bill’s passage and moved it to the Senate floor. Sen. Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, opposed the recommendation, while Senate Minority Leader James Ruchti, D-Pocatello, supported it “with some reluctance.”
At the same committee meeting, Sen. Dan Foreman, R-Viola, introduced a bill to repeal Idaho’s prohibition on private militias.
The law forbids a “body of men” outside of the government from associating “together as a military company or organization, or parade in public with firearms in any city or town of this state,” but the law is currently not enforced, according to previous Statesman reporting.
Foreman, who introduced a similar bill last year that failed, said he thinks the law infringes on Americans’ constitutional rights to bear arms and peacefully assemble.
“Freedom of assembly is a right that is not predicated on the citizens’ agreement to refrain from carrying firearms,” he said.
“If we try to limit constitutional rights for anybody … to enhance safety, we take the first step down the road where someday none of us will have constitutional rights,” Foreman said.
Senate Pro Tem Chuck Winder, R-Boise, said he wants to explore ways of implementing an “enhanced crime” when gun-toting bands intimidate groups of peaceful protesters.
Ruchti said he thinks that First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly can be threatened by guns and therefore can conflict with the Second Amendment.
“That’s what concerns me, is we’re somehow equating them,” he said. “We’re somehow saying that they can be used simultaneously when I don’t think that’s accurate. I just don’t think they mix well.”
Wintrow was the lone no vote on introducing the bill to the Senate.
Paolini, of the ADL, said his organization also had serious concerns about repealing the militia prohibition and pointed to an instance in 2022 when members of a far-right organization called the Patriot Front were arrested after descending on a Pride parade, many with shields and shin guards, according to The Lewiston Tribune. Some of those arrested have been convicted of conspiracy to riot.
“When groups are acting that way, particularly when they have these kinds of long-term, violent movements behind them, it really runs the risk of creating conditions for really serious violence in our communities,” he said."

OUQI85S62V_M96B6YWP0LEZJ7V,Nicola Sturgeon faces criminal investigation over deleted WhatsApp messages,Simon Johnson,"January 21, 2024 at 11:24 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nicola-sturgeon-faces-criminal-investigation-142434400.html,"Nicola Sturgeon is facing a criminal investigation over deleting her WhatsApp messages from the pandemic after bereaved families instructed lawyers to prepare a police complaint.
Aamer Anwar, lead solicitor of the Scottish Covid Bereaved group, said he had been instructed to make a complaint to Police Scotland.
He said he would also ask the ­Information Commissioner’s Office to investigate “any potential breaches of the law” after the UK Covid Inquiry heard on Friday that “no messages whatsoever” had been handed over by Ms Sturgeon.
Mr Anwar told the Sunday Mail there were “severe consequences for those in power who choose to delete information with the intention of preventing its disclosure to a public inquiry”.
Three relatives who formed a campaign group after their mothers died in 2020 at Almond Court care home in Glasgow said they were also considering a police complaint.
The UK Government wrote to all devolved governments in June 2021, February 2022 and October 2022 asking for material of potential relevance to be kept and not destroyed.
Under the Inquiries Act 2005, it is a criminal offence if someone intentionally suppresses, conceals, alters or destroys a “relevant” document. Offenders face a large fine or even prison.
WhatsApp messages may also need to be retained to comply with Freedom of Information laws. David Hamilton, the Scottish Information Commissioner, said on Saturday: “Some of the material presented at the inquiry is deeply concerning, and will be considered further by my office.”
Following months of obfuscation by Ms Sturgeon, Jamie Dawson, KC, counsel to the inquiry, confirmed on Friday that “no messages whatsoever” or notebooks were handed over by the former first minister.
John Swinney, who was deputy first minister during the pandemic, erased his messages using an “auto-delete” function.
It also emerged that Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland’s national clinical director, told his colleagues that “WhatsApp deletion is a pre-bed ritual” – less than 24 hours after the UK inquiry was unveiled.
But Ms Sturgeon made an unequivocal promise during a Covid press conference in August 2021 that her WhatsApps would be handed over to a future public inquiry.
The disclosure they had been deleted caused uproar on Friday, at the end of the first week of the UK public inquiry sitting in Edinburgh to take evidence about the Scottish Government’s handling of the pandemic.
Chaired by Lady Hallett, it is scheduled to hear testimony this week from Prof Leitch, Liz Lloyd, Ms Sturgeon’s former chief of staff, and First Minister Humza Yousaf. Ms Sturgeon and Mr Swinney will give evidence next week.
Mr Anwar said it was now a “matter of public record” that Ms Sturgeon, Mr Swinney and Prof Leitch had “wilfully” deleted their messages.
He said: “The deletion of WhatsApps can only be seen as a cynical, premeditated decision and of course Ms Sturgeon and others must answer as to their motivation for deleting messages.”
He added: “The trust that my clients had in the Scottish Government being transparent and accountable is left shattered. We are now instructed to prepare a criminal complaint to Police Scotland and to ask the ­Information Commissioner’s Office to investigate any potential breaches of the law.”
Jackie Marlow, George Hillhouse and Tracy MacMillan of the Almond Court group of relatives told the Scottish Mail on Sunday: “We are disgusted officials deleted messages during the pandemic, indicative of them having something to hide.
“Knowing what we know now, that clearing this correspondence when they knew there was to be an inquiry may be criminal, we are considering reporting this to the police.”
In a lengthy statement published on social media on Saturday, Ms Sturgeon admitted that her messages had “not been retained on my own device.”
She said she had been able to “obtain copies” of some “between me and those I most regularly communicated with through informal means”. The inquiry has received messages from Ms Sturgeon extracted from other people’s mobile devices.
The former first minister also said she conducted her Covid response “through formal processes”, was not a member of a WhatsApp group and only used informal messaging systems to communicate with a “limited” number of people.
However, evidence shown to the inquiry on Friday showed she used WhatsApp for discussions with Ms Lloyd and Mr Yousaf, who was health secretary before he became first minister.
A schedule of her communication methods also said she would “exchange information or views with colleagues by text or WhatsApp”.
However, it said that “messages were not retained, they were deleted in routine tidying up of inboxes or changing of phones.” It said she was “unable to retrieve messages” and had “nothing to return”.
Ms Sturgeon argued that she acted in line with “Scottish Government policy”, which gave ministers discretion to decide what should be kept and what deleted.
A spokeswoman for Ms Sturgeon and Mr Swinney referred to the statements they have previously issued and said they would not comment further.
His spokesman said on Friday: “Mr Swinney is committed to full transparency. He has engaged fully with the Covid inquiry and will continue to do so. All messages were handled in line with Scottish Government policies.”
Police Scotland said it was not aware of any complaints having been made.

OV3OTWXWL5_A7T4ZP73JWLI133,Johnny Appleseed biography includes stories of his ties to Mansfield,"Mark Caudill, Mansfield News Journal","January 21, 2024 at 7:20 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/johnny-appleseed-biography-includes-stories-102013502.html,"During his travels from Pennsylvania to Indiana, John Chapman passed through many places and influenced many people.
Better known as Johnny Appleseed, he spent significant time in Mansfield, living in and around here for about 20 years, between 1810 and 1830.
Readers can learn a lot more about the enigmatic figure in the book ""Johnny Appleseed: The Man Behind the Folklore,"" by Mark Bodanza.
Bodanza and Appleseed share the same hometown, Leominster, Massachusetts. Bodanza is a lawyer, author and city councilor. ""Johnny Appleseed"" is his 13th nonfiction book.
""As a Leominster native, I felt a certain obligation to tell John Chapman's story,"" Bodanza said. ""I have had a keen interest in history since grade school and have been vigorously pursuing that with writing and research over the last two decades.""
Bodanza said Appleseed's time in Mansfield coincided with the War of 1812.
""He interacted with the natives,"" Bodanza said. ""In at least a couple of cases, he warned the settlers of impending native attacks.""
Bodanza relayed a couple of Mansfield-centric anecdotes about Appleseed. When asked if people would have the same professions in heaven, Appleseed replied they would.
A lawyer asked about his profession.
""You guys don't go to heaven,"" Appleseed said. ""You are mired in mud and get to sling it at each other for eternity.""
In another case, a traveling preacher asked for the location of the ""barefoot Christian traveling to heaven.""
Appleseed, who was laying on a piece of timber, lifted his foot in acknowledgement.
While Appleseed was considered a local hero, he was also a bit of an enigma, Bodanza said, adding nearly half of the nation doesn't even believe he existed.
Appleseed was born on the eve of the American Revolution and was a man who heeded the westward call of the frontier. He set out on a mission that not only included propagating apple seedlings but also spreading deep-seated religious beliefs along with his mindful way of life.
""Everything about Johnny Appleseed is not entirely clear,"" Bodanza said. ""He's an enigmatic figure.""
The author said a 1948 Disney film popularized Appleseed.
""I don't think he would have gotten as much publicity in modern times if not for that film,"" Bodanza said.
Next year will mark the 250th anniversary of Appleseed's birth.
Known for going barefoot, Appleseed lived the ""simplest of lives.""
""He was the ultimate minimalist before the term was invented,"" Bodanza said.
He said he didn't realize what a thoughtful and purposeful life Appleseed led.
""It was difficult to capture in words,"" Bodanza said of trying to define Appleseed. ""He can't been contained to one place. It's almost like he was a spirit.""
Appleseed has a historical marker in Mansfield at the intersection of Brinkerhoff Avenue and Summit Street.
He is recognized in other area towns. In Wayne County, the village of Apple Creek holds a Johnny Appleseed Festival, scheduled this year for July 26-27.
In Mifflin, just off Ohio 603 in Ashland County, sits the now-closed Johnny Appleseed Amphitheater. It opened in 2004 but closed the next year, in part, because of poor attendance for a play documenting Appleseed's life.
""I'm truly happy I finally took on an examination of Chapman's life,"" Bodanza said. ""It has a great deal of relevance to the times we live in and life generally. At the very least, Johnny Appleseed will always speak to us about introspection and the world around us.""

Relatives of those killed are now searching for answers, writes Austin Landis in Medellin.
Tou Ger Xiong loved coming back to Colombia.
""He talked about the high spirited people… just enjoying life,"" his brother, Eh Xiong, told BBC News. ""He even picked up Spanish.
""It never, ever even crossed his mind that he would end up in a tragic incident this way.""
Tou Ger, 50, was a Hmong-American community activist and comedian from Minnesota. Prior to his most recent trip to Medellin, he had been speaking to a woman online.
A few weeks into his two-month visit, in mid-December, he called his brother and asked him for $2,000 but didn't say what it was for or that anything was wrong. Eh said he would transfer the money. He never heard from his brother again.
The next day, police found Tou Ger's body in a remote, wooded area of the city. A friend in Medellin explained to Eh that his brother had been kidnapped and held at gunpoint for the $2,000 ransom.
""I did not want to believe it. I didn't know if it was really happening,"" Eh said. ""My heart just sank.""
Eh scrambled to contact the US embassy, who confirmed it was his brother's body. Colombian police this week arrested a woman and two men linked to his death, charging them with kidnapping and murder.
It's not clear whether he first met the woman through a dating app or through friends. But his death is one of eight in Medellin that prompted a warning from the US embassy about the risks of using dating apps. All eight victims were Americans who died in suspicious circumstances in November and December.
The US state department said it was aware of a gang in the city that previously used dating apps to isolate victims before abducting and killing them. But it's unclear if a gang was behind the US deaths.
In the first 10 months of 2023, Medellin's tourism observatory had already recorded 32 violent killings of foreigners in the city - including at least 12 Americans and three from the United Kingdom - a 40% increase from the previous year.
Jeff Hewett was found ""lying dead in a pool of blood"" in his Medellin hotel room, his friends wrote online, describing him as ""an easy-going, wry, kind spirit"" and apparent victim of a ""robbery gone bad"".
Johny Jerome was killed on his 45th birthday. Phillip Mullins was drugged and died of an overdose, according to local media reports.
The embassy says several of these cases began with a dating app used to lure victims, part of a concerning increase in people who end up ""drugged, robbed, and even killed by their Colombian dates"". Neither Tinder nor Bumble, both popular in the city, would comment.
Carlos Calle, the former director of the city's tourism observatory, said it's common for criminals to drug tourists with scopolamine, an odourless substance known as ""Devil's Breath"". The US embassy also warned about the drug, which sedates victims for up to 24 hours.
Eight US deaths in Colombia linked to dating apps
""There's a negative profile of the tourist in the city that looks for a certain type of opportunities,"" said Calle in an interview. It's usually related to sex work, he said.
A spokesperson for the tourism observatory confirmed that the ""majority"" of victims last year were men, but added that many cases are still under investigation.
Prostitution is legal in Colombia and widespread in tourism hotspots like the cities of Medellin and Cartagena. But there's nothing to suggest the men killed were using prostitutes.
Alok Shah, 36, thinks scopolamine is what caused his vision to ""go sideways"" when he brought a woman back to his hotel room in late 2022. It was like his short-term memory was disappearing, he said.
The Texas resident had matched with a Colombian woman in her mid-20s on Tinder. They first went out for coffee, but Shah later decided to buy beers and bring her to his hotel.
He says he hadn't felt unsafe during his previous frequent visits to Medellin, or like prostitution was as prevalent when he first came in 2017. But he knew women were a draw to the city. ""If you're a single guy, the women are very lovely here,"" a friend had told him.
Before his watch, jacket and $200 in cash disappeared that night, he remembers his date rubbing a powder on his neck. But he stayed conscious enough to realise something was wrong, threatening to call the police and chasing her away.
""I generally don't interact with the locals there now,"" he said. ""There's just too much danger, there's too much risk.""
The new US embassy notice recommends its citizens avoid taking dates to private places like hotels, plus inform friends, family or building staff about who they're with. And don't resist a robbery because that could be fatal.
Medellin's city police would not comment on the recent increase in violent deaths and referred BBC News to the mayor's office.
""We want more and more foreigners to come to the city,"" said Mayor Federico Gutierrez, but added that tourists coming purely for sex and drugs were not welcome. He said he's directed the police to crack down on what he says is a related underlying issue - the sex trafficking of minors.
Police have been directed to begin ""special interventions"" in the neighbourhoods where tourism is most prominent, a spokesperson for the mayor told BBC News, including the popular nightlife area called El Poblado.
More than 1.4 million foreigners visited the city as tourists in 2022, a new record over previous years, and over a quarter were American, according to statistics released by the mayor's office. The numbers for 2023 are expected to be even higher, partly because Medellin has become a top destination for remote workers.
Last week, Eh Xiong came to Medellin himself for the first time, to carry out a Hmong tradition by calling his brother's spirits back home.
""We're not mad at the people of Colombia,"" he said. ""I truly believe that he would have forgiven the people who did that to him.""
He added: ""[Tou Ger had] this quick wit, fearlessness, that believes in the goodness of all people.""

“He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear,” DeSantis said in a video released Sunday on X, formerly Twitter. The Florida governor described Trump as the preferable alternative to President Joe Biden or Nikki Haley, the last remaining rival to Trump in the GOP primaries.
His exit from the race is a stunning blow to the political fortunes of a candidate who just two years ago won a second term as governor in a landslide election and stepped onto the national stage heralded by big-dollar Republican donors as the future of the party.
New polling from CNN and the University of New Hampshire showed DeSantis earning just 6% of the state’s Republican vote, with Trump at 50% and Haley, the former South Carolina governor, at 39%.
“I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory,” DeSantis said in the video.
Trump said he was honored by the endorsement, urging “all Republicans to rally behind” his candidacy and help defeat Biden in November.
“Nikki Haley is the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement,” Trump said in a statement. “It’s time to choose wisely.”
Haley addressed DeSantis’ exit during a campaign stop shortly after his announcement.
“I want to say to Ron, you ran a great race,” Haley said to cheering crowds. “It’s now one fella and one lady left.”
Some donors wanted DeSantis to preserve political capital so he could potentially run for president again in 2028. The Florida governor is only 45 years old, and donors see potential for him to seek higher office again when Trump is no longer on the ballot.
Once flush with cash and projecting bravado, DeSantis was considered the heir apparent to Trump and the former president’s most formidable challenger when he joined the race in May.
DeSantis has expressed regret over his early campaign media strategy where he avoided mainstream media, preferring instead to speak to conservative outlets.
“I should have just been blanketing. I should have gone on all the corporate shows. I should have gone on everything,” he told radio host, Hugh Hewitt, on a recent show.
Money Woes
DeSantis’ operation was wracked by internal turmoil, including fights over messaging and strategy between the campaign based out of Tallahassee and the main super political action committee backing him, Never Back Down. It also became mired in leadership shakeups and a cash crunch.
Donors were rattled as DeSantis team’s burned through cash even as he began losing ground in the polls, leading him to lay off staff, reshuffle top aides and focus his strategy on early voting states, in particular Iowa. Many of his donors moved to back other candidates in the GOP field.
In the weeks before the Iowa caucuses, two newer super PACs, Fight Right and Good Fight, booked millions of dollars in advertisements in the state, highlighting the clash between the campaign and Never Back Down.
DeSantis and aides insisted they had money to stay in the race until at least early March but the Iowa loss raised fresh doubts among donors. In the days following the caucuses, DeSantis moved most of his team to South Carolina, largely ceding the New Hampshire contest to Trump and Haley.

OZVH3DOU5V_YT5FERRG0U8H5E1,What you need to know about this election year | INSIDE THE STATEHOUSE,Steve Flowers,"January 21, 2024 at 7:08 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/know-election-inside-statehouse-100839897.html,"This is a presidential election year. Our GOP presidential primary is our election in the Heart of Dixie. We are a one-party state, especially in presidential races. Alabama is one of a group of states that will hold its primary early, March 5 to be exact. Therefore, we will be going to the polls in less than two months to vote for a presidential nominee.
The presidential contest will more than likely be a rematch between Joe Biden, the sitting Democratic president, and Donald Trump, the Republican former president. Americans are not too enthused to see this rematch. I have never seen such a weird presidential matchup or unusual scenario in my lifetime.
More: These Alabama leaders are poised to make a mark in 2024 | INSIDE THE STATEHOUSE
The old political truism, “more people vote against someone than for someone,” will definitely come into play in this presidential race. More people would rather vote for anyone than Trump or Biden. I have never seen two candidates for president with this high negative polling numbers. Indeed, if Republicans were to nominate anyone besides Trump, they would beat Biden. By the same token, if the Democrats were to nominate anyone besides Biden, they would beat Trump. If indeed Biden and Trump are the nominees, you will see a low voter turnout come November.
As I remind you every four years, we do not elect our president by direct vote. You vote for electors who go to an Electoral College and cast their votes. Under the “winner-take-all” Electoral College System, if a candidate wins a state by one vote, they get all of that state's electoral votes.
We have become such a polarized partisan electorate there are fewer than 10 of our 50 states that matter in a presidential contest. The race for president will be determined in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa and Georgia. The few truly independent voters left in these pivotal swing states will decide the presidency. Both parties will concentrate their efforts and resources in these states.
The straight party lockstep voting mentality of American voters has become so entrenched that in at least 40 states the race for president has been predetermined. As I have often said, “If Mickey Mouse were the Republican nominee, he would carry Alabama. By the same token, if Donald Duck were the Democratic nominee, he would carry California.” It will be fun to watch.
We do not have many good races to watch in Alabama. We have four seats on our state Supreme Court up for election this year. However, popular Republican Justices Will Sellers, Jay Mitchell and Tommy Bryan are all running unopposed and will be back for six more years. Justice Sarah Stewart is opting to run for chief justice, leaving her seat open. It will be filled by Republican Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Chris McCool, who like Sellers, Mitchell and Bryan garnered no opponent, Democrat or Republican.
The chief justice race is the only contested Supreme Court Seat. Sarah Stewart has two opponents, Bryan Taylor and Jerry Michael Blevins.
The Democrats have fielded a candidate in the chief Justice race. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin will be on the ballot. However, winning a statewide race in the Heart of Dixie as a Democrat is difficult, to say the least, and not only improbable, but maybe impossible. There are 29 elected statewide positions in Alabama; all 29 are held by a Republican.
There are two Republican assistant attorney generals, Thomas Govan and Rich Anderson, running for Chris McCool’s seat on the Court of Criminal Appeals. Both are well-qualified for this appellate post.
Under the federal court’s decision to realign Alabama's congressional district lines to try to create a new minority Democratic district in the state, all of our powerful incumbent congressmen have altered districts. However, our veteran seniority member’s districts have probably been enhanced to their benefit.
Republican congressmen Robert Aderholt, Mike Rogers, and freshman Republican Dale Strong have no or token opposition. Democratic congresswoman Terri Sewell is also getting a free ride.
This is not the case in the newly drawn 1st District. Two incumbent Republican congressmen, Jerry Carl (Mobile/Baldwin) and Wiregrass Republican Barry Moore were placed into the same district. They will be pitted against each other in a March 5 primary contest that will be decided that day, since it is a super-Republican district.
By far the biggest race in Alabama this year will be for the newly drawn open 2nd Congressional District in Montgomery to Mobile. We will discuss that race next week.

P0MAHDW6G5_935P3ZW4Y21I5QT,"In small-town Wisconsin, looking for the roots of the modern American conspiracy theory",TIM SULLIVAN,"January 21, 2024 at 9:12 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/small-town-wisconsin-looking-roots-121208885.html,"APPLETON, Wis. (AP) — The decades fall away as you open the front doors.
It’s the late 1950s in the cramped little offices — or maybe the pre-hippie 1960s. It’s a place where army-style buzz cuts are still in fashion, communism remains the primary enemy and the decor is dominated by American flags and portraits of once-famous Cold Warriors.
At the John Birch Society, they’ve been waging war for more than 60 years against what they're sure is a vast, diabolical conspiracy. As they tell it, it’s a plot with tentacles that reach from 19th-century railroad magnates to the Biden White House, from the Federal Reserve to COVID vaccines.
Long before QAnon, Pizzagate and the modern crop of politicians who will happily repeat apocalyptic talking points, there was Birch. And outside these cramped small-town offices is a national political landscape that the Society helped shape.
“We have a bad reputation. You know: ‘You guys are insane,’” says Wayne Morrow, a Society vice president. He is standing in the group’s warehouse amid 10-foot (3-meter) shelves of Birch literature waiting to be distributed.
“But all the things that we wrote about are coming to pass.”
___
Back when the Cold War loomed and TV was still mostly in black and white, the John Birch Society mattered. There were dinners at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York and meetings with powerful politicians. There was a headquarters on each coast, a chain of bookstores, hundreds of local chapters, radio shows, summer camps for members’ children.
Well-funded and well-organized, they sent forth fevered warnings about a secret communist plot to take over America. It made them heroes to broad swaths of conservatives, even as they became a punchline to a generation of comedians.
“They created this alternative political tradition,” says Matthew Dallek, a historian at George Washington University and author of ""Birchers: How the John Birch Society Radicalized the American Right.” He says it forged a right-wing culture that fell, at first, well outside mainstream Republican politics.
Conspiracy theories have a long history in the United States, going back at least to 1800, when secret forces were said to be backing Thomas Jefferson’s presidential bid. It was a time when such talk moved slowly, spread through sermons, letters and tavern visits.
No more. Fueled by social media and the rise of celebrity conspiracists, the last two decades have seen ever-increasing numbers of Americans lose faith in everything from government institutions to journalism. And year after year, ideas once relegated to fringe newsletters, little-known websites and the occasional AM radio station pushed their way into the mainstream.
Today, outlandish conspiracy theories are quoted by more than a few U.S. senators, and millions of Americans believe the COVID pandemic was orchestrated by powerful elites. Prominent cable news commentators speak darkly of government agents seizing citizens off the streets.
But the John Birch Society itself is largely forgotten, relegated to a pair of squat buildings along a busy commercial street in small-town Wisconsin.
So why even take note of it today? Because many of its ideas — from anger at a mysterious, powerful elite to fears that America’s main enemy was hidden within the country, biding its time — percolated into pockets of American culture over the last half-century. Those who came later simply out-Birched the Birchers. Says Dallek: “Their successors were politically savvier and took Birch ideas and updated them for contemporary politics.”
The result has been a new political terrain. What was once at the edges had worked its way toward the heart of the discourse.
To some, the fringe has gone all the way to the White House. In the Society's offices, they’ll tell you that Donald Trump would never have been elected if they hadn’t paved the way.
“The bulk of Trump’s campaign was Birch,” Art Thompson, a retired Society CEO who remains one of its most prominent voices, says proudly. “All he did was bring it out into the open.”
There’s some truth in that, even if Thompson is overstating things.
The Society had spent decades calling for a populist president who would preach patriotism, oppose immigration, pull out of international treaties and root out the forces trying to undermine America. Trump may not have realized it, but when he warned about a “Deep State” — a supposed cabal of bureaucrats that secretly controls U.S. policy — he was repeating a longtime Birch talking point.
A savvy reality TV star, Trump capitalized on a conservative political landscape that had been shaped by decades of right-wing talk radio, fears about America’s seismic cultural shifts and the explosive online spread of misinformation.
While the Birch Society echoes in that mix, tracing those echoes is impossible. It's hard to draw neat historical lines in American politics. Was the Society a prime mover, or a bit player? In a nation fragmented by social media and offshoot groups by the dozens, there’s just no way to be sure. What is certain, though, is this:
“The conspiratorial fringe is now the conspiratorial mainstream,” says Paul Matzko, a historian and research fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “Right-wing conspiracism has simply outgrown the John Birch Society.”
___
Their beliefs skip along the surface of the truth, with facts and rumors and outright fantasies banging together into a complex mythology. “The great conspiracy” is what Birch Society founder Robert Welch called it in “The Blue Book,” the collection of his writings and speeches still treated as near-mystical scripture in the Society’s corridors.
Welch, a wealthy candy company executive, formed the Society in the late 1950s, naming it for an American missionary and U.S. Army intelligence officer killed in 1945 by communist Chinese forces. Welch viewed Birch as the first casualty of the Cold War. Communist agents, he said, were everywhere in America.
Welch shot to prominence, and infamy, when he claimed that President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the hero general of World War II, was a “dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy.” Also under Kremlin control, Welch asserted: the secretary of state, the head of the CIA, and Eisenhower’s younger brother Milton.
Subtlety has never been a strong Birch tradition. Over the decades, the Birch conspiracy grew to encompass the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, public education, the United Nations, the civil rights movement, The Rockefeller Foundation, the space program, the COVID pandemic, the 2020 presidential election and climate-change activism. In short, things the Birchers don't like.
The plot’s leaders — “insiders,” in Society lexicon — range from railroad baron Cornelius Vanderbilt to former President George H.W. Bush and Bill Gates, whose vaccine advocacy is, they say, part of a plan to control the global population. While his main focus was always communism, Welch eventually came to believe that the conspiracy's roots twisted far back into history, to the Illuminati, an 18th-century Bavarian secret society.
By the 1980s, the Society was well into its decline. Welch died in 1985 and the society’s reins passed to a series of successors. There were internal revolts. While its aura has waned, it is still a force among some conservatives — its videos are popular in parts of right-wing America, and its offices include a sophisticated basement TV studio for internet news reports. Its members speak at right-wing conferences and work booths at the occasional county fair.
Scholars say its ranks are far reduced from the 1960s and early 1970s, when membership estimates ranged from 50,000 to 100,000. “Membership is something that has been closely guarded since day one,” says Bill Hahn, who became CEO in 2020. He will only say the organization “continues to be a growing operation.”
Today, the Society frames itself as almost conventional. Almost.
“We have succeeded in attracting mainstream people,” says Steve Bonta, a top editor for the Society’s New American magazine. The group has toned down the rhetoric and is a little more careful these days about throwing around accusations of conspiracies. But members still believe in them fiercely.
“As Mr. Welch came out with on Day One: There is a conspiracy,” Hahn says. “It’s no different today than it was back in December 1958.”
It can feel that way. Ask about the conspiracy’s goal, and things swerve into unexpected territory. The sharp rhetoric re-emerges and, once again, the decades seem to fall away.
“They really want to cut back on the population of the Earth. That is their intent,” Thompson says.
But why?
“Well, that’s a good question, isn’t it?” he responds. “It makes no sense. But that’s the way they think.”

Haley made the statement during a Sunday morning appearance on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" with host Margaret Brennan. Brennan asked Haley whether she saw evidence of Trump declining mentally when she served in his cabinet as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
""If you look recently there have been multiple things,"" Haley said. ""He claimed Joe Biden was gonna get us into World War II. I'm assuming he meant World War III. He said he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama.""
""Don't be surprised. If you have somebody that's 80 in office. Their mental stability is going to continue to decline. That's just human nature,"" Haley said. ""If you look at Joe Biden, he's very different than he was two years ago.

""He's just not at the same level he was at 2016, and I think we're seeing some of that decline,"" she said.
Haley is rallying support in New Hampshire and South Carolina coming off a third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses earlier this month. Trump won the caucuses with an overwhelming lead over any of the candidates, followed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.
Haley has argued that Iowa had poor turnout due to record low temperatures, with much of the state having been in below-zero weather on Election Day.
""You look at Iowa. I mean President Trump won a state of three million people with 56,000 votes. We had a very low turnout in Iowa. We’re going to have a really good turnout in New Hampshire,"" Haley told reporters on Friday.
Trump defended himself during a rally with supporters in New Hampshire this weekend, arguing he is more mentally fit than ever.
""I don't mind being 80, but I'm 77, that's a big difference,"" he said. ""I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago.""

P3PSYLK73S_11BEG0332957WX7,Fire breaks out at Russian gas terminal near St Petersburg,AFP,"January 21, 2024 at 9:10 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/fire-breaks-russian-gas-terminal-121035801.html,"A blaze at a natural gas terminal in the Baltic Sea port of Ust-Luga on Sunday was caused by an ""external factor"", said Novatek, Russia's biggest exporter of liquified natural gas.
The operator said there were no victims and the fire was ""currently localised"", at the site 110 kilometres (70 miles) west of St Petersburg near the Estonian border.
Neither Novaktek nor the authorities gave further details about the cause of the fire, which is 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) from the Ukrainian border.
Kyiv this week claimed responsibility for two attacks on oil depots in Russia, including one in the same Leningrad region where Ust-Luga is located.
The second attack in the Bransk region bordering Ukraine led to a major fire.
The Kremlin continues to present the conflict with Ukraine as having no effect on daily life in Russia.
But with Russia's presidential election approaching in March, Ukraine has stepped up drone and missile attacks over the border in enemy territory.
The authorities in Usk-Luga had offered a reassuring commentary on the gas terminal blaze, despite video posted on social media purporting to show columns of smoke and flames at the site.
""No casualties as a result of a fire at Novatek's terminal in the port of Ust-Luga. Personnel were evacuated,"" Aleksandr Drozdenko, governor of Leningrad Oblast, posted on Telegram along with a short video showing a massive fire and smoke at a chemical complex.
The Ria-Novosti news agency said a 100 cubic metre container was ablaze.
""A high alert regime has been introduced in the Kingiseppsky district (which includes the port),"" Drozdenko said.
The Russian ministry of emergency situations and local fire service were involved in fighting the blaze, he added.
Local official Yuri Zapalatski said the fire started just before 2:45 am local time.
TASS news agency and other state media said the cause of the fire had not been announced.
Russia's defence ministry announced Sunday that Ukrainian attacks overnight had been foiled but made no mention of any incident in the Leningrad region.
The Ust-Luga complex processes natural gas condensate into naphtha, jet fuel and ship fuel components, according to Novatek's website.
The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline leading to Germany, which has never entered into service after a sabotage raid in September 2022, starts from the town of Ust-Luga.

The scam involves callers posing as law enforcement officers, state attorneys, court officials, or deputy clerks, claiming that individuals failed to appear for jury duty or other court obligations.
Often, the scammers go to great lengths, using the names of actual judges or public officials to deceive their targets. The caller typically asserts that a fine has been imposed and issues a warning of an arrest warrant if the fine is not promptly paid.
To settle the matter, they may request sensitive information such as bank account details, suggest purchasing a prepaid debit card, or even propose payment in cryptocurrency.
In response to these scams, the 4th Judicial Circuit, the Clerk’s Office, and law enforcement officers emphasize that legitimate entities will never call or email residents to demand payment for missed jury duty or other court obligations. Communication from these offices regarding legal matters will always be in writing, and no request for payment via prepaid debit card or cryptocurrency will be made.
Duval County Clerk Jody Phillips advises the public to remain vigilant, stating, “While this scam has unfortunately been around for years, the recent increase in cases around Florida made it a good time to remind the public that they should remain vigilant. When in doubt, you can always contact our office directly, and we would be glad to assist you.”
Residents are encouraged to verify the legitimacy of any such calls by contacting the Clerk’s Office at (904) 255-2000. Additionally, suspicious calls can be reported to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office’s non-emergency line at (904) 630-0500. The collaboration between legal authorities and public awareness plays a crucial role in preventing individuals from falling victim to these scams.

P9OHT10QNX_VUZQZMCYNA5FG4X,DeSantis might be the worst presidential candidate in recent memory,Brent D. Griffiths,"January 22, 2024 at 7:23 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-might-worst-presidential-candidate-222356336.html,"Ron DeSantis dropped out of the 2024 race on Sunday.
At one time, it would have been considered an unexpected ending for a promising candidate.
Now, DeSantis will go in history as one of the worst candidates in recent memory.
Turns out, Mickey Mouse is stronger than you thought.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his presidential campaign on Sunday, succumbing to the final realization of defeat in a candidacy that once held such promise.
The epitaph of his campaign is and will be intensely debated. Perhaps, any politician trying to be a replica of Trump when the original was readily available was doomed to fail.
And yet, it doesn't explain the glitchy rollout. The weird, definitely too online videos. And how the governor of one of America's largest states, just seemed well, odd on the campaign trail. It's true that as DeSantis himself complained, Trump's unprecedented criminal indictments upended the race. Still, it seemed like one man in America who could have humbled Trump just couldn't stop tripping over himself.
It's worth remembering as pundits, foes, and anyone else kick the Florida man while he's down that they remember DeSantis once cut a much different figure. After all, there's a reason the Biden White House once made it a point to tangle with him regularly.
DeSantis cut his teeth after narrowly winning a general election over then-Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, a candidate who was virtually anointed as the future of the Democratic Party but who now looks at best like a deeply flawed challenger. And yes, it was then-President Donald Trump whose endorsement powered DeSantis to that very general election in the first place.
You know how the story goes. DeSantis pivoted away from his early governorship to becoming a pandemic-era culture warrior willing to take on Trump or anyone else who stands his way. He later added Disney, one of his state's largest employers, to his enemy list. After pundits point out this a bold strategy for a historic swing state, DeSantis pulls off a historic reelection rout.
Front pages proclaimed him the man of the moment. Very early polling showed DeSantis leading Trump in national polling. The Wall Street Journal had him up by double digits over Trump in a 2022 poll.
Of course, it didn't last.
It might be our fault too, more specifically the media. To juice early interest in the presidential race, the national media often declares frontrunners that age more poorly than a mid-2000s sitcom: just ask Rudy Giuliani, Scott Walker, and Kamala Harris (briefly). Some, namely Joe Biden, campaign long enough to go from frontrunner to also-ran back to winning the race again. But for the rest, they drop out before the Iowa caucuses or live on long enough to be humbled by roughly a couple hundred thousand Americans.
While DeSantis may often be compared to former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the Floridian's disappointing performance might be so bad that he has now risen close to the level occupied by Giuliani. As America's (former) Mayor, Giuliani dominated early polling in the 2008 Republican primaries. But Giuliani was ultimately doomed by cultural issues (evangelical conservatives couldn't stomach his then-pro-choice views) and his curious decision to skip the early states in favor of focusing on the delegate battle. He ultimately staked his campaign on Florida. After finishing third, he quickly dropped out.
Walker's failed candidacy is similar in that the Wisconsin Republican expanded his operation quickly to match the early hype for his bid. Just like DeSantis, Walker ended up being doomed by the sheer rate at which his campaign burned through contributions.
Maybe there's a different ending in another multiverse. But in this reality, a week ago DeSantis lashed out at ""worthless"" Republicans who back Trump.
""You can be the most worthless Republican in America, but if you kiss the ring, he'll say: 'You're wonderful,"" DeSantis told Iowans just a day before he finished the caucuses without carrying a single county.
DeSantis can only hope he'll return to a wonderful world as Florida's governor. It sure won't be Disney's.

PARFRYE9U5_57H1BTVJ17U0B74,Lauren Boebert switched districts in a bid to stay in Congress. Winning over voters won't be easy,JESSE BEDAYN,"January 21, 2024 at 9:52 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/lauren-boebert-switched-districts-bid-125220371.html,"LAST CHANCE, Colo. (AP) — Fleeing a tough reelection bid in the district where she lives, Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert is moving from the mountains to the plains, in the hopes of finding conservative pastures green enough to salvage her place in Congress.
To win, she'll have to convince a new swath of voters that her brand of white-hot, far-right political activism — built on divisive one-liners and partisan ferocity in the U.S. House — is more needed in Washington than the home-grown Republicans she now faces in the primary.
While Boebert's new district voted for President Donald Trump by a nearly 20 percentage point margin in 2020, more than double the margin in her old district, and some Republican voters are already admirers, others are greeting her with hands-on-hips skepticism.
“She feels she is a better candidate than the ones that we have,” said Robin Varhelman, seated behind a desk at the cattle auction she owns in Brush. “She’s gonna have to explain to people why.”
Varhelman, flanked by the massive head of a bull named Big Red she used to rope, with a cap reading “USA Trump” hanging from its right ear, said she wasn’t sure if Boebert made the switch for the good of the state or her own survival.
After Boebert eked out a victory by just 546 votes in 2022, her home district moved from Republican-leaning to a toss-up for 2024 — threatening the GOP’s already threadbare control of the U.S. House.
The narrow margin in Congress leaves both major parties fighting fiercely for every available seat in 2024. Boebert's move to the new district, where she'll have to take on at least nine other Republicans for her party's nomination, probably gives the GOP a better chance to win both.
That's part of her reason for switching, she said in a phone interview, but she gave another reason for jumping into a race that's already considered safely Republican: “There is need for my voice in Congress.""
After attacking the Democrat who nearly upset her in 2022 as the beneficiary of outside money, Boebert has become the outsider and will have to live down the “carpetbagger” label that her new opponents are already lobbing her way.
Boebert’s abdication came after a video surfaced last year of the congresswoman vaping and groping with a date in a Denver theater, which rattled even devoted supporters as she barreled toward an election rematch against Adam Frisch. The Democrat she nearly lost to in 2022 had received triple her campaign donations in this year’s race, benefiting tangibly from her disruptive profile, which grated on donors far beyond state and district borders.
“I can read the tea leaves,” Boebert said. “I don’t want the left to have a chance to buy the seat from us, and their only argument is me.”
Number crunchers, political experts and the National Republican Campaign Committee generally agree that Boebert’s exodus will give Republicans a better chance to retain that district — though newly elected NRCC Chair Rep. Richard Hudson said the organization had no hand in the decision.
Frisch said he’s “taking a bit of a victory lap” after Boebert's retreat, and is plugging ahead with the same bipartisan platform, buoyed by at least $7.7 million in his campaign coffers. Frisch is expected to face Jeff Hurd — a mild-mannered conservative in the old GOP tradition, who said his goal is “making local headlines, not national headlines.”
In Boebert’s new district, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson has endorsed her candidacy, and the NRCC is treating her as an incumbent. Less happy with the switch is Republican state Rep. Richard Holtorf, now one of her opponents.
“By Lauren Boebert district shopping and becoming a carpetbagger so she can keep her office in D.C., she has now become part of the swamp,” he said.
Whether Boebert will join the ranks of American politicians who have relocated and won remains unclear.
That road is littered with many who “could never quite convince voters that they were in this for something other than their own ambition,” said Christopher Galdieri, a politics professor at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, who wrote a book on American politicians who’ve picked up and moved races.
Boebert does have some things working in her favor — she’s not leaving Colorado, she’s a known conservative gladiator on national issues such as immigration and reducing the national debt, and she’s a dedicated acolyte for Trump, whose popularity among rural Republicans remains high.
Rancher Dawn Whitney, who attended one of Varhelman’s recent auctions, said Boebert’s flag-bearing for conservative, Christian and agrarian values is already enough to earn her vote.
“Ranchers and farmers are pretty much the same everywhere,” said Whitney, her calloused hands busy at a word search puzzle as the auctioneer chanted.
“As long as she is country related, I think she’ll be fine,” said Whitney, who cited a well-worn reason voters cling to Boebert: Rural residents often feel their political power slipping and see an outspoken champion in Boebert.
“She don’t back down,” she said.
Still, Boebert is joining a race that is practically guaranteed to elect a Republican anyway, said Galdieri. In effect, that means she’s pushing aside “homegrown options” to run in a safer district.
“Voters notice that,” he said.
While some voters — even if they chafed at Boebert’s style — weren’t as miffed that she changed districts, the June Republican primary is where her opponents can do the most damage. Along with Holtorf, she’ll face Mike Lynch, minority leader in Colorado’s House of Representatives.
“I was a fan of Lauren Boebert when she first got there,” he said. “And then I think, for lack of a better term, she drank the Kool-Aid and became what she was fighting.”
Boebert’s retort is unwavering.
“If there’s anyone who takes on the swamp, it’s me,"" she said. “I’m the only candidate in this race who’s actually done the work.""
Nodding to part of the challenge ahead, she added, “I’m excited to meet people and learn more about the nitty gritty local issues.”
While a segment of the new district’s voters is in a more urban center south of Denver, the region stretches across Colorado’s prairie east of the Rocky Mountains — where some folks’ great-grandparents ate dinner beneath tablecloths during the Dust Bowl. A half-century ago, grandparents wrestled their calves out of blistering winter chills, just as their descendants were doing this week, and as their own children will do as long as things hold steady.
Though Boebert might be escaping tough electoral odds, voters in the new district hold tight to the traditional values borne from that history — the same values that Boebert stepped on in the groping episode at a musical production of “Beetlejuice"" in Denver.
That embarrassment was memorable enough to transcend district lines.
“I don’t really care either way what she does, but she’s definitely got to get some sh— together, getting thrown out of a theater,” said Mark Moorman, a Republican who bid at auction on a bull the size and weight of a small car.
Before she switched districts, Boebert had apologized up and down Colorado’s 3rd district as part of her last-ditch strategy against Frisch. She’d undertaken a local press tour and grassroots boot camps geared to emphasize her work on local issues.
Now, on new turf, “that’s totally out the window,” said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics in Denver. “She’s the national politics candidate. That is her weakness; that is her strength. She kind of has no choice.”
It’s the difference between Republican voter Debbie Spear — “She’s going to have the same target on her back wherever she goes, here, there, Texas. We don’t need that, what is she going to bring more than the candidates we have?” — and the passerby at a ranching store nearby, who shouted out: “The girl from Rifle? Hell, yeah.” ___

Sean Brutto, 34, allegedly shot the rear sliding glass door of a home in the 800 block of Willow Court around 9:17 a.m. before going inside the house.
Itasca police were called to the scene for reports of a gunman entering homes. While they were en route, officers were told shots had been fired.
When officers arrived, Brutto was in the front yard of a home in the 700 block of Willow Court armed with an AR-15 rifle. He was ordered to drop the firearm and he complied.
He was ordered to the ground and removed his coat, which held a box of ammunition containing 19 rounds. Officers recovered a loaded AR-15 with one bullet in the chamber.
Prosecutors say Brutto fired two shots in the neighborhood before firing one round at the home in the 800 block of Willow Court. The round shattered the door and hit the refrigerator.
The owner of the home left his bedroom where he allegedly ran into Brutto on the second floor in the hallway, armed with the AR-15.
Prosecutors say after a brief struggle between the two men, during which the homeowner was able to disarm Brutto and throw the weapon downstairs, Brutto ran downstairs, retrieved the AR-15, stole the homeowner’s iPhone and fled the scene.
He was charged with two counts of home invasion, one count of aggravated discharge of a firearm – occupied building, one count of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon and one count of reckless discharge of a firearm.
Brutto’s next court appearance is scheduled for Feb. 5."

Three men were shot dead in a car park and a supermarket, and a female cashier was taken hostage until a gendarme volunteered to take her place at the cost of his life.
On the morning of 23 March 2018, Radouane Lakdim, a 25-year-old small-time drug dealer from a housing estate in Carcassonne, went to a car park that had a reputation as a gay meeting place. He was highly radicalised and under police surveillance,
Lakdim took aim and shot at two men in a car. One of them, aged 61, died. The other was seriously injured.
Lakdim then continued his journey by car, passing four police officers jogging and firing in their direction, seriously injuring one of them.
Shortly before 10.30am, he arrived at a Super U supermarket in Trèbes, a town close to Carcassonne, where he shot the shop's 50-year-old butcher and a customer, a 65-year-old retired bricklayer, in the head.
He proceeded to shout ""Allahu Akbar"" while shouting at people between the aisles. Armed with a revolver, Lakdim took a 39-year-old cashier hostage.
He ordered her to call the police, and while on the phone he introduced himself as an ""Islamic State brigadier"", referring to France's bombing raids in Syria.
After an hour, 44-year-old Lieutenant-Colonel Arnaud Beltrame entered and convinced Lakdim to take him hostage instead of the cashier.
The GIGN – the gendarmerie's elite intervention unit – launched an assault at around 2.30pm. Lakdim was shot dead.
Beltrame, who received serious knife wounds to the neck by Lakdim, died in hospital.

PCP6JQ2T03_7D8O60XA98ZW2UH,Israel-Gaza: Netanyahu defies Biden over Palestinian state,"Mark Lowen, in Jerusalem, and Sean Seddon - BBC News","January 21, 2024 at 6:08 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-gaza-netanyahu-defies-pressure-011253156.html,"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again rejected the idea of creating a Palestinian state.
His comments came hours after a phone call with US President Joe Biden after which the US leader indicated Mr Netanyahu may still accept the idea.
Mr Netanyahu's remarks appeared to deepen a public divide with the US.
The US believes a Palestinian state alongside Israel - known as a ""two-state solution"" - is vital for long-term stability.
But the White House acknowledged this week the US and Israeli governments ""clearly see things differently"".
Speaking to reporters after the two leaders held a call for the first time in almost a month, Mr Biden insisted a two-state solution was still possible with Mr Netanyahu in office.
""There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that... don't have their own militaries,"" he said.
But on Saturday Mr Netanyahu doubled down on his position, which he has held for much of his political career and repeated earlier this week.
A statement released by his office read: ""In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.""
Key Israeli war leader challenges Netanyahu over Gaza strategy
Palestinians tell of fears for the future as war destroys Gaza
Iran's sudden strikes show just how perilous region has become
Also on Saturday, in a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said Israel must retain ""security control over the entire area west of [River] Jordan"", an area which also encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank territory.
The comments will dampen hopes in some circles that the Gaza crisis could result in Israeli and Palestinian leaders restarting diplomatic negotiations and kickstarting the dormant peace process.
Mr Netanyahu's increasing isolation abroad comes amid support for the war at home and protests over the fate of the estimated 130 hostages still being held inside Gaza by Hamas.
Hamas killed about 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took 240 hostages in their surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October.
Thousands of protesters, including relatives of those still missing, gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday, urging Mr Netanyahu to reach a truce to allow the hostages home.
Gil Dickmann, whose cousin was captured on 7 October, said: ""Dear Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we believe that you can bring them back. We believe in you.
""We know that you can sign this deal and bring about this victory to all the citizens of Israel. Just do it, Bibi. Just do it. Bring the hostages back home.""
Israeli forces have continued to push into southern Gaza, saying they are searching for top Hamas officials they believe are hiding in Khan Younis, the Strip's second biggest city.
The Israel Defense Forces said they had raided a tunnel in Khan Younis that had been used to hold hostages, although they were not there when it was discovered.
While the focus of the fighting is now in southern Gaza, there have been renewed clashes around the northern town of Jabalia, as Palestinian fighters reportedly advanced while Israel tried to move its soldiers and tanks south.
Almost three months since Israel launched its ground invasion of Gaza, its army - vastly superior to Hamas in strength and equipment - is still facing significant resistance across the territory.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that 25,105 people had been killed in the territory since 7 October. More than 60,000 had also been injured, it said."
PFE98PYY4R_50RFJW6MECR8CJ5,State of Texas: DOJ report finds law enforcement failures during and after Uvalde school shooting,Grace Gates,"January 21, 2024 at 9:00 AM·18 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/state-texas-doj-report-finds-000000277.html,"AUSTIN (Nexstar) — The Department of Justice took a “minute-by-minute” approach in its investigation of law enforcement’s response to the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde. Its nearly 600-page report describes chaos, confusion and ignorance — all aspects that the Texas House of Representatives found within their own investigation released just weeks after the 2022 mass shooting.
RELATED: New DOJ report finds ‘cascading failures’ in law enforcement response to Uvalde school massacre
Thursday morning, the U.S. Department of Justice released its highly anticipated critical incident review of the active shooting at Robb Elementary School that killed 19 students and two teachers on May 24, 2022. The document reveals themes related to leadership failures on the day the Uvalde elementary shooting took place, as well as a lack of communication, collaboration and cooperation in the days and months following.
“I think that the DOJ report goes a long way in validating our concerns about the lack of communication, the lack of leadership,” said State Representative Joe Moody, vice chair of the Texas House of Representatives’ Investigation Committee on the Robb Elementary Shooting.
The House’s 77-page document uncovered the miscommunication among officers which led to a delay in stopping the shooter. “The scene was chaotic, without any person obviously in charge or directing the law enforcement response,” it reads.
KXAN’s coverage of the Uvalde school shooting
According to the DOJ report, the lack of structure not only contributed to the confusion and chaos during the incident, but also affected law enforcement’s post-incident response to preserving the integrity of the crime scene.
Only two law enforcement officers in leadership positions with the main responding agencies had training in Incident Command Systems (ICS) and National Incident Management Sytems (NIMS), according to the DOJ report.
Those two officers were Uvalde CISD Police Chief Pete Arredondo, who had completed 32 hours of training, and the Texas Department of Public Safety South Texas Regional Director Victor Escalon, who arrived shortly before the classroom was entered, had completed 88 hours, according to the report.
“In critical incidents, particularly events involving multiple jurisdictions and disciplines, the understanding and use of NIMS and ICS are essential to the successful sharing of information and coordination of resources, tactics, and investigations,” the DOJ report states.

“There were also failures in leadership, command, and coordination. None of the law enforcement leaders at the scene established an incident command structure to provide timely direction, control, and coordination,” the report states.
Neither Arredondo nor Escalon took steps to provide leadership to those in the room, according to the report.
Once children were finally rescued from the classrooms, a perimeter should have been established and direction with other leadership in the hallway should have been given by Escalon, according to the DOJ.
“The TXDPS regional director, and some other officers, walked past the law enforcement officers bringing injured and deceased victims out of the classrooms and entered classrooms 111 and 112 with no identifiable purpose or action, therefore compromising the crime scene,” the report states.
It wasn’t until a few minutes later that a Texas Ranger on scene took control and ordered all law enforcement out of the crime scene, according to the DOJ.
“The Texas Ranger appeared to be one of the few leaders on scene who attempted to coordinate with other agency personnel and ended up in different interactions with all the major responding agencies,” the report states.
Internal memos find ‘no fault’ in suspended Texas Ranger’s Uvalde response
According to the report, a Texas DPS captain present at the crime scene ordered another officer to create a log of names for anyone who enters the crime scene; however, “none of the officials filed reports after their walk-throughs, as is reportedly required by TXDPS.”
In addition to the integrity of the crime scene inside the school being jeopardized by leadership shortfalls, the DOJ report states DPS declined the FBI’s offer to assist with the collection of evidence from the car wrecked by the shooter. The report states there was an urgent need to preserve the crime scene with a forecasted major storm moving in.
As a result, “the storm brought heavy rainfall and winds that washed out the crime scene and compromised the evidence, which included one of the subject’s two rifles, casings from shooting at the funeral home employees, and other personal items inside the vehicle,” according to the DOJ.
KXAN found this wasn’t the only instance DPS refused help or denied other agencies information further delaying the investigative process, the report states.
The DOJ’s report states the FBI offered its victim specialists to help with the death notification process but were denied the ability to assist.
Officials react to DOJ report of Uvalde shooting response
“They were told “we got this” by TXDPS, even though the TXDPS staff was untrained in this process,” according to the DOJ report.
Furthermore, the report states local investigations have been delayed due to the unwillingness to cooperate with a request by the City of Uvalde for evidence necessary to their internal review.
“UPD’s internal investigation has been hampered by a lack of access to evidence that TXDPS was in possession of and not willing to share,” the report states.
U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said that none of the 376 officers at the scene will face federal charges. One day after the release of the DOJ report, Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell called forth a grand jury to review evidence. Any charges related to the May 2022 shooting are left up to them.
The report states Texas DPS and other law enforcement agencies failed to communicate in a culturally sensitive manner with victims’ family members.
DOJ report: TX DPS official re-enacted Uvalde shooting in front of victims’ families
Key among these failures was a lack of information released in Spanish, death notices delivered by undertrained personnel and insensitive leadership, the report said.
According to Moody, the Texas House investigative committee also acknowledged a lack of information flow to families, especially those whose primary language is Spanish. The DOJ report says that press conferences were primarily held in English, despite requests for translation.
Moody explained that the House had planned to release English and Spanish reports at the same time but received word that families wanted the documents immediately, rather than waiting for the translation. A Spanish report was eventually published.
The federal agency also criticizes the Department of Public Safety for refusing to utilize resources from the FBI’s victim specialists. The report details one press conference where a DPS officer “re-enacted the shooting,” in front of victims and families.
IN-DEPTH: TX DPS official re-enacted Uvalde shooting in front of victims’ families
Moody emphasized that the DOJ was better able to delve into how Uvalde and DPS officials communicated with the public. “We certainly heard from some of the family members about, you know, the lack of care or lack of compassion,” he said. “There’s no right way to deliver such terrible information to people who have lost so much, but it certainly could have been better, should have been better.”
On Friday, the Texas Department of Public Safety released a statement thanking the DOJ “for the tremendous amount of time and attention it has put into compiling the critical incident review.”
“As DPS Director Steven McCraw first stated in the weeks after the shooting, the law enforcement response that day was an abject failure, and this report’s observations underscore those failures,” DPS said in its Friday statement. “The State of Texas has already implemented some of the recommendations proposed by the DOJ review in order to prevent tragedies in the future.”
A Travis County judge issued an order Friday for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to sit for a deposition on Feb. 1 in the lawsuit brought by four of his former employees. However, some of those plaintiffs and their attorneys expect Paxton to appeal.
Judge Jan Soifer said Paxton will have to appear for and answer questions in an oral deposition at an Austin law firm on that day starting at 9 a.m. She said she reached this decision because his office failed to negotiate with the plaintiffs’ attorneys over times to schedule the deposition.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton moves to end litigation in whistleblower lawsuit
The order also set dates for three of Paxton’s top employees: Feb. 2 for First Assistant Attorney General Brent Webster, Feb. 7 for Chief of Staff Lesley French Henneke, and Feb. 9 for senior advisor Michelle Smith.
KXAN never received any responses after reaching out twice Friday seeking comment from the Office of the Attorney General about the judge’s latest order. This story will be updated once anything is shared.
This all comes a day after Paxton’s attorneys submitted a filing that they said aims to end the lawsuit the former employees brought against his office. It also follows the Texas Supreme Court denying Paxton’s request to block his deposition in the lawsuit from his former top-ranking deputies, who allege Paxton wrongfully terminated them after reporting him for alleged corruption to federal authorities.
Attorney TJ Turner, who represents whistleblower David Maxwell, shared his reaction Friday to this filing, calling it a “stunt” intended to block the deposition from happening.
“I think the last thing Ken Paxton wants to do is put a hand on his Bible and tell the truth, and he’s going to avoid that at all costs,” Turner said. “So I think there will be another legal maneuver, and we’ll wait and see what that is.
In their filing, Paxton’s attorneys emphasized his belief that he did nothing wrong, noting the Texas Senate acquitted him at his impeachment trial last year. They also argue that the former employees claims’ include are not protected by the state’s whistleblower protection law.
However, in the same document, they said Paxton’s office “hereby elects not to contest any issue of fact in this case” and “elects not to dispute the Plaintiffs’ lawsuit.”
That latter argument especially shocked Blake Brickman, a former deputy attorney general who’s now suing Paxton. He said he saw what Paxton wrote in the filing as “total vindication.”
“This is a total 180 that Ken Paxton has done. He is now saying he is not contesting our facts. The impeachment trial was based on our allegations, and now he’s saying what we said is true,” Brickman said. “The people of Texas really need to think about that. Conservative, rule-of-law Republicans really need to think about how disingenuous this attorney general is for him to say, actually, all these things are true now, right before he’s about to get deposed, after he went through the impeachment. It’s shocking. It really is.”
Brickman said he does anticipate Paxton to appeal the judge’s order. However, that last resulted in the Texas Supreme Court rejecting his request to avoid testifying under oath in the lawsuit.
If Paxton does eventually go under oath, though, he could invoke his Fifth Amendment right and not answer any questions. Mike Golden, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said that could end up harming a defendant in a civil case like this.
“Here in a civil case, any witness, including the defendant or an employee defendant, can plead the Fifth Amendment and refuse to answer any particular question. That’s protected by the Constitution, and they can’t be compelled to answer those questions,” Golden said. “But the flip side is, in the civil case, their refusal to answer that question gets used against them in court. The plaintiffs can argue to the jury: he didn’t answer this question because he knew the answer will be bad for him, and he didn’t answer 77 questions because he knew the answers were going to be bad for him. That’s the huge difference between how a criminal case works and a civil case [works].”
In new campaign finance reports released this week, Paxton detailed how he spent nearly $2.3 million in campaign funds to pay for his legal defense in his impeachment trial.
A round of frigid weather had many Texans facing subfreezing temperatures last week, and the Arctic blast led to record-breaking demand for electricity across the state. During those days, ERCOT called on Texans to conserve energy. But the state still set new records for power use.
Numbers from ERCOT show the previous peak energy demand record for January was set back in 2018. Back then, Texans set the record at just under 66-thousand megawatts. Last Sunday, January 14, the state shattered that record, with peak demand closing in on 71-thousand megawatts.
The next day, we shattered it again, with demand topping 76-thousand megawatts. Tuesday brought another record, with peak demand exceeding 78-thousand megawatts.
But the new records have some worried about future demand on the system. Politics reporter Ryan Chandler spoke with the CEO of ERCOT about how the state will meet the need for energy.
Ryan Chandler: Every time the supply and the demand on the grid gets a little too close, I notice that wind and solar are always the first scapegoats or points of blame — because maybe the sun isn’t out or there’s less wind than we expect. But you know, of course, back in February 2021, natural gas was also hindered by the extreme cold, as well. Can you break down how all of the different energy sources that feed our grid play into the overall supply and which are the most reliable this week?
Pablo Vegas, ERCOT CEO: Well, it’s really a question of needing to have all of the pieces of the puzzle working together in order to get through an event like this. And it’s really never our intent to try to place blame on any one source of energy. When we’re having challenges or when the grid gets tight, what we want to do is just try to explain facts as to what’s happening on the grid. Those facts can vary based on what the season is and what’s going on, and what time of day it is. For example, during the winter, we’re always going to see those peaks, typically when the sun goes down and things get very cold. So, obviously, solar resources won’t play a role in helping to deliver energy during those peaks in the wintertime.
And then, as we look at this week in particular, we really needed all of the pieces and parts to work together. So we needed the thermal power plants to be available, we needed the batteries to all be available and ready to go. And then wind is the main variable that we look at. That just depends on whether the wind is blowing for this event. The wind performance, the wind has been blowing a little bit less than what is seasonally normal this time of year. So that does help to contribute a little bit, but it’s not blame. It’s just the fact — the wind blows, sometimes it blows hard, and sometimes it doesn’t blow hard. But the windmills themselves, they’ve seen really good performance in terms of very little icing. So we haven’t been losing the available windmills to that kind of issue. So, all across the board, the electric supply fleet has really been performing very well during this week.
Ryan Chandler: Let’s talk long-term because this week we’re feeling pretty comfortable, but every December, January, February, people are still anxious ever since that February 2021 storm. Every time the temperatures plunge, we start worrying: ‘Are the lights going to stay on? Am I going to stay warm?’ What are we doing as a state and as a grid in the next 5, 10 years to make sure that when the temperatures drop, we don’t have to have this same conversation next year or the year after that?
Pablo Vegas, ERCOT CEO: We certainly know a couple of things are going to likely remain true. One is: Texas continues to grow economically year over year. Texas is doing really well. A lot of people are moving to the state, businesses are moving to the state. So that helps to drive electric demand up. As a result of that, it requires infrastructure investments across the board. We’ve seen the state legislature take up this issue and find ways to try to incentivize all different types of generation to get developed, including thermal dispatchable generation.
We’re already seeing a lot of growth on the electric grid from renewable sources. We’re seeing solar and wind growing on the electric grid year over year. We’re seeing batteries growing very rapidly on the electric grid. We’re seeing that every year, the additions of those resources, and they’re making a big difference during the summers as well as during the winters. If we can add to that and balance that growth with some thermal dispatchable resources, which is what some of the legislation that was passed in the last session enabled and incentivized, then we’re really going to be able to get to that place where we know we’re going to be able to address whether it’s the hottest day or the coldest winter without having as many reliability concerns as we sometimes do today.
Ryan Chandler: Are we seeing any impact from those investments? For people who may be unaware, the governor signed a pair of bills meant to provide loans and incentivize power plants to come to Texas and build more plants. It could cost as much as $18 billion, per some reports. Are we seeing any payoff from that investment? Any projects in the pipeline now?
Yeah, we’ve already seen some announcements made from companies that are going to start to build new gas-fired power plants as a result of that incentive that came through the legislation. The governor and I were just down in Houston a few weeks back (for) an announcement that Calpine made about an investment. They’re already making up their Freestone energy center. So, it’s definitely leading to companies making decisions to make investments and to help support the growing energy economy here in Texas.
Texas voters will begin heading to the polls in just over a month for the primary elections. Early voting begins on Feb. 20 for the March 5 primary. New polling is giving early insight into how voters feel about the issues and the candidates.
The Emerson College Polling/Nexstar Media poll asked 1,315 registered Texas voters about the upcoming presidential and senate primaries along with hypothetical November election scenarios.
The poll found a variety of concerns motivating Texans to vote this year. Immigration and border security was listed by 29% of voters as the top issue facing Texas. The economy finished second at 22%, followed by healthcare at 12% and education and abortion access both at 9%. Threats to democracy, crime and housing affordability were also named.
Among Democratic voters, a key primary race will determine who faces Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in November. In the Senate primary, 29% of Democratic voters polled plan to support Representative Colin Allred. State Sen. Roland Gutierrez trails with 7% support in the poll, just ahead of the 6% supporting Nueces County District Attorney Mark Gonzalez. A plurality of voters (37%) are undecided ahead of the March primary.
While Allred has a double-digit lead over the other Democrats in the field, the poll still shows him short of the 50% threshhold to avoid a runoff to decide the nomination.
In a hypothetical general election between Allred and Senator Ted Cruz, Cruz holds 42% of the vote over Allred’s 40%, a statistical tie considering the poll’s credibility interval of +/- 2.6 percentage points. A race between Gutierrez and Cruz appears even closer, with Cruz receiving 41% and Gutierrez receiving 40% of support. In both cases, approximately 8% of voters choose someone else, and 11% are undecided.
The poll shows that Texas voters expect a November rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in the presidential election. In the primary poll, President Biden won support from 72% of Texas Democrats, giving him a strong lead for the nomination. Marianne Williamson trails with 6%, followed by 5% for Dean Phillips.
Donald Trump leads the Republican primary with 69% of support from Texas voters. He’s trailed by former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley at 11% and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis at 9%. Trump is also ahead in a hypothetical general election battle, claiming 49% of the vote over Biden’s 41%.
Almost 90% of people in the Emerson College Polling/Nexstar Media poll said they were likely to vote in the upcoming state primary elections. That would be astonishingly high. Just 18% of registered voters participated in the 2022 primary election. In 2020, the last presidential primary year, 25% of Texas voters turned out for the March primary.
As of now, Texas is home to 17.9 million registered voters, about 81% of the voting age population. That’s over a million more potential voters than January 2020.

The Emerson College Polling/Nexstar Media Texas poll was conducted January 13-15, 2024. The sample consisted of 1,315 registered voters, with a credibility interval, similar to a poll’s margin of error, of +/- 2.6 percentage points. The Democratic Senate Primary poll consisted of 460 Democratic Primary voters, with a credibility interval of +/- 4.5 percentage points.

PFKL1ZG3I1_S1ZHVD7V0X84UEL,Superbug crisis threatens to kill 10 million per year by 2050. Scientists may have a solution,"Sandee LaMotte, CNN","January 22, 2024 at 1:55 AM·10 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/microscopic-war-raging-inside-us-150018664.html,"Cynthia Horton’s earaches are the stuff of nightmares.
“I can wake up from my sleep in horrible pain, like I’m having a root canal with no anesthesia,” she said. “When I sit up, my ear is often weeping with infection, even oozing blood.”
Already weakened by a lifelong battle with lupus, Horton’s immune system was devastated by rounds of radiation and chemotherapy after a 2003 surgery for a cancerous tumor in her ear.
Ear infections became the norm, usually eased by a round of antibiotics. But as the years passed, the bacteria in 61-year old Horton’s ear became resistant to antibiotics, often leaving her with little to no relief.
“These multi-drug-resistant superbugs can cause chronic infections in individuals for months to years to sometimes decades. It’s ridiculous just how virulent some of these bacteria get over time,” said Dwayne Roach, assistant professor of bacteriophages, infectious disease and immunology at San Diego State University.
Last year doctors offered to treat Horton’s infection with one of nature’s oldest predators — tiny tripod-looking viruses called phages designed to find, attack and gobble up bacteria.
The microscopic creatures have saved the lives of patients dying from superbug infections and are being used in clinical trials as a potential solution to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. In the United States alone, more than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur each year.
Such infections are a “urgent global public health threat,” killing 5 million people worldwide, according to 2019 statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“It’s estimated that by 2050, 10 million people per year — that’s one person every three seconds — is going to be dying from a superbug infection,” said infectious disease epidemiologist Steffanie Strathdee, codirector of the first dedicated phage therapy center in North America, the Center for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics, or IPATH, at UC San Diego School of Medicine.
Eager for a different solution to her recurrent ear infections, Horton was game. Samples of her drug-resistant bacteria were shipped from her doctor’s office in Pennsylvania to UC San Diego’s IPATH with the hopes that phage hunters there could find a match. What scientists discovered next, however, was unexpected.
The bacteria cultured from Horton’s ear were a perfect match to a rare superbug found in certain brands of over-the-counter eye drops that were robbing people of their vision and lives.
Suddenly, the search for a solution to Horton’s problem took on new meaning. Would the bacteria from her ear help scientists find phages that would treat the eye infections as well?
Severe cases of antibiotic-resistant eye infections began popping up in May 2022. By the following January, the CDC said at least 50 patients in 11 states had developed superbug infections after using preservative‐free artificial tears. By May 2023, the outbreak had spread to 18 states: Four people died, another four lost eyes, 14 suffered vision loss, and dozens more developed infections in other parts of the body.
“Only a fraction of patients actually had eye infections, which made the outbreak incredibly difficult to solve,” said epidemiologist Dr. Maroya Walters, who led the CDC’s artificial tears investigation.
“We saw people who were colonized by the organism develop urinary tract or respiratory tract infections months down the road, even though they were no longer using these drops,” Walters said. “One patient spread the infection to others in the health care facility.”
The culprit was a rare strain of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had never been identified in the United States before the outbreak, the CDC said.
Horton had never used eye drops, yet the bacteria cultured from her ear were the same rare strain. Using those bacteria and other samples sent by the CDC, scientists at IPATH immediately went to work and identified more than a dozen phages that successfully attacked the deadly pathogen.
Scientists at the CDC were intrigued by the discovery, so much so that they mentioned the availability of the phage treatment for the superbug on the CDC website.
“It brought up this idea of when we have an outbreak that’s caused by bacteria with such limited treatment options, should we be thinking about these alternative therapies?” Walters said.
What is this little creature that can topple bacteria capable of withstanding all the drugs that modern science can muster? And more importantly, could phage treatment become a major player in the battle to end the superbug crisis?
Thanks to evolution, the gazillions of bacteria in the world today have a natural enemy: tiny viruses called bacteriophages genetically programmed for search-and-destroy missions. In this microscopic game of “The Terminator,” each set of phages is uniquely designed to find, attack and devour a specific type of pathogen.
“Each bacterial species, or even genotypes within it, can have a whole repertoire of phages that are attacking it, using a wide variety of methods to enter and debilitate the bacterial cell,” said Paul Turner, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University and microbiology faculty member at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.
To counter the attack, bacteria employ various evasive maneuvers, such as shedding their outer skins to eliminate docking ports the phage use to enter, ravage and ultimately explode the pathogen into bits of bacterial goo.
That’s good news because the newly naked bacteria may lose their resistance to antibiotics, becoming once again vulnerable to elimination. The phage, however, is taken out of action, no longer able to fight.
To maximize success, specialists search for a variety of phages to tackle a particularly nasty superbug — at times creating a cocktail of microscopic warriors that can hopefully continue the attack when one is neutralized.
That’s what happened in 2016 to Strathdee’s husband, Tom Patterson, a retired professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego. Due to an infection with “Iraqibacter,” a drug-resistant bacterium found in the sands of Iraq, Patterson was in multi-organ failure and perilously close to death. In a race against time, Strathdee overcame incredible obstacles to find and deliver several cocktails of purified phages to Patterson’s doctors.
One of those cocktails contained a phage that “scared the bacteria so much that it dropped its outer capsule,” said Strathdee, an associate dean of global health sciences at UC San Diego and coauthor of “The Perfect Predator: A Scientist’s Race to Save Her Husband From a Deadly Superbug.”
“It was more afraid of the phage, if you will, than the antibiotic, and that allowed the antibiotic to work again. It was the one-two punch Tom needed,” Strathdee said. “Three days later, Tom lifted his head off the pillow out of a deep coma and kissed his daughter’s hand. It was just miraculous.”
In labs around the country, phage scientists are taking research and discovery to the next level, or what Strathdee calls “phage 3.0.” Scientists in Turner’s Yale laboratory are busy mapping which phages and antibiotics are most symbiotic in the fight against a pathogen. Roach’s San Diego State lab is investigating the body’s immune response to phages while developing new phage purification techniques to prepare samples for intravenous use in patients.
Currently, clinical trials are underway to test the effectiveness of phages against intractable urinary tract infections, chronic constipation, joint infections, diabetic foot ulcers, tonsillitis and the persistent, reoccurring infections that occur in patients with cystic fibrosis. The chronic infections common in cystic fibrosis are typically due to various strains of drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa — the same pathogen responsible for Horton’s ear infection and the artificial tears outbreak.
A number of labs are developing libraries of phages, stockpiled with strains found in nature that are known to be effective against a particular pathogen. In Texas, a new facility is taking that a step further — speeding up evolution by creating phages in the lab.
“Rather than just sourcing new phages from the environment, we have a bioreactor that in real time creates billions upon billions of phages,” said Anthony Maresso, associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
“Most of those phages won’t be active against the drug-resistant bacteria, but at some point there will be a rare variant that has been trained, so to speak, to attack the resistant bacteria, and we’ll add that to our arsenal,” Maresso said. “It’s a next-generation approach on phage libraries.”
Maresso’s lab published a study last year on the treatment of 12 patients with phages customized to each patient’s unique bacterial profile. It was a qualified success: The antibiotic-resistant bacteria in five patients were eradicated, while several more patients showed improvements.
“There’s a lot of approaches right now that are happening in parallel,” Roach said. “Do we engineer phages? Do we make a phage cocktail, and then how big is the cocktail? Is it two phages or 12 phages? Should phages be inhaled, applied topically or injected intravenously? There’s a lot of work underway on exactly how to best do this.”
To date, genetic manipulation of phages has been difficult due the streamlined nature of the creature: “Normal phages are optimized by evolution to be lean, mean, killing machines. There’s very little room in there for us to get in and change things,” said Elizabeth Villa, a professor of molecular biology at UC San Diego who studies a new form of phage called “jumbo” phages.
“Jumbo phages have very large genomes and come close to having a nucleus that encapsulates the genetic material, which protects them from some of the mechanisms bacteria use against phages to deactivate them,” said Dr. Robert “Chip” Schooley, a leading infectious disease specialist at UC San Diego who is codirector of IPATH.
“That also gives them room to be engineered to become more potent, so they’re very promising phages to be used therapeutically,” Schooley said.
Genetically engineering phages would allow scientists to target each person’s unique mix of antibiotic-resistant pathogens instead of searching sewage, bogs, ponds, the bilge of boats and other prime breeding grounds for bacteria to find just the right phage for the job.
Along with phage libraries, genetic engineering is also a key to churning out phages in mass, to distribute on a wider scale. In Russia and the country of Georgia, where phage therapy has been used for decades, patients can buy phage cocktails off the shelf in pharmacies.
All this work has caught the attention of the CDC. In addition to using a phage cocktail to treat a superbug outbreak in real time, phages could also help fight a broader issue — the recolonization of the infected person with the same superbug, the CDC’s Walters said.
“The issue is that when patients have infections with these drug-resistant bacteria, they can still carry that organism in or on their bodies even after treatment,” Walters said. “They don’t show any signs or symptoms of illness, but they can get infections again, and they can also transmit the bacteria to other people.”
However, if phages could be used to “decolonize” a bacterial population inside a high-risk person, “patients could really decrease the likelihood of developing an infection and spreading to others, which is a big part of the problem,” Walters said.
“We were thinking about trying to develop a curated phage collection that would be active against a large number of certain resistant organisms,” she added. “Pseudomonas is a good place to start — there are more than 140 different species. But there are many other organisms that threaten us that we also need to tackle.”

That is, catching up on all the PBS, BBC and assorted Brit Box mysteries that I’ve missed out on or deserve a re-watch. Inspector Morse, Jimmy Perez and Adam Dalgleish are my constant companions these days. Because there’s nothing like a violent death in a windswept locale to make you feel warm and snuggly on a cold winter’s eve. And no one does it better than the Brits.
Oh sure, we Americans have contributed a host of quirky detectives to the genre: Columbo, Monk and the ever-resourceful MacGyver. But I blame my mother for my current obsession, because 9 p.m. Thursday was the sacred hour that “Mystery!” aired on PBS in northeast Ohio. My formative years were filled with Lord Peter Wimsey, Sherlock Holmes (the excellent Jeremy Brett version) and Helen Mirren’s incredible turn in “Prime Suspect.""
I feel the same way about British mysteries that some of my friends do about Hallmark movies. You don’t mind that it’s a formula. And if you watch just a few, you start to get the gist.
First, start with an enviable location, such as:
A). A stylish London flat.
B). Oxford or Cambridge.
C). A quaint village in Yorkshire.
D). The rugged coastlines of the Shetland Islands.
Next, toss in a former or current occupation (because the sleuth is often a brilliant amateur) seemingly at odds with the ghastly business of solving murders. Your detective should be:
A). Independently wealthy, or from minor nobility.
B). A vicar, curate, priest or nun.
C). A writer.
D). A professor of some obscure subject.
Then, give your detective a passion or hobby unrelated to sleuthing. It spices things up, rounds out their character and provides comic relief. Your crime-solver may be into:
A). Opera.
B). Writing poetry.
C). Jazz.
D). Solving crossword puzzles.
Finally, introduce a flaw, foible or past tragedy that makes it difficult or impossible for said detective to begin or maintain normal human relationships. He or she must be:
A). A “confirmed bachelor,” ideally curmudgeonly.
B). Widowed.
C). Alcoholic.
D). Widowed and alcoholic.
And one more thing. Your detective must have a quirky/amusing sidekick to play off. Said sidekick should be the complete opposite in temperament, socioeconomic background or gender — possibly all three. They might be:
A). A gay curate who’s still in the closet because it’s the 1950s.
B). Your dead wife’s ex-husband.
C). Your official police partner, who is considerably younger (or older), more strait-laced (or rough around the edges), or (gasp) a woman.
D). A winsome dog.
And the murders? Well, they are secondary in the scheme of things. But they should be a bit creative, not too bloody, and generally happen to people we don’t care much about.
Otherwise, it would be too much like real life. And that’s not what Thursdays at 9 p.m. are all about.

Chris Sununu (R) on Sunday dug into former President Trump following his apparent confusion about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), arguing the former president has “lost the fastball.”
The comment came in response to a question by NBC “Meet the Press” anchor Kristen Welker, who pointed to Trump’s speech last week, when he appeared to confuse Haley and Pelosi while discussing the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots.
“Look, whether it’s Joe Biden or Donald Trump … either one, get off the teleprompter, they can barely make a cogent point. I mean, really,” Sununu said.
Welker interjected to ask if Sununu was saying Trump is not mentally fit, to which the governor responded, “Not in that moment, he sure as heck wasn’t. I mean, look, the point is you have two nearly 80-year-olds fighting this thing out. That’s not what America wants.”
“That is a great example of, this is not Donald Trump, the disruptor of 2016. This guy has lost his fastball. You know, that’s a great example of it. We always want to go forward in America, right? We always want that next generation. Neither of these guys represent the next generation,” Sununu continued.
Sununu, whose state will hold its high-stakes primary on Tuesday, has endorsed Haley and appeared with her on the campaign trail in recent months. He came under criticism earlier this month, however, when he said he would support whomever the eventual Republican nominee is, even if it is Trump as a hypothetical convicted felon.
Haley also called out Trump’s mental fitness during another Sunday interview, arguing the former president’s mental fitness is “not at the same level” as it was the first time he won the White House in 2016.
A polling index by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ shows Trump with a 11.1 point lead over Haley in the Granite State, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails far behind.

Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Facebook, information as of 06:00 on 21 January
Details: A total of 80 clashes between Ukrainian and Russian forces occurred over the course of the past 24 hours. Russian forces deployed S-300 guided anti-aircraft missiles to carry out three missile strikes on civilian infrastructure in Novohradivka (Donetsk Oblast) and four airstrikes. They also deployed multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) 58 times to attack the positions of Ukrainian troops and civilian settlements, injuring civilians and damaging around 40 residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure facilities.
Russian forces deployed 2 Shahed-136/131 attack drones on the night of 20-21 January, with Ukrainian air defence disabling 1 Russian drone.
Russian forces also carried out airstrikes on Chernatske and Seredyna-Buda (Sumy Oblast).
A total of 140 civilian towns and villages came under Russian shelling in Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Mykolaiv oblasts.
Russia continues to maintain its forces near the Ukrainian border on the Sivershchyna and Slobozhanshchyna fronts and is conducting sabotage operations in the area in order to prevent Ukraine from transferring its troops to more vulnerable fronts. Russian forces are also building up minefields and explosive barriers as a protective measure along the Russian-Ukrainian border, in Belgorod Oblast.
On the Lyman front, Ukrainian forces repelled six Russian assaults near Terny and Yampolivka (Donetsk Oblast) and another seven assaults in the vicinity of the Serebrianka forest and Bilohorivka (Luhansk Oblast).
On the Bakhmut front, Ukrainian forces repelled eight Russian assaults in the vicinity of Bohdanivka, Andriivka and Klishchiivka (Donetsk Oblast).
Within the area of responsibility of the Tavriia Operational Strategic Group on the Avdiivka front, Ukrainian forces are continuing to repel Russian attempts to encircle the city of Avdiivka. Ukrainian forces are holding the line and inflicting significant losses on the Russians. Over the course of the past day, Ukraine’s defence forces repelled 11 Russian assaults near Avdiivka and another 12 assaults to the south of Sieverne, Vodiane, Pervomaiske and Nevelske (Donetsk Oblast).
On the Marinka front, Ukraine’s defence forces are continuing to hold the Russians back near Heorhiivka, Marinka and Novomykhailivka (Donetsk Oblast), where they repelled six Russian assaults.
On the Shakhtarsk front, Russian forces did not undertake any offensive operations.
On the Zaporizhzhia front, Ukraine’s defence forces repelled a Russian assault to the west of Verbove (Zaporizhzhia Oblast).
Within the area of responsibility of the Odesa Operational Strategic Group on the Kherson front, Ukrainian forces are continuing to undertake operations to expand their foothold [on Dnipro’s left (east) bank]. Russian forces keep trying to push the Ukrainians out despite suffering significant losses. Over the course of the past day, the Russians undertook six unsuccessful assaults on Ukrainian positions.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces are undertaking active operations to inflict losses on Russian forces in terms of personnel and equipment and to wear the Russians out along the entire front.
Over the course of the day, Ukrainian aircraft carried out airstrikes on six clusters of Russian military personnel, weapons and equipment, one air defence system, one ammunition storage point and one communication centre.

PM5IPPSKWM_X2SXFUKZY66U8OS,Sturgeon’s Covid blunders intensify black cloud hanging over SNP,Alan Cochrane,"January 22, 2024 at 4:38 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/sturgeon-covid-blunders-intensify-black-193820546.html,"The stench is becoming unbearable and what’s worse is that the suspicions that many of us have had about the rottenness of this SNP Government are being borne out with almost every day that passes. No, not just about its perpetual and damaging obsession with breaking up Britain but about the arrogance that stems from the untrammelled power of 16 years in office.
It has come to a head with the astonishing revelations that while she was first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, as well as her senior ministerial colleagues and civil servants, is said to have casually disposed of WhatsApp messages that provided information about how she ran the response to the Covid pandemic.
That has now led to the families of those who suffered badly from Covid, as well as those who lost loved ones, to demand a police investigation as to whether laws about the retention of such documents and messages had been broken.
On Saturday, Ms Sturgeon admitted that her messages had “not been retained on my own device” but she said she had been able to “obtain copies” of some.
But in many ways a more sobering and shocking example of how cavalier with the truth her administration had become is shown with the emergence of a cabinet minute detailing how Ms Sturgeon and her ministers were considering how to politicise the fight against Covid.
Incredibly, their decision was reached on the very same day as Ms Sturgeon was seen at one of her daily televised press conferences indignantly denying as “nonsense” that any such course of action was being contemplated. Her emphasis was on public health and she added: “Anybody trotting out political or constitutional arguments is in the wrong place completely.”
There we have it: on a June day in 2020, when the death toll from Covid was terrifying the nation and Ms Sturgeon’s daily TV slots – the so-called “Zooms of doom” – had become compulsive viewing, her cabinet was working out how to make political hay from the pandemic. Not how to ease suffering but to score political points.
It can only be imagined how such a move might be viewed among Covid victims everywhere.
Seasoned observers of all parties, including nationalist veterans, have been shocked by the latest revelations, which show just now much “official” Scotland – in the shape of civil servants in St Andrew’s House, the Scottish Government’s Edinburgh headquarters – appears to have been affected by the attitudes of ministerial bosses.
There are few who would disagree with the verdict of Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, who accused the SNP Government of being guilty on an “industrial scale of lying and misleading the public”. He included civil servants in his attack, saying the problem went “beyond a few rotten apples at the top, in terms of ministers”. Mr Sarwar added: “It seems that even government officials were complicit.”
This view has been reinforced by evidence from the Covid Inquiry, which revealed that some officials had informed ministers and senior advisers about how messages are deleted.
Nobody’s laughing at these details, as revealed by these first episodes in the inquiry north of the border. That’s before ministers, including Ms Sturgeon and her senior advisers, begin giving evidence.
As well as possibly facing a criminal investigation over deleted WhatsApp messages from the pandemic, the ­Information Commissioner’s Office is also being asked to investigate “any potential breaches of the law” after the UK inquiry heard on Friday that “no messages whatsoever” had been handed over by Ms Sturgeon.
There is also the small matter of Operation Branchform, the more than two-year-long police investigation into the SNP’s finances – a huge black cloud that is still hanging over Scotland’s governing party.
It is difficult to imagine a more testing period than what’s in store for Humza Yousaf’s team but, in the minds of most observers, they are reaping what they and their predecessors have sown.

It’s the latest example of the former president leveraging his popularity within the GOP to influence Republican officeholders – even as he lacks any formal powers to set the political agenda. If Trump openly campaigns against it, Republicans will have a hard time supporting the border security deal that is now favored by many senators in their own party.
The proposal – which has not yet been finalized – would reportedly approve several conservative border priorities. The deal would call for stricter asylum standards and new deportation powers in exchange for a $106 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and other domestic and foreign goals that are related to the mission of keeping the country safe.
In an interview with House Speaker Mike Johnson Wednesday night, Fox News host Laura Ingraham said Trump told her he was against the deal, that he’d urged Johnson to reject it, and that he was “extremely adamant” about it.
“He and I have been talking about this pretty frequently,” Johnson said, noting that he would reserve judgment on the deal until the bill text is out. But “it doesn’t sound good at the outset.”
Trump also posted to Truth Social Wednesday that he opposes a border package “unless we get EVERYTHING needed to shut down the INVASION” at the southern border. He added that he has “no doubt” that Johnson will “only make a deal that is PERFECT ON THE BORDER.”
Trump’s comments are “certainly not helpful,” Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said Thursday. “But in the end, people are going to have to do what they think is right to solve what is a major crisis at our southern border at a time when we have more leverage than we would ever have.”
Many Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have argued it is a unique moment to win conservative border policy, as Democrats won’t want to support new restrictions under Trump and have an incentive to address migration. In a CBS News poll released earlier this month, just 32% of Americans said they supported Biden’s handling of the border.
But that’s the same reason some House Republicans have opposed the package, arguing it would not only open the door to additional Ukraine aid, which several oppose, but that it could help Biden’s reelection prospects and take away a politically salient issue for Trump to campaign on.
That’s left Senate Republicans arguing that the package is a more conservative deal than they’d ever get with Trump in office – and that it wouldn’t hurt his prospects.
“I don’t think it’s going to be like turning off the spigot tomorrow if we were to pass something,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “This is going to long be an issue, including through the election. There’s a lot of other stuff to run on too … I don’t think you need to hold a gun to your own head and say ‘don’t make me do this.’”
Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said Democrats won’t agree to conservative border priorities “without being forced to.”
“It doesn’t surprise me” that Trump is talking to Johnson about the deal, Rounds told USA TODAY. But “I think that the next administration, if it’s different than the Biden administration, will definitely want these tools in their arsenal.”
Johnson has not officially dismissed the bipartisan plan, which Senate leaders are hoping can come to the floor for a vote as early as this week. But he has said he would only support something that hews closely to House Republicans’ hardline border bill, which received no Democratic votes in the House and has no chance of survival in the Democrat-controlled Senate – making successful border policy this year even more out of reach.
Since leaving office at the beginning of 2021, Trump has repeatedly flexed his influence in the party that he reshaped during his first term in office.
In the months following Jan. 6, 2021 – when a mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol after he repeatedly claimed he had won the election without evidence – many Republicans distanced themselves from the former president and condemned his lack of action to interrupt the riot.
But even then, only 10 Republican House members voted to impeach him and seven Republican senators voted to convict.
In the years since, those attitudes have softened and Trump’s power in the party has grown. In the 2022 midterm elections, he actively campaigned against those who he felt hadn’t been sufficiently loyal, with mixed success.
He’s weighed in on multiple Congressional fights, including the bid to replace former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. He has pushed members to take action that would benefit him or punish his opponents, such as impeaching Joe Biden or face being “immediately primaried.” He has fostered relationships with GOP members and personally asked for their endorsements, leading to more than half of the caucus endorsing him before the Iowa Caucuses.
Now, he remains the clear frontrunner to be the party’s nominee for president. He took more than half of the votes in Iowa, which was the first presidential nominating contest of the election season, and is likely to similarly dominate the New Hampshire primary this week.
“He’s the leading candidate to be president coming out of our party,” Rounds told reporters Thursday. “So most certainly, individuals here will give deference to someone who is the leading candidate to be the next president.”

Costco posted Fratelli Beretta’s announcement that “in an abundance of caution,” Fratelli Beretta USA “issued a voluntary market withdrawal” of Fratelli Beretta Antipasto Gran Beretta.
The “voluntary market withdrawal” — a recall by any other name — involves item No. 1074880, twin 12-ounce trays of dry salami, dry coppa and prosciutto sold at Costcos from Nov. 16 through Jan. 9 with a best by date of June 13, 2024.
Previously, Fratelli Beretta recalled lot No. 075330300 of twin 9-ounce trays of Busseto Charcuterie Sampler with dry coppa, sweet soppressata and prosciutto that were sold at Sam’s Club. The best by date on this lot is April 27, 2024.

The official infection count is 47 people in 22 states with no hospitalizations or deaths. Salmonella outbreaks often wind up undercounted because most people get sick and recover without hospitalization or needing to see a medical professional.
Of the 47 people, the CDC said 26 have been interviewed about what they’ve eaten recently and 19 said they’d eaten charcuterie meats. Ten people could identify what meats by memory or purchase tracking.
Four were Costco customers who bought the Fratelli Beretta brand Antipasto Gran Beretta and one bought a different Fratelli charcuterie product. Five bought charcuterie meats at Sam’s Club. Three of them bought the Busseto sampler, but the other two couldn’t remember the brand.
As for where the sick people are, Ohio leads with 11. Washington has five. New York has four. Texas, Nebraska and Pennsylvania have three each. Wisconsin and Arizona each have two. One person has been counted in each of these states: Kentucky, Missouri, Illinois, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.
About 1.35 million people in the United States each year spend four to seven days with diarrhea, fever and stomachaches from salmonella. Check with a medical professional if fever exceeds 102 degrees and is accompanied by diarrhea; the diarrhea lasts more than three days or is bloody; you vomit up even liquids, rarely urinate, have a dry mouth and throat or get dizzy when rising. Those could be signs of dehydration."

PSC4S8OFEN_VCB36V3U3YO4XL0,Here's Why We're Not At All Concerned With Thinkific Labs' (TSE:THNC) Cash Burn Situation,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 10:59 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-were-not-concerned-135956188.html,"There's no doubt that money can be made by owning shares of unprofitable businesses. For example, although Amazon.com made losses for many years after listing, if you had bought and held the shares since 1999, you would have made a fortune. But the harsh reality is that very many loss making companies burn through all their cash and go bankrupt.
So should Thinkific Labs (TSE:THNC) shareholders be worried about its cash burn? For the purposes of this article, cash burn is the annual rate at which an unprofitable company spends cash to fund its growth; its negative free cash flow. First, we'll determine its cash runway by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves.
Check out our latest analysis for Thinkific Labs
You can calculate a company's cash runway by dividing the amount of cash it has by the rate at which it is spending that cash. When Thinkific Labs last reported its balance sheet in September 2023, it had zero debt and cash worth US$87m. In the last year, its cash burn was US$8.9m. So it had a cash runway of about 9.7 years from September 2023. Notably, however, analysts think that Thinkific Labs will break even (at a free cash flow level) before then. In that case, it may never reach the end of its cash runway. You can see how its cash balance has changed over time in the image below.
Happily, Thinkific Labs is travelling in the right direction when it comes to its cash burn, which is down 72% over the last year. And while hardly exciting, it was still good to see revenue growth of 18% during that time. It seems to be growing nicely. While the past is always worth studying, it is the future that matters most of all. So you might want to take a peek at how much the company is expected to grow in the next few years.
While Thinkific Labs seems to be in a decent position, we reckon it is still worth thinking about how easily it could raise more cash, if that proved desirable. Issuing new shares, or taking on debt, are the most common ways for a listed company to raise more money for its business. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.
Thinkific Labs' cash burn of US$8.9m is about 5.0% of its US$178m market capitalisation. Given that is a rather small percentage, it would probably be really easy for the company to fund another year's growth by issuing some new shares to investors, or even by taking out a loan.
As you can probably tell by now, we're not too worried about Thinkific Labs' cash burn. In particular, we think its cash runway stands out as evidence that the company is well on top of its spending. Its revenue growth wasn't quite as good, but was still rather encouraging! There's no doubt that shareholders can take a lot of heart from the fact that analysts are forecasting it will reach breakeven before too long. After considering a range of factors in this article, we're pretty relaxed about its cash burn, since the company seems to be in a good position to continue to fund its growth. An in-depth examination of risks revealed 3 warning signs for Thinkific Labs that readers should think about before committing capital to this stock.
Of course Thinkific Labs may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of companies boasting high return on equity, or this list of stocks that insiders are buying.

PTO72R94DS_YO2K18E2GD18CYT,Will bad weather keep New Hampshire voters home on Tuesday? Don't count on it,"Michael Collins and Joey Garrison, USA TODAY","January 22, 2024 at 8:00 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/bad-weather-keep-hampshire-voters-230039503.html,"The good news for Republicans heading into Tuesday’s presidential primary in New Hampshire: GOP voters are projected to turn out in record numbers.
The good news for all New Hampshire voters planning to go to the polls: There's no snow in the Election Day forecast.
Not that it would matter.
“New Hampshire voters don't seem to care too much about what the weather's doing,” said Nathan Shrader, a political scientist at New England College and co-director of the school’s Center for Civic Engagement. “If they have their minds made up about voting and participating, they're going to do it. These are some of the most civically minded people I've ever met.”
Counting the vote: Will results of the New Hampshire primary be delayed? What to know.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican who oversees elections in the state, predicted Friday that 322,000 people could vote in the GOP primary. That’s roughly 53% of the total number of registered Republicans and voters who haven’t declared a preference for either party.
It also would set a new state record. The previous record was set by Democrats in 2020, when about 297,000 votes were cast in the contested Democratic primary.
Before that, it was Republicans who held the record. In 2016, the first time Donald Trump was a candidate for president, a record of more than 287,000 people – or 44% of eligible voters registered as Republican or undeclared – voted in the GOP primary. Four years later, when Trump sought re-election and faced nominal opposition, GOP turnout was 23%.
Trump is back on the ballot on Tuesday, with polls giving him a comfortable lead over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
Republican voters are eagerly engaged in the contest this year, Shrader said, because they see a chance to do one of two things: Give Trump a big win that would all but make the GOP nomination his and allow him to focus more quickly on the general election in November. Or give Haley an unexpected victory or a close second-place finish that would prolong the nominating process for a few more weeks.
“New Hampshire voters relish that opportunity,” Shrader said.
A record GOP showing in New Hampshire could help ease concerns raised by last week’s Iowa Republican caucuses, which had considerably low turnout. Roughly 110,00 registered Republican voters took part in the Iowa caucuses, down from a record 187,000 voters in 2016.
The low turnout was widely considered to be the result of Iowa’s extreme cold and snow. Lagging turnout in New Hampshire could raise questions about Republican enthusiasm.
Shrader doesn’t expect that to happen, though.
The weather forecast doesn’t call for any snow in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Even if it did snow, that probably wouldn’t be enough to keep most voters at home, Shrader said.
“Voters here take this so seriously, their roles so seriously, I don't think they allow challenging weather conditions to keep them away from the polls,” he said.
'Conservative all my life': With her candidacy on the line, Haley takes on Trump in New Hampshire
Democrats, meanwhile, haven’t been all that enthusiastic their Granite State primary, Shrader said, since their leading candidate, President Joe Biden, won’t be on the ballot.
Biden, who is seeking a second term, isn’t competing in New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary because of a disagreement between state and national Democrats over which state should lead the nominating process. The Democratic National Committee, at Biden’s request, wanted South Carolina to go first. New Hampshire went ahead and scheduled its primary earlier than allowed, which national Democrats said violated the rules.
As a result, Biden decided to skip New Hampshire, but a group of volunteers unaffiliated with his campaign has launched a write-in campaign.
Still, Democratic turnout is expected to be lower than in previous years. Scanlan projected that 88,000 people would vote in the Democratic primary. That’s just 14% of the total number of Democrats and undeclared voters. For comparison, turnout on the Democratic side was 43% in 2020 and 41% in 2016.
As of Friday, New Hampshire has 873,357 registered voters: 267,768 registered Republicans, 261,254 registered Democrats and 344,335 undeclared voters for either party. Scanlon projects that overall turnout on Tuesday should be around 47%.

PTYLHORZOZ_ZNYE2XUDJ2MPJT6,UN urges Ethiopia and Somalia to talk to solve dispute,Mustafa HAJI ABDINUR,"January 21, 2024 at 9:00 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/un-urges-ethiopia-somalia-talk-120046483.html,"United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres on Sunday urged Addis Ababa and Mogadishu to open dialogue to settle their dispute over Ethiopia's maritime deal with the breakaway region of Somaliland.
Tensions in the Horn of Africa have escalated since landlocked Ethiopia struck a deal with Somaliland on January 1 that gives it much sought-after access to the sea.
In return, Somaliland -- which unilaterally declared independence in 1991 -- has said Ethiopia would give it formal recognition. Addis Ababa has not confirmed this.
Somalia on Thursday ruled out mediation with Ethiopia unless the deal is cancelled, and vowed to fight by ""all legal means"" to oppose it.
""We are always guided by our principles and our principles are related to the unity, the sovereignty and territorial independence of countries, including Somalia,"" Guterres told a press conference at the G77 plus China summit in the Ugandan capital.
""We hope that through dialogue it will be possible to overcome the current situation,"" he said.
His comments added to calls led by the United States, China, the European Union, African Union and Arab League to respect Somali sovereignty.
Ethiopia and neighbouring Somalia have a history of stormy relations and territorial feuds, fighting two wars in the late 20th century.
Mogadishu has branded the maritime pact an act of ""aggression"" by Ethiopia, which has in turn insisted no laws have been transgressed.
Under the deal, Somaliland agreed to lease 20 kilometres (12 miles) of its coast for 50 years to Ethiopia, which wants to set up a naval base and a commercial port.
Somalia vehemently opposes the independence claim by the former British protectorate of 4.5 million people that is not recognised by the international community.
Ethiopia -- the second most populous country in Africa -- was cut off from the coast after Eritrea seceded and declared independence in 1993 following a three-decade war.
Addis Ababa had  access to a port in Eritrea until the two countries went to war in 1998-2000. Since then Ethiopia has sent most of its sea trade through Djibouti.
While Somaliland is largely stable, Somalia has witnessed decades of civil war and a bloody Islamist insurgency.

Ron DeSantis of Florida dropped out of the GOP presidential race on Sunday.
The onetime rival to Trump used a purported Winston Churchill quote in his announcement video.
According to the International Churchill Society, the quote is fake.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida ended his 2024 presidential campaign on Sunday and endorsed former President Donald Trump.
Much like his disappointing campaign, perhaps one of the worst in history, DeSantis' video announcing the suspension missed the mark by including an apparently fake Winston Churchill quote.
""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,"" DeSantis wrote in a tweet accompanying his video, attributing the quote to Churchill.
“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”- Winston Churchill pic.twitter.com/ECoR8YeiMm
— Ron DeSantis (@RonDeSantis) January 21, 2024
But as many people quickly pointed out, the International Churchill Society debunked the legitimacy of the quote over a decade ago.
""Not only did Churchill never say those words — he never said the similar words more usually attributed to him, which are: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,'"" the society wrote in 2013.
It added that the conclusion was based ""on careful research in the canon of fifty million words by and about Churchill, including all of his books, articles, speeches and papers.""
A DeSantis spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Florida governor was seen as Trump's strongest opponent in the early days of his campaign, but DeSantis' numbers took a nosedive in the months that followed.
He pinned his hopes on last week's Iowa caucuses but lost to Trump by 30 percentage points.

After True Detective’s third season hit the small screen five years ago, the crime anthology series is back for a fourth installment. The six-episode season—starring Jodie Foster and Kali Reis—is set in the fictional town of Ennis, Alaska. The chilling destination is a stark contrast to previous seasons, which were filmed in Louisiana, California, and Arkansas. Unlike its predecessors, the latest season—aptly named True Detective: Night Country—wasn't filmed where it's set. In reality, the Alaskan town is portrayed by various locations in Iceland. If you’re eager to know more about the icy atmosphere, dig into everything we know below—from why filming took place in Iceland instead of Alaska to the frigid Nordic nation areas that provided backdrops.
The fourth season follows detectives Liz Danvers (Foster) and Evangeline Navarro (Reis) as they investigate the disappearance of eight men who operate a research station in the fictional town of Ennis, Alaska. Showrunner Issa López landed on Alaska as the setting after pondering how to recapture the success of the award-winning first season, which starred Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey as Louisiana detectives and was led by the original True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto. (The second and third seasons were less critically admired.) López told Total Film that a big part of what made the first season a hit was its sweltering, southern setting. So, the filmmaker went in the complete opposite direction. “Where True Detective is male and it’s sweaty, Night Country is cold and it’s dark and it’s female,” López revealed at an HBO event per Vanity Fair.
Filming in Alaska wasn’t practical thanks to the area’s rough conditions. ""As much as we would have liked to be true to the elements of the story, the part of Alaska where we needed to shoot this—which is above the Arctic Circle where the night expands into months—doesn’t have the infrastructure,"" López told Total Film.
The filmmaker added that the temperatures would’ve been so low in the months they planned to shoot that the cameras wouldn’t even work. Instead, they took the grueling 120-day shoot to Iceland. The country makes an excellent Alaska stand-in and has been tapped for many productions, including the newly released A Murder at the End of the World. Filming took place in and around Reykjavík as well as in the towns of Akureyri and Dalvík, where the production team built the whole fictional village of Ennis, according to Icelandair. Store facades, including a liquor store and gas station, along with traffic signs and specifically styled holiday decor give the Icelandic environments an American feel.
But the fictional Ennis wasn't completely dreamt up out of thin air. The sparsely populated place was inspired by the real area of North Slope Borough, Alaska, Today reports. While larger than the state of Utah, the region is estimated to have just over 11,000 residents. It boasts spectacular landscapes across nearly 95,000 square miles of northern Alaska.
Whether you tune in for the mystery or setting, Night Country already seems to be fostering a True Detective renaissance. Bundle up and tune in as episodes continue to air on Sunday nights on HBO and simultaneously drop on Max.

PY5JSEIVGD_BY7QW2CKP28H45N,This law was supposed to make California voting more fair for everyone. Has it? | Opinion,"Jonathan Mehta Stein, James Woodson","January 21, 2024 at 10:00 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/law-supposed-california-voting-more-130000698.html,"When the Voters Choice Act was signed into law in 2016, many California policymakers and voter advocacy groups expected that the new law would help bring meaningful change in the voting process, making it more accessible and inclusive.
A key aim of the act was to bolster voter engagement and turnout — particularly among historically marginalized voting groups — in counties opting into the new program. The Voters Choice Act sought to accomplish this by expanding voting opportunities, offering more flexible options for voter participation and requiring elections officials to work with communities to improve their administrative and voter outreach planning.
Opinion
Implementation of the Voters Choice Act began in five counties in 2018. Five years later, 27 California counties — representing more than half of the state’s eligible voting population — have opted into the voluntary voting model, and two more counties are adopting it in the 2024 election cycle.
When enacted, the Voters Choice Act represented a major election reform for the state. But has it held up to the expectations and actually improved voter turnout, particularly among under-served and marginalized populations?
To find out, California Common Cause, the California Black Power Network and other leading voting advocacy experts from around the state came together to take a deeper look into the law’s impact. This included surveying and interviewing community organizations and county election officials, as well as looking into data from the 2022 California voter files.
While it was challenging to isolate impacts from the Voters Choice Act and a range of other factors that could affect voter turnout, our findings on the law’s effectiveness were a mix of both successes and shortcomings.
On the upside, we found that counties that adopted the act reported fewer issues with bilingual poll worker staffing than in counties that had not; more accessible voting machines for voters with disabilities; fewer reported problems at vote centers during the three days before and on Election Day; and a significant reduction in provisional voting. The rate of in-person voting continued to be higher in Voters Choice Act counties than counties without it during the 2022 elections.
But we had a harder time determining other expected benefits.
Despite the law requiring counties to develop specific plans for voter outreach, many county elections officials and community groups reported being uncertain as to whether their voter outreach efforts actually reached historically marginalized voters, including communities of color, youth and low-income voters. Voter data for the 2022 elections also showed a continued lower turnout among these groups, and no evidence that the law — as currently implemented — has done anything to close California’s deep and persistent voter participation disparities.
Elections officials and voter engagement organizations in counties that adopted the law also told us that a lack of funding was a major barrier to achieving more effective voter outreach and education, among other issues.
In light of these mixed results on Voters Choice Act implementation and its impact, we clearly need to do more to shore up its effectiveness. With the 2024 election season already underway, improvements to the act take on a whole new sense of urgency.
First, we need to reignite state oversight and leadership of Voters Choice Act implementation. The state’s monitoring and engagement in implementation in counties has dropped off significantly since 2020, resulting in less support for community groups and election officials involved in implementation on the ground.
We believe that the California Secretary of State should reinstate the official Voters Choice Act statewide task force with membership representing the broad categories required in the law. This would bring renewed attention and much needed support to the law, especially for future counties implementing the voting model. There are early signs the secretary is moving in this direction, which we applaud. The secretary of state should also work with and convene a wide array of data experts, advocates and community organizations to identify, research and develop solutions to the ongoing voter file race and ethnicity data challenges, especially for Black voters and Asian-American subgroups. Each of these ideas could help potentially support needed outreach efforts to California’s most marginalized communities ahead of the 2024 elections.
There also needs to be more voter education and outreach funding in Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 2024 budget directed toward disenfranchised voting groups. While we recognize this is a challenging budget year, additional state funding that enables trusted messengers to reach under-participating communities may finally close voter participation gaps in a way that legal changes and policy reform have not.
While the Voters Choice Act was never intended to be a panacea for all voting challenges facing California, one thing is very clear: The law is a reform worth revisiting and reinvesting in, and still holds promise for expanding electoral participation across the state and across many voting groups.

The 23-year-old driver of a white Chrysler 300 slammed into a red fuel truck parked near Bryant and Viele Aves. in Hunts Point about 3:20 a.m., cops said.
“They were having a takeover car meet where they take over the block and lock the block up and do doughnuts and stuff,” said an employee of the fuel company that owns the struck truck, who gave his name only as Chad, 28. “The guy was going about 100 mph, it was very fast. Hit a bump. The car skid right into the truck.”
“He hit a bump, lost control of the car and skid into that oil truck,” said Chad, who saw video of the crash. “It’s a tragic accident.”
Medics rushed 21-year-old front-seat passenger Gilvante “Gio” Roberson and 15-year-old back-seat passenger Sabrina Villagomez to Lincoln Hospital, but neither could be saved, cops said.
A 17-year-old girl was in critical condition at St. Barnabas Hospital, and the 23-year-old driver was taken to Harlem Hospital in stable condition, according to police.
Sabrina lived in Nanuet, Rockland County, with her mother, according to her distraught father.
“Today in the morning my wife called [and] I was sleeping,” said the dad, Jorge Villagomez. “I said, ‘What happened, what happened?’ She said, ‘Your daughter is dying.’ ”
The man recalled watching his usually happy teenager grow unhappy in recent months as she started hanging out with a new crowd.
“Three weeks ago, I take my daughter on vacation with me to Florida,” Villagomez said. “I saw in the face she is not happy. She is no good. I ask her many times, ‘What’s wrong?’ She said, ‘Dad, I’m OK.’ ”
Sabrina and the 17-year-old victim in critical condition became friends a few years ago, but the father said he did not know Roberson or the driver.
“She was fine last week,” the elder Villagomez said. “My little girl, she is no more. It’s very hard.”
Friends showed up at the crash scene to create a memorial for the front-seat victim, who lived in East New York, Brooklyn.
“There was 100 people out,” Chad said of the car meetup. “There were at least 70 cars.”
“The fire department came with the Jaws of Life,” he added. “They chopped the car to get the people out.”
Roberson spent the hours before the crash documenting the car meet and posting clips of the dangerous stunts on his Instagram page, which is flooded with drivers doing doughnuts and other tricks.
In one of the posts, the cars took over a Queens street and burned rubber as a crowd of people cheered the drivers on from the side of the road.
The last post made to the Instagram account was right around the time of the crash.
“For those who followed him that knew who he was, if it wasn’t about music, he was posting about cars,” said Roberson’s friend, who identified himself only as Beamo. “That’s what he was about.”
About 100 people gathered to mourn the victims at the crash site Sunday afternoon.
“Everybody that was in the vehicle were more than friends,” said Beamo. “[They] were loved ones. They cared about each other.”
A family friend said Roberson’s family is still wrapping their heads around the horrific crash.
“They’re trying to figure out what was going on,” said the friend, who asked not to be named. “The family is a little struck.
“I thought I was dreaming,” she added of the crash. “I didn’t think it was real.”
Cops were still investigating the incident to determine if the driver will face charges."

PZV0C2ZOSB_JANUBPUQBXNT9QF,Chicago's 'rat hole' was mysteriously filled and then restored. Now it's a place of holy rat-rimony.,"Lloyd Lee,Associated Press","January 21, 2024 at 3:20 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/chicagos-rat-hole-mysteriously-filled-062029896.html,"A rat-shaped hole in a Chicago neighborhood recently went viral and instantly won some fans.
The hole was reportedly filled on Friday but was quickly restored.
People have left behind tributes while others got engaged and married at the hole.
The viral Chicago ""rat hole"" was quickly restored after it was mysteriously filled in, proving how the imprint has instantly become a beloved attraction — and a site for love?
In a city infamous for its gangster past, some culprit filled in a Northside Chicago neighborhood landmark affectionately called by residents the ""rat hole.""
The indentation in the pavement on West Roscoe Street resembles the outline of a rat — claws, tail, and all. It was reported Friday on social media that the ""rat hole"" had been filled with a substance resembling white plaster.
Transportation and Streets and Sanitation officials told the Chicago Tribune that the city was not behind the fill-in — which one day may find itself part of Windy City tongue-in-cheek lore like Al Capone's vault and a coil of bronze faux feces on a fountain intended to remind people to pick up their dog poop.
Neighbors gathered Friday afternoon using a brush and water to scrub the shallow hole in the sidewalk clean, restoring it to its ""ratfull"" place among the city's iconic — if not strange — attractions.
Tributes — including plastic flowers, a prayer candle, small toys, a pack of cigarettes, and coins — adorn what may have been the final resting place of ""Lil Stucky"" or ""Chimley,"" names given by some in the neighborhood to the creature that once lay there spreadeagled.
""Overall, people just appreciate that our wonderful block is getting attention — even if it's to look at a rat hole,"" Jeff VanDam told the Chicago Sun-Times for a story Friday. ""It's a small, quirky feature of a neighborhood where we get used to it, we care about it, and we want to protect it.""
The hole also appears to have become a site to mark relationship milestones.
One post on X from Saturday appeared to show a proposal, while another video showed a ""gay wedding"" in front of the hole, an X user said.
Chicago resident Winslow Dumaine learned about the ""rat hole"" from a friend and posted a photo earlier this month of it on X, formerly known as Twitter. The photo drew more than 5 million views, he said.
People living nearby said the imprint had been there for nearly two decades and was made by a squirrel, according to Dumaine.
""I think at the end of the day, the rat hole is a silly thing, but the thing that made it so viral was the fact that thousands and thousands of people were in on a big, sweet, heartfelt joke,"" Dumaine told the Tribune.
""Chicago prides itself on all of the things that make Chicago difficult, and no matter how much Chicago hates rats, they love rats,"" he added. ""It's a part of our culture.""

PZY2L9ANJM_RSDEVYRZEQJQGUJ,Nikki Haley tries to draw New Hampshire's independents without alienating voters who backed Trump,The Associated Press,"January 22, 2024 at 6:10 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nikki-haley-tries-draw-hampshires-211042355.html,"Richard Anderson drove through a snowstorm last week to see his preferred candidate in New Hampshire’s Republican primary. But he’s not sure how far he’ll go to support her if she wins the nomination.
Anderson, a 73-year-old independent voter from Jackson, liked what he heard from Nikki Haley at the Mount Washington Hotel. But he disagrees with the former U.N. ambassador’s plan to pardon former President Donald Trump if he is convicted of any of the crimes he’s been charged with.
“That bothers me,” he said. “I’ll still vote for her in the primary, but I’ll wait to see if she’s still saying that in the general election.”
Haley’s best shot at shaking Trump’s grip on the Republican nomination rests with her ability to attract New Hampshire’s independent voters — including some who might not stick with her in November — without alienating too many conservatives. Other Republicans have hit the right balance here, notably John McCain in two GOP primary victories. But those wins came long before Trump’s rise in politics and the Republicans’ rightward shifts both in the state and nationally.
“It’s a very difficult needle to thread,” said Nathan Shrader, an associate professor of politics at New England College, “because if she makes too much of an overt play for the independent voters, that could be a turnoff for some of the Republicans who we know in the Trump era are more conservative than they might have been a generation ago.”
Democrats can’t vote in the GOP primary, but voters unaffiliated with a party — who make up nearly 40% of registered voters in New Hampshire — can. That makes them a key target, though they aren’t a monolith.
A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released Sunday found that a majority of registered Republicans likely to vote in the primary — 67% — said they planned to vote for Trump. But a majority of those registered as undeclared — 58% — said they support Haley.
The poll, taken Tuesday through Friday, also found more registered Republicans in the state view Haley unfavorably (47%) than favorably (31%). Trump, meanwhile is viewed favorably by 76% of registered Republicans and unfavorably by just 16%.
Haley was viewed favorably by 42% of people who have registered themselves as undeclared, while 32% viewed her unfavorably. Just 34% of the same group, by contrast, views Trump favorably, compared with 59% unfavorably.
The poll was published before Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race Sunday afternoon.
Some Haley supporters interviewed at her events are left-leaning voters who have little ideological overlap with Haley but are intent on stopping Trump. Others lean Republican and agree with her policies.
Corinne Pullen is a blend of both. Pullen, a retired 68-year-old nurse from Canterbury, said she’s impressed with Haley’s “strict and strong” foreign policies and her plans to decrease federal spending. She considers Trump a “narcissistic braggadocio buffoon.”
“When I compare these two candidates, it is a no-brainer who I would feel comfortable and safe having in the White House,” she said.
Trump has turned that crossover appeal into an attack line, suggesting that Haley is being propped up by “radical left Democrats.” The former president’s campaign argues Haley will struggle with conservatives in closed primaries like that of her home-state South Carolina, where the Feb. 24 primary is the next big matchup for her and Trump.
“Her entire focus at this point in time ... has been about turning out Democrats and behavioral Democrats to hijack the Republican primary in New Hampshire,” Trump senior advisor Chris LaCivita told reporters this month.
As if to underscore that point, Trump on Saturday arranged for South Carolina’s current governor, lieutenant governor, and several other elected leaders to come to New Hampshire to campaign with him. The day before, he won a rousing endorsement from South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, whom Haley appointed to the Senate when she was governor.
Haley, however, dismissed that move.
“I won South Carolina twice as governor,” she said recently. “I think I know what favorable territory is in South Carolina. We are going to South Carolina. We’re going to be strong in South Carolina.” She added: “The road is never going to stop here in New Hampshire, that’s always been the plan.”
Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, is skeptical that Haley can pull together a strong and diverse enough coalition to top Trump in Tuesday’s primary. Even if she did, “how do you duplicate that elsewhere?” he asked. “The answer is, you don’t. I don’t think you can pull off that magic trick in state after state.”
Unlike McCain, who openly appealed to “Republicans, independents, Democrats, Libertarians, vegetarians, all of them,” Haley doesn’t mention independents in her stump speech. But the super PAC backing her is filling its mailboxes with fliers citing her endorsement from New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Trump critic, and her plans on the economy and debt reduction.
Haley described herself to reporters Thursday as “a conservative that knows how to talk to moderates and independents and not make them feel bad, but make them feel included.”
At the same time, she pushed back against criticism from Trump and DeSantis that she isn’t conservative enough.
“Show me where I’m moderate, because I’m not,” she said.
That didn’t stop Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a moderate Republican who voted for Biden in 2020, from endorsing her on Saturday and urging New Hampshire voters to “showcase their deep-rooted independent streak.” And it doesn’t bother independent voter Kristen Mansharamani, who described herself as “further left” than Haley on abortion, education and other issues but said she believes Haley would be a unifying leader.
“I told my 12-year-old son that I am looking for the person who I think is going to get rid of some of the standstill and the polarization in politics and I think she can do that better than anyone else out there right now,” said Mansharamani, 48, of Lincoln.
In Iowa, Haley was the top candidate for the most anti-Trump Republicans, including those who said the former president did something illegal in one of the pending criminal cases against him, according to data from AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of likely Iowa voters before they entered the caucuses.. Two-thirds of Haley’s caucusgoers said they would not ultimately vote for Trump in the general election.
In New Hampshire, some anti-Trump independents supporting Haley say they aren’t sure whether they’d back her in a general election either.
Amy Watson, a 59-year-old oral surgeon from Hollis, praised Haley’s tenure as U.N. ambassador and governor but said Haley’s views on environmental issues may be a dealbreaker in November.
“As things transpire, I think I’m going to consider what she has to say,” she said. “I’m very much concerned about global warming, so that’s one area where she may lose me.”

Officers with the Clovis Police Department responded just after midnight to the 2600 block of Sierra Madre Avenue for a possible shooting, spokesman Ty Wood said.
A witness told police that the boy was on the ground and then jumped into a dark-colored SUV, with the driver taking off with another person inside.
An officer saw a vehicle that matched the description and pulled the driver over at Shaw and Clovis avenues in the parking lot by a Baskin-Robbins, Wood said.
The officer saw three people inside, with one person intoxicated and a juvenile with a gunshot wound.
The boy was shot in the upper body but had non-life threatening injuries, Wood said.
A second person — an 18-year-old — was taken to the hospital for intoxication.
Officers are investigating the shooting and said a gun was found in the back seat. A shell casing was found along Sierra Madre Avenue.
The 18-year-old was charged with assault with a deadly weapon using a firearm, public intoxication and carrying a concealed weapon.
Wood said that it appears a disturbance took place between the pair, who appear to know each other.
Detectives were canvassing for surveillance video in the neighborhood.
The driver was released.

Marquella Marshall, 41, and Marsha Delacruz, 47, were sentenced in federal court Tuesday for their role in the illegal operation, announced U.S. attorney Tara McGrath’s office.
Marshall was given a 180-month prison stay, while Delacruz will spend 48 months behind bars, U.S. District Judge Larry Alan Burns decided.
‘El Chapo’-linked narcotrafficker sentenced for moving millions of dollars worth of cocaine
According to court records, Marshall, a Texas resident who previously lived in San Diego, is an Eastside San Diego street gang member and a “facilitator” and “secretary” for the Mexican Mafia.+
As explained by the attorney’s office, Marshall was tasked by high-ranking Mexican Mafia members to communicate on their behalf, collect and launder money, handle drug transactions, and direct street operations on the gang’s behalf.
During Tuesday’s hearing, Judge Burns described Marshall as “a conduit” for the MexicanMafia and further described the distribution conspiracy as “an assault on the integrity of the prison system.”
“Drug smuggling and use in prisons result in overdose, violence, and power struggles,” said U.S. attorney McGrath. “These significant sentences are a strike against the prison drug culture which puts guards and staff at risk and exists in large part because of dangerous gangs like the Mexican Mafia.”
Delacruz, who’s from Lemon Grove, was also an Eastside San Diego street gang member, court documents show. Delacruz was reported to have worked at the direction of Marshall, the attorney’s office explained.
As part of the conspiracy, Marshall, Delacruz and others mailed methamphetamine to variouslocations, including jails and prisons in Southern California. According to court documents, Marshall and Delacruz disguised some of the narcotics-laden packages as legal mail to avoid detection by law enforcement.
Several Mexican Mafia associates, including the pair sentenced Tuesday, were apprehended after an investigation by the FBI Violent Crimes Task Force/ Gang Group.

In an Instagram post this week, the Mission Beach Town Council is pleading with residents to petition City Representatives to act to repair the Mission Beach seawall.
Local piers impacted by crashing waves
In a photo posted to their social media account, it shows part of the seawall crumbling, which they say keeps getting worse after storms and has been getting hit hard from the recent king tides.
According to the council, the entire seawall is cracking and crumbling, except the new section of the wall between Ventura Pl and San Gabriel Place.
Demolition notice posted at Ocean Beach Pier
The council is now asking local residents to send photos of the damaged seawall to Seamus Kennedy with City Council Member Dr. Campbell’s office at skennedy@sandiego.gov, noting that since June 2023 only one 8-foot section of the wall has been repaired.
Cracks in the seawall let in moisture, which allows the seawall to crumble even more. The Mission Beach Town Council says the longer the repairs are put off, the more expensive fixing the seawall will be.
Just recently a demolition notice was posted at the nearby Ocean Beach Pier which keeps damaged by large waves and storms.
The large waves are back this weekend as San Diego County coastal areas are under a high surf advisory and coastal flood advisory. You can expect waves 4 to 7 feet high, with high tides reaching nearly 6 feet through Sunday evening. There is also a high rip current warning.

Some Haley supporters interviewed at her events are left-leaning voters who have little ideological overlap with Haley but are intent on stopping Trump. Others lean Republican and agree with her policies.
Corinne Pullen is a blend of both. Pullen, a retired 68-year-old nurse from Canterbury, said she’s impressed with Haley’s “strict and strong” foreign policies and her plans to decrease federal spending. She considers Trump a “narcissistic braggadocio buffoon.”
“When I compare these two candidates, it is a no-brainer who I would feel comfortable and safe having in the White House,” she said.
Trump has turned that crossover appeal into an attack line, suggesting that Haley is being propped up by “radical left Democrats.” The former president’s campaign argues Haley will struggle with conservatives in closed primaries like that of her home-state South Carolina, where the Feb. 24 primary is the next big matchup for her and Trump.
“Her entire focus at this point in time ... has been about turning out Democrats and behavioral Democrats to hijack the Republican primary in New Hampshire,” Trump senior advisor Chris LaCivita told reporters this month.
As if to underscore that point, Trump on Saturday arranged for South Carolina’s current governor, lieutenant governor, and several other elected leaders to come to New Hampshire to campaign with him. The day before, he won a rousing endorsement from South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, whom Haley appointed to the Senate when she was governor.
Haley, however, dismissed that move.
“I won South Carolina twice as governor,"" she said recently. “I think I know what favorable territory is in South Carolina. We are going to South Carolina. We’re going to be strong in South Carolina.” She added: “The road is never going to stop here in New Hampshire, that’s always been the plan.”
Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, is skeptical that Haley can pull together a strong and diverse enough coalition to top Trump in Tuesday's primary. Even if she did, “how do you duplicate that elsewhere?” he asked. “The answer is, you don’t. I don’t think you can pull off that magic trick in state after state.”
Unlike McCain, who openly appealed to “Republicans, independents, Democrats, Libertarians, vegetarians, all of them,” Haley doesn’t mention independents in her stump speech. But the super PAC backing her is filling its mailboxes with fliers citing her endorsement from New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Trump critic, and her plans on the economy and debt reduction.
Haley described herself to reporters Thursday as “a conservative that knows how to talk to moderates and independents and not make them feel bad, but make them feel included.”
At the same time, she pushed back against criticism from Trump and DeSantis that she isn’t conservative enough.
“Show me where I’m moderate, because I’m not,” she said.
That didn’t stop Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a moderate Republican who voted for Biden in 2020, from endorsing her on Saturday and urging New Hampshire voters to “showcase their deep-rooted independent streak.” And it doesn’t bother independent voter Kristen Mansharamani, who described herself as “further left” than Haley on abortion, education and other issues but said she believes Haley would be a unifying leader.
“I told my 12-year-old son that I am looking for the person who I think is going to get rid of some of the standstill and the polarization in politics and I think she can do that better than anyone else out there right now,” said Mansharamani, 48, of Lincoln.
In Iowa, Haley was the top candidate for the most anti-Trump Republicans, including those who said the former president did something illegal in one of the pending criminal cases against him, according to data from AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of likely Iowa voters before they entered the caucuses.. Two-thirds of Haley’s caucusgoers said they would not ultimately vote for Trump in the general election.
In New Hampshire, some anti-Trump independents supporting Haley say they aren’t sure whether they’d back her in a general election either.
Amy Watson, a 59-year-old oral surgeon from Hollis, praised Haley’s tenure as U.N. ambassador and governor but said Haley’s views on environmental issues may be a dealbreaker in November.
“As things transpire, I think I’m going to consider what she has to say,” she said. “I’m very much concerned about global warming, so that’s one area where she may lose me.”

A militant decapitated him and tried to sell his head for $10,000, his father has claimed.
He said his head was found by Israeli forces in an ice cream store's freezer.
The head of an IDF soldier who was killed during Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel was found in an ice cream store's freezer, his father said in an interview on Israel's Channel 14 news station.
Sergeant Adir Tahar, 19, was killed as Hamas militants threw grenades during their assault on Israeli territory, The Times of Israel reported.
He was then beheaded, and his head was taken into the Gaza Strip, his father, David, told Channel 14, per the report.
During an interrogation, a Hamas militant also claimed that he had attempted to sell the head for $10,000, he added. ""That is just insane barbarism.""
In an email to Business Insider, the IDF said it had ""no information that can confirm the report about the selling of the head."" It did not refer to the other aspects of the story.
However, the Israeli Foreign Ministry shared the story in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
According to the post, David Tahar told Channel 14 that he spent two months searching for his son's severed head before it was eventually discovered in a freezer in Gaza.
Tahar's head was found by elite Israeli troops supported by tanks in an ice cream store, per The Times of Israel.
""I did everything I could. It wasn't easy. In the end, I got a body without a head. I insisted very much with the army to see the body. They tried to explain to me that I should not see it,"" David said.
""Half an hour before I buried my child, his body arrived at Mount Herzl, I opened the coffin when I was alone,"" he added. ""He was unrecognizable. I identified him by dog tags and a DNA test and things he had in his pants.""
In the days following the Hamas attacks, unverified reports emerged of other instances of beheadings carried out by the group, including claims that the group had decapitated babies.
The IDF received widespread criticism, alleging it had spread the rumor without evidence.
Responding to the backlash, a spokesperson for the force, Major Nir Dinar, said the IDF would not investigate its claims as it was ""disrespectful for the dead"" to do so.
No Israeli officials have confirmed the story.
""We cannot confirm any numbers. What happened in Kibbutz Kfar Aza is a massacre in which women, children and toddlers, and elderly were brutally butchered in an ISIS way of action,"" the IDF said in a statement to Sky News at the time.
President Joe Biden even mentioned the alleged findings in a speech.
""I never really thought that I would see and have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children,"" Biden said.
But the White House later said that the president had not independently verified the claims.
Around 1,200 people were killed in Israel during Hamas' October 7 attacks.
Reports have since emerged of the brutal tactics used by the Palestinian militant group on the day, including horrific stories of widespread sexual violence and mutilation.
Israel responded to the attacks with weeks of deadly airstrikes and a ground invasion of Gaza, leading to the deaths of more than 25,000 Palestinians so far.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the proposal of a Palestinian state once the conflict concludes, saying that ""the war is continuing and it will continue until the end, until we achieve all of its goals.""

Q5R1JL1HVS_03EHKAUE9A02M2U,Some Investors May Be Worried About Colgate-Palmolive's (NYSE:CL) Returns On Capital,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 11:00 PM·2 min read",20230121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-may-worried-colgate-palmolives-140009602.html,"Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Colgate-Palmolive is:
Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
0.31 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$16b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).
So, Colgate-Palmolive has an ROCE of 31%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Household Products industry average of 16%.
Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive
In the above chart we have measured Colgate-Palmolive's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Colgate-Palmolive here  for free.
In terms of Colgate-Palmolive's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. While it's comforting that the ROCE is high, five years ago it was 44%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.
To conclude, we've found that Colgate-Palmolive is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 47% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.
Like most companies, Colgate-Palmolive does come with some risks, and we've found 3 warning signs  that you should be aware of.

""The right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all,"" Guterres said on Saturday in Kampala at a meeting of non-aligned states - nations that remained neutral during the Cold War.
""The refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people, are unacceptable.""
Guterres went on to say that the denial of a two-state solution was prolonging a conflict that had become a global threat to peace and security, contributing to polarization and strengthening extremism everywhere.
He also renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire in the battle between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Netanyahu continues to reject the notion of an independent Palestinian state once the Gaza conflict is over.
""I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over the entire area west of Jordan - and this is contrary to a Palestinian state,"" he said on Saturday, reiterating his stance that any solution in the foreseeable future must include Israel's military control over the entire West Bank.
The United States, an important Israel ally, has also been pushing for a two-state solution."

Putin also reportedly thanked the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for his invitation to visit the country and his continued support of Russian military efforts in Ukraine.
According to Reuters, KCNA's Korean-language report suggested Putin planned to visit soon, but its later English report said he was ""willing"" to do so at an early date. An exact date for the visit has not been established.
Moscow and Pyongyang have significantly increased their military ties since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia's newfound pariah status that followed the outbreak of full-scale war has forced the country to seek new allies, and as a major producer of military hardware and a similarly isolated country, North Korea has allegedly used the partnership to further its own military goals.
The nature of the relationship is increasingly becoming a two-way street, said U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in which Russia provides North Korea with advanced military technology and long-range attack capacity, potentially including ballistic missiles and nuclear capabilities in exchange for the shells and missiles.
In the short term, this cooperation has already been felt in Ukraine, where Russia has allegedly used North Korean-supplied ballistic missiles in attacks on the country.

QC9F7EBS2T_1BL7BP5MN4F4PKF,"DeSantis was supposed to save the GOP from Trump, not endorse him | Opinion",the Miami Herald Editorial Board,"January 22, 2024 at 7:13 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-supposed-save-gop-trump-221340047.html,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis didn’t save the Republican Party after all, or America for that matter.
Two days before the New Hampshire primary election, DeSantis suspended his campaign for president on Sunday.
As he exited, he endorsed former President Donald J. Trump. Of course, he had no choice. The Florida governor tried to sell voters the idea that he’s just like Trump, but more electable, more reasonable — but also more conservative. That didn’t work because, in the end, DeSantis’ brand wouldn’t exist without MAGA.
DeSantis’ departure from the Republican primary, which now leaves only Nikki Haley as a serious contender against Trump, marks the end of a political nosedive for our governor, once viewed as the strongest candidate who could end the Republican Party’s addiction to Trump.
He failed.
His trademark culture wars, anti-COVID vaccine stance and opposition to government-mandated school closures weren’t enough to persuade voters in other parts of the country to back him. With his presidential pitch gone, and Trump’s reemergence after his 91 criminal charges, DeSantis became a candidate without a cause.
It was clear he couldn’t survive much longer but DeSantis had vowed to stay in the race until Super Tuesday. His deflating 30-point loss to Trump in the Iowa caucuses last Monday had seemingly closed his path to the White House. And we all wondered: What was the point in staying in a losing race?
In the video his campaign released announcing his decision he fell in line with the party of Trump: “Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear. I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear.”
It’s not just that he was steamrolled by Donald Trump. DeSantis never appeared to want to save the GOP. He was more interested in making it a more ravenous, angrier and intolerant party. That worked for Trump, but didn’t work for the governor with all the charisma of burned toast.
So now DeSantis’ presidential campaign has ended. But the damage of the laws he has pushed through in Florida, as he landed more appearances on Fox News, will live on. Without his political ambitions, there likely wouldn’t be “Don’t say gay,” woke wars and the waste of state resources to fight meaningless battles against drag queen bars. These were efforts to appeal to Trump’s base but his supporters refused to leave the former president, especially after he was indicted.
DeSantis’ hard-right stances on issues like abortion and the Ukraine war — which he once called a “territorial dispute” before walking that comment back — alienated moderate voters. In the end, DeSantis became a candidate without a lane. What an outcome for a Florida governor who established himself as the dominant figure in state politics and who had the Legislature under his thumb. In the past two years, lawmakers have given DeSantis most of his priorities, often with little vetting, resulting in laws that are ambiguous and confusing, perhaps by design.
With his White House aspirations over — at least for now, because he could try again in 2028 — DeSantis returns to the Sunshine State to finish the final three years of his second term. In hindsight, it is now clear the young governor, who’s only 45, was a man in a hurry — too much of a hurry.
Glorified by the media as Trump’s heir apparent and buoyed by his legislative successes, DeSantis soon proved he wasn’t ready for prime time. He refused to engage with mainstream media, a strategy that worked for him as governor, until he felt forced to give more attention to outlets like CNN and network news. But that was too late.
There was also a barrage of negative news coverage of his imploding campaign, rumors about whether he wore hidden height boosters in his cowboy boots and, more than anything, his struggle to connect with voters.
DeSantis could have pitched a kinder form of conservatism or at least a more reasonable version. Instead, he banked on exploiting divisions in our country. As he bows out, DeSantis leaves the Republican Party exactly as he found it, under Trump’s dominance.

The governor stated that no casualties have been reported but other Russian media sources suggested that 150 people were evacuated. A high-alert regime was introduced in the Kingiseppsky district. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.
Novatek is Russia's largest producer of liquified natural gas. The U.S. introduced sanctions against one of Novatek's major production entities, the Arctic LNG-2 (liquified natural gas) project, for which it has a 60% share.
Reuters reported last month that Novatek itself issued force majeure declarations to multiple clients after the U.S. imposed sanctions against Russian LNG in November 2023.
Businesses may declare force majeure if they cannot supply promised goods or services due to circumstances beyond their control.
Earlier this month, a huge fire broke out at a warehouse in St. Petersburg belonging to one of Russia's biggest online stores, Wildberries, affecting at least 70,000 square meters of the property.

Trentino province, in northern Italy, said it would cull eight bears a year following a spate of attacks on people.
“We want to put the brakes on the growth of the bear population, to guarantee the safety of people,” said Roberto Failoni, the member of Trentino’s government responsible for its forests.
However, Michela Brambilla, chair of the Italian inter-parliamentary group for the rights of animals, labelled the move a “terrorist” attack on bears that can be avoided by taking better care of the environment.
Ms Brambilla told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera that the province should do more to educate locals and tourists on how to behave safely on the mountain.
“It would have been enough, for instance, to place signs advising tourists [on the danger of bears] and placing rubbish bins so that the bears don’t eat trash left behind in the woods. Instead, they only think of culling plans,” she said.
The row has ignited a long-running debate on how to manage local bear populations while keeping people safe in the mountainous region.
In July, judges at the Council of State in Rome ruled that a culling order for two bears in northern Italy be suspended.
One of the bears, called JJ4, killed jogger Andrea Papi while he was running in the Brenta Dolomites in the Alps. The other bear, known as MJ5, had attacked a hiker in the same area weeks earlier.
The judges ruled that brown bears were protected by a 1979 Bern Convention on wildlife and that “culling represents a last resort” to control their population.
Italy’s section of the World Wide Fund for Nature said: “Very dangerous bears are extremely rare cases and they are unpredictable. There needs to be an attentive assessment of each case so it’s impossible to determine annual culling quotas as the new plan foresees.”"

The bodies of an unidentified 36-year-old woman, 45-year-old man, named locally as Bartlomiej Kuczynski, and his two daughters were found in a house in Costessey.
Post-mortem examinations on the adults were carried out on Sunday and a pathologist will examine the bodies of the two girls on Wednesday.
Detective Chief Inspector Chris Burgess, who is leading the investigation, said: “Following this latest development we remain satisfied no one else was involved in this incident.
“This latest information will only add to the distress and shock felt by members of the local community and it’s why, from the outset, we’ve been determined to carry out detailed and methodical inquiries to make sure we fully understand how this incident has happened.
“I would like to thank the community for their support and for the many people who have called offering information. We continue to work through this and will get back to everyone who has been in touch. The police cordon remains in place at the scene and we will continue to have a presence in the area tomorrow.”
The force referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct after failing to respond to a 999 call an hour before four family members were found dead.
Norfolk Police confirmed they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the ‘‘tragic incident’’.
The alarm was raised on Friday morning after a member of the public raised concerns for the welfare of people inside.
It has since emerged that a man phoned 999 an hour before the alarm was raised – but “police resources were not deployed” in response to that first call.

QFUTJEV4AT_OS2M9BE9M8IK9OM,Trump mocks Nikki Haley's first name. It's his latest example of attacking rivals based on race,Bill Barrow,"Updated January 21, 2024 at 9:40 AM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-mocks-nikki-haleys-first-230429383.html,"ATLANTA (AP) — Donald Trump used his social media platform Friday to mock Nikki Haley 's birth name, the latest example of the former president keying on race and ethnicity to attack people of color, especially his political rivals.
In a post on his Truth Social account, Trump repeatedly referred to Haley, the daughter of immigrants from India, as “Nimbra.” Haley, the former South Carolina governor, was born in Bamberg, South Carolina, as Nimarata Nikki Randhawa. She has always gone by her middle name, “Nikki.” She took the surname “Haley” upon her marriage in 1996.
Trump, himself the son, grandson and twice the husband of immigrants, called Haley “Nimbra” three times in the post and said she “doesn't have what it takes.”
The attack comes four days before the New Hampshire primary, in which Haley is trying to establish herself as the only viable Trump alternative in the Republicans' 2024 nominating contest.
Trump's post was an escalation of recent attacks in which he referenced Haley's given first name — though he's misspelled it “Nimrada” — and falsely asserted she is ineligible for the presidency because her parents were not U.S. citizens when she was born in 1972.
More: Nikki Haley says America was never racist. Her memoir tells a trickier story
The attacks echo Trump's “birther” rhetoric against President Barack Obama. Trump spent years pushing the conspiracy theory that the nation's first Black president was born in Kenya and not a “natural born” U.S. citizen as required by the Constitution. That effort was part of Trump's rise among Republicans' most culturally conservative base ahead of his 2016 election that surprised much of the U.S. political establishment.
Haley has dismissed Trump's latest attacks as proof that she threatens his bid for a third consecutive nomination.
“I’ll let people decide what he means by his attacks,” Haley told reporters in New Hampshire on Friday when asked about Trump’s false assertions that her heritage disqualifies her from the Oval Office. “What we know is, look, he’s clearly insecure if he goes and does these temper tantrums, if he’s spending millions of dollars on TV. He’s insecure, he knows that something’s wrong.”
Trump’s campaign did not reply to an inquiry about his comments.
Since Monday's Iowa caucuses — which Trump won by 30 points over Ron DeSantis, who placed second — Haley has aimed to portray the rest of the GOP primary battle as a two-way race between Trump and herself despite her narrow third-place finish. Haley's campaign is aiming for a stronger showing in New Hampshire, hoping for a springboard into her home state South Carolina, which holds the South's first presidential primary next month.
For his part, Trump bounces between declarations that the nominating fight is already effectively over and blasting Haley as if the two are indeed locked in a tight contest. Trump still criticizes his other remaining rival, DeSantis, but his preferred pejoratives for the Florida governor, “Ron DeSanctimonious” or “Ron DeSanctus,” have nothing to do with race or ethnicity. DeSantis is white.
Trump’s focus on Haley's name comes as far-right online forums have for months been littered with mentions of her given name alongside racist commentary and false “birther” claims. Haley's name and family background also have become talking points on the left. Some widely circulating social media posts have called her a hypocrite for saying America was “never a racist country” when she likely experienced racism herself.
Pastor Darrell Scott, a Black man who has led a diversity coalition for Trump’s previous campaigns, defended the former president's latest attacks as “slings and arrows” that come in election season.
“You have to dissect politics as politics. It’s not personal,” said Scott. “He’s not intending to demean her or degrade her in any way. He’s just doing that to garner votes.”
Scott said Trump “has a compassionate side that most people don't see” and defended his aggressive approach as a “goose-and-gander situation” for a public figure constantly “under attack for everything.”
Tara Setmayer, senior adviser to the Lincoln Project group that opposes Trump from within the conservative movement, agreed that Trump’s rhetoric works in a Republican primary. But she said that’s a damning reality for the party and does not excuse his behavior.
“These are the rantings of an incredibly, almost pathetically insecure man who has demonstrated over his entire career his racism and bigotry,” said Setmayer, who is multiracial and calls herself a former Republican and now a conservative independent. “Why would anyone expect it to be any different now, when an entire political party has enabled this level of morally questionable behavior?”
Amid the fallout Friday, Trump won the endorsement of South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate’s only Black Republican and formerly a presidential candidate himself. Haley appointed Scott to the Senate in 2012, during her first term as governor.
Trump has a long history of using race, ethnicity and immigrant heritage as a cudgel.
For years, he has referred to Obama as “Barack Hussein Obama,” putting an obvious emphasis on the 44th president's middle name. Obama was the son of a white American mother and a Black father from Kenya. He was born in Hawaii, though Trump spent years asserting Obama had manufactured the story and a birth certificate to support it. Trump eventually admitted his claims were false but then, during the 2016 general election, said he did so only to “get on with the campaign.”
When David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, encouraged Republican primary voters to back Trump in 2016, Trump responded in a CNN interview that he knew “nothing about David Duke, I know nothing about white supremacists.”
Trump is also among many Republicans who deliberately mispronounce Vice President Kamala Harris's name. Rather than the correct “KA'-ma-la,” Trump sometimes says, “Ka-MAH-la.” Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, is the first woman to become vice president and the third non-white person as either president or vice president, following Obama and Charles Curtis, Herbert Hoover's vice president who had Native American ancestry.
Leading up to Trump’s 2017 inauguration, civil rights icon John Lewis, then a Black congressman from Georgia, said he would not attend Trump’s inauguration because he considered him an illegitimate president. Trump reacted by blasting Lewis’s Atlanta-based district as being in “horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested).” The district includes downtown Atlanta, Coca-Cola’s world headquarters, the Georgia Institute of Technology and principal sites of the 1996 Olympic Games, among other attributes.
During his presidency, Trump questioned during a meeting with lawmakers why the U.S. would accept immigrants from Haiti and “shithole countries” across Africa instead of countries like Norway. He did not explicitly mention race but the White House followed disclosure of his comments with a statement explaining that Trump supported granting access to the U.S. for “those who can contribute to our society.”
He also has said that four congresswomen of color should go back to the “broken and crime infested” countries they came from, ignoring the fact that all of the women are American citizens and three were born in the U.S.
Trump's mother was born Mary Anne MacLeod in Scotland and came to the United States between the two world wars. His paternal grandfather, Frederick Trump, was a Bavarian-born immigrant from Germany in the 1880s. Trump's first wife, Ivana Zelníčková before their marriage, was born in what is now the Czech Republic. His third wife, former first lady Melania Trump, was born Melanija Knavs in what is now Slovenia. That means four of Trump's five children also are children of immigrants.
Haley frames her family's story as proof that the U.S. “is not a racist country.” She sometimes highlights her role in taking down the Confederate battle flag from South Carolina statehouse grounds after a racist massacre in her state — though she had sidestepped requests to remove the banner earlier in her term. And Haley has for years navigated Trump's penchant for racist rhetoric.
“I will not stop until we fight a man that chooses not to disavow the KKK,” Haley said during the 2016 primary campaign after she had endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio over Trump. “That is not a part of our party; that is not who we want as president.”

WASHINGTON PARISH, La. (WGNO) — A New Hampshire man accused of committing sex crimes involving juveniles was booked into the Washington Parish Jail on Friday, Jan. 19.
The Washington Parish Sheriff’s Office reported that detectives began an investigation in November 2022 into alleged sexual battery and indecent behavior with a juvenile involving 27-year-old Benjamin Hart.
Former New Orleans priest Lawrence Hecker absent from court, hospitalized
During the investigation, police discovered Hart had allegedly been targeting a juvenile by playing video games and contacting them on Xbox Live.
Washington Parish deputies said Hart “had an existing case involving multiple juveniles in Carroll County, New Hampshire” in addition to pending charges in Washington Parish.
In April 2023, Hart was arrested in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
According to the WPSO, “WPSO, in collaboration with the 22nd District Attorney of Washington Parish, pursued a governor’s warrant for his extradition.”
The extradition was granted after a hearing in January 2024. Hart was then booked into the Washington Parish Jail and faces charges of sexual battery, indecent behavior with a juvenile and trafficking of children for sexual purposes.
“This case serves as a crucial reminder for parents to monitor their children’s online gaming and social media interactions closely. Incidents like these are not just occurring in large cities; they are striking close to home in our own community,” said Washington Parish Sheriff Randy “Country” Seal.

A long-shot candidate is trying to get his name out there.
Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn) is trying to make his message heard. Phillips held a rally in front of a crowd in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Saturday.
Phillips asked the crowd, “Are you ready to send a message to Republicans and Democrats and all Americans that you all matter? And Democracy matters?”
The congressman is running in the Democratic primary. He said it’s time for a new generation of leadership.
“I called on the president to pass the torch,” Phillips told voters at the afternoon rally.
Phillips also took shots at President Joe Biden for not campaigning in New Hampshire.
“I can’t believe it, but the President of the United States is not on the ballot,” said Phillips. “If he wrote you off, why would you write him in?”
Phillips touted his plans for universal health insurance and helping Americans get more financial stability.
Voters are fond of his campaign promises.
“I can’t believe how aligned I am with him,” said Donna Leroy, a resident of Dorry, NH.
“His message embodies everything that I believe we need in going forward with politics,” said Molly Campbell of North Conway, NH.
“I really liked what he had to say,” said Paul Leroy of Dorry, NH.
President Biden is not on the ballot here in New Hampshire. His campaign pushed for South Carolina to get the first primary. New Hampshire officials were not pleased with that request, and they are now going forward with keeping the primary to be the first in the nation.

Police in Bashkortostan, 900 miles east of Moscow, have arrested 45 people since protests broke out on Wednesday, in the largest demonstrations in Russia since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
“Protests in Bashkortostan began in the city of Baymak,” said OVD-Info, a Russian human rights group. “The next day, protests spread to the capital of the republic, Ufa.”
The protests were triggered by the imprisonment of Fail Alsynov, a Bashkir activist who was sentenced to four years on Wednesday for making an alleged racist slur.
His supporters say he is being punished for leading opposition to plans by well-connected Russian businessmen to develop mines.
In a video posted on Sunday on the Telegram social media channel, Radiy Khabirov, Bashkortostan’s Kremlin-appointed leader, said that protesters would be punished.
“For those detained by law enforcement officers, this is immediately an end to their future careers,” he said.
At least 40 people were injured in the small town of Baymak on Wednesday in clashes between riot police and several thousand protesters. Russian media also reported that 1,000 people protested peacefully in Ufa on Friday, triggering more arrests.
Protests are banned in Russia, but resentment in some parts of the country towards the government has been building since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the mobilisation of men into the army.
The Kremlin has pushed mobilisation heavily along Russia’s fringes, including in Bashkortostan on the southern edge of the Ural Mountains. Roughly a third of Bashkortostan’s 4 million people are ethnic Bashkirs, a Turkic group linked closely to Tartars and Kazakhs.
The protests come as the Kremlin prepares for a presidential election in March. Vladimir Putin wants to use the election to show popular support for his war, but gripes and protests by ordinary Russians have undermined this messaging.
As well as protests in Bashkortostan, thousands of Russians are enduring a freezing winter after central heating breakdowns. Wives of mobilised soldiers are also continuing to call for their husbands to be returned from the front line.

QKF1WC3ART_AJG6TAXR5DU15UC,Court kills Texas law labeling explicit books for schools. What now for parents? | Opinion,Nicole Russell,"January 21, 2024 at 8:28 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/court-kills-texas-law-labeling-112800087.html,"Many concerned Texas parents wanted a way to label inappropriate books in their kids’ school libraries or classrooms. To this parent of four, this makes sense. The Legislature devised a bill that would create such a system, but a federal appeals court just blocked Texas from enforcing it. This also makes sense.
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday blocked the Texas Education Agency from enforcing the READER Act, a state law that would have required booksellers to rate books’ sexually explicit content before selling them to schools. This decision is particularly interesting because it comes from one of the most conservative courts in the country.
Several booksellers in Houston and Austin originally sued the state, saying the law violated their First Amendment rights. The appellate court was affirming a lower court’s decision.
While the Legislature may have meant well, the law was drafted poorly and really had no chance of being properly implemented. It would have required vendors to sift through every book to rate them based on explicit material, a subjective concept to be sure. Then, booksellers would have had to send those to the Texas Education Agency to be reviewed where those officials would correct them — based on more subjective measures — and post them online. The booksellers argued that the rating system violates free speech protections and is tantamount to the government compelling speech, a no-no in First Amendment law.
Parents and conservatives in Texas may not like this, but First Amendment protections apply to everyone, including people with opposing viewpoints. A controversial Supreme Court case demonstrates this well. In 2019, Jack Phillips, a baker who creates custom cakes, won a Supreme Court case. The court found that it was unconstitutional for the state of Colorado to compel Phillips to create a specific kind of cake (which the court viewed as “speech”) honoring a specific kind of wedding because of his religious convictions about celebrating same-sex weddings.
Conservatives lauded this case and similar ones with similar conclusions for years because they cemented the right against compelled speech and protections of religious conviction. The appellate court’s decision on book ratings is similar: Even though Texans want a way to identify explicit books in schools for kids, creating an undue burden on booksellers and forcing them to label their books by content does violate their First Amendment rights.
Such protections for some but not all regardless of ideology, party, or persuasion, are no rights at all. So, it’s good that even a more “conservative” court recognizes this. It means that everybody’s First Amendment rights are intact and that our laws are working this time — they don’t always, which is why the Supreme Court exists.
However, it does leave parents wondering how to handle the issue of books with explicit content in schools. Legislators need to continue listening to their constituents and working with school leaders to come to a solution that is both constitutional and practical. They can start with a renewed resolution not to make a big deal passing laws that aren’t functional or constitutional in the first place.
For the past few years, there’s been an ongoing debate about whether and how schools should police inappropriate content. It’s led to parents voicing concerns in school meetings and sexually explicit books being removed from school libraries. It’s even led to national media outlets saying Texas just bans all the good books. (I hate to disappoint folks, but a book is not really banned if it’s available on Amazon.)
For now, until a legislative solution — if there is one — is crafted, parents and kids might have to do things the old-fashioned way: Parents need to remain involved in their kids’ education and ask children, librarians and school administrators what’s available at school, what their kids are reading and why.

The Trainspotting star, who was once married to Angelina Jolie, was raised by socialist parents and has described himself as “pretty leftie.”
But he has revealed that being cast as the former Tory leader in the popular Netflix drama had “100 per cent” changed his perspective on the politician.
“I was raised in a very, very socialist household, but the more I read about Sir John, the more I liked him,” he said.
“He’s one of the most misunderstood politicians ever: he was very magnetic and had a great sense of humour. “
Miller told The Observer: “That’s actually how Peter Morgan [the creator of The Crown] described him to me. He said: ‘He’s George f------ Clooney!’ Oh right, what am I doing here then?”
The actor won plaudits for his portrayal of Sir John as he skilfully navigated the fallout from the breakdown of the marriage between Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, acting as something of an intermediary.
He has previously described how he discovered, while researching the role, that he and Sir John had many similarities.
They were both raised in south-west London – Kingston and Worcester Park respectively – and went to state grammar schools. Both also had theatrical parents.
“I had all these things in common, and then the more you learn about the work that he did – my respect for him grew massively,” he has said.
In the fifth and penultimate series, broadcast in late 2022, Prince Charles, played by Dominic West, is shown agitating for modernisation and trying to recruit Sir John to his cause, insisting that the monarchy is in need of a revamp.
He summons the Prime Minister to a secret meeting at Highgrove in 1991, hinting that he could replace his mother just as the Conservative party had ousted Margaret Thatcher the previous year.
“What makes the Conservative party successful? Its instinct for renewal and its willingness to make way for someone younger,” he says.
Sir John described the plotlines as “malicious nonsense.”
He said that “utterly untrue” storylines presented as fact so soon after the death of Elizabeth II would be devastating for the Royal family.
He wrote in a letter to The Telegraph that such scenes “will be profoundly hurtful to a family who are still grieving for the very person on whose life the entire drama was founded.”

American fighter jets have repeatedly struck Houthi sites in Yemen over the past ten days, with the latest on Saturday taking out an anti-ship missile that was preparing to fire, according to the US military.
Despite the operations to destroy their radars, missiles and drones, the Iran-backed group – which has almost a decade of experience hiding its weapons from western-backed Saudi air strikes - has vowed to fight on, framing their attacks as an act of solidarity with Palestinians under Israeli attack in Gaza.
On Saturday the Washington Post reported that the Biden administration was crafting plans for a sustained campaign against the Houthis.
The newspaper said the White House had convened senior officials on Wednesday to discuss ways it could evolve its response to the attacks.
No further details have been released on what they may look like though earlier this week Mr Biden conceded the attacks would continue despite failing to deter the Houthis from their campaign.
“Are they stopping the Houthis? No,” Mr Biden told reporters this week. “Are they going to continue? Yes.”
The US officials interviewed by the Post said that they do not expect the campaign to stretch on for years, as in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, but could not estimate when it might end.
However, others in the administration fear the US will end up entangled in yet another open-ended Middle Eastern conflict without an exit strategy.
In its latest assault, the US on Saturday struck a Houthi anti-ship missile that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and about to be launched, according to the US military. That round of strikes came just hours after the US struck three other Houthi anti-ship missiles.
Britain joined the US in carrying out reprisal attacks on Houthi targets earlier this month. Though it has struck a more cautious tone since on its approach to future strikes, it has not ruled out further action.
Defence secretary Grant Shapps said the UK will not accept the Red Sea being permanently closed.
On Sunday the Ministry of Defence said it would spend 405 million pounds to upgrade a missile system now being used by the Royal Navy to shoot down hostile drones over the Red Sea.
The Houthis have framed their attacks in the Red Sea as a tactic to pressure the US into ceasing its unfettered support for Israel’s military campaign against Hamas.
The group, which controls most of Yemen, has carried out more than 30 missile and drone attacks against commercial and naval vessels since mid-November.
Iran is believed to have stepped up its arms deliveries to the Houthis in the wake of the October 7 attacks, with commanders from Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps and Lebanon’s Hezbollah reportedly on the ground in Yemen helping the Houthis coordinate the attacks.
UK and US intelligence also indicates that Houthis are seeking more weapons from Tehran, Politico reported.
The fear among some US lawmakers is that Washington has miscalculated to what extent it can involve itself in the conflict with the Houthis.

QRIZD1SNZJ_3AQ5728PBKI3MH3,"With 85% institutional ownership, Tate & Lyle plc (LON:TATE) is a favorite amongst the big guns",editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 6:20 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/85-institutional-ownership-tate-lyle-092044177.html,"Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Tate & Lyle's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions
A total of 18 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership
Using data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company
Every investor in Tate & Lyle plc (LON:TATE) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 85% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Tate & Lyle.
Check out our latest analysis for Tate & Lyle
Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.
Tate & Lyle already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Tate & Lyle's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.
Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Tate & Lyle is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC with 8.7% of shares outstanding. With 5.1% and 4.6% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.
After doing some more digging, we found that the top 18 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Tate & Lyle plc. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own UK£17m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.
With a 12% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Tate & Lyle. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified  1 warning sign for Tate & Lyle that you should be aware of.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, that aired on Jan. 21, 2024.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We go now to the Republican governor of the state of Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Good morning, Governor.
GOV. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: Good morning, Margaret. It's great to be with you.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's good to talk to you. You are one of the youngest, if not the youngest governor in the [country], the first female governor of Arkansas. I want to ask you about a number of things, including the current Arkansas law, we've been talking a lot about reproductive health. The law bans abortions except to save the mother's life in a medical emergency, no exceptions for rape or incest. Your Attorney General has twice recently rejected ballot measures that would repeal the ban and give a limited right to abortion up until 18 weeks of conception. As Governor, are you open to any ballot initiative?
GOV. SANDERS: Look, I'm proud of the fact that Arkansas is one of the most pro-life states in the country. I'm unapologetically pro-life, I believe that we are a culture that protects life, that values life. I think that's who we are as a country. And I'll continue to support those measures.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But- I know those are your personal convictions, but would you seek the opinion of your constituents on this? I mean, some of the Attorney General's objections. One of the things he objected to was replacing the word conception with fertilization. And another one, it was narrowing a medical emergency to threat to physical health and defining it just as that. I mean, they seem to be tweaks. On the premise though, would you be open to seeking the opinion of your constituents in a ballot initiative?
GOV. SANDERS: Arkansas overwhelmingly pro-life state, I'm proud of that fact and proud of where we are. And we'll continue to push for things that I think protect all innocent human life. It's why we haven't just focused on pro-life legislation. But we've also done things in the foster and adoption care space. It's why I've spent so much time focusing on education, empowering every single Arkansan to have a great quality of life. We are looking at every aspect and making sure that we're doing what we can to protect and value life at every stage here in the state of Arkansas.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it sounds like a no? You wouldn't want to put it on a ballot?
GOV. SANDERS: I'm not going to put a blanket on anything that could come forward. But as it stands right now, I haven't seen anything that I would be supportive of.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state, you're talking about the sanctity of life, your state had one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country, according to the CDC up until about 2021. Arkansas is one of the few states that hasn't extended postpartum care for mothers. Why don't you want those moms to get care for a full 12 months, as is being offered, instead of just 60 days?
GOV. SANDERS: Well, I'm gonna have to disagree with the premise of your question saying that I don't want that. I certainly want us to do everything that we can to help during pregnancy and well after a child is born, which is why we have done things like focus on the foster and adoption care, we've put significant funding into our pregnancy crisis centers, we're focusing on things that help our mothers, including bring your kids to work at state government. We've expanded maternity leave for state employees, we included that in our education package. We have taken a number of steps that are very positive in this front. And we're going to continue to do that as long as I'm governor.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the states of Mississippi, Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, they did extend for 12 months rather than the 60 days. So, I'm just wondering specifically on that option, why you opted out?
GOV. SANDERS: We're gonna continue to look at options that we feel like best help people here in the state of Arkansas, we've done that in a number of ways and we're going to continue to do that over the course of hopefully the next seven years while I'm governor of Arkansas.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you as well about what is happening with the kids in your state. I was interested to see that you are not among the 15 Republican governors who rejected a new federal program to give food assistance to eight million children during the summer months. You opted into that--
GOV. SANDERS: I did. I--
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- A number of Republican guidance say on premise that- that- that- this- this violates conservative principles. So why are they wrong? And why are you okay with this federal program?
GOV. SANDERS: Well, I want to focus on why I think it helps our state. Arkansas in the past has ranked at the bottom when it comes to food insecurity for children. I don't think any child should ever go hungry if we have options available to us to help improve that. That's exactly what we're going to do. That's why we've opted into this program. We're going to continue to look for ways to help and protect kids in our state. And I was proud to be part of that program. And we'll continue to look for options to help move Arkansas out of the bottom when it comes to food insecurity and into the top.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You are, as we said at the get go there, the youngest governor in the country. And I wonder when you look at your party right now, what does it say about the party and about our politics that not only is the President of the United States at such an advanced age, but the Republican front runner Donald Trump, 77 years old here- are these much older individuals, really the new generation that you've been calling for?
GOV. SANDERS: I think this election right now is very simple. It's a very clear contrast, you have two individuals who have a four-year record to run on. One has a record of success coming from a posture and a position of strength in Donald Trump, and one who comes from a position of weakness. Every single thing that voters actually care about, every single thing that drives voters to show up and cast their ballot. Donald Trump is winning on, whether it's the economy, whether it's securing the border, whether it's national security, whether it's taking a hard line against China, every single one of those major issues that really drive voters, Donald Trump is dominating Joe Biden on, and they both have clear records in which to run from, and I have no doubt that the matchup in November will declare Donald Trump a clear victor because of that- that contrast.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he's only four years younger than the president whose age you've- you've criticized, but your predecessor as governor, Asa Hutchinson, just recently ended his presidential bid and he endorsed Nikki Haley. He said, ""Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last eight years. Trump intentionally tries to divide America."" Do you honestly, Sarah- Sorry, Governor Sanders, I'm used to calling you Sarah from- from the front row at the White House there? Do you honestly believe Trump is going to unite the country this time, when in the first term, that you were part of, the country was very divided?
GOV. SANDERS: You know, one of the things that I think is so often left out of Donald Trump's story is the patriotism and the love of country that he brought back. We haven't seen that in this president--
MARGARET BRENNAN: -- What do you mean by that?
GOV. SANDERS:-- In fact, we've seen the total opposite. We see people who believe in America again, who see the strength of our country. We brought back American manufacturing, we secured our border, we had a strong economy, our enemies abroad actually feared us and our allies actually respected us. Instead of the people now are across the- the other side of the world are laughing at us and taking advantage of the weakness of this President. Donald Trump-- you know, you joked a minute ago, you called me Sarah, instead of Governor, you know, your colleagues called me a lot of other things. I'll take Sarah all day over some of the things that the media and the left called me. But when those things were happening, the person who was defending me, empowering me to do my job was Donald Trump. I know that he can deliver again, because he's done it before.
MARGARET BRENNAN: No-- Governor, I think we've always had a respectful exchange, you and I, so I don't think we're part of the media group you're talking about--
GOV. SANDERS: -- I didn't say you, I was--
MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Right. But- but on the substance of the question, in terms of uniting the country, I mean, some of the policy things you just rattled off, as you know, immigration has been broken for decades. And those border problems were border problems under President Trump. The Middle East policies he had didn't solve issues. I mean, in fact, we are seeing the conflict in Israel really flare up in a way, he didn't broker the peace deal he promised. He didn't get Russia out of Ukraine. She didn't improve relations with China. So how can you point to that as a- as a high point without recognizing that even he says the work was not finished?
GOV. SANDERS: Well, that's why we need him to come back for four years because he didn't get to finish, but he certainly made significant progress. Our border was far more secure under President Trump, than under President Biden, I had the chance to go to the border myself. And while I was there, met with those who are standing on the front lines, including members of the Arkansas National Guard that we deployed, because the federal government is not doing their job, states are having to step up. And in meeting with those individuals, they told us that more people had come across in just that month, just that month on the terrorist watch list than in the entire four years of Donald Trump's presidency. Donald Trump was actually taking steps to secure our border, to strengthen our country. It's hard to argue that having a good economy, having safe and secure borders, taking a hard line against China, those are empowering and unifying things for our country--
MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Would you be his VP if asked?
GOV. SANDERS: -- And only- hold on I want to just finish this one point. And only one of two people in the race has actually delivered on each of those things. And it's Donald Trump, not Joe Biden.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'd be open to vetting to be his vice president potentially?
GOV. SANDERS: Look, I absolutely love the job I have. I think it's one of the best jobs I could ever ask for. And I am honored to serve as governor, and I hope I get to do it for the next seven years.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Next seven years. All right. That sounds like two terms. Maybe a no. Governor Sanders. Thank you. We'll be right back.

Brian Kemp is aiming to give state residents relief on taxes.
While Kemp’s plan, according to his remarks at the State of the State address, were focused on lowering state income taxes, some lawmakers have an extra plan in mind.
A group of 21 state senators filed legislation on Jan. 11 to make guns, gun safes, accessories and ammunition tax free for 11 days each year.
According to the legislative text of Senate Bill 344, the bill would make firearms, ammunition, gun safes and related accessories exempt from state sales and use taxes from the second Friday of October to the fourth Monday of October each year.

The tax free holiday for gun buying would include stocks, barrels, scopes and magazines, in addition to ammo and the guns themselves.
A fiscal note on file with the Georgia legislature from Jan. 8 by State Auditor Greg S. Griffin said the bill would impact state revenues from $1.31 to $3.27 in the 2025 fiscal year while hitting local revenues between $1.1 to $2.73 million.
However, the fiscal note said the lower estimates were based on sales remaining evenly distributed during the 11-day proposed tax holiday, while the higher estimate assumes purchases are higher during the period.
In 2023, the analysis estimates gun sales accounted for roughly $1.06 billion in Georgia, based on national sales of federally registered firearms reported by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Officers made their way to the home on Austin’s northeast side after a man called 911 for help, saying he’d been stabbed in the stomach and was “bleeding a lot,” Austin Police Department officials said at a Jan. 21 news briefing. The attacker was still at the home, the man told police.
Three officers arrived at the scene and found a group of people gathered outside the house, including a person with stab wounds, police said.
As officers moved toward the home they could hear screaming from inside, police said, so they decided to force their way in through the front door. As soon as they did, they were met by a man clutching a knife in one hand and an injured woman in the other, officials said.
All three officers opened fire, shooting the man, police said.
Several other people were rescued from the house, including three children, according to police. A woman was found dead on the floor of a bedroom with stab wounds, police said, and two other people were stabbed and are hospitalized in stable condition.
Officials say the man shot by police was also taken to a hospital and is in stable condition.
Police said they did not know what relationship, if any, there is between the accused attacker and the victims, but an investigation is underway.
Anyone with information about the case is asked to contact investigators at 512-974-6840.

Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) could end his Democratic primary challenge to President Biden and make a third-party bid with No Labels, claiming that Phillips’s campaign doesn’t even matter.
“At the end of the day, there’s only going to be two parties that have an ability to get to 270 electoral votes, and that’s going to be Joe Biden as a Democratic nominee and whoever emerges from the extreme Republican primary that’s going on right now,” deputy campaign manager Quintin Fulks said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday.
Phillips’s long-shot challenge to Biden has gained no momentum, and questions swirl over whether the congressman will continue his campaign after the New Hampshire primary. Biden will not be on the ballot in New Hampshire, but a write-in campaign is seeking to defeat Phillips anyway.
“We’re going to stay focused on the issues and make this about freedom and democracy,” Fulks continued. “The Americans that have the most at stake understand that, and they’re not going to be fooled by anything else.”
The Biden campaign has effectively ignored Phillips since he launched his candidacy in October.
“There are only two options of who’s going to be the President of the United States, and that’s either Joe Biden or whoever the Republicans put forth, and our campaign is going to continue to make sure that we’re delivering a message to draw that contrast about what this election is all about, and that’s restoring democracy and protecting freedoms from millions of Americans across this country,” Fulks added.
No Labels, a third-party effort that has vowed to put forward a bipartisan presidential “unity” ticket, is actively recruiting figures to place on the ballot. Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) has been floated as an option, as has Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). Both have teased that they could make White House runs, but neither has made a public decision.
Phillips first signaled interest in No Labels on Saturday, saying he would be interested in running on the group’s ballot line if Trump was the GOP nominee.
“It would have to be a Joe Biden-Donald Trump rematch that shows Joe Biden is almost certain to lose,” Phillips told The New York Times. “That is the only condition in which I would even entertain a conversation with any alternative.”

Officers found 33-year-old Antoine Gee Jr. lying dead on Milwaukee’s northwest side on the night of Jan. 10, police told WITI. He was wearing a Domino’s jacket, investigators said, and they found a paper receipt near his body — which led police to the store location he’d been sent from moments earlier.
Gee was unknowingly walking into a trap set by three 17-year-old boys, according to a criminal complaint filed Jan. 19 in Milwaukee County.
Surveillance video shows Gee walking toward three figures dressed in black clothing when a struggle breaks out, officials said. One of the figures pulls out a gun and fires six shots, then the group of three runs away, leaving Gee lying motionless on a median, according to investigators.
A witness told police he heard the boys talking to each other earlier in the night while gathered in a basement. One mentioned they wanted a pizza and that “they were going to ‘snatch it,’” officials said. After ordering the pizza, the group left and later returned to the home in a frenzied state, “running around like wild animals and … (turning) off all of the lights,” according to investigators.
The witness said one of the teens had a pizza delivery bag, documents read.
Video of the shooting showed one of Gee’s attackers running away with his pizza bag, officials said.
Gee’s family called his death “senseless,” WISN reported.
“These are kids that did this. And you took away a good one for nothing,” Jerome Avery Sr., Gee’s uncle, told the outlet. “When you took him, you didn’t just ruin his life, you ruined a community.”
The three teens, whom McClatchy News is not naming because they are minors, are all charged with murder, officials say.

R30M2SPFKW_RGERMZ0RP20YNUH,Opinion: A play about Gaza won awards in Israel. No theater would dare mount it now,Guy Ben-Aharon,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/opinion-play-gaza-won-awards-110008558.html,"In 2015, I directed the American premiere of an Israeli play that grapples with Gaza — a play I could never direct today.
Gilad Evron’s “Ulysses on Bottles” centers on Izakov, a Jewish Israeli lawyer representing two clients: a Palestinian teacher, nicknamed Ulysses, arrested by Israel for trying to reach Gaza on a raft made of plastic bottles in hopes of bringing Russian literature to the strip, and an Israeli defense official, Seinfeld, seeking advice about whether Israel’s blockade of Gaza could implicate the country in crimes against humanity.

The world premiere of the play in Israel in 2012 wasn’t easy to produce. A Jewish actor declined the title role, fearing he’d be blacklisted from commercial work. Eventually the role went to a Palestinian citizen of Israel. Still, the production ran for more than 80 performances and won Israel’s top theater prize for best original play that year.
When I directed “Ulysses” three years later in Boston, in a translation by Evan Fallenberg, I knew it would shake up audiences. I too was challenged by what the play brought up: Israelis’ daily indifference to the Gaza siege, which their government hoped would weaken Hamas’ rule but instead became a cruel policy of collective punishment.
My own discomfort is exactly why I wanted to do the play. Theater allows us to confront hard facts in a way that is provocative but ambiguous. It can make big issues intimate, and it doesn’t force you to make up your mind, only to watch and wrestle.
Reaction to the Boston production could be summed up in one comment: great art but unsettling. Tickets sold out for the majority of the run, but my theater company, Israeli Stage, lost funders and audiences. The head of Boston’s Jewish federation never came to another of our productions, and his organization reduced its sponsorship of our work. The consul general of Israel in Boston summoned me to his office and told me to put on other plays instead.

Here is an excerpt from the most difficult scene in the play, in which Seinfeld confesses his deepest fears to Izakov: that the population in Gaza will boom, diseases and misery will multiply and the blockade will explode in Israelis’ faces:
Seinfeld: Imagine 10 million people who can’t get out, who can barely move, who are infected and starved and scorched. … The fear no longer stops anyone. To live or to die — they don’t see the difference. And they come and overtake us. And then what, lawyer Izakov? I shoot them at the border and I shoot them as they continue to advance and rise up; they grow in numbers and I keep shooting. … Thousands? Millions? How many? Till when?
The play seems prophetic today. Fear of death didn’t stop Hamas from flooding into Israel and killing 1,200 people and taking more than 200 people hostage. Now as nearly 2 million Palestinians are displaced inside Gaza, fleeing Israeli bombardment, disease is rampant and famine looms.
And as Seinfeld predicts, we continue shooting. Gaza health officials say more than 24,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel’s military, 10,000 of whom are children. Who knows how many more will be killed. “Thousands? Millions? How many?”

As a director, I want to speak in the way I know best, to ask people to come to the theater and see what a play like “Ulysses on Bottles” has to say. But where could it be staged today?
I couldn’t put it on in Germany. There, it would be attacked as antisemitic. A week into the Israel-Hamas war, Berlin’s leading theater, the Maxim Gorki Theatre, postponed performances of “The Situation,”  a play by Israeli director-playwright Yael Ronen that explores the third generation of Germans, Israelis and Palestinians whose families survived the Holocaust and Nakba.
I couldn’t put it on in the U.S. Theaters there would certainly fear the loss of support from Jewish audiences and benefactors. And for those who want to hear about Palestinian suffering, what an Israeli playwright has to say about Gaza would never do. In November, I asked a producer at a university theater company in Boston if he’d put on a reading of the play. He said the university president had forbidden productions or statements about Gaza on stage.
And Israel? No Israeli theater would dare put on this play now. I was texting with someone at the theater that originally produced it, and I asked whether they’d mount it now. The conversation ended; there was no response.

In fact, Gaza disappeared from the Israeli theater a long time ago. “Ulysses on Bottles” was the last major Israeli play to reckon with Gaza, and that was 12 years ago. Israeli theater, attended by a staggering 40% of the population, is harnessed by the state: Many actors come up through the military’s performing troupes, and all theaters rely on public funding. When theaters criticize Israeli policy, or explore taboo topics such as the occupation or the Nakba, their funding may be cut or conditioned by the ministry of culture.
During the last two decades of Israel’s rightward drift, theater professionals have self-censored to survive, a situation made worse now. I know an actress who was suspended from teaching at an acting studio because she posted about Palestinian suffering that predated Oct. 7. In November, Jerusalem’s municipal theater dropped a play by an Afghan-British playwright about his family’s exile from Afghanistan because he tweeted about the “Gaza genocide.” “We cannot celebrate the work of this writer,” the theater’s manager said in a news release.
There’s a scene in “Ulysses on Bottles” where Izakov tries to convince Ulysses to sign an agreement that he won’t set sail for Gaza ever again, in exchange for his freedom from jail:
Izakov: Sign the agreement and that’s that! … Enough throwing your life away on something so insubstantial, so completely groundless. …Stop being some parody, some extinct species that nobody is interested in or knows anything about. Your anonymity is complete. The theater is empty. There are no protest movements, there’s no echo, the square is empty. Go home!
The squares in Israel do feel empty. Antiwar protests are made up of a hundred protesters at best. The theaters are full but with plays that serve as distractions from war. There’s no place where an Israeli director can put Gaza center stage and ask audiences to come to terms with their inaction in the face of an endless cycle of violence. As things stand, Ulysses can’t even dream of setting sail.

Israel is pressing its push against Hamas in southern Gaza as it seeks to destroy the Islamist militant group responsible for the deadliest attack in the country's history.
In early January, Israel's military said the Hamas command structure in northern Gaza had been dismantled, leaving only isolated fighters.
But witnesses told AFP Israeli boats were bombarding Gaza City and other areas in the north early Sunday. Hamas has also reported heavy combat in the north.
""Dozens are still under the rubble,"" the Hamas government's media office said, adding that the dead and injured ""could not be transferred to hospitals due to the continued artillery shelling on... Khan Yunis and the Tal al-Hawa area in Gaza City and the north"".
The Israeli army said it ""eliminated a number of terrorists"" in the main southern city of Khan Yunis and killed 15 militants in northern Gaza over the past day.
Thick plumes of smoke billowed above Khan Yunis on Sunday morning, AFP journalists saw.
The October 7 attacks by Hamas resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
Israel's relentless bombardment and ground offensive have killed at least 25,105 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
- 'Difficult conditions' in tunnel -
Militants also seized about 250 hostages during the October attacks.
Israel says around 132 remain in Gaza, of whom at least 27 captives are believed to have been killed, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.
In a briefing on Saturday evening, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said troops had found a tunnel in Khan Yunis where some hostages had previously been kept.
Among the evidence of their presence were paintings, including by a five-year-old captive, he said.
""About 20 hostages"" had been held there at different times ""in difficult conditions without daylight... with little oxygen and terrible humidity"".
Soldiers entered the tunnel and fought a battle with militants in which ""the terrorists were eliminated"", Hagari said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under intense pressure to return the hostages and account for security failings surrounding the October attacks.
Thousands protested across Israel on Saturday evening to demand the release of the hostages and early elections to oust Netanyahu.
Avi Lulu Shamriz, the father of Alon Shamriz, a hostage mistakenly killed by Israeli troops earlier in the war, told AFP in Tel Aviv Netanyahu's war cabinet was heading for disaster.
""The way we're going, all the hostages are going to die. It's not too late to free them.""
- Devastating West Bank raid -
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees says about 1.7 million people have been displaced in Gaza, with about one million crowded into the Rafah area.
UN agencies have warned better aid access is needed urgently as famine and disease loom.
Diplomatic efforts have sought to secure scaled-up aid deliveries for Gaza and a truce, after a week-long cessation of hostilities in November saw Hamas release dozens of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Hamas's Qatar-based chief Ismail Haniyeh was in Turkey Saturday for talks with the foreign minister, diplomatic sources said, renewing ties with the key regional power which asked the group's leaders to leave the country following the October attacks.
Violence has meanwhile surged in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since October 7.
The Israeli military said it demolished two houses in Hebron belonging to two Palestinian gunmen who carried out an attack on a road between Jerusalem and Bethlehem in November.
An AFP journalist saw a fireball erupt and smoke billowing from a home on Sunday as Israeli armoured vehicles manoeuvred through Hebron's roads during the raid.
Palestinians gathered outside the crumpled remains of one of the homes on Sunday, with young boys weaving their way through a thicket of tangled metal and rubble.
One man removed a banner Israeli forces attached to a destroyed house which read: ""terrorism has no home"".
The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian fighters in a village south of Jenin and the towns of Arura and Qalqilya.
Rising tensions and violence across the Middle East have also stoked fears of a wider conflagration involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
Iranian media said an Israeli strike on Damascus on Saturday killed the Revolutionary Guards' spy chief in Syria and four other Guards members, prompting a threat of retaliation.

Police went to the Santa Clara home for a welfare check at about 11 a.m., Jan. 16, after an acquaintance of the husband “expressed concern” about him and his wife, according to a Jan. 19 news release from the Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office.
Liren Chen, 27, was not answering his phone and not coming to the door, even though they could see him inside “motionless on his knees, had his hands in the air and was staring blankly,” the acquaintance told police.
When officers entered the home, Chen was “spattered with blood,” officials said. They found his wife dead on the floor of a bedroom behind him with “severe blunt force injuries to her head,” according to officials.
“Chen’s right hand was extremely swollen and purple,” investigators said. “He had blood on his clothing, legs, arms, and hands and scratches on his arm.”
While officials did not name Chen’s wife, records show he was married to Xuanyi Yu and that they shared a home in Santa Clara, the San Francisco Standard reported.
Yu’s LinkedIn profile has been turned into a memorial page and lists her job as software engineer at Google.
Chen’s page shows he was a software engineer as well, working for YouTube, which is owned by Google.
He is charged with murder, officials said.

RC34NBZV9A_KYLICJI8X2N0VX8,A Look At The Fair Value Of SThree plc (LON:STEM),editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 5:18 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-sthree-plc-081858723.html,"SThree's estimated fair value is UK£3.62 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity
With UK£3.76 share price, SThree appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value
Analyst price target for STEM is UK£5.60, which is 55% above our fair value estimate
Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of SThree plc (LON:STEM) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.
View our latest analysis for SThree
We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = UK£228m
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 1.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = UK£26m× (1 + 1.5%) ÷ (6.8%– 1.5%) = UK£492m
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= UK£492m÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= UK£254m
The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is UK£481m. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of UK£3.8, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.
We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at SThree as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.902. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Strength
Debt is not viewed as a risk.
Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.
Weakness
Earnings declined over the past year.
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Professional Services market.
Opportunity
Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.
Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.
Threat
Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the British market.
Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For SThree, we've put together three essential factors you should assess:

Wade, which shaped abortion rights for women. In 2022, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution does not protect the right to an abortion.
In a news release on Friday, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell released a snapshot revealing the impacts of that decision on PNW abortion providers.
Senator Cantwell said the number of abortions provided in Washington rose by 23% in 2022.
“The snapshot compiles stories and data from Planned Parenthood clinics in Central and Eastern Washington, the Washington State Department of Health, and the Northwest Abortion Access Fund,” writes the news release. “Together, they paint a picture of a strained reproductive care delivery system in the State of Washington.”
A few main findings from her snapshot are:
On average, Washington providers perform 201 more abortions per month.
The number of out-of-state abortion patients is up by 46%, with a 56% increase in abortion patients from Idaho specifically.
Abortion care providers “face unique threats and harassment given our close proximity to Idaho,” said the Planned Parenthood CEO.
Planned Parenthood in Washington and Idaho currently pays to fly six nurses in from other regions “because people are afraid to perform abortions where they live,” writes the snapshot.
Around 11% of abortions are now prescribed virtually, up from 8% after Dobbs vs. Jackson.
“What we see in the aftermath of the Supreme Court overturning abortion rights is a persistent and growing strain on our state’s reproductive health care system,” said Sen. Cantwell. “Out-of-state patients see Washington state as a haven, but our hardworking reproductive care providers are facing a heavier workload and escalating harassment.”
“The Washington-Idaho border is the epicenter of this problem,” she continued.
According to the CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho, Karl Eastlund, Planned Parenthood in Washington and Idaho currently pays to fly in nurses from other regions to help meet demands.
“As abortion providers in Washington, our staff face unique threats and harassment given our close proximity to Idaho, which has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country,” said Eastlund. “Staffing shortages are a problem for all health care providers in Washington. This has been the case for a while now, but the overturn of Roe forced many providers to look at the potential risks now associated with giving care that all people deserve access to.”
According to the news release, 21 states have total abortion bans or stringent restrictions in place.
“In April, Sen. Cantwell joined U.S. Senator Patty Murray and 25 other colleagues in reintroducing the Let Doctors Provide Reproductive Health Care Act, which would ban anti-choice states from restricting or preventing health care providers from performing abortions in states where abortion is legal,” writes the release."

DeSantis made the announcement in a video posted to X in which he also endorsed former President Donald Trump.
The move comes after DeSantis lost the Iowa caucuses to Trump by 30 percentage points, according to the Deseret News.
“Following our second-place finish in Iowa, we’ve prayed and deliberated on the way forward,” he said. “If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it.

Trump responded to DeSantis’ endorsement in a statement to Fox News Digital Sunday:
“Very honored to have his endorsement,” Trump said. “I look forward to working together with him to beat Joe Biden, who is the worst and most corrupt president in the history of our country.”

Lucasfilm first took the wrapper off this ""Star Wars"" coming-of-age show that they secretly labeled ""Grammar Rodeo"" back at Star Wars Celebration 2022 by revealing its official title as ""Star Wars: Skeleton Crew."" The ""young adults in space"" series was described as having the darker tone of an old '80s Steven Spielberg adventure, conceived by ""Spider-Man Trilogy"" director Jon Watts and screenwriter Christopher Ford, who also wrote the hit Spidey installment, ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats are trying to temper expectations for U.S. President Joe Biden in next week's Democratic primary election in New Hampshire, as supporters scramble to gin up write-in support for him since his name is not on the ballot.
The primary on Jan. 23 offers the first at-the-polls gauge of Biden’s political strength this election cycle, and the unprecedented situation will be closely watched amid polls showing him tied with likely Republican challenger Donald Trump .
A poor showing against Democratic longshots Dean Phillips, a Minnesota congressman, and self-help author Marianne Williamson is likely to fuel concerns that Biden is weak heading into the general election.
Biden did not register for the New Hampshire contest after the state refused his demand that it cede its top spot in the presidential primary calendar to the more diverse South Carolina.
But his New Hampshire supporters can still vote for him because many U,S, states allow voters to write the name on a ballot paper of a candidate who is not officially running. That candidate wins if they receive more votes than the registered candidates.
Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, said Biden should achieve ""a fairly significant win,"" but added that he didn't really know what that looks like.
""What is a big enough win to count? Right now we see Biden with upwards of 70% of the vote. Is that enough? Does that mean the Democratic Party is behind him, or does it show division in the party?"" Smith told Reuters.
Supporters say the unpredictable race should not be viewed as some type of national litmus test, because turnout will be low, write-in campaigns are notoriously hard and Biden angered Democrats there by booting the state from its historical role as the party first-in-the-nation primary.
Jim Demers, one of the organizers of the shoe-string Biden write-in campaign said he’s seen polls that range from less than 50% to 60% of the vote for Biden.
State officials expect to declare a Democratic winner on Tuesday after tallying write-in votes.
Biden allies say the benchmark should be the 2010 write-in campaign of Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, the first U.S. senator to win that way in 50 years, taking about 40% of the vote and besting a Tea Party favorite.
""She won with 39% of the vote as a candidate in a write-in effort she led and Joe Biden and his campaign aren’t even participating in an effort to write his name in for this one,"" said Jim Messina, who was then-President Barack Obama's campaign manager in 2012.
The Democratic National Committee ruled that the New Hampshire election effectively won’t count and the winner won't amass New Hampshire's 23 delegates in the march to the party's nomination.
Some New Hampshire Democrats are definitely upset.
""When it comes down to it, we’re in the Democratic primary and Biden has chosen to take his name off of the New Hampshire ballot,"" said state representative Jonah Wheeler, a Democrat who supports Williamson.
Biden's high-profile supporters including California Representative Ro Khanna, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu have been helping rally the faithful, and organizers have a shoe-string budget to teach voters how to write in a candidate.
A CNN poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center in mid-November showed 65% of likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire plan to write in Biden’s name, with 10% going for Phillips and 9% for Williamson.
In 2020, Biden finished a disappointing fifth in a crowded Democratic primary that saw some 300,000 votes cast. State officials expect less than 100,000 votes this year.
Lyndon B. Johnson, then the Democratic incumbent, shunned the New Hampshire primary in 1968 due to over-confidence, only to see an insurgent campaign from Minnesota, U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy and his anti-Vietnam War platform. Johnson supporters mounted a barely successful write-campaign, but a weakened Johnson dropped out of the race weeks later.
David Watters, a write-in advocate and Democratic state senator in New Hampshire, said the best way right now to register rejection of former President Donald Trump, his likely Republican challenger, is to write-in Biden on Tuesday.
""We've got to stand up for Joe Biden,"" Watters said.
Elliot and Edith Smith, a married couple, attended a Dean Phillips campaign event in Nashua earlier this month. Like many U.S. voters, they are dissatisfied by a choice between of Biden and Trump, but they don’t see any other viable options.
The were both planning to vote for Biden in the state’s primary, but not enthusiastically, over deep concerns about Biden’s vigor and whether the 81-year-old president can withstand a second term.
“I am disgusted with both parties, but we can’t elect Trump,” said Elliot Smith, 72. “I’m a Democrat, but would consider other Republicans like Haley or Christie in the general election, but there’s no chance they can beat Trump.”

Doug Burgum, who endorsed Donald Trump after suspending his own Republican presidential campaign, on Sunday tried to downplay the former president's inflammatory new attacks on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley's name and heritage.
When pressed by ABC News ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Trump's intentional mispronunciations of Haley's first name -- Nimarata -- and elevation of a false conspiracy theory that she is unable to be president because her Indian immigrant parents weren't citizens when she was born in South Carolina, Burgum initially did not give a direct answer.
But Raddatz followed up: ""Please answer the question, sir. Answer the question about why you think Donald Trump is doing that.""
Trump has repeatedly misstated or mispronounced Haley's first name, more often in social media posts. She goes by her middle name and took her husband's last name after they married.
Trump has a history of racist attacks on some non-white opponents -- including infamously questioning whether Barack Obama was born in the U.S. (he was) and singling out Obama's middle name, Hussein.
Burgum on ""This Week"" chalked the comments up to more routine sharp exchanges in a campaign, pointing to how President Joe Biden has gone after Trump rather than, he argued, focusing more on key issues like crime, immigration and inflation.
""I think it's politics,"" Burgum said, adding, ""That's politics around the world, and it's politics in America.""
""So, do you think that's the kind of politics that Donald Trump is using, going after Nikki Haley's heritage, that will bring the country together?"" Raddatz asked.
""You could ask me the question about, you know, what did Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris say? The vicious things they said about Joe Biden, even during debates nationally televised within that party,"" Burgum said, referencing some of Biden's 2020 primary opponents. ""This is all in the norm for politics in our country. But once we agree as parties, we get behind candidates. The Democrats got behind Biden in 2020. I'm confident Republicans are gonna get behind President Trump.""
Haley has also responded to Trump's attacks.
""I know President Trump well. That's what he does when he feels threatened. That's what he does when he feels insecure,"" she said during a CNN town hall on Thursday.
Burgum, who suspended his campaign in December after failing to gain traction, endorsed Trump earlier this month, one day before the Iowa caucuses that began the 2024 race.
On ""This Week,"" Burgum was asked about several areas in which he seemingly diverges from Trump, including a self-declared mission to pull the country together -- while Trump has vowed ""retribution"" -- and reaffirming that Biden won the 2020 race.
Burgum said he was endorsing Trump because he was ""confident that President Trump is going to be right on the economy, right on energy policy and right on national security.""
""During the time that President Trump was in office, I mean, we had peace and prosperity in America. And under President Biden, we’ve got chaos around the world,"" he said.
When Raddatz pressed Burgum over Trump's repeated and unfounded claims that the 2020 election was ""stolen,"" a stance Burgum has opposed in the past, including an interview with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, Burgum initially pivoted to past instances of other candidates raising questions about the election process.
He then cited ""irregularities"" regarding 2020, though there has never been any evidence of widespread fraud.
""Do you think the election was stolen now, sir?"" Raddatz followed up.
""No, I'm not saying that,"" Burgum responded.
""I'm saying that I think that we have to ... make sure that Americans have confidence in these elections,"" he said.
Burgum also swatted away a recent gaffe by Trump in which he repeatedly confused Haley with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while discussing the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Trump and other Republicans have made repeated attacks on Biden's age and fitness, which many voters also feel is poor, polls show -- as Biden says his work speaks for itself.
Haley seized on Trump's slip in a recent campaign appearance, suggesting he, too, might not be mentally strong enough.
""I've been on the campaign trail, and I know when you're going around the clock, it's possible to ... use words that don't fit in sentences,"" Burgum told Raddatz. ""But I would say having been with the president last week in Iowa and in New Hampshire and watching him go for 20 hours a day, I know that he's got the strength, he's got the experience to lead.""any

Murmuration Community Therapy, a non-profit organisation based in Bristol, is making the film in partnership with the city council.
A viewing on 12 January included neurodivergent children, parents, a teacher, parents and the filmmaker - who was keen to get some feedback.
Tamara, 11, who watched the film, said: ""It's absolutely amazing"".
She has dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorders [ASD] and dyscalculia.
""It kind of just sums up the whole of how people are just different now, and now we have figured out all about these different neurodivergence,"" Tamara said.
The idea is to screen the video across Bristol schools to encourage understanding and empathy.
Co-director Poppy Villierezz said there is ""a crying need"" to help these children who have ""a higher incidence of experiencing bullying"".
The film, also previewed by members of the council, includes children aged 11 to 13 talking about their school experiences and how they try to fit in with the world around them.
Ms Villierezz said there is very little support for neurotypical children to become more flexible and respectful around other neurotypes, which can result in bullying and social difficulties at school.
She hopes the film, which was commissioned by the special educational needs and disabilities [SEND] team at Bristol City Council, will bridge that gap between pupils.
Former teacher Lavinia King, who has a dyslexic son and attended the screening, said there was no resource like this when she was teaching in 2010.
""The film was wonderful, it should be shared at a teacher training level,"" she said.
""I think that if you speak to most teachers, SEND is part of what we're trained in, it's such a tiny aspect.
""I feel passionately strong about normalising divergence in schools.""
Ms Villierezz added: ""This video is being created to meet what is a crying need in this city and probably across the country.
""It was really exciting to see the group watch the draft.""Murmuration Community Therapy has now launched a crowdfunding scheme to help fund the film's release.

RQ78XJ2F3M_PYO527O7YPO8ZLW,Canned Sardines Make For A Delectable Banh Mi In A Pinch,Matthew Wilson,"January 21, 2024 at 11:15 a.m.·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/canned-sardines-delectable-banh-mi-021556837.html,"The bánh mì is a staple in Vietnamese cuisine — simple to make but easily customizable. The sandwich features meat of your choice and veggies like pickled daikon, cucumber, carrots, and cilantro on French baguette bread. The sandwich is topped with mayonnaise for a creamy finish. While you can make bánh mì with fresh fish, canned sardines add a salty flair to the sandwich. Plus, they're convenient if you want to make a quick and easy but fulfilling sandwich.
Canned sardines stand out among the various proteins you can choose for the sandwich such as chicken, meatballs, or even pork. There's a historical element with Vietnamese people having a long history with canned sardines, which we will get to in a minute. For Vietnamese immigrants, the sandwich is a reminder of home, and for others, it's a tasty snack. The saltiness of the canned fish pairs well with the sourness of pickled veggies like the aforementioned daikon. The heartiness of the fish contrasts well with vegetables, so much so that people often throw canned sardines in a salad. The fish adds an additional flavor and depth to the meal, without sticking out or seeming out of place with the other elements of the sandwich. The preferred type of sardines for this sandwich are the kind soaked in tomato sauce because you get that sweet hint of tomatoes to further bring things together.

You may tempted to use fresh sardines in your bánh mì sandwich because fresh is always better, right? While it's true that fresh ingredients, including sardines, typically have a higher quality, the dish has historically been made using canned sardines. So if you want a more authentic sandwich, then it's better to grab a couple cans of sardines for your bánh mì.
Generally, if you're using fresh sardines then your sandwich will have a different taste. Fresh sardines have a less potent fish taste and are generally sweeter than the canned variety. While that may make for a more pleasant dining experience if you were eating the fish straight up, there's a risk of fresh sardines not standing out among the other ingredients of your sandwich. In comparison, canned sardines have a stronger salty taste.
Additionally, canned sardines are more convenient if you're trying to make a bánh mì or perhaps a fish taco in a pinch. You don't have to worry about the hassle of cooking them before you prepare your sandwich. Fresh sardines can be difficult to find unless you have a fish market in your town. Likewise, they typically don't last long unless frozen. Comparatively, canned sardines can last a lot longer in your pantry.
As mentioned above, the Vietnamese have a somewhat conflicted history when it comes to canned sardines. The French originally introduced the canned fish to the country in the early 1900s. With the process for canning becoming available in the 1800s, canned sardines became a staple for the lower classes in France. At the time, Vietnam was a French colony called Indochina, which it remained until 1954. The meal proved to be popular among colonists, often eaten in tomato sauce.
The meal also became a hit among the Vietnamese middle and upper class in the country. When France pulled out of Vietnam so did most of its import of canned sardines, but Vietnam started its own sardine canning company, Ha Long Canfoco. For immigrants who left Vietnam during the height of the Vietnam War, canned sardines took on a strong association with their homeland but also difficult times. Vietnamese immigrants ended up in refugee camps waiting for passage into another country, and canned sardines were a common meal for these refugees.
Still, many of these immigrants enjoyed the taste of canned sardines in the years afterward. They took the recipe for the canned sardine bánh mì sandwich with them, passing it down to their families.

U.S. officials have for at least a month analyzed information on the Houthis’ planning for the stepped-up attacks, including their attempts to procure additional weapons needed to launch missiles at freighters, according to a readout of the intelligence obtained by POLITICO and a U.S. official familiar with the matter.
The intelligence also indicated that the group may try to attack Western forces in the region. Yet it is not clear if the recent strikes by the U.S. in Yemen have shifted the Houthis’ planning for those types of attacks.
The developments come days after President Joe Biden acknowledged that U.S.-led strikes against the group have failed to stop attacks from the militants on commercial shipping, while also vowing to continue hitting sites in Yemen to sap the Houthis’ capabilities and break their will.
Navy SEALs intercepted one weapons shipment bound for the Houthis this month in a daring nighttime raid, seizing a small boat carrying Iranian-made cruise and ballistic missile components. The mission came at a high cost: two Navy SEALs went missing while attempting to board the boat. The military called off its search for them on Sunday.
Iran has long supported the Houthis — one of a network of proxy groups across the Middle East, along with Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah — with weapons, training and funding. Fresh weapons from Iran could replace the ones the Houthis have lost in the half-dozen rounds of U.S. and allied strikes since they began on Jan. 11.
The shipments are a sign that Tehran is playing a direct role in fueling the crisis in the Red Sea, according to the U.S. official and a DOD official. They, along with others, were granted anonymity to discuss a sensitive national security issue.
The Central Intelligence Agency declined to comment.
The Houthis have framed their attacks on international shipping as a show of support for Gaza and as a way to pressure Israel to stop its bombing campaign targeting Hamas militants.
Additional attacks by the Houthis threaten to draw the U.S. even deeper into the widening Middle East conflict — something Biden has actively tried to avoid during his time in office. Biden has said the U.S. and Iran, which has long engaged in a shadow war with Israel, do not want to directly fight each other. But more Houthi strikes, especially possible attacks on Western troops, would also bring Washington and Tehran closer to a direct conflict.
Some experts believe Iran’s weapons shipments and its broader support for the Houthis is an attempt to exploit the current regional turmoil to evict U.S. troops from the Middle East.
“In addition to escalating against America in Iraq and Syria via militia groups to put pressure on America to end Israel's war against Hamas, Iran also has a more localized logic at play,” said Behnam Ben Taleblu, with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. “It is trying to create a cycle of violence that leads to the eviction of U.S. forces from the region, beginning with Iraq.”
Stopping future weapons transfers is critical for the administration as it continues to carry out strikes against the group in Yemen to degrade its ability to launch further attacks on vessels navigating the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
But intercepting Iranian weapons as they’re being shipped to Yemen is exceedingly difficult. Commando operations like the one this month are complex, involving special operators in combat boats, snipers, drones and helicopters for overwatch, as well as Navy SEALs, said a second DOD official.
“This is our specialty, really being able to operate in the maritime clandestinely, going after difficult targets with some stealth,” the second DOD official said.
For now, the Biden administration insists that it is not at war with the Houthis, despite more than a week of near daily strikes on the group’s positions in Yemen.
“We don't seek war. We don't think that we are at war. We don't want to see a regional war,” Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters on Thursday. “What we are doing with our partners is self-defense.”
The intent of the strikes — both the multinational, pre-planned strikes on Jan. 11 and the smaller-scale U.S. attacks on anti-ship missiles being prepared for launch last week — is to erode the Houthis’ will and ability to launch further attacks, U.S. officials said.
“We are taking things off the table for them,” said a second U.S. official. “The capabilities that they had on Thursday morning last week, they don’t have those anymore.”
“That’s the calculus: is this going to continue to be worth it to them?”
Iran’s support for its proxies is fueling attacks on U.S. forces and others elsewhere in the region. As of Friday, Iran-backed militia groups had attacked U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria 140 times since October, according to the Pentagon. The attacks have typically been small-scale, using a combination of drones and rockets and causing little damage to infrastructure. But on Saturday, militants in Western Iraq launched a major attack on al Asad airbase, injuring a number of U.S. personnel.
Initially after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Iran refrained from getting directly involved in the conflict. But Tehran has become bolder in recent days, launching missiles toward Iraq, Syria and Pakistan. In the latest sign that Iran is getting drawn more deeply in the conflict, Tehran accused Israel on Saturday of launching an airstrike that killed four Iranian military advisers, including the chief of intelligence in Syria for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in Damascus, Syria.
The impact of Iran’s “malign support” on the region is often underappreciated, said the first DOD official.
“It’s a persistent effort from Iran that is underestimated,” the official said.
Still, officials and experts maintain that Iran does not seek open war with the West. It’s significant that neither Iran nor Lebanese Hezbollah, a more sophisticated militant group than the Houthis also funded by Tehran, has gotten more involved in the fight in Gaza, said retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, the head of all U.S. forces in the Middle East until 2022.
Tehran’s three objectives are: preservation of the regime, destruction of Israel, and ending the U.S. presence in the region, McKenzie said.
“Based on that, they do not seek large-scale war with the United States because they know the regime would be threatened by it,” he said.
Ultimately, U.S. officials are hoping Iran will decide the Houthi attacks are no longer worth the economic cost to the region, the second U.S. official said.
“The calculation that they have to make is that they are impacting trade in their own region, commercial companies,” the official said. “Goods, services that flow to the region are being impacted by what the Houthis are doing. So at what point are countries in the region already saying enough is enough?”"

Unverified videos shared on social media show people pushing up against security officials shouting ""Dina is a murderer!""
One woman, who said her husband had been killed in mid-December 2022 in protests that would go on for months, managed to evade security and shake up the president. Local media reported that she was taken away by police but not detained.
The woman identified herself to reporters as Ruth Barcena and said her late husband, Leonardo Hancco, had been fatally shot during protests in December 2022.
""My husband was murdered here. They killed my husband, and they want me to calm down?"" Barcena shouted in the crowd.
The December 2022 protests broke out after former President Pedro Castillo was ousted and arrested while illegally trying to close Congress. His vice-president, Boluarte, was rapidly sworn in but dozens died in ensuing protests, mostly in southern Peru.
Boluarte has faced a constitutional complaint and probe on charges of ""genocide, qualified homicide and serious injuries,"" charges she denies.
Prime Minister Jorge Otarola condemned Saturday's protest as a ""lamentable"" act on X, saying it had ""put in danger the head of state's integrity and this is very serious. With violence, we all lose as a country.""
Peru's interior ministry said it would carry out investigations to identify those responsible.

As the lights came up when the screening at the Library theater ended, the audience’s thunderous applause erupted into a standing ovation while filmmakers Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie took the stage and embraced through tears.
The documentary, screening in the U.S. Documentary Competition section at Sundance, explores the intergenerational trauma from the residential school system in Canada, in which Native children were removed from their families and overseen by Catholic priests and nuns to “get the Indian out.” What ensued was years of physical and sexual abuse, births due to rape and, multiple eyewitnesses attest in the documentary, babies who were burned in an incinerator to hide the overseers’ transgressions.
Charlene Belleau, an activist who devoted her life to investigating the residential school system and who appears in the film, thanked NoiseCat and Kassie through tears of her own during the Q&A after the screening.
“When you’re sworn to confidentiality with investigations and prosecutions, you can never talk about those things,” she said. “For us to be able to allow people into our lives, to share our truth, is very special. I knew this day would come and now it’s here.”
Bell continued by paying tribute to those who lost their lives due to the abuse. “I think of the many children that were lost to the residential school, the many that have committed suicide,” she continued. “At the same time, I balance that with my little grandbaby.”
The story is a personal one for NoiseCat, who appears in the documentary alongside his father Ed Archie NoiseCat, who was born and abandoned at the school and whose background haunts him and his mother. Julian Brave NoiseCat works to find peace for his father by clarifying what happened after his birth, and it builds to a shattering emotional climax.
What sets “Sugarcane” apart is it’s not a procedural or a mystery, but very much told through a lens of empathy. The film chronicles the horrendous crimes, but is largely focused on the traumatic impact they had on the lives of those at the school and generations after.
Julian Brave NoiseCat revealed during the Q&A that Deb Holland, the U.S.’s first Native American Cabinet Secretary and Secretary of the Interior, was in the audience and is leading an inquiry into Native American boarding schools in the United States.
“This is not just a Canadian story, it is also an American story. There were twice as many schools in the United States that twice as many children were taken away to,” NoiseCat said. “And we really hope that this film is part of a broader conversation not just in Canada, but also in America about the enduring power of the indigenous communities but also the horrifying legacy of the Native American boarding schools.”
Bell, through tears, left the audience with a counter to the decades of silence that have been imposed upon the survivors and indigenous community.
“The message I want to leave with each and every one of you that’s in the audience, so that this resonates across the country, is that tonight, you tell your loved ones what you saw today. You tell them the truth, the whole truth.”
“Sugarcane” is a sales title seeking distribution.

""We recently removed a developer account that was knowingly violating our API usage policies which disallow political campaigning, or impersonating an individual without consent,"" a spokesperson for OpenAI said in a statement to Reuters.
Dean.Bot, powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT was created by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Matt Krisiloff and Jed Somers, who started a super PAC named We Deserve Better supporting Phillips, ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, the report added.
The PAC has received $1 million from billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who called it ""by far the largest investment I have ever made in someone running for office"" in a post on social media platform X.
The super PAC, had contracted with AI start-up Delphi to build the bot. OpenAI suspended Delphi's account late on Friday, noting that OpenAI's rules ban the use of its technology in political campaigns. Delphi took down Dean.Bot after the account suspension, the report added.
We Deserve Better did not immediately respond to a request for comment while Delphi could not be immediately reached for comment.
Dean.Bot, which had a disclaimer explaining that it was an AI tool, could converse with voters in real-time through a website, in an early use of an emerging technology that researchers have said could cause significant harm to elections, the Post reported.

RYPTI4S8ZW_7P2IVLGFKGN4V22,At least 27 dead in a shelling of a market in Russian-occupied Ukraine,Associated Press,"January 21, 2024 at 9:43 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/least-25-dead-shelling-market-124308422.html,"KYIV, Ukraine — Moscow-installed officials said Ukrainian shelling killed at least 27 people and wounded 25 on Sunday at a market on the outskirts of Donetsk, a Russian-occupied city in the eastern part of the country.
Among the injured in the suburb of Tekstilshchik were two children, said Denis Pushilin, the local leader.
Ukrainian officials in Kyiv did not comment on the incident, and the claims could not be independently verified by The Associated Press. Both sides have increasingly relied on longer-range attacks this winter amid largely unchanged positions on the 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line in the nearly 2-year-old war.
The artillery shells that hit the area had been fired from the area of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west, Pushilin said, adding that emergency services responded to the scene.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today’s shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine,” according to a U.N. spokesperson, adding that all such attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law.
Donetsk is one of four regions in Ukraine that Russia annexed illegally in 2022, months after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.
Russia’s Foreign Ministry also blamed Ukraine and described the strike as a “terrorist attack.”
Also on Sunday, a fire broke out at a chemical transport terminal at Russia’s Ust-Luga port following two explosions, regional officials said. Local media said the Baltic Sea port, 165 kilometers (about 100 miles) southwest of St. Petersburg, had been attacked by Ukrainian drones, causing a gas tank to explode.
The blaze was at a site run by Russia’s second-largest natural gas producer, Novatek.
In a statement to Russian media outlet RBC, the company blamed the fire on an “external influence,” saying operations at the port were paused.
Yuri Zapalatsky, the head of the Kingisepp district on the Gulf of Finland where the port is located, said there were no casualties but the area was on high alert.
News outlet Fontanka reported that two drones had been detected flying toward St. Petersburg on Sunday morning, but were redirected toward the Kingisepp district. AP could not independently verify the reports.
Russia’s Defense Ministry did not report any drone activity in the Kingisepp area in its daily briefing. It said that four Ukrainian drones had been downed in Russia’s Smolensk region, and that two more were shot down in the Oryol and Tula regions.
Russian officials previously confirmed a Ukrainian drone had been downed on the outskirts of St. Petersburg on Thursday.
In fighting on the front line, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Moscow’s forces had taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. Ukrainian forces confirmed the settlement had been occupied, but described its capture as temporary.
Ukrainian Ground Forces Command spokesman Volodymyr Fityo said Kyiv’s troops had been pulled back to reserve positions from the village, which had a population of about 45 people before the start of the war.
“That’s five houses, probably,” he was quoted as saying by Ukrainian news outlet Hromadske. “Our main goal is to save the lives of Ukraine’s defenders.”
Recent Russian attacks have tried to find gaps in Ukraine’s defenses by using large numbers of missiles and drones in an apparent effort to saturate air defense systems.
The massive barrages — more than 500 drones and missiles were fired between Dec. 29 and Jan. 2, according to officials in Kyiv — are also using up Ukraine’s weapons stockpiles."
RZ4X6AOXIT_5885TQDYAURNDBG,Whitmer says it would be ‘good’ if Biden talked about abortion more,Miranda Nazzaro,"January 22, 2024 at 12:36 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/whitmer-says-good-biden-talked-153646427.html,"Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer suggested that President Biden should talk about abortion more so people know he is a president who is “fighting” for the right to an abortion.
Asked by CBS News “Face the Nation” anchor Margaret Brennan if Biden, who is of Catholic faith, needs to talk about abortion more, Whitmer said, “I think it would be good if he did.”
“I know that one tenet of his belief system is that women and only women at — with their families and — and health care professionals are the ones who know what decision is right for them,” said Whitmer, co-chair for Biden’s reelection campaign. “And that he is fighting and going to continue to fight to make sure that that is squarely the ability … [of] an American woman to make that decision.”
Brennan then asked if Biden needs to be the messenger on that more, to which Whitmer said, “I don’t think it would hurt.”
Whitmer argued people want to know their president “is fighting” and suggested more “blunt language” could be helpful.
The topic of Biden’s discussion, or lack thereof, around abortion was sparked by Whitmer’s earlier comments in the interview where she appeared confident with Biden’s pledge to veto any national abortion ban. Brennan asked Whitmer if she believes this is a “legitimate promise” to voters, as Biden “doesn’t talk about abortion much.”
Biden is the nation’s second Catholic president in history and often attends Saturday evening mass with his family near his home in Wilmington, De., or in Washington, D.C. His faith has come into the spotlight at times when dealing with certain issues central to the Democratic Party but opposed by the Catholic Church, including abortion and transgender issues.
Conservative Catholic bishops have expressed issue with Biden’s support for abortion access, a view that sparked calls for the church not to offer him communion.
Biden has not shied away from pointing out Republican attacks on abortion, has pushed for Congress to codify Roe v. Wade and, as Whitmer referenced, pledged to veto any attempted national abortion ban. As a practicing Catholic, Biden said in June he is not “big on abortion” but believes the Roe v. Wade decision “got it right.”
In the wake of the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe. v. Wade in 2022, abortion access is widely seen by Democrats as a hot-button and key voter issue for 2024. Democrats in 2022 saw better-than-expected results in the midterms in the wake of these concerns.
Whitmer on Sunday said she believes the topic of abortion mobilized a lot of voters and a lot of those who are not traditionally Democrats to give their support to her as a governor, who has been a vocal supporter of the right to an abortion.

S0J07W5JHD_ST4ZHPXBOTUVLXZ,DeSantis Backs Down: Florida’s governor ends his presidential campaign,Max Greenwood,"January 22, 2024 at 5:15 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-backs-down-florida-governor-201555236.html,"Ron DeSantis is backing down — and getting behind former President Donald Trump.
The Florida governor, who bet everything on the Iowa caucuses and lost, ended his 2024 presidential campaign on Sunday, less than 48 hours before the New Hampshire primary, a contest that he had virtually no chance of winning.
In a video posted online just two hours before a scheduled campaign stop in Manchester, DeSantis acknowledged that he had no path forward in the race for the 2024 Republican nomination for president.
“If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome — more campaign stops, more interviews — I would do it,” DeSantis said. “But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.”
DeSantis’ decision to drop out of the presidential contest left the primary a two-candidate race between Trump and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. DeSantis, in his video, said he was endorsing Trump — releasing people who’d previously backed the governor to announce their support for the former president.
Florida lawmakers, including state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, House Speaker Paul Renner and House Speaker Designate Daniel Perez, were among those who threw their endorsements behind Trump.
“I am proud to endorse Donald J. Trump to be the next President of the United States,” Perez, R-Miami, said in a statement. “Floridians have delivered for President Trump twice before, and we will work nonstop to do so again this November.”
Florida U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, who’d previously endorsed Trump, said on the social media site X that Republicans were “one step closer to getting everyone focused on saving our country by helping Trump beat Biden.”
It was a swift about-face for DeSantis, who had ramped up his attacks on Trump in recent weeks. In his closing pitch to voters in Iowa, he said that, with Trump, “you can be the most worthless Republican in America, but if you kiss the ring, he’ll say you’re wonderful.”
DeSantis explained his reversal, saying in his video announcement that while he has had “disagreements” with the former president, Trump is “superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden.”
Trump welcomed DeSantis’ endorsement on Sunday, signaling that he is willing to put their rivalry behind them.
“With only a few days left until President Donald J. Trump’s victory in New Hampshire, we are honored by the endorsement from Governor Ron DeSantis and so many other former presidential candidates,” Trump’s campaign said in a statement. “It is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.”
When a reporter asked Sunday how DeSantis could get back in Trump’s “good graces,” the former president’s response was short: “We’ll see.”
With his White House campaign now behind him, and the state’s legislative session underway, the governor will return to Florida to finish out the final three years of his last term in the governor’s mansion. His agenda isn’t entirely clear; he spent his time on the campaign trail saying he’d already accomplished everything he’d promised to do as governor.
“He’s going to settle back into the governor’s mansion and act like it’s business as usual; like nothing happened,” said Rick Wilson, a former Republican consultant and a co-founder of the anti-Trump group, the Lincoln Project. “He won’t admit he failed.”

DeSantis had insisted all week after his second-place Iowa finish that he would not drop out, and that he had a shot to win the nomination.
“As long as I’m in the hunt, that tells me that I’m seeing a pathway,” he told reporters Friday outside an ice arena at Saint Anselm College. “The minute I don’t, I’m not just going to do this for my health.”
But there were signs before the Sunday announcement that DeSantis’ campaign was nearing the end of the line.
DeSantis’ campaign appeared directionless as Tuesday’s primary approached. He bounced back and forth between New Hampshire and South Carolina. Then he canceled two planned TV appearances on Sunday morning after saying just days earlier that he regretted not engaging with mainstream media more readily. His campaign also scheduled a last-minute stop in New Hampshire on Sunday, explaining that he’d canceled the TV interviews because he had a scheduling conflict.
He never made it to Manchester.

S20JGS30YP_7LGFRUYRM69RKTJ,Kristen Welker presses Sununu on supporting Trump in general election,Miranda Nazzaro,"January 22, 2024 at 4:57 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/kristen-welker-presses-sununu-supporting-195745476.html,"New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) on Sunday was repeatedly questioned by NBC anchor Kristen Welker over his pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee, even if it is former President Trump as a hypothetical convicted felon.
The exchange, during an NBC “Meet the Press” interview, started when Welker asked for Sununu’s reaction to Trump remarks about presidential immunity over the weekend, in which he argued any president should be allowed immunity so “that [the] president can act, and do what he feels, and what his group of advisers feel is the absolute right thing.”
Sununu said he does not agree with Trump’s presidential immunity argument and that “everybody should be concerned with that type of mentality going into the White House.”
Sununu, who has endorsed former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley’s White House bid, said earlier this month he would support the eventual Republican nominee, even if it is Trump, who could be a convicted felon. Welker on Sunday asked Sununu how he could make this sort of vow given the fact he disagrees with the former president’s argument.
“Look, at the end of the day, I think most Republicans are going to get behind the Republican nominee. I’m hoping that it’s obviously Nikki Haley. This is how bad Joe Biden is. Six months ago Trump couldn’t beat Biden,” Sununu responded, before listing off various issues facing the country.
“So this is where we’ve come, where Joe Biden is so bad that even folks would get behind Donald Trump,” he added later.
Welker then pressed Sununu again on how he could support Trump, whom the governor has previously said contributed to the Jan. 6 riots.
“And yet you’re saying that the comments by Donald Trump, everyone should be worried about that. You have said earlier that Trump’s rhetoric and actions contributed to the January 6 insurrection. How can you support someone who you believe contributed to the insurrection?” Welker asked.
Sununu appeared to avoid directly answering the question and brought the focus to New Hampshire, which will hold its first-in-the-nation primary Tuesday.
“We’re … we’re here in New Hampshire in the first nation primary. No one’s really thinking about the general election right now. If you want to beat Donald Trump, it has to happen at the ballot box,” Sununu said.
Welker then asked for a third time if Sununu would vote for Trump in the general election “despite all of these comments, despite his comments on immunity, despite what you said about the insurrection.”
Sununu did not answer the question directly, instead pointing to polling: “Well, according to the polls, most of America would. This is how — I mean, this is what you guys don’t report on. This is how bad Biden has been, this is how incompetent he’s been.”
Welker switched gears and asked the New Hampshire governor if he believes Trump would follow the Constitution if reelected in November, to which Sununu said, “My sense is if … he were in … there in a second term, you know, not a whole lot is going to happen. Because nobody’s going to be willing to work with him.”
Welker interjected and asked again, “Do you think [Trump] would follow the Constitution?”
Sununu responded, “I would hope so.”
Welker sought to clarify his comments, asking Sununu if he is “really not confident” Trump would follow the Constitution and that he’s instead just “hopeful.”
“I would say that about any president. I would hope so. I’d hope Joe Biden would, I would hope any of them would. Yes,” he answered.
A polling index maintained by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ shows Trump with an 11.1 point lead over Haley in the Granite State. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis trails far behind, polling in single digits, according to the polling index.

S2XRJNHTT4_JCOM6QL9HKP2F5J,Air quality alerts in Calgary as inversion traps smog near ground,Forecast Centre,"January 22, 2024 at 6:03 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/air-quality-alerts-calgary-inversion-210332374.html,"Even though Calgary is finally and blissfully warming up after the recent cold snap, anyone in and around the city should continue using caution outdoors as poor air quality lingers into the beginning of the week.
Folks throughout the region likely noticed the dingy haze in the air on Sunday as pollutants like smoke and vehicle exhaust hang low near the surface.
DON'T MISS: Ready for a warm-up, Canada? You’ll love next week’s forecast
Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) issued a special air quality statement for the Calgary metro area as a result of this smoggy pattern.
“Poor air quality will persist until pollutants can mix away from the surface,” ECCC said in its statement on Sunday. “This may be as late as midweek.”
People suffering from respiratory illnesses, as well as those living with chronic respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD, are vulnerable to health issues as a result of the increase in pollutants. Staying indoors or using quality masks while outside can help reduce the effects of poor air quality.
The latest forecast for Calgary reflected an Air Quality Index of 7 in and around the city, indicative of the hazardous pollution folks may breathe in. These issues are largely confined to the Calgary region—the air quality is much better up the road in Edmonton.
_DON'T MISS: Sick of winter? Look on the bright side: we’re halfway to spring!
A classic temperature inversion is to blame for Calgary’s pollution issues this weekend.
Temperatures throughout the city hovered around -11°C for most of Sunday morning. Meanwhile, weather models indicated that temperatures rapidly rose to near the freezing mark just 350-400 m above the surface.
The sharp density difference between cold air below and warm air aloft acts like a ‘ceiling’ that caps the atmosphere, trapping all that pollution close to the ground.
This pollution will remain in place until winds pick up or the inversion lifts, allowing the atmosphere to mix and ventilate the area.

Sununu, New Hampshire’s popular chief executive, endorsed Haley for the GOP nomination and has campaigned extensively with her across the Granite State. Haley needs a strong showing there after finishing third in Iowa’s Jan. 15 Republican caucus, behind former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
“Just showing a stronger performance than was in Iowa, that’s the most important piece right now and having less candidates in the race and defining it as a one-on-one race,” Sununu said in an interview on Sunday with Bloomberg Television.
New Hampshire so far presents the strongest opportunity for Haley — a former US ambassador to the UN — to upset Trump owing to the state’s more moderate electorate and the ability of undeclared voters to participate in the GOP primary.
Even so, a CNN poll released Sunday showed Trump with 50% support among likely Republican primary voters versus 39% for Haley. Both candidates have seen an increase in support since a previous survey earlier this month, when Trump had the backing of 39% of voters and Haley registered at 32%. DeSantis was at 6%, the CNN poll found.
Sununu dismissed characterizations that early contests in New Hampshire and Haley’s home state of South Carolina were make or break for her presidential bid, but said that she must notch wins in the Super Tuesday round of primaries on March 5. He said Trump has sought to frame the early primaries as must-win contests because the former president wants to end the nomination race early.
“I don’t think any of these early states are must wins for Haley,” Sununu said. “When you get to Super Tuesday, OK, now you really have to start winning states obviously. But as long as she keeps building on that momentum, I think there’s a lot of opportunity.”
Sununu has long been a staunch critic of Trump. In the Bloomberg Television interview, he cited Trump’s loss in 2020 to Joe Biden and said that the former president has hurt the Republicans’ ability to win congressional races.
“Because of that Trump brand, we’ve lost in 2018 and 2020 and 2022,” he said. “We’re just tired of that brand that just drags the rest of the Republican Party down.”
Trump has begun to look ahead to the Feb. 24 primary in South Carolina. On Saturday, in a jab at Haley, Trump was joined at a New Hampshire rally by current South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster and several state lawmakers, a day after announcing the endorsement of South Carolina US Senator Tim Scott.
Sununu criticized Scott for endorsing the former president over Haley, who appointed Scott to the chamber in 2012, when she was South Carolina governor.
“Tim Scott wouldn’t be a senator without Nikki Haley,” he said. “That’s why what he did was so disrespectful.”

S3J787VXN6_CH2JTXZOVY3VP9V,2 Stocks Down 43% and 58.5% to Buy Right Now,"Keith Noonan and Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool","January 21, 2024 at 8:40 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-down-43-58-114000004.html,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has helped push tech giants, including Microsoft and Nvidia, to new valuation highs and lifted the performance of the stock market at large. On the other hand, not every company with powerful strengths and attractive long-term opportunities in the space has rocketed to new valuation peaks.
Even though the S&P 500 index is now trading in the neighborhood of record highs, some promising players in the AI revolution are still sitting at deeply discounted levels -- and investors who back the right ones could score massive returns.
With that in mind, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors think investing in Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) and The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is a smart move while the stocks are still trading down big from their highs.
Keith Noonan (Palantir): Palantir stock has already seen some strong rebound momentum over the last year. The data software specialist's partial valuation recovery has been powered by improving business performance and excitement about the company's strengths in artificial intelligence.
On the other hand, Palantir still trades down 58.5% from the high it reached shortly after going public. For investors looking to build positions in potentially explosive AI stocks, the company's shares still trade at levels that leave the door open for very strong returns.
Palantir's revenue increased 17% year over year to reach $558 million in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the company posted roughly $72 million in net income. The performance marked Palantir's fourth consecutive quarter of profitability and was a dramatic improvement from the roughly $124 million loss it posted in the third quarter of 2022.
Palantir's overall U.S. commercial customer base has increased tenfold over the last three years. Revenue from this customer category grew 33% year over year in the third quarter to reach $116 million -- representing roughly 46% of the period's $251 million in sales to private sector customers and 21% of total revenue.
Aided by strong demand for the company's new AI tools, sales to U.S. commercial customers will soon account for the majority of its private sector business. Sales to private sector customers will also soon account for the majority of revenue, surpassing the slower-growing government customers segment.
The fastest-growing parts of Palantir's business are on track to quickly become its largest sales contributors. In turn, there's a good chance that revenue and earnings growth will proceed at a faster pace. With the company seeing its business composition shift in favorable directions while AI is still just heating up, Palantir looks poised to be a long-term winner.
Jeremy Bowman (The Trade Desk): Digital advertising has experienced a huge boom over the last decade -- driven by new platforms such as social media and video-sharing sites like YouTube -- and there's little doubt that technology will only play a greater role in advertising in the coming years.
Connected TV, or ad-driven streaming, is only starting to go mainstream as streaming services focus on their advertising tiers. Artificial intelligence is set to improve ad creation and targeting, and new platforms, like virtual reality headsets, also present a new opportunity for advertisers to find potential customers.
There's one company at the nexus of this evolving opportunity: The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is the largest independent demand-side platform (DSP) in the adtech industry, and it has a long track record of delivering excellent results. The company has achieved a customer retention rate of at least 95% for nine years, showing customers are overwhelmingly pleased with the service.
The Trade Desk is also on the cutting edge of technology in the industry. Its Unified ID 2.0 (UID2), a cookieless tracking protocol, is the leading candidate to replace third-party cookies, which Google plans to ban in the second half of 2024. It's also rolling out its new Kokai artificial intelligence platform designed to enhance campaign optimization, data-sharing, and measurement, among other features.
In addition to the potential growth in advertising and new technology, right now also looks like a great time to buy the Trade Desk because the stock is down 43% from its all-time high. And the company is still delivering rapid growth on the top and bottom lines in a difficult environment for the advertising industry. The Trade Desk stock could surge once the economy and the ad industry enter a steady recovery.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday rejected conditions presented by Hamas to end the war and release hostages that would include Israel's complete withdrawal and leaving Hamas in power in Gaza.
As Israeli planes resumed bombing Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters the Israeli leader's refusal to end the military offensive in Gaza ""means there is no chance for the return of the (Israeli) captives.""
""In exchange for the release of our hostages, Hamas demands the end of the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of all the murderers and rapists,"" Netanyahu said in a statement. ""And leaving Hamas intact.""
""I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,"" Netanyahu said.
Under a deal brokered in late November by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, more than 100 of the estimated 240 hostages taken captive to Gaza during an attack by Hamas militants on Oct. 7 were freed in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
Since then, Netanyahu has faced mounting pressure to secure the release the 136 hostages who remain in captivity.
The Hostages and Missing Persons Families Forum demanded in a statement that Netanyahu ""clearly state that we will not abandon civilians, soldiers, and others kidnapped in the October debacle.""
""We must advance the deal now,"" it said. ""If the prime minister decides to sacrifice the hostages, he should show leadership and honestly share his position with the Israeli public.""
Relatives of the hostages at a protest outside Netanyahu's residence demanded action.
""We need the government to now fix the problem that they have created and get these hostages home immediately, said Jon Polin, father of Hersh Goldberg-Polin.
Netanyahu also took a stronger line on the issue of Palestinian statehood than before.
""I will not compromise on full Israeli security control of all territory west of the Jordan River,"" he said.
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday he spoke with Netanyahu about possible solutions for creation of an independent Palestinian state, suggesting one path could involve a non-militarized government.
Netanyahu appeared on Saturday to push back against Biden's remarks about Palestinian statehood after the war against Hamas in Gaza ends as the two men do not see eye-to-eye on Palestinians having a state, a solution Biden has advocated to achieve long-term peace.
In the statement on Sunday, Netanyahu repeated that he would insist upon ""full Israeli security control over all the territory west of Jordan.""
Netanyahu said he had firmly stood up to ""international and internal pressures"" to change this position and would continue to do so.
""My insistence is what prevented for years the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have posed an existential danger to Israel,"" he said.

At least one Iraqi service member was reportedly wounded.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an Iran-backed militia group, claimed responsibility for firing the missiles that were launched from inside the country.
The attack is believed to be the largest among more than 140 incidents since mid-October, signifies a pattern of Iranian-backed militia groups targeting US forces in Iraq and Syria, ABC News reports.
The attacks are seen by some as acts of solidarity with Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, mirroring similar actions by Houthi militants in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden against commercial shipping.
Unlike previous attacks primarily using Iranian-made drones and rockets, Saturday's assault involved more powerful ballistic missiles and repesents an escalatory move, per ABC News.
Iran also backs the Houthis and have triggered retaliatory strikes from the US.
The Pentagon has labeled its strikes on Houthi missiles as ""defensive"" measures.
The Houthis rebels' attacks on Red Sea shipping sought to support a ceasefire in Gaza.
The heightened tensions between Iran-backed militias and the US in Iraq follow a US military drone strike in Baghdad on January 4, which targeted a senior leader of one such militia, the Guardian reports.
There are 2,500 US troops still stationed in Iraq, part of the ongoing mission to counter the Islamic State terror group.
Another 900 US troops are deployed to Syria to prevent a resurgence by the Islamic State, the Pentagon reports.

In an article for The Telegraph ahead of Holocaust Memorial Day on Saturday Jan 27, Sir Ephraim Mirvis says the “spurious” allegation that Israel was perpetrating a genocide in Gaza was “the ultimate demonisation of the Jewish state”.
He added that the misappropriation of the word “genocide” was an affront to the victims and the survivors of the Holocaust, and also to those of more recent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur.
“It is a term deployed not only to eradicate any notion that Israel has a responsibility to protect its citizens, but also to tear open the still gaping wound of the Holocaust, knowing that it will inflict more pain than any other accusation,” Sir Ephraim writes.
“It is a moral inversion, which undermines the memory of the worst crimes in human history.”
Sir Ephraim, who was born and educated in South Africa, cited the attempt by that country’s African National Congress government to bring a genocide case against Israel in the International Court of Justice as an example of “increasingly frequent, disingenuous misappropriation of the term”.
His warning came amid fears that some bodies were coming under pressure to cite claims of a genocide in Gaza during their commemoration of Holocaust Memorial Day next Saturday.
Last week, the Jewish Chronicle reported that an east London library’s display of books relating to the Holocaust appeared under a banner stating “say no more genocide this Holocaust Memorial Day”.
The display was removed after a local resident complained. Meanwhile, activists disrupted a speech by David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, on Saturday, accusing the Labour frontbencher and his audience of “supporting genocide” because of the party’s stance on Israel.
Sir Ephraim said: “We have watched in horror as people have rushed to invoke the crime of genocide – some within days of Oct 7. Fringe academics and their partisan cheerleaders have selectively quoted Israeli politicians to paint a picture of a country bent on annihilation.
“The enthusiastic clamour by some to declare it as something which belongs in a different moral category to the many other just wars with horrific humanitarian consequences, represents a moral failure built upon a foundation of hatred and disinformation.”
Sir Ephraim cited the legal definition of a genocide as acts committed with “intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”.
He added: “It should be obvious that if Israel’s objectives were genocidal, it could have used its military strength to level Gaza in a matter of days.
“Instead, it is placing the lives of its own soldiers at risk in its ground operations, securing humanitarian corridors and providing civilians with advance notice of its operations, even to the detriment of its military objectives.”

SBA8SMBVBV_0BI03V1N28EOT9Y,Ayodhya’s Muslims confront grief and anxiety as Ram Temple inauguration nears,"Aishwarya S Iyer, CNN","January 21, 2024 at 12:57 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ayodhya-muslims-confront-grief-anxiety-001134414.html,"Saffron flags are flying in the majority Hindu town of Ayodhya as excited locals prepare to host Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the inauguration of a new multimillion-dollar temple.
But like many of the town’s 500,000 Muslims, 65-year-old Maulana Badshah Khan says he’ll be staying at home.
He fears a repeat of the religious violence that erupted more than 30 years ago, when Hindu nationalists destroyed the Babri Masjid, a 16th century mosque, triggering riots across the country.
On Monday, Modi will officially open the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, a lavish temple built on the same site that analysts say is a monument to Hindu nationalist ambition.
Khan says he believes the celebration is a clear sign of how Muslims are becoming marginalized under the leadership of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
“The wounds of Babri Mosque’s demolition will always be there. Even if we feel despondent about voicing them,” said Khan.
“The temple holds the symbolic value of showing the Muslims their place in New India.”
More than 7,000 people have been invited to Ayodhya to attend the ceremony in person, including high-profile politicians who are flying in from across the vast country to take part. And tens of thousands of pious Hindus are thronging to the small town to place flowers and gifts inside the temple.
Amid these increasing crowds, there is apprehension among Ayodhya’s Muslims.
Azam Qadri, the 39-year-old head of a local religious body, said that those who lived through the 1992 violence fear the arrival of outsiders.
“Every time people come from outside there is trouble. One cannot afford to lose their precious belongings, savings, or identity papers anymore. It is not easy to restart your life again,” he said.
Haji Mahboob, who lost two relatives during the 1992 violence, said local Muslims are worried the emboldened crowds will chant provocative slogans against them.
“They will call for Muslims to be expelled from Ayodhya or demand a Hindu Rashtra (nation),” he said.
Mahboob said there is now a sense of hopelessness among his community.
Many Muslims believed that in 2019, when the Supreme Court granted Hindus permission to build the temple on the contested site, the controversy might come to an end, he said. But instead, emboldened Hindus began targeting even more mosques across the country, campaigning to tear those down too.
“The Hindus cannot stand us, they cannot see us, what can we do?” he said.
Modi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform the country’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but he also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India should become a land for Hindus.
Many states have passed legislation that critics say is rooted in Hindutva and discriminatory toward Muslims, including laws that make it increasingly difficult for interfaith couples to marry and banning the slaughter and transport of cows – an animal considered sacred to Hindus.
And one of Modi’s key promises to his voters was to build the Ram Temple on the desecrated mosque’s site, and he’s hoping its construction will firm his chances for a rare third election win this year.
Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, author of “The Demolition and the Verdict,” a book about the 1992 mosque demolition, said Modi’s decision to preside over Monday’s festivities is a sign of Hindu hegemony in India.
Modi’s involvement in the ceremony is indicative of how the line between the state and religion is becoming increasingly blurred, he said.
Mukhopadhyay added the sentiment among Muslims is not one of celebration. He has heard that Muslims are advising each other not to travel by train, not to drive cars alone and not to wear clothing that identifies them as Muslim.
“There is going to be immense sadness and there is also going to be tremendous fear (among India’s Muslims),” he said.
Speaking to CNN, BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said Muslims are not being marginalized in India, and that the inauguration of the Ram Mandir is a “cause for celebration.”
“In terms of Prime Minister Modi’s government’s work, initiatives, and developmental agenda, not one scheme, program, or anything, distinguishes between Indian citizens on the basis of religion, caste, region,” he said.
In the years following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, Hindu nationalists rallied to build the Ram Mandir on the site of the destroyed mosque, setting the stage for an emotional and politically charged showdown that worried Indian liberals, who feared more outbursts of sectarian violence.
That 2019 judgement that paved the way for the building of the Ram Mandir also allocated land for the town’s Muslims to build another mosque, some 25 kilometers (about 15 miles) from the Ram Mandir in a village called Dhannipur.
Mahboob, one of the petitioners who fought for the Babri mosque in the Supreme Court, said for most Muslims of Ayodhya, its construction does not hold emotional sway.
“If they built the mosque close to where Babri stood, we could have tried to convince ourselves that injustice was not happening to us. However, this land is so far away, and over that the construction has not even begun. So what do we say?”
Late last year, Arafat Shaikh – a member of the BJP – was appointed to lead the construction of the mosque. He told CNN that he had never stepped foot in Ayodhya before he took on the role.
He said the delays were due to disagreements about the design of the building but believes the new mosque will be unique as it will be the first in India with five minarets.
Amongst other ambitious plans, Shaikh says he wants additional land for educational institutions, a vegetarian kitchen, and a 21-foot-long Quran which will be painted saffron – a color closely associated with Hinduism but one that has become increasingly politicized and appropriated by the Hindu-right.
Shaikh said the color was chosen because Gharib Nawaz, a famous Sufi saint, also revered saffron.
“It will bring the two communities closer,” he said.
Right-wing Hindu nationalist organizations say the temple’s opening is a symbol of a new Hindu nation.
“The Mughals tried to change us, then the English tried to change us, but the inauguration of the Ram Temple shows the world that our Hindu traditions, practices, and beliefs are still intact. New India will see a resurrection of the Hindu civilization,” said Vinod Bansal, spokesperson of the right-wing Vishwa Hindu Parishad group.
Mahant Jairam Das, the local head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the parent organization of the BJP, said he does not believe the mosque should not be built in Ayodhya, instead claiming calls to build the structure were a “call for war.”
“Go to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, or a Muslim-dominated country. Why build a mosque like this in India?” he said.
For Hassan Ali, who was just nine when he spent two nights in a local police station trying to escape the 1992 violence, the sectarian fault lines are clearly visible.
“In 1992 there were many stories of local Hindus and Muslims helping each other. However now, there is a lot more poison that has been fed to people,” he said. “So one cannot tell anymore. One cannot tell what people have in their hearts.”

And while holding an important place in Irish culture, these natural landscapes could also be crucial to our future.
That's according to Cormac Ó hÁdhmaill, presenter of a new BBC Northern Ireland documentary on the secret life of bogs.
In his new Irish language series, Rúin na bPortach (Secrets Of The Peat), Ó hÁdhmaill visits bogs across the island of Ireland and throughout the world, exploring their role in the global ecosystem and how they have shaped Irish culture and identity.
One of the major benefits of bog lands, as the documentary explores, is that they can act as ""carbon sinks"" - sites that trap carbon out of the atmosphere and prevent it contributing to climate change.
However, damaged bogs, as 86% of them are in Northern Ireland, release their stored carbon, further contributing to climate change.
There are currently several projects across Northern Ireland to ""restore"" bogs, allowing them to once again act as a sponge for carbon in the atmosphere.
However, Ó hÁdhmaill told BBC News NI that these efforts are ""not the scale that will be needed"".
He said that bogs also slow the flow of water and that ""the government is starting to realise"" you can tackle the issue of flooding via peatlands.
""It's kind of a double whammy: preserve your bogs for the benefit of the climate, preserve your bogs also to alleviate the flooding in the future.""
Ó hÁdhmaill said that the programme doesn't just look at the issue of climate change, ""although that is probably the most important"".
""We looked at the mythology of bogs; we looked at the traditions associated with bogs; we looked at what we can learn from bogs as a storage of scientific facts and cultural artefacts from the past.
""It was an eye-opener, to be honest. We've neglected bogs for so long; bogs were something to be exploited; bogs were basically seen as sources of fuel.""
The series includes a trip to the National Museum of Ireland for a conversation about the human remains found in bogs in Ireland, and what they can tell us about ""a time before our history books began"".
It also examines the folklore and mythology surrounding bogs in Ireland.
Peatlands were long thought to be home to fairies and various superstitions developed regarding these landscapes.
""Some of our traditions have lists of prayers that you can arm yourself with against the dangers of the bog,"" said Ó hÁdhmaill
""They were difficult places, they were dangerous and places to be respected,"" he added.
And it's a respect that he is hoping we can all regain.
The first of three episodes of Rúin na bPortach will be available at 22:00 on Sunday 21 January on BBC Two Northern Ireland, and BBC iPlayer. An English language version will be broadcast on BBC Northern Ireland later this year."

The 37-year-old made history when she became the first Indigenous person to win a Golden Globe for best actress in a motion picture drama earlier this month. In a resurfaced interview with Vulture from August, Gladstone slammed ""Yellowstone"" over what the outlet described as the show's ""cowboy mythmaking.""
""Delusional! Deplorable!"" Gladstone said of the series, which was created by Taylor Sheridan and John Linson.
""No offense to the Native talent in that,"" she added. ""I auditioned several times. That’s what we had.""
‘YELLOWSTONE’ AND ‘KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON’ LEAD RESURGENCE OF WESTERN GENRE IN HOLLYWOOD
According to Vulture, Gladstone's father is of Blackfeet and Nez Perce heritage while her mother is White. In a 2017 interview with The Guardian, Gladstone shared that she lived on the Blackfeet Nation reservation in Montana until she was 11.

Gladstone starred alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro in ""Killers of the Flower Moon,"" which was directed by Martin Scorsese and based on David Grann's non-fiction book of the same name.
The actress played Mollie Kyle, an Osage Nation woman living on the tribe's reservation in Oklahoma. In the movie, her character marries World War I veteran Ernest Burkhart (DiCaprio).
Set in the 1920s, the film follows Mollie as she ""fights to survive and bring to light the spree of greed-fueled murders committed against the Osage community after oil was discovered on their land,"" per a plot synopsis.

During her interview with Vulture, Gladstone praised ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" for focusing on its Indigenous characters.
""It’s not a White savior story,"" she told the outlet. ""It’s the Osage saying, ‘Do something. Here’s money. Come help us.’""
In a November 2022 interview with The Atlantic, Sheridan slammed critics who claimed that ""Yellowstone"" was ""anti-woke.""
""They refer to it as ‘the conservative show’…‘the Republican show’ or ‘the red-state ‘Game of Thrones,’ "" he said.
Sheridan continued, ""And I just sit back laughing. I’m like, ‘Really?’ The show’s talking about the displacement of Native Americans and the way Native American women were treated…about corporate greed…the gentrification of the West, and land-grabbing. That’s a red-state show?""
The Paramount+ show, which stars Kevin Costner in the lead role of ranch owner John Dutton, will air the second half of its fifth and final season in November 2024.

The popular tourist attraction and cemetery in North London is the final resting place of around 170,000 people, many of them famous.
Highgate is planning research into which graves are occupied by figures with links to the “legacy of empire”, and to establish tours of the cemetery’s colonial links.
Plans for the 37-acre site form part of the Unlocking Highgate project backed by a £100,000 National Lottery Heritage Fund grant.
The announcement of the project comes against a backdrop of “decolonising” in the museum and heritage sector, in which institutions address their own links to empire.
Ian Dungavell, chief executive of the cemetery, told the Telegraph that “lots of people are interested in the complex legacy of empire now”, and the cemetery needs to “embrace the complexity of the past”.
The project will also aim to tell the stories of the dead from more diverse backgrounds.
Mr Dungavell said: “Overall, we’re looking at how to ensure that the diversity of those who are buried at Highgate Cemetery is reflected in the stories which are told about it, and that those stories are told in a way which reflects a variety of perspectives rather than a single incomplete narrative.”
The cemetery is the final resting place of many illustrious Britons, including George Michael, George Eliot, Douglas Adams, Michael Faraday, and the German philosopher Karl Marx, whose tomb dominates the eastern half of the site.
Also interred at the site are less well-known figures with connections to empire, including soldier Anthony Home, who earned a Victoria Cross for his service during the Indian Mutiny, colonial businessman and founder of HSBC Douglas Lapraik, the premier of New South Wales Sir Charles Cowper, and 19th-century secretary of war Viscount Cardwell.
Mr Dungavell also pointed to the grave of lion-baiter and menagerie operator George Wombwell, whose supply of exotic animals would have depended on European colonial connections in Africa and South America and would have raised questions around colonialism and links to empire.
Lottery funding will be used to support a new Head of Programmes and a Learning Officer design to consult the local community in north London and devise ways to make Highgate an “inclusive” attraction.
Highgate has found that “a lack of accessible interpretation prevents us from connecting with new communities”, and its grant-funded project will aim to solve this problem by “re-focusing stories, embedding accessibility training and inviting diverse experts to curate special tours”.
Mr Dungavell also suggested that one focus could be Claudia Jones, a socialist campaigner from Trinidad who was instrumental in founding what became the Notting Hill carnival.
Alongside the work to identify potential connection to empire on the site, and to highlight these stories, Highgate will also look to introduce LGBT-focussed tours of the cemetery following further consultation with relevant local groups.
George Michael may be an obvious focus for future tours, but the site is also the final resting place of Radclyffe Hall, whose scandalous 1928 novel, The Well of Loneliness, was about lesbianism.
Future work at Highgate will include conserving monuments, clearing trees plagued by ash dieback, and, ironically, making room for new £25,000 graves near Marx’s tomb, on ground which is particularly coveted by communists.
The former leaders in the Iraqi and South African communist parties are buried near the final resting place of the German philosopher, whose left-wing mystique could help maintain the cemetery’s income stream.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Some of the bereaved families whose loved ones were killed in a Hamas rampage at the Nova music festival joined an Israeli Jewish nature project group on Sunday for a special tree-planting event at the site.
Around 1,000 people planted about 200 seedlings in the scorched earth of the Re'im parking lot where thousands of young people were partying in the dawn hours of Oct. 7 when armed Palestinian infiltrators swept in.
According to police, 364 people were shot, bludgeoned or burned to death at the Nova festival in a stretch of tree-dotted brush near Kibbutz Reim. Another 40 people were taken hostage by Hamas back to the Gaza Strip, 5 km (2 miles) away, police said.
It was the bloodiest incident in the shock cross-border assault by the Palestinian Islamist faction, and triggered a devastating Israeli counter-offensive in Gaza.
“I still can’t believe that we are planting a tree instead of hugging our child,” Ela Bahat, whose son Dror was killed at the festival, told Reuters.
Family members wept while planting trees with the Israeli Jewish National Fund, hoping to bring new life to the scene of death and desecration.
""We buried him four days after on October 11, and this was the first day of the rest of our lives,"" Bahat's father Idan said. ""I really hope that in any way, that from upstairs they will bring some peace to earth.""

SINKWO3V6Z_0AL6YYFB0UKNUE3,Historically Speaking: What happened to Exeter’s 14 schools?,Barbara Rimkunas,"January 21, 2024 at 7:16 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/historically-speaking-happened-exeter-14-101631246.html,"At one time, in the mid-19th century, Exeter had 14 public school buildings. You won’t be able to find most of them today, but it’s an interesting exercise tracking down where they once stood.
Charles Bell, author of “The History of the Town of Exeter, New Hampshire,” tells us that there were a few early schoolteachers in town as early as the mid-1600s, although there are no clear records as to where the classes were held.
“The records of the town contain no information in regard to the earliest schools, as they were probably maintained, not at the public charge, but by the parents of the children who attended them.”
A schoolhouse was erected opposite the meeting house around 1707. Children who lived on the outskirts of town were too far away to attend classes. They would learn basic reading and arithmetic at a dame school near where they lived – generally run by someone’s busy mother.
Over time, small schoolhouses were erected all over town. The 1802 map of Exeter, by Phineas Merrill, places a small schoolhouse at the corner of Kingston and Pickpocket Road. The school has been called by many names over the years – Pickpocket School, King’s Falls District School, Haverhill Road School, Kingston Road School, and District 6 School. The state of New Hampshire required the town to create school districts in 1807. Most of Exeter was dominated by District 1, which had up to six schools clustered in the downtown village area. The little schools on the outskirts of town, Epping Road, Newmarket Road, Hampton Road, and Kingston Road, were ungraded one-room affairs.
Historically Speaking: How Exeter experienced the roaring twenties in 1923
The first account we have of the school in District 6 is a notice in the Exeter News-Letter, published in 1832. It must have been a lonely existence for the teacher in one of these small schools. They had no other adults present – unless the supervisory committee popped in for an unannounced visit – and the number of students was staggering. In 1832, the school was taught by Mr. Peavey, who seems to have been a replacement for a previous teacher loathed by the school committee.
“The appearance of this school in the hands of its present master, as compared with it under its last, was truly cheering. The committee found perfect order, a judicious classification, a full circle of studies, and such visible proficiency in them all, as fully satisfied them that the instruction given had been systematic, definite, and thorough. The attainments of the scholars, especially in arithmetic, deserve great praise.”
Mr. Peavey was teaching 46 students of varying ages in a single classroom. The following year, the number increased to 56 students. Even with the increase in student numbers, the committee could only fault Peavey in one subject, “with the exception of penmanship, of which there was but little apparent improvement.”
It’s not certain when the small building was erected, only that it existed in 1802. Students on the far side of town attended classes there for over 100 years. Several times repairs were made to the schoolhouse. Clifton Towle, in a paper presented to the Exeter Historical Society in 1938, noted it “was small, and had sharply sloping floors which were removed in 1850. Many repairs were made from 1850 to 1885 in response to such hints from the superintending school committee as in 1855, ‘Getting old and leaky. Hope the district will build a new one,’ in 1860, ‘Not large enough.’” He also noted that the building was the oldest existing schoolhouse in the town.
Exeter school reports could be brutally honest. Published for the town, they rarely held back in their assessments of the teachers.
In 1852, the Kingston Road School had two teachers: Sarah Locke taught the summer term and John Sanborn taught the winter term.
“Miss Locke’s intellectual qualifications were very good; Mr. Sanborn’s were by no means deficient. Miss Locke was gentle and at the same time firm; Mr. Sanborn, so far from being tyrannous in his exactions of obedience, was as easy as an antiquated slipper. Miss Locke was careful to keep the room neat and clean; Mr. Sanborn was content to let it go dirty.

Historically Speaking: How a portrait of a naval hero found its way back to Exeter
As time went on, the school served fewer and fewer students. By the time the district system was abandoned in 1885, there were usually under 20 children attending the Kingston Road school. Even then, it was considered far too small. However, it was maintained into the 20th century because it served the needs of the farm families who lived too far away to have their children walk to the nearest schools on Lincoln Street. It was the demise of another small school that led to the end of the Kingston Road Schoolhouse.
The school on the Plains, overlooking Park Street Commons, was considered the most miserable school to attend. It was dark, cramped and considered wholly inadequate for the needs of students who would need higher standards to attend public grammar schools or the Robinson Female Seminary. In 1902 it was decided to raze the old Plains school and build a new four-room schoolhouse at Winter Street. The new school could easily absorb the 16 or 17 students still attending the school on Kingston Road. The building itself was sold in 1912.

Jerri Lynn Isreal, 66, was arrested Saturday. She had previously been convicted of a murder charge in Florida around 1995, according to a news release from Gulfport Police.
Her arrest came days after detectives searched a home at 16th Avenue and 22nd Street in Gulfport for a missing person and found a body inside a large box, police said. Harrison County Coroner Brian Switzer identified the body Friday as John Gaither, 42, of Gulfport.
Gaither and Isreal shared the home, police said. Gaither was first reported missing Dec. 22, Gulfport police Sgt. Jason Ducre said Friday. Police first responded to the home on the evening of Dec. 22, the release said.
Detectives started to notice discrepancies in what Isreal told them, the release said. “Some stuff just didn’t add up,” Ducre said Friday. Police said Isreal had become “increasingly uncooperative.” They said she “changed her statements multiple times.”
Police searched the home with a warrant about 10 a.m. Thursday, the release said, and found Gaither’s body in a wooden box. The box was so large that police cut out part of the wall Thursday to extract it from the home, authorities said. It was filled with junk and found on the ground, as Switzer put it, “like a coffin.”
Isreal was sent to a hospital at that time for medical treatment, according to the release.
Isreal was being held Saturday at the Harrison County jail in lieu of bond.
Gaither’s full autopsy is scheduled for Monday."

MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (Reuters) - Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley and former President Donald Trump will make their closing arguments in New Hampshire on Sunday in a final stretch of campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination before voters go to the polls on Tuesday.
Time is running short for Haley, who served as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, to topple the Republican presidential frontrunner after his victory in the Iowa caucuses underscored his dominance in the primary race.
If she cannot score an upset win in New Hampshire on Tuesday, her already-narrow path to the nomination could close altogether.
Trump, who is leading Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis here, addressed a stadium full of cheering supporters in Manchester on Saturday night, encouraging them to go the polls on Tuesday, when the primary will take place.
But he also appeared to shift some of his focus to the next major nominating contest, in South Carolina in late February.
At the rally, several high-ranking state and federal officials from that state spoke on Trump's behalf, including South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster.
""They understand that I am the only candidate in this race who is going to save America and we're gonna get rid of this Biden disaster right away,"" Trump said.
""So you know what I'm doing? I'm kissing ass.""
Haley has stepped up her attacks on Trump in recent days with a late-in-the-game move to draw contrasts with a businessman and politician whose time in the White House was characterized by chaos and who faces four criminal cases, including for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election that he lost to now President Joe Biden.
Despite her shift, some Republican and independent voters say Haley should go further with her criticisms and that she has not hit her main rival hard enough throughout her campaign.
""I think Trump needs to be put in his place,"" said Chris Jay, 57, a Republican who said he was leaning toward Haley but wanted her to lob more head-on attacks at the former president.
Haley on Saturday knocked Trump, 77, for his age after he seemingly confused her with former Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. Haley also criticized Trump for his affinity for strongmen such as Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Trump, she said at a campaign event in Keene, New Hampshire on Saturday, “needs to stop praising dictators.” She said as his UN ambassador, she tried to break up his “bromance” with Putin.
Trump has upped his already fierce attacks on Haley as well, targeting her given first name on his social media platform and amplifying false posts questioning her birthright U.S. citizenship.
The daughter of two immigrants from India, Haley was bornNimarata Nikki Randhawa but has long used her middle name Nikki and later took her husband's surname.
At the Saturday night rally in Manchester, Trump attacked Haley for her support among some wealthy donors who have also supported Democrats and called her a threat to social security.
Above the stage where Trump spoke, a large screen showed messages critcizing Haley, alongside unflattering pictures of her.
""Nikki Haley is loved by Democrats, Wall Street and globalists,"" one of the images on the screen read.

The National Oil Corp. said in a terse statement that it lifted the force majeure at the Sharara oil field in the country’s south and resumed full production. It didn’t provide further details. Force majeure is a legal maneuver that releases a company from its contractual obligations because of extraordinary circumstances.
The company had activated the maneuver on Jan. 7 after protesters from the desert town of Ubari, about 950 kilometers (590 miles) south of the capital, Tripoli, shut down the field to protest fuel shortages.
Over the past two weeks the company’s chief, Farhat Bengdara, and military officials from eastern Libya have been negotiating with the protest leaders, Fezzan Group.
Barzingi al-Zarrouk, the protesters’ spokesman, announced that they have suspended their protest after they reached agreement with the company.
He said the agreement was brokered by the self-styled Libyan National Army, which is commanded by powerful military general Khalifa Hifter. Hifter’s forces control Libya’s east and much of the south.
The protesters have reportedly called for rehabilitating infrastructure and repairing roads in the southwestern region of Fezzan, one of the historic three provinces of Libya. They previously closed the field for two days in July.
Libya’s light crude has long featured in the country’s yearslong civil conflict, with rival militias and foreign powers jostling for control of Africa’s largest oil reserves.
Libya has been in turmoil since a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The North African nation has for most of the past decade been split between rival administrations in the east and the west, each backed by militias and foreign governments."

Armed gunmen hijacked a bus in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince with at least six nuns on board and drove off to an unknown destination taking all passengers hostage, Vatican News reported on Saturday, citing the Haitian Conference of Religious group.
""I have learned with sorrow of the kidnapping, in Haiti, of a group of people, including six religious sisters"", Pope Francis said after his weekly Angelus prayer.
""In my heartfelt plea for their release, I pray for social concord in the country, and I invite everyone to bring an end to the violence, which is causing a great deal of suffering to that dear population,"" he added.
Violence has been escalating for months in Haiti as gangs jockey for power and seek to put pressure on interim Prime Minister Ariel Henry, ahead of the Feb. 7 expiry of a political accord that consolidated his power.
The violence comes ahead of a court decision expected on Jan. 26 on a Kenyan-led multinational force to address gang violence in the country, one of the poorest in the Western Hemisphere.

See what they're like — from a sold-out 6-month luxury cruise to a cheaper $21,100 option.",Brittany Chang,"January 21, 2024 at 7:11 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/9-around-world-cruises-joined-101101505.html,"Nine new around-the-world cruises have already set sail in 2024.
These ships joined Royal Caribbean's nine-month Ultimate World Cruise at sea.
Oceania said its 2024 world cruise sold out in 30 minutes.
The Seven Seas just got a bit more crowded: Nine new world cruises have recently set sail, joining Royal Caribbean's ongoing Ultimate World Cruise in a quest to travel around the world in 2024.
TikTok has developed an obsession with Royal Caribbean's nine-month vacation. But it's not the only one of its kind — nor was it the most in-demand.
In 2021 and 2022, other operators also announced their global cruises, with one selling out 30 minutes after it was offered. Since the start of the new year, nine of these have already embarked. Take a look at which ones.
Oceania's 2024 world cruise was so hot that it sold out 30 minutes after reservations opened in March 2022, the premium cruise line said at the time.
After almost two years of waiting, these travelers finally set sail from Los Angeles on January 14. For the next 180 days, the Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings subsidiary says the Insignia is set to sail to 96 ports in 34 countries.
The vessel is now on its way to Hawaii, the Pacific Islands, Australia and New Zealand, Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Canada, according to its world cruise itinerary. This includes 24 expected overnight stays in destinations like Yangon, Myanmar, and Reykjavik, Iceland.
Oceania's cabins started at $48,500 per person.
On January 6, the Seven Seas Mariner departed Miami on a roundtrip 132-night global expedition. Through May 17, the ship is set to stop at 66 ports in 31 countries — sailing to expected destinations in Central America, Hawaii, the Pacific Islands, New Zealand and Australia, Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Bermuda.
Fares started at $73,500 per person for Regent Seven Seas' basic suite. Too cheap? The most luxurious 2,000-square-foot accommodation had a $200,000-per-person price tag.
Like Oceania, these fares didn't stop travelers from flocking to the luxury cruise. The ship was fully reserved in less than three hours when bookings opened in July 2021, Regent Seven Seas said at the time.
Azamara's sold-out 2024 world cruise departed on January 5 from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Over the next 155 nights, the Azamara Onward plans to stop in 40 countries across Central and South America, the Pacific islands, New Zealand and Australia, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe before concluding in Barcelona.
There are 22 overnights scheduled throughout this world tour.
The private equity-owned cruise line's 2024 global adventure started at $39,000 per person for the windowless interior cabin. Travelers who prefer to cruise in luxury would've paid $157,000 per person for the highest-end suite.
Ultra-luxury Silversea's 2024 global vacation set sail on January 15 from San Francisco. Through May 26, the Silver Shadow is scheduled to see 65 ports in 14 countries.
Unlike most world cruise itineraries, this one is scheduled to spend most of its 132 nights traversing the Pacific Ocean, sailing to the Pacific Islands, New Zealand and Australia, Southeast and East Asia, Alaska, and Canada before returning to San Francisco.
Silversea's fares started at $66,000 per person for the least expensive vista suite, cheaper than Regent Seven Seas' cruise of the same length.
On January 4, the Island Princess embarked on its 111-day world cruise from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with a second pickup scheduled in Los Angeles on Thursday. From there, travelers are expected to get to see 51 destinations in 27 countries across Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Europe, and the Americas, according to the Carnival Corp brand.
Fares started at almost $21,100 per person.
Regret not going on Princess' world cruise? There's another chance: The cruise line's second 2024 global itinerary is sailing in late April.
It seems like every major cruise giant has an ultra-luxury brand. Carnival Corp's is Seabourn — and on January 11, the Seabourn Sojourn departed Los Angeles on a 145-day, 72-port, 28-country cruise.
The sailing is set to conclude in Piraeus, Greece, near Athens, on June 5. Along the way, the itinerary shows the Seabourn Sojourn traveling east to destinations like Hawaii, Australia, China, Japan, Sri Lanka, Egypt, and Jordan.
The Sojourn is scheduled for 20 overnights in destinations like Cairns, Australia, and Honolulu.
Fares started at $74,300 per person.
Luxury operator Cunard has two 2024 ""world voyage"" itineraries: 123 nights on the Queen Mary 2 and 107 nights on the Queen Victoria.
Queen Mary 2's four-month roundtrip New York City voyage departed on January 3, sailing east to 32 ports in the UK, Europe, Africa, Australia, Asia, and the Middle East, according to its itinerary.
Eight days later, the Queen Victoria also began its 3 ½-month roundtrip Southhampton, UK journey. According to the UK-based operator, the ocean liner is set to sail west to 29 ports in Bermuda, Aruba, Central and North America, the Pacific Islands, New Zealand and Australia, Asia, Africa, and Europe.
Cunard did not immediately respond to Business Insider's inquiry about its fares.
On January 3, Holland America Line's world cruise guests would've moved onto the Zuiderdam to spend the next 127 nights circumnavigating the globe, according to the operator's itinerary.
This roundtrip Fort Lauderdale, Florida cruise is scheduled for 46 ports in the Caribbean, Central and South America, the Pacific Islands, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.
Holland America did not immediately respond to Business Insider's inquiry about the itinerary's fares.

Whilst their demands vary in general they claim that they are taking the hardest hit from environmental reforms and that they need more government subsidies to offset them.
In Romania, farmers and truckers have been clogging up main roads with their tractor and trucks for a week and a half now.
They're demanding lower taxes and fairer subsidies, but so far talks with the government have failed, and they're continuing to protest. They're also angry over the growing cost of insurance for heavy machinery.
In Berlin on Saturday, farmers were joined shoulder-to-shoulder with eco-activists.
Farmers say that they are fully supportive of environmentally friendly, genetically unmodified farming, but for that, they do need subsidies or, at least, fair prices set for their products.
But they say, the government has hesitated to implement such measures despite handing their demands to the agriculture minister Cem Özdemir.
The farmers have been on the streets since December, when the federal government agreed on a budget cancelling several decades-old farming subsidies and benefits. These could have saved farmers over 480 million euros. Later, Berlin decided to soften the plans, by making the benefit cuts gradual.
In southern France, mass protests over the past few days have forced the government to address farmers' issues. Prime Minister Gabriel Attal will meet on Monday with the president of the National Federation of Agricultural Operators' Unions or FNSEA.
Earlier, farmers vowed to block some motorways until Attal heard their demands. The FNSEA has said it will decide next week whether they will call for nation-wide action.

Romanian truckers and farmers continue to protest after talks with the government fail
The farmers say that authorities' eco-transition policies make national producers uncompetitive. Not only does it make farms unprofitable, it forces France to buy food products from countries where environmental standards are weaker they claim."

I once again came across one of my favorite subjects, HOPE:
“We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.” ~ Martin Luther King Jr.
This time, not only did I ponder hope, but the first part of the quote speaks about accepting life’s disappointments. I think back on my life, and I think I became a glass-is-half-full kind of person in spite of those disappointments.
I remember whenever I had difficulties or disappointments, including teenage angst, my mother would listen to me cry and wine. Being the ever-practical person, she would then look at me, put her hand under my chin and say, “Buck up, girl!”. Translation” “move on — quickly!” My parents actually told my brothers and me that “we play the hands we’re dealt.” We learned to deal head-on with whatever life brings and to keep moving in spite of those life bumps. We also learned that things always did get better — eventually! As I’ve mentioned before, my mother also preached, “Never give up hope, kids — it’s gotten me a long way in life.” I think somewhere between “buck up” and “never give up hope,” perhaps we learned to not be afraid of life and its disappointments.
This all makes me think about my 37 years as a social worker and addressing human services needs in this community. It can be daunting to address hunger, homelessness, childhood trauma, mental health crises, financial instability, health issues and more. I thrive on working with community partners to address these issues on a macro level. There’s never a quick solution to any of these difficult societal issues. However, we have many like-minded community partners who move together towards common good solutions. Sometimes it’s one baby step at a time or sometimes two steps back before three steps forward! As Dory says in “Finding Nemo,” just keep swimming! Just keep moving! Life is full of disappointments, but hope does not disappoint us. Let us not give up hope.
Continuing in the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. Day Observances, please note that the United Way is hosting our 4th Equity Challenge in a 21-week format with weekly email prompts Jan. 15 (MLK Jr. Day) through June 19 (Juneteenth).

Staff at Britain’s National Archives censored documents revealing how the late Queen requested that her relative’s will was kept secret, The Guardian reported.
Staff had recently withdrawn the papers, removed sections of them and then re-released them back into the public domain.
In a report written by the senior judicial official, Robert Bayne-Powell, in 1970, he described in a section removed by censors how the late Queen had “requested the solicitors for the executors to apply to seal up the will of the Princess Royal, Countess of Harewood.
“I suggest that any royal will should be sealed up if the sovereign so requests,” he added.
The Guardian reported that two years ago staff at the National Archives in Kew in south-west London had removed a file containing official discussions on royal wills between 1957 and 1970.
The file had been opened to the public in 2018 but when it was returned, sections of two documents as well as a letter had been withheld. The paper said it could see what had been censored having photographed the complete file in 2021.
The Countess of Harewood, daughter of George V and an aunt of the late Queen, died in 1965 leaving £5.6m in today’s money.
Staff at the archives also removed a letter dated June 1970 from the file in which a courtier in charge of the late Queen’s finances had told a Whitehall official that the wills of minor royals did not need to be kept private.
The courtier, Lord Tryon, told the official: “The Buckingham Palace lawyers consider that except in special circumstances (for example a will containing something which should not be made public) ‘fringe members’ of the Royal family need not have their wills sealed. This should only be for HRHs.”
This suggested that courtiers were unsure if minor royals should have their wills kept private.
The National Archives said that the documents had been removed, in consultation with the Ministry of Justice, as they contained information relating to communications with the monarch, which would be kept secret under a section of the Freedom of Information Act they said.

He hatched a plan to rob a flea market vendor he figured had a large supply of cologne he could unload for cash.
His haphazard scheme went badly awry. After Naranjo and a teenage accomplice broke into their target’s Northwest Side home, the vendor’s son, a Chicago police officer, shot and killed the younger intruder and wounded Naranjo, who was later arrested after seeking treatment.
For his role in the home invasion, Naranjo wound up with a 40-year prison sentence under Illinois’ felony murder rule, a controversial law that allows murder charges to be filed against a person committing certain felonies if someone is killed during the commission of those crimes.
But Naranjo caught a break. Halfway into his lengthy prison term, Naranjo was released in late October after being granted clemency by Gov. J.B. Pritzker.
Under changes made in the sweeping 2021 criminal justice reform bill known as the SAFE-T Act, Naranjo likely would no longer be eligible for a felony murder charge. Beyond that, Naranjo’s clemency petition highlighted issues related to the 2002 shooting detailed in a 2021 investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that pointed to problems in the case that include conflicting narratives of the fatal shooting and also questioned the fairness of Naranjo’s sentence.
The petition noted that Rafael Balbontin, the off-duty police officer who shot Naranjo and his accomplice, was later convicted of stabbing his wife to death. Balbontin was sentenced to 25 years in prison, far less than the term handed to Naranjo.
In his clemency petition, Naranjo admitted wrongdoing and expressed remorse for putting his friend, 14-year-old Juan “Johnny” Salazar, in a situation that got him killed. But Naranjo’s lawyers argued in the petition that his punishment went beyond his role in the events that led to Salazar’s death.
“Yeah, you look at the facts. They tell you it’s not fair. We see all these things. But it’s not nothing new,” Naranjo, now 47, said in an interview with the Tribune earlier this month. “But at the same time, I’m OK with it. I don’t have no bitterness, no resentment, because it was just time that I used to better myself.”
Naranjo wasn’t the only person imprisoned in a felony murder conviction to be granted clemency last year. Pritzker also granted clemency to Gerald Berry, who was serving natural life in prison after being convicted of felony murder for his role as a lookout in a 2001 home invasion that led to the shooting deaths of one of his co-conspirators as well as a man they were seeking to rob. Berry, who was 20 at the time of the crime, will now be eligible for parole after serving 27 years.
A spokesperson for Pritzker, who has aligned himself with progressives on criminal justice issues, would not discuss the governor’s position on the felony murder rule, saying only that decisions to grant clemency are decided on a case-by-case basis.
“The clemency process involves a very careful review of the individual facts of each petition and the recommendation of the Prisoner Review Board,” Pritzker spokesperson Alex Gough said in a statement. “The Governor takes this responsibility very seriously and will continue his efforts to ensure that criminal justice lives up to the principles of atonement and rehabilitation.”
Naranjo’s case highlights issues critics point to in their opposition to the felony murder rule, versions of which are on the books in many states — several of which, like Illinois, have put curbs on the charge in recent years.
Steven Drizin, the co-director for Northwestern University’s Center on Wrongful Convictions and one of Naranjo’s attorneys in his bid for clemency, said the felony murder rule results in “dozens of others who are serving murder time at 100% for crimes that shouldn’t be charged as murder.”
“And Edgar’s case is probably the most extreme case of injustice in that a third party intervened in the crime and killed his friend, his accomplice. That can’t happen anymore in Illinois,” Drizin said.
Jonathan Masur, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said one impetus for the felony murder rule is the need to provide an outlet for public outrage when someone is killed during the commission of a serious crime, even if that anger is directed at someone who played a peripheral role in the victim’s death.
Masur, whose specialties include criminal law, argues felony murder calls for punishment that is out of proportion to a person’s actual crime.
“You should be responsible for what you do and your own actions, and you shouldn’t be responsible for other actions over which you had very little control and very little involvement,” Masur said. “It just completely divorces an individual’s own culpability and moral responsibility from the punishment that they receive.”
On the other side of the argument, David Crump, a law professor at the University of Houston Law Center, said a felony murder statute is, in general, appropriate and can remove an incentive for criminal suspects to perjure themselves or minimize their role in a crime in situations where they might try to avoid responsibility for someone’s death.
“A robbery where somebody dies is not just a robbery,” Crump said. “It’s more serious.”
In his clemency petition, Naranjo said he came up with the idea to rob a man who sold cologne from a flea market where Naranjo’s family worked as food vendors.
On Oct. 4, 2002, Naranjo and Salazar drove to the vendor’s home in the 3000 block of North New England Avenue in the Montclare neighborhood. They wore bright yellow rain ponchos and face masks. Salazar carried an unloaded BB gun purchased by Naranjo.
The two forced their way inside the man’s house after his wife answered the door when Salazar knocked. The man’s wife began screaming and Naranjo told her to “shut up” while Salazar pointed the BB gun at her.
The man who Naranjo and Salazar sought to rob came to his wife’s aid, striking Naranjo with a mop wringer. His wife yelled, “They have a gun,” in Spanish.
Balbontin, a rookie police officer at the time and the couple’s son, was in the basement. Hearing the commotion, he grabbed his service gun and ran upstairs. Naranjo and Salazar ran from the home. Balbontin followed them outside and yelled, “Chicago Police, freeze,” before opening fire eight times in their direction. Salazar was shot in the back while Naranjo’s right hand was hit, the petition said.
Balbontin also accidentally shot his father, the target of the robbery, in the right shoulder.
Naranjo picked Salazar up, helped him back to their car and took off, throwing the BB gun and yellow ponchos out of the car window. He drove to an industrial area and dumped Salazar’s body on a curb.
Naranjo went to an area hospital for treatment. Staff called police, and after initially making up a story about his wounds, Naranjo eventually confessed to the attempted robbery.
In his bid for clemency, Naranjo expressed regret, mostly for Salazar’s death.
“I am constantly overcome with guilt, shame and remorse over the pain that decision caused,” Naranjo said in his petition. “I will forever live with the pain I caused. Johnny was only 14 years old; he never got to live his life. He was a good friend to me, and I should never have agreed to take him with me.”
Reached by the Tribune, Salazar’s mother declined to comment. But she told the Journal Sentinel in 2021 that Naranjo should remain incarcerated and that she couldn’t forgive him.
“We all make mistakes,” she told the newspaper. But she said her son was treated “like an animal” by Naranjo, noting that he dumped his body “instead of taking him to a hospital, or, hell, bringing him home to me.”
Chicago police, prosecutors and Balbontin offered varying narratives of the incident, according to the clemency petition, which is partly based on testimony in a lawsuit filed by Salazar’s family.
The Chicago Police Department’s former longtime spokesperson, Pat Camden, initially called Balbontin’s actions “heroic” and said both Naranjo and Salazar had guns, and that a law enforcement panel concluded that the officer was “in fear of his life.”
A prosecutor at Naranjo’s bond hearing alleged that one of the intruders “turned and pulled the trigger several times, but the gun did not fire,” according to the petition.
At a later date, Camden slightly changed the department’s narrative saying Balbontin “saw one of the two with a gun.”
Balbontin testified in his deposition for the lawsuit that he never saw either of them holding a weapon and that he could not see their hands or arms because of the yellow ponchos they were wearing. He also testified that Salazar “jerked real quick and made a furtive movement” when he told him to freeze and then opened fire.
Naranjo’s legal team contended in his clemency petition there’s no evidence to back any of these narratives. For instance, Salazar’s autopsy showed that he was shot in the back, which the legal team argued is inconsistent with Balbontin’s account in one legal proceeding about the case that the 14-year-old turned toward him and was “crouching a little.”
“This new evidence not only demonstrates that the narratives of law enforcement kept changing, but it also raises questions about the Chicago Police Department’s quick decision to clear Balbontin and find that the shooting was justified,” the clemency petition states.
In the late 2000s, the city settled the Salazar family’s lawsuit for $2.25 million.
In addition to outlining the conflicting narratives of the shooting, Naranjo’s lawyers cited two changes within the SAFE-T Act, sweeping criminal justice reforms passed by the legislature in 2021, that they believed were pertinent to their client’s case.
One of the changes prevents prosecutors from using the felony murder rule in cases where third parties, such as police officers, intervene in certain crimes and kill co-conspirators. This change was not retroactive. Naranjo’s lawyers argued in his petition that if it were, felony murder likely would not have been an option.
The other change prohibits police officers from using deadly force against suspects fleeing from their felony crimes unless officers have reason to believe that they can’t be arrested later and that they’re likely to do harm to another person.
“Neither of these circumstances existed in Edgar’s case and today, Officer Balbontin’s shooting of Salazar and Edgar would be given much greater scrutiny and likely would not have been deemed ‘justified,’” the petition states.
Additionally, Naranjo’s lawyers argued in the clemency petition that his 40-year sentence was especially unfair considering Balbontin was sentenced to 25 years in prison after being convicted in the fatal stabbing of his wife.
In January 2005, Balbontin was out to dinner with his parents when he told them he was going home to kill himself, Naranjo’s petition says. When he left the restaurant, his parents called his wife and warned her of his threat, and suggested she hide all the guns at home.
But when he got there, the petition says, Balbontin got into a dispute with his wife and stabbed her repeatedly, killing her. He also stabbed his mother-in-law in the arm when she tried to intervene, but she survived.
“Edgar should not be required to serve more time for his less serious crime of an attempted home invasion than Officer Balbontin is currently serving for his brutal and senseless murder,” Naranjo’s petition says.
Naranjo was released from prison on Oct. 31 and spent the holidays getting to know cousins and nephews he’d never met. Thanksgiving was a big family celebration, about 20 people, in a relative’s living room. On Christmas Day, he and his parents, brother, sister-in-law and a nephew had Chinese food.
Flanked by Marissa Jackson, one of his lawyers, Naranjo said he wants people to understand that the person he was in 2002 no longer exists.
“That guy passed away,” Naranjo said. “I think the 21 years of spending time and just really paying attention to myself, I think that was the goal. You know, to really understand who I was ... as a person. My goals. My identity. Trying really to find an identity and a purpose.”
That purpose, he said, is finding a way to speak up for people who are still incarcerated but would be freed if sentencing reforms, like the change to felony murder, that have been passed by state lawmakers in recent years were retroactive. Efforts toward that end in recent years have been unsuccessful in Springfield.
“I think that we need a fair system,” Naranjo said. “I want to make it known that I’m still thinking about the brothers, the acquaintances, the people that were left behind in the same situation that I am. I think about them every day.”

T4O2LPXCO1_7YZEH0I6UQSPX7Q,Glenn Quinn murder: PSNI failed to deal with threat intel,Aileen Moynagh - BBC News NI,"January 22, 2024 at 4:34 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/glenn-quinn-murder-psni-failed-130905591.html,"The brother of murdered Glenn Quinn has said a police apology for failings in how death threat intelligence was handled ""means nothing"".
Police failed to properly deal with intelligence that indicated he was under threat, an ombudsman has found.
Glenn Quinn, 47, was found beaten to death in his house in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, in January 2020.
No one has been convicted of the killing.
His family believe individuals linked to a loyalist paramilitary group - the South East Antrim Ulster Defence Association (UDA) - were responsible.
The ombudsman report has found that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) failed to warn Glenn Quinn about a threat to his life before he was murdered.
The PSNI has apologised to Mr Quinn's family.
Mr Quinn's mother, Ellen, said she is ""absolutely disgusted"" by the report's findings.
His brother Martin Quinn told BBC News NI that he feels ""angry and let down.""
""We knew it would be a difficult read and when we got into the detail of the missed opportunities and the inaction carried out by senior officers responsible for policing in Carrick, it's a disgrace,"" he said.
""It's an absolute indictment on the PSNI itself, almost to the point where the PSNI failed Glenn so much that the PSNI has Glenn's blood on their hands as well as the people that murdered him.""
The Police Ombudsman, Marie Anderson, said the PSNI received intelligence from an anonymous source on 1 January 2020, three days before Mr Quinn was found dead.
The intelligence referenced Mr Quinn's name and home address, and that he was to be shot dead at his home.
However, the ombudsman said Mr Quinn was not informed as he was not associated on police systems with the address provided in the intelligence.
""This led to the police failing to identify him as a target,"" she said.
""However, if police had visited the address it is likely that they would have been able to confirm that he lived there, which would have verified the credibility of the threat.""
Glenn's mother said it might have made a difference, but Martin said it ""definitely would have"".
""If Glenn had of contacted me and said he'd received a threat message from the police we would have immediately moved Glenn away from the danger and then sought to resolve the issue there,"" Martin said.
""But that wasn't done.
""The police didn't do it.""
She added: ""This would have led to Mr Quinn being given a threat warning notice which would have provided him with an opportunity to consider police advice in respect of appropriate precautionary measures.""
Two duty inspectors who each assessed the intelligence said that it did not constitute ""a real and immediate threat to life"", the ombudsman added.
Mrs Anderson recommended that one of the inspectors should be disciplined for this failing, and that she would have recommended the same for the second inspector but the officer retired before her investigation ended.
The ombudsman said the PSNI had decided the serving officer had no case to answer for misconduct and that they should receive additional training instead, a move that Mrs Anderson said was extremely disappointing.
""That is just rubbing salt in our wounds,"" Martin said.
""How on earth can they justify not disciplining the officer who blatantly took no action, absolutely no action and the ombudsman has identified it and the ombudsman recommended that he be disciplined, and it wasn't done?""
The Quinn family are due to meet PSNI Chief Constable Jon Boutcher on Tuesday and want this decision reviewed.
""They can't ignore it. They just can't whitewash it and push it away,"" said Martin Quinn
""This isn't a dog that was knocked down in the street.
""This was my brother.
""This was a human being. A happy go lucky, really decent guy and he was murdered for nothing, and the police could have stopped it,"" he added.
Glenn's mother said she will never give up fighting for justice.
""To the day I die I will fight for Glenn, for justice for Glenn, for justice for him and for these people to be punished for that they've done,"" she said.
Reward of £40,000 to help catch man's killers
Under-threat Quinn family refuses to leave Carrick
PSNI knew Glenn Quinn was under threat, says family
In the report, Ms Anderson noted that the police had accepted her recommendation for the introduction of formal training for police officers to make critical 'life and death' decisions in responding to suspected death threats.
""I welcome that police last month commenced this essential basic training"", said Mrs Anderson.
PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Chris Todd apologised to Mr Qunn's family and said the police accepted Mrs Anderson's findings.
He said police has ""now implemented recommendations to ensure that incidents of a similar nature do not occur again"".
""In addition, instructions have also been issued to those involved in the management of threats to reinforce the importance of ensuring that all feasible operational steps are taken to mitigate the threat and ensure a consistent approach to the assessment of threat messages. We must be a learning organisation and I take responsibility for that.""
""Policing is a human endeavour and sometimes mistakes are made. The scale and complexity of this work is exceptionally challenging. Intelligence is not an exact science and police often have to work off a partial picture,"" he added.
The family of Glenn Quinn recently offered an increased reward of £40,000 to help to find his killers on the fourth anniversary of his murder."

Tim Scott (R-S.C.) signaled Sunday he was open to serving as former President Trump’s vice presidential running mate days after he put his full endorsement behind the former chief executive in the 2024 race for the White House.
Scott — who ended his own presidential bid in November — was asked about chants for Scott to serve as Trump’s “VP” during a rally in New Hampshire on Friday when Scott formally endorsed Trump.
“The only thing I want is four more years of Donald Trump and a Republican majority in the Senate, a majority in the House and the White House, so that poor kids who are today growing up in neighborhoods like I grew up in, have a chance for a quality education. I want kids to look to their future and believe that America is their oyster,” Scott told CNN’s Dana Bash when asked on “State of the Union” if he wants to be Trump’s running mate.
“That’s what I really want,” he continued. “And if I can help achieve that through my endorsement by being on the campaign trail in my home state of South Carolina for the next four or five weeks, and then beyond, that’s the goal. If you don’t think about yourself, but think about the country first, we’ll be in good shape.”
Bash pointed out that Scott was not rejecting the idea of serving as vice president, saying, “That wasn’t a no. That door is wide open. Fair read?”
“Well, Dana, you can, you can take it any way you want,” Scott responded with a laugh. “My goal is to do one thing. It’s always going to do the same thing, make America and Americans believe in our future in the way that we do not today. Whatever that takes.”
Scott’s endorsement came days ahead of the New Hampshire primary, set to take place Tuesday.
Scott, whose campaign for president emphasized a message of hope, was first appointed to the Senate by Nikki Haley, who was governor of South Carolina at the time. The two clashed on the campaign trail, and Scott’s endorsement of Trump’s campaign is seen as a blow for Haley.
Scott, in his CNN interview, defended endorsing Trump over Haley, saying it’s important for the party to unite behind Trump. Scott also said he texted Haley several times since ending his campaign, including the day before he announced his endorsement of Trump.

T66B02GAGA_Y2WJRFX4M3KS3OM,Supreme Court will decided Trump's fate in 14th Amendment challenges | GARY COSBY JR.,"Gary Cosby Jr., Tuscaloosa News","January 21, 2024 at 7:03 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/supreme-court-decided-trumps-fate-100321069.html,"The United States Supreme Court has agreed to review a decision by the Colorado Supreme Court that removed Donald Trump from the ballot in that state due to a violation of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Maine has joined Colorado in banishing Trump from the primary ballot and other states have challenges before their courts also questioning Trump’s eligibility to hold office.
Section 3 of the amendment says “No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.”
The Supreme Court, in taking this case, will very likely render a decision that either universally qualifies Trump to run for office or universally disqualifies him. The Supreme Court’s decision, one way or the other, will be greeted with massive dissent and will have a pronounced impact on the Nov. 5 presidential election.
During his term as president, Donald Trump appointed three of the nine justices. In any normal legal matter, a judge placed in a circumstance such as this, would very likely recuse himself or herself due to the obvious conflict of interest. One of the determining factors in this case will be whether the three Trump-appointed justices recuse themselves. If they do not, it is difficult to see how anything resembling a fair and balanced decision will be reached.
A heavily biased Supreme Court is disturbing. It is distributing no matter which way the court might be loaded, conservative or liberal. The Constitution is neither. It is a document that is supposed to establish how American government works and guarantee freedom for the American people. However, the document has always been interpreted by men and women who are biased. It could not be otherwise.
More: Disinformation and propaganda pose real threat to America | GARY COSBY JR.
The case itself must necessarily turn on whether Trump participated in insurrection or, and this is potentially the most telling point, gave aid and comfort to those who did. Many of his actions, or inactions on Jan. 6, 2021, appear to have violated this amendment, and he has not stopped giving aid and comfort to those who stormed the Capitol Building even after leaving office.
Since Trump did not himself storm the Capitol building, his attorneys could argue that he did not participate in insurrection. That is a great deal like Bill Clinton’s denial that he had sex with the intern. The defense is in the semantics, or the definition, rather than in the action itself. And it is likely the concept that Trump didn’t storm the building himself that lawyers will use to argue his case before the Supreme Court. They might make a case for him not participating, but it will be more than difficult to argue that he did not give aid and comfort to those who did.
The court’s decision will do one of two things. First, they could rule that Donald Trump can be removed from primary ballots. It is quite clear that Trump fomented the insurrection, fired up a mob, released it against the Capitol, and did nothing to stop what turned into an ugly, violent clash that claimed the lives of several people and endangered many others. Everyone in America saw what he did, heard his words, and saw his complacency toward the unfolding disaster, all of which is easily classifiable as violating the 14th Amendment.
If the justices do this, they will face enormous pressure from Trump’s following, a group of devotees who have shown not the least hesitation to threaten the lives of those who oppose their leader. The resume of this group, and it is by no means a complete list, includes an attempt to “arrest” the governor of Michigan, an attempt to force a caravan of Biden supporters off a highway, death threats sent to court officials and an attack on the U.S. Capitol building.
The justices could also rule that the former president is eligible to be on ballots in all 50 states. This is the path of least resistance and the path that requires the least courage. It will appease the Trump following and put the decision in the hands of voters. This is the most likely outcome, particularly if the three Trump-appointed justices do not recuse themselves. It is also the decision that will create the least public outcry.
The language in the 14th Amendment is plain. Trump’s behavior was obvious and continues to be obvious. The problem for the court and the problem for America in general is that Trump’s threats of retribution against those who oppose him pose a danger to the peace and stability of our nation if the court rules against his challenge.
Allowing each state to determine Trump’s fate would doom any chance he has to regain the White House. Since this situation is without precedent, whatever decision the Supreme Court makes will resonate throughout the future history of the United States.

The California Dream For All Shared Appreciation loan program, which was first introduced last year and was so popular that it ran out of the $300 million set aside to help first-time homebuyers in just 11 days, has relaunched, the state announced.
Made possible by the California Housing Finance Agency, the program gives eligible individuals 20% of the home's cost to help with the down payment.
There are some changes to the program this year, however.
SUGGESTED: California home sales on the decline, prices down in LA County
This time, the program is modeled on a first-come, first-serve lottery system to better handle the thousands of applications the agency is expected to receive.
Here's how it works.
The lottery opens in April (exact date TBA), with the application website closing in May.
Between 1,700 and 2,000 hopefuls will be chosen to receive the voucher, which must be used in 60 days, Cal Matters reports.
You are eligible to apply if you've never owned a home or if you owned a home three or more years ago and sold it, according to CalHFA. You must also plan to live in the home you are buying.
Prospective homebuyers must work with state-approved lenders and must meet certain income requirements, which vary by county - but are down to 120% of area median income. Last year, it was 150%.
When the homeowner sells the house, the state will get a portion back (15% or 20% of any appreciation of the home depending on your income) and, in turn, use that money to help out the next first-time homebuyer.
SUGGESTED: These California cities will see home sales skyrocket in 2024: study
If your home hasn't grown in value but you still want to sell, you'd be responsible for paying back the original 20% loan, according to the CalHFA.
The first phase of the California Dream For All program helped 2,182 new homeowners purchase a home with 55% self-identifying as belonging to communities of color, according to the program's website.

The terminal of Russia's Novatek natural gas company caught fire in the port of Ust-Luga in Leningrad Oblast near St Petersburg, Governor Alexander Drozdenko reported on Telegram.
No casualties were reported by local authorities but other Russian media sources suggested that 150 people had to be evacuated.
Novatek is the largest independent natural gas producer in Russia. The fire was still ongoing as of 9 a.m. local time, according to Drozdenko.
The explosions in Ust-Luga were a result of a planned operation by the Security Service of Ukraine, according to an unnamed source in the agency cited by Ukrainska Pravda.
Other attacks were reported overnight on Jan. 21 in Russia's Tula, Smolensk, and Oryol oblasts, targeting infrastructure critical to the Russian military.
The Russian Defense Ministry accused Ukraine of launching multiple drone attacks and claimed that one drone was shot down over Tula, four over Smolensk, and one over Oryol.
Citing its sources in Ukraine's special services, news outlet Suspilne reported that the Shcheglovskiy Val plant in Tula, where Pantsir mobile air defense systems for the Russian military are produced, was one of the targets.
The Smolensk Aviation Plant, which produces Kh-59 cruise missiles used to frequently target Ukraine was hit in the overnight attack, Hromadske reported, citing its source in Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR).
Smolensk Oblast Governor Vasily Anokhin denied that there were casualties or property damage during the drone attack.
The plant was previously hit in October and November 2023.
A source from HUR confirmed to Ukrainska Pravda that the agency was also behind the attacks in Oryol and Tula.
Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, multiple attacks have been reported across Russian territory. Ukraine does not always claim responsibility for these attacks.
An overnight drone attack that hit an oil depot near St Petersburg was carried out by Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR), Ukrainska Pravda reported on Jan. 18, citing a source in intelligence.

In some areas, it broke a years-long snow drought that left many, especially northerners, confused.
Other states, such as Texas, got an inch of snow, something Texans seldomly see.
Freezing temperatures swept the nation – and parts of the globe – last week with snow, ice, and sleet.
Some areas of the country were finally relieved of a snow drought that had persisted for several years, ending a streak of short, dry winter days. Other states that rarely see snow got a chilly treat.
These images, both lively and picturesque, show what it looked like across the nation.
Texas
Texas rarely sees snow, but the cold front left a lake in the Dallas-Fort Worth area looking like a frosty wonderland covered in light snow. The area saw over an inch of snow during the cold front.
Washington, DC
The nation's capital saw its first snowstorm in two years to the gleeful delight of children who finally got to pull their sleds out of the garage.
New Jersey
In Paterson, New Jersey, ice blanketed portions of the 77-foot waterfall, turning it into an icy dreamland. Some disregarded warnings of the freeze to capture photos in the ice.
New York
New York City also saw its first serious snow in two years, ending a dry spell that set a record for a city which usually sees two feet of snow.
Oregon
Oregon saw freezing rain and icy conditions that caused school and airport closures along with days-long power outages. The weather conditions caused over a dozen deaths in the state and dozens more nationwide.
Alaska
In Alaska, a 20-foot-tall snowman returned from its hibernation, allowing locals to smile for pictures. An Anchorage family erected the giant snowman again in 2023 after a 10-year break. The tradition started in 2005, per the Anchorage Daily News.
Tennessee
Children took to sledding in Sevier Park in Tennessee's capital last week when temperatures dipped to as low as -1 degrees Fahrenheit, per the National Weather Service. The area saw over half a foot of snow.
Illinois
Snow and ice in the Chicago area are certainly not rare, though this year was warmer than most for areas along the Great Lakes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

“I don’t think it would hurt. I think people want to know that this is a president that is fighting,” Whitmer said on CBS’s Face the Nation. Whitmer added that using more “blunt language” would be helpful as he communicates his belief that women, not politicians, should make their own decisions.
Democrats increased abortion rights messaging after conservative justices voted to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2002. The issue remains central to the party’s efforts to sway women and more moderate voters.
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will headline an abortion rights rally in Virginia this week. Biden’s campaign said the event will “underscore what is at stake for reproductive freedom in 2024,” while communicating Biden’s “commitment to codifying the protections of Roe into law.”
Their campaign is also releasing television advertisements this week to run in battleground states marking the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Democrats are seeking to tie the issue to former President Donald Trump and his appointment of conservative Supreme Court justices that made Roe’s overturn possible.
Republican candidate Nikki Haley has suggested the idea of a ban on late-term abortions, though said that some restrictive laws would be difficult or impossible to pass through Congress.
Michigan approved a proposition to ingrain abortion access into the state constitution during the 2022 election, joining a small number of other states with such protections.

TECRMHARVE_9JCS00Z1FCYDL03,Nikki Haley Goes All in Attacking Trump’s Mental Fitness After Pelosi Flub,Peter Wade,"January 22, 2024 at 1:45 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nikki-haley-goes-attacking-trump-164549609.html,"Despite his repeated bragging that he “aced” a cognitive test while in office, many have questioned Trump’s mental fitness to be president in recent days. His opponent, former Trump cabinet member Nikki Haley, is making political hay out of his recent flub where he confused her with former House speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“Don’t be surprised if you have someone that is 80 in office, their mental stability is going to continue to decline. That’s just human nature,” the former South Carolina governor said Sunday on Face the Nation. (Trump is 77 years-old and would be 78 on inauguration day 2025). She added, “I don’t know if he was confused, I don’t know what happened, but it’s enough to send us a warning sign.”
Did @NikkiHaley ever question Donald Trump’s mental fitness when she served in his cabinet?“I called him out if he was doing something wrong,” but she says that Trump is now “just not at the same level he was at 2016. I think we're seeing some of that decline.” pic.twitter.com/D5coEaehEs
— Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) January 21, 2024
Trump during a Friday campaign speech said that “Nikki Haley” was “in charge of security” at the Capitol on Jan. 6, repeating Haley’s name four times where he almost certainly meant to say Pelosi’s. Not only did Trump confuse Haley and Pelosi, he also repeated a claim that he offered to send 10,000 troops, which has been fully debunked by the Jan. 6 committee.
“Nikki Haley, you know they, do you know they destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it. All of it, because of lots of things like Nikki Haley is in charge of security,” Trump told the rally crowd, although it’s unclear what exactly he claims Haley (or Pelosi) deleted. “We offered her 10,000 people, soldiers, National Guard, whatever they want. They turned it down. They don’t want to talk about that. These are very dishonest people.”
When Margaret Brennan incredulously asked Haley if this was the first time she ever questioned Trump’s mental fitness, Haley listed a number of his recent flubs, but she conveniently skirted around Brennan’s question about whether she questioned Trump’s cognitive abilities while she served in his cabinet.
“[Trump] claimed that Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II. I’m assuming he meant World War III,” Haley said. “He said that he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama. He says that I’m the one that kept security from the Capitol on Jan. 6. I was nowhere near the Capitol on Jan. 6.”
Trump has defended his switching Biden and Obama’s names last November by claiming he did it “sarcastically.”
“When you worked in his cabinet, did you ever question his mental fitness?” Brennan asked Haley.
“When I worked in his cabinet, I called him out if he was doing something wrong,” Haley said, dodging the question. “I would show up, I’d pick up the phone and say, ‘You can’t do this, instead you could do X, Y, or Z… but this is different. We’re seeing he’s just not at the level he was in 2016. I think we’re seeing some of that decline. But more than that, what I’ll say is, focus on the fact that no matter what it is, chaos follows him. Rightly or wrongly, chaos follows him, and America is tired.”
“Does he cause it?” Brennan interjected.
“In some cases he causes it. In some cases he doesn’t, but regardless, he’s like a magnet to it,” Haley said.
Voters have demonstrated concern for both Biden and Trump’s mental fitness, although Biden hasn’t made Trump’s cognitive abilities a campaign issue the way Trump has done to Biden. And that may be reflected in the polls. An NBC News poll from Sept. 2023 found that 74 percent of respondents had major or moderate concerns about Biden “not having the necessary mental and physical health to be president for a second term,” while only 47 percent said the same of Trump’s mental and physical health.
Trump is currently leading over Haley in New Hampshire polls by eleven points. The Granite State heads to the polls for the primary on Tuesday.

""Multiple ballistic missiles and rockets were launched by Iranian-backed militants in western Iraq targeting al-Assad Airbase,"" CENTCOM said in a social media post, which placed the time of the attack at 6:30 pm Baghdad time (1530GMT) Saturday evening.
Most of the projectiles were intercepted by the base's air defense systems but ""others impacted on the base,"" the statement said.
""A number of US personnel are undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries. At least one Iraqi service member was wounded,"" it added.
Since mid-October, there have been dozens of attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria, deployed there to fight jihadists of the Islamic State group.
Most have been claimed by ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq,"" a loose alliance of Iran-linked armed groups that oppose US support for Israel in the Gaza conflict.
The group said in a press release Saturday that it had carried out the latest attack.
The use of ballistic missiles marks an escalation in the attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria, who had previously been targeted with lower-tech rockets and drones.
Saturday's air base attack comes amid soaring tensions in the Middle East following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7.
Five members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were also killed in a strike Saturday in Damascus that Tehran blamed on Israel, threatening reprisals.
Last Monday evening, Iran itself launched a deadly strike in northern Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region, saying it had targeted a site used by ""spies of the Zionist regime (Mossad).""
Washington has on several occasions launched strikes of its own, which it has said were to impede further assaults or to prevent imminent attacks.
According to the Pentagon, dozens of US personnel have been lightly wounded in previous attacks since late October.
There are roughly 2,500 American troops in Iraq and some 900 in Syria.

TJXCYJDJZR_YWDS59LVPB4DWLZ,Understanding a week of missile strikes across Middle East,Raffi Berg - BBC News Online Middle East editor,"January 21, 2024 at 7:32 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/understanding-week-missile-strikes-across-010157139.html,"The past week has seen new rounds of violence across the Middle East, deepening fears of conflict spreading in an already unstable region.
Here is a brief guide to what has happened - and where it might lead.
On Tuesday, Iran unexpectedly carried out a missile and drone attack on Pakistani territory. Iran said it was targeting an Iranian Sunni Muslim militant group, Jaish al-Adl, that has staged attacks inside Iran. Pakistan said two children were killed and swiftly hit back, launching missiles at Pakistani ""terrorist hideouts"" on Iran's side of the border. Iran said three women, two men and four children were killed.
The flare-up has heightened tensions in a region already experiencing a multitude of crises. Although the area of the tit-for-tat strikes is far from the main theatres of fighting in the Middle East, the border is volatile and further incidents here could quickly escalate, for instance if Jaish al-Adl retaliates against Iran.
A sign of a perilous region
This week saw multiple rounds of US Navy missile strikes against the Houthi Zaidi Shia movement in Yemen, following Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a waterway crucial to world trade. The Houthis - backed by Iran - stepped up their attacks in November following the outbreak of the war in Gaza. They vowed to target ""Israeli-linked"" boats so long as Israel's offensive continued, to show solidarity with the Palestinians.
Tracking Houthi attacks in the Red Sea
Why are the Houthis attacking Red Sea ships?
Consequently all merchant shipping in the international waters has been put under threat, something considered intolerable by Western powers. The US and UK, backed by allies, launched the first air strikes against the Houthis last week to try to deter them - but the group has remained defiant.
On Monday, the Houthis hit a US vessel in the Gulf of Aden in what appeared to be their first successful attack on an American ship since their campaign began. A second was hit in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday and the Houthis have vowed to continue - raising the prospect of further US strikes and the question of whether Iran will feel forced to respond.
An increasingly intensifying years-long shadow war between arch-foes Israel and Iran ratcheted up on Monday when Iran fired missiles at what it described as headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency in Irbil in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, killing four people. Iraq - an ally of Iran and hostile to Israel - denied Mossad was there and condemned the attack.
Why did Iran launch strikes on its allies' territory?
Iran said its attack was a response to the alleged Israeli killings recently of a senior Iranian commander in Syria and two top Iran-backed militants in Lebanon - one a commander of the Shia militant movement Hezbollah and the other the deputy leader of the Palestinian group Hamas.
The Israel-Lebanese border, where Israel and Hezbollah - heavily armed and funded by Iran - have frequently traded strikes since the Hamas attack on Israel and start of the Gaza war on 7 October, is one of the most dangerous fronts in the region.
On Wednesday Israel's military chief of staff said ""the likelihood of [war in the north] happening in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past.""
At the same time as it struck in Iraq, Iran fired missiles into a rebel-held province in north-west Syria, saying it had targeted bases of the Islamic State (IS) group in retaliation for IS suicide bombings in southern Iran on 3 January which killed 94 people. IS, a Sunni jihadist group, considers Shia Muslims heretical, and Iran is the dominant Shia power in the region.
While Iran is a key ally of the Syrian government, directly striking militants in the rebel-held region is a rare step and a signal to its adversaries that Iran is prepared to act far afield.
Iran shows power with regional strikes
An air strike on the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Saturday killed 10 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five of them were senior members of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Syria and Iran blamed Israel, with Iran vowing revenge.
It follows similar strikes around Damascus earlier in the week. Israel has not commented, but has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of aerial operations in Syria involving attacks on targets it says are linked to Iran. An interception of a fighter aircraft by Syrian air defences - which has so far not happened - or deadly retaliation could ignite a new crisis in a region beset by wars.
Intense fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has continued, with the war there now in its 15th week. At least 891 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardment since last Sunday, raising the death toll there since 7 October to more than 25,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. On the Israeli side, nine soldiers were killed in the same period, bringing its combat death total to 189.
Israel intensified its offensive on the southern city of Khan Younis this week, while troops reached their furthest point south since the start of the war, the Israeli military said. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the conflict could go on until 2025, Israeli TV reported this week.
Gaza destruction 'risks lost generation of children'
Israel was also hit by a car-ramming and stabbing attack on Monday, for which police arrested two Palestinian suspects from the occupied West Bank. The attack, which was praised by Hamas, killed a woman and injured 17 other people. It was one of the first such attacks inside Israel since the start of the Gaza war, heightening anxieties among Israelis still reeling from the 7 October attacks.
Violence has also escalated in the West Bank alongside the war. Israeli air strikes there on Wednesday killed nine Palestinians, medics said. Israel said at least five of the dead were planning an imminent attack.
Missiles were fired at an air base used by US-led coalition forces in western Iraq on Saturday, injuring several US military personnel, US Central Command said. Iranian-backed militants are suspected of being behind the attack.
Bases housing US and coalition forces in Iraq and north-east Syria have been attacked dozens of times by Iranian-backed militants in recent months, drawing US retaliation. The attacks are seen as part of Iran's indirect conflict with the US, where it can strike US assets at arms length.
About 3,400 coalition personnel are in Iraq and Syria as part of efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group, which still operates in pockets in the region.
Attacks by one country into another have also been happening in other places in the Middle East this week.
Turkey carried out air strikes against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq and a US-backed Kurdish-led militia alliance in northern Syria on Monday, its defence ministry said. The latest strikes are part of a decades-long and bloody conflict between Turkey and armed Kurdish groups which Turkey, which has a large Kurdish minority, regards as terrorist organisations. One of the strikes is reported to have hit a prison holding more than 3,000 IS prisoners.
There were also rare air strikes by Jordan across its border with Syria. Ten people, including children, are reported to have been killed. It is thought to have targeted drug smugglers. Iran-backed militias in Syria have been accused by Jordan of trafficking the amphetamine Captagon into the kingdom and on to Gulf Arab states."

Check Out: 5 Ways the Middle Class Can Build Wealth Over the Next 5 Years  Learn: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000
Everyone spends money differently, so income and assets alone may not always be a good indicator of your financial class.
Experts explain how boomers can determine where, exactly, they fall between poor, middle class, upper middle class and rich.

Income plays an important part in determining your net worth and socioeconomic class, though it’s far from the only factor. Here’s an overview of the accepted average ranges of the major socioeconomic income classes to give you a baseline. However, note that net worth includes other assets, as experts explain below:
Lower class: The bottom 20% of earners with household incomes not exceeding $28,007.
Lower middle class: Those in the 20th to 40th percentile of household income, between $28,008 and $55,000.
Middle class: Those in the 40th to 60th percentile of household income, ranging from $55,001 to $89,744.
Upper middle class: Households in the 60th to 80th percentile, with incomes between $89,745 and $149,131.
Upper class: The top 20% of earners, with household incomes of $149,132 or more.
The essential method for determining your net worth, according to Derek Mazzarella, CFP with Gateway Financial Partners, is “assets minus liabilities.”
Another way to describe this, he said, is “anything you own minus what you owe.”
What you own includes basic material objects plus things such as properties, income or retirement accounts, stocks and bonds, art, jewelry, stamp or coin collections, etc., he said. Don’t forget to get current appraisals on everything, he urged.
“Anything you’d put on your insurance you’ll want to claim as an asset,” he said.
Some areas people forget to include in their assets things like old pensions, old 401(k)s from previous jobs, inheritance, CDs, annuities and rental income from investment properties, Mazzarella said.
“Sometimes you may even have a life insurance policy that has cash value that you forgot you had,” he added.
Then, of course, you want to subtract what you owe, which can include mortgage loans, car loans, personal loans, credit card debt, money owed on a business bought or sold and back taxes, to name a few.
Learn: 5 Life-Improving Things You Can Afford Once You Reach Upper Middle Class
While the number you arrive at after subtracting debts from assets will give you an idea of your class, the truth is that you may be able to live more or less richly based on where you live, Mazzarella said.
“Having money in New York is different than in Alabama,” he pointed out. “Your income might not be high for the national average but you may be well ahead for your state.”
What will matter most to boomers, since most of them are either already in retirement or approaching it, he said, is whether or not you can generate income to live comfortably in retirement.
“Net worth is more about your personal time,” he said. “Can you go on vacation without stressing about it? Can you do what you want to do? As long as you’re in that realm, that’s a better way to think about it rather than comparing yourself to peers.”
Lower class: The bottom 20% of earners with household incomes not exceeding $28,007.
Quite simply, the poor are “people that are struggling to meet basic needs, people forgoing a trip to the grocery store because they aren’t sure they have enough funds,” said Andrew Van Alstyne, CFP with Fiduciary Financial Advisors.
“That is someone in a very bad position,” he said. “The younger you are, the worse that may be, with life expectancies extending and cost of living not dropping off.”
Lower middle class: Those in the 20th to 40th percentile of household income, between $28,008 and $55,000.
Middle class: Those in the 40th to 60th percentile of household income, ranging from $55,001 to $89,744.
Upper middle class: Households in the 60th to 80th percentile, with incomes between $89,745 and $149,131.
The line between middle class and upper middle class can be very fine, Van Alstyne said.
These are both sets of people who go about their day-to-day lives similarly, Van Alstyne said. However, “The main difference between them is that the upper middle class are the ones that can afford hobbies, to travel and have more of the experiential components of life that many of us strive for in retirement.”
Both sets of boomers tend to have a good amount of retirement savings, but the upper middle class is more likely to be taking vacations and have a bit more discretionary income.
Upper class: The top 20% of earners, with household incomes of $149,132 or more.
What sets the rich apart is that they aren’t worrying about whether they can afford a vacation, Van Alstyne said, they’re deciding on where to purchase a vacation home and can vacation in exotic locations for extended periods of time.
“Making ends meet and having conversations regarding weekly, monthly and annual lifestyle impacts isn’t a concern for the rich,” he said.
The rich also rarely fully retire, Van Alstyne has found.
“They’re not getting the Rolex and their final bonus check and sent out the door,” he said. “They’re keeping a board seat or they’re the owner of the company and they’re still going to put their thumb on the scale on the operation even if they’re passing it off.”
He said rich boomers are people who, in retirement, “take their foot off the gas pedal, but they’re not stopping.”
One thing that can happen to boomers in retirement, Van Alstyne warned, is a kind of class shift based on market conditions when you start drawing down from retirement accounts. This is most likely to happen to people in the middle to upper middle classes, if the market has dipped near retirement.
For example, he said, for people who retired in 2022, which was “the first real down year” due to the COVID-19 pandemic, “if you didn’t have a proper strategy for your withdrawals, you could have had a class change just in what you had to take out in that year alone because your portfolio didn’t have time to recover.”
“You can think you’re saving the right amount,” he said, “but if it’s not in the correct bucket when you go to access it, your portfolio may not be able to recoup the losses from a down year.”
Ideally, he said, it’s important to have a large enough emergency fund set aside that isn’t tied up in other assets so you can pull money out of it to let retirement accounts recuperate some of their lost value.
While it’s easy to aspire to live a rich life, Van Alstyne said, “We need to stop assuming people are rich just because of the lifestyle they’re living and just be comfortable with where you are.”
Striving for a comfortable life may be the best goal of all.

TUZIIGDGB3_D5RGPJB9VCY5H6V,Trump Rallies In New Hampshire With Top South Carolina Republicans,Daniel Marans,"January 21, 2024 at 12:45 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-rallies-hampshire-top-south-034548846.html,"Former President Donald Trump, right, shakes hands with Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) as a group of South Carolina politicians join Trump on stage in Manchester, New Hampshire.
MANCHESTER, N.H. – Three days before a New Hampshire primary in which former President Donald Trump hopes to defeat former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, he addressed a packed rally of his supporters alongside South Carolina’s top Republican elected officials.
Trump announced the group of conservative Palmetto State politicians – Haley’s successor Gov. Henry McMaster; Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette; State House Speaker Murrell Smith; Treasurer Curtis Loftis; Attorney General Alan Wilson; and U.S. Reps. William Timmons, Joe Wilson, and Russell Fry – as evidence of Haley’s political weakness. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), a former presidential candidate, endorsed Trump on Friday, but was not present at Saturday night’s event.
“The Radical Left Democrats are supporting Nikki Haley for one reason because they know she’s very easy to beat. She’s gonna be very easy to beat. She’s them,” Trump declared before introducing the elected officials, several of whom spoke on his behalf. “That’s why I’m so proud to be joined today by an incredible group of leaders from Nikki’s home state of South Carolina where we’ll be in about three weeks.”
Trump’s effort to display dominance over Haley served a dual purpose. Since the eve of the Iowa caucuses, Trump has hammered Haley as a liberal infiltrator because of her reliance on the support of anti-Trump moderate Republicans and independents. To that end, he has made the misleading claim that Democrats are allowed to vote in New Hampshire’s Republican primary. In fact, while independents are free to vote in the state’s GOP primary without any advance preparation, registered Democrats who want to participate must have switched their registration to the Republican Party in early October.
“They want to turn liberal voters into Republicans for about two minutes while they vote and then go back to being liberal voters in the Democrat party,” he said on Saturday night. “It’s terrible.”
After repeatedly suggesting changing party affiliation was as simple as changing a band-aid, he later made clear, in passing, that he understands that any Democrats who want to vote in the Republican primary needed to have done so by Oct. 6.
Trump did not mention that South Carolina, where polling shows him with a large lead in that state’s Feb. 24 contest, does not have partisan registration of any kind. That means that people who vote consistently for Democrats are free to participate without any additional requirements.
Don’t listen to polls. Get out and vote. We need a big, big win against these terrible people.Former President Donald Trump
Of course, Trump’s show of force on Saturday night also set the stage for a strategy he is likely to employ should he either lose, or win only narrowly, in New Hampshire: Writing off the state as a liberal aberration, and encouraging his supporters to avenge him in the deeply conservative Palmetto State. Thanks to its population of Trump-skeptical moderate and libertarian voters, Trump’s polling lead over Haley in New Hampshire, while substantial, is far narrower than it is in South Carolina.
“Don’t listen to polls,” he told the Manchester crowd, warning them against seeing his lead over Haley as a sure thing. “Get out and vote. We need a big, big win against these terrible people.”
Judging by the raucous crowd of thousands assembled to see Trump in Southern New Hampshire University’s arena on Saturday night, his base of supporters in the state does not lack for enthusiasm. Event staff closed the doors to the venue an hour before Trump got on stage, saying that the fire marshal said the arena was at legal capacity. Inside the arena though, there were many empty seats.
Even as he savaged Haley with biting attacks, Trump enjoyed a jovial rapport with the crowd.
“Nikki Haley, I know her well,” he began, prompting a chorus of boos and apparently a lone cry of “bird brain” from one attendee.
“The guy’s screaming ‘bird brain.’ Only in New Hampshire does that happen!” Trump responded.
Haley was the core focus of Trump’s speech, against whom he continued to marshal a combination of attacks from the right – that she is a “globalist” who will cave to China, bankroll Ukraine, and fail to curb illegal immigration – and from the left, by hitting her for her plans to raise Social Security’s retirement age.
Trump went on an extended riff about the latter point toward the end of his speech, arguing that her position was both wrongheaded and politically stupid.
“Haley said she wants to raise the Social Security retirement age to match life expectancy, which means that she wants it to go up to about 77. Is everybody happy with that?” he asked, eliciting a loud “no” from the audience. “It’s not going to happen with us.”
Haley has actually said that she would raise the age for younger workers to account for life expectancy, not to match average life expectancy exactly.
Trump went on to outline how Haley’s stance would cost her the election, just as former Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan’s plan to privatize Medicare undermined Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential bid when Ryan was his vice presidential candidate.
“Paul Ryan’s 2011 plan to destroy Medicare – the same plan that led to Democrat ads, the most vicious ads showing Republicans wheeling granny off the cliff. Do you remember that? That was not good politics,” Trump recalled. “They lost that election.”
Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley speaks at a get-out-the-vote rally in Nashua, New Hampshire, on Saturday. She has pinned her hopes on a strong showing in the Granite State.
Trump instead implied that he could grow the economy enough by drilling for more oil – “liquid gold under our feet” – that benefit cuts would not be necessary to close Social Security’s funding gap. (There are no credible actuarial analyses that say the program’s funding gap can be addressed solely through economic growth, though it is possible to shore up its finances with revenue increases alone.)
He also blasted Haley for supposedly supporting a 23% national sales tax, based on a 2012 social media post in which she said she supported “the Fair Tax” proposal. (A select group of fiscally conservative, congressional Republicans have, for years, introduced a bill called the FairTax Act that would replace federal income, payroll, and estate taxes with a single 23% sales tax.)
“Think about that. Think. This is death – this is death for a candidate,” he said. “The world doesn’t know that. I thought I’d let you know before the election.”
Trump treated Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis mostly as an afterthought though he noted that DeSantis had also voted to raise the Social Security retirement age, and backed the 23% sales tax as a member of Congress.
“I haven’t even mentioned the name of Ron DeSanctimonious yet because I think he’s gone,” Trump said toward the beginning of his speech.
Someone in the crowd yelled out that DeSantis wears high heels. The claim is based on internet speculation that DeSantis uses lifts in his cowboy boots to make himself look taller.
Our economy didn't suck when he was our president and I was finally doing the best financially in my life.Leslie Szabunka, food service worker
“He does not wear high heels, OK! He does not wear high heels!” Trump joked with faux coyness. “All right, maybe.”
“Guy screams out, ‘He’s got a new pair of high heels,’” Trump added. “You can’t do that. It’s not polite. Don’t do that. I’ll have to admonish you.”
Trump supporters told HuffPost that they felt that the economy was better under Trump.
“Our economy didn’t suck when he was our president and I was finally doing the best financially in my life,” said Leslie Szabunka, a food service worker at a local college who was sporting a red “Trump” stocking hat.
Mahmoud Attia, manager of a Nashua pizza place, and his wife, Wesam Al-Sayed, drove up to hear Trump speak with their three boys. After waiting in line in the freezing cold for an extended time, they were not able to get in before the arena reached capacity.
Attia previously voted for Democrats, but regretted his vote for President Joe Biden and plans to rectify that with a vote for Trump this year.
Trump has a “strong personality. He knows what he’s doing,” said Attia, who immigrated from Egypt in the late 1990s. “He’s not a mess like this guy, like crooked Joe Biden.”
Asked what issues he had with Biden, Attia replied, “Economy sucks – everything is bad.”"

Removing that much snow can be more than a hassle, it can be tiring, and it some cases it can trigger health issues.
Yellow object over Edgewater not sun, but it was fun
“We see not only back injuries from the strain especially with heavy snow but we see a lot of people slipping and falling,” said Cleveland Clinic Emergency Medicine Physician Christopher Bazzoli, MD.
Research from the American Heart Association shows that strenuous activity, like shoveling snow, can actually put some people at risk for having a heart attack.
“Your body is burning a lot of extra energy just staying warm, then we put on more layers and that makes physical activity more difficult and more bulky,” Bazzoli said. “And now we’re shoveling snow, especially if it’s a wet snow, very heavy.”
Winter weather heat safety tips: What to know
The Cleveland Clinic recommends that if you experience any shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or chest pains you should take a break. And if it’s serious call 911.
One resident in Cleveland Heights said he received well over a foot of snow. Which gave him plenty to shovel out.
“I did it last night for about three hours, and just came out to touch it up,” Eric Brown said. “Finished it off today. A couple of hours and then we’ll be done.”
He suggests folks keep it simple and safe.
“I say pace yourself,” Brown said. “You know, everybody knows what you can do if you if you don’t work out, if you don’t run, if you don’t do anything like that, don’t come out and shovel for 5 hours like I did.”

TY6XAUXR1O_W5BZCWDHK6EHLFU,Innovative project 20 years in the making allows Venice to rise above floods — but experts worry it won’t withstand a new adversary,Tina Deines,"January 21, 2024 at 11:00 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/innovative-project-20-years-making-140000829.html,"Regular high tides in Venice, Italy, have flooded the city for centuries. Now, MOSE, a system of 78 hinged steel floodgates along the seafloor, is offering protection, but experts question whether it can stand up to a warming planet, as the Economist reports.
After nearly two decades of construction, MOSE — known formally as the Experimental Electromechanical Module — is now in operation. Its system of floodgates runs for about a mile along the seafloor beneath the three inlets to the Venetian lagoon, per the Economist. When high tide rolls in, machines compress air that is blasted into the floodgates. Seawater is forced out, and the floodgates rise. This creates a barrier that keeps the city dry until the tide retreats.
That’s not to say that the system doesn’t come with challenges. First off, it’s expensive — each raising of the barrier costs about €150,000 (around $165,000 as of mid-January). Plus, the barrier disrupts water traffic, which can cost maritime workers like fishermen money.
According to geologist Luigi Tosi, sealing the lagoon off too often could also result in water that is “first a bathtub, then a sewer,” per the Economist. That’s because most of Venice’s sewage runs into the city’s canal system.
Plus, it may not be able to keep up with the rising sea levels that accompany a heating planet. In fact, some researchers are predicting a water level rise between 32 and 110 centimeters (about 13 to 43 inches) in the lagoon by 2100, the Economist reports. Not to mention that the city itself is sinking because of the extraction of groundwater.
That’s why experts say the system must be updated to contend with these environmental changes. Tosi is a proponent of pumping seawater underground to actually raise the city back up, reports the Economist.
Though it comes with obstacles, MOSE offers a unique solution to flooding that could be applied in certain other flood-prone areas across the globe as the planet continues to warm.
In the United States alone, 40% of the population lives in coastal areas, and more than $1 trillion worth of property is located within 700 feet of the coast, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports. People and properties situated near the ocean may be at greater risk for the extreme weather events that come with a heating planet, including hurricanes, rising sea levels, and high tide flooding like that in Venice.
It’s not just coastal communities at risk of flooding, however. Heavy rain around Milan caused major flooding in the city in late 2023. Meanwhile, Venice survived the same storm system thanks to MOSE.
Of course, MOSE isn’t the only innovative solution to flooding.
A team in Vancouver, Canada, is hoping to revamp the city’s waterfront area to take advantage of floodwaters. The plan includes vertical extensions of flood-adaptive townhouses with community terraces and mid-rise buildings with public spaces that allow for flooding without permanent damage, as well as “floating habitat islands” and mixed-use spaces on stilts.

TYVKXIMGQ8_XHNGTM4GYSCS3B6,Senegal presidential candidate list excludes opposition leader Sonko,MALICK BA,"January 22, 2024 at 3:27 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/senegal-presidential-candidate-list-excludes-022002136.html,"Senegal's Constitutional Council on Saturday published a final list of 20 candidates for the February 25 presidential election that excludes jailed opposition leader Ousmane Sonko and Karim Wade, the son of former president Abdoulaye Wade.
Those listed include Prime Minister Amadou Ba, chosen by President Macky Sall as his successor after Sall announced in July that he would not seek a third term.
Also named were former prime ministers and rivals Idrissa Seck and Mahammed Boun Abdallah Dionne, the ex-mayor of Dakar Khalifa Sall and Bassirou Diomaye Diakhar Faye, presented as a substitute candidate for Sonko.
Faye, 43, a member of Sonko's dissolved party, is also detained but has not yet been tried.
He has been in prison since April 2023 for ""contempt of court"" and ""defamation against a corporate body"" over a Facebook post.
Sonko, who came third in the 2019 presidential election, has been at the centre of a bitter stand-off with the state that has lasted more than two years and sparked often deadly unrest.
The 49-year-old opposition figure has generated a passionate following among Senegal's disaffected youth, striking a chord with his pan-Africanist rhetoric and tough stance on former colonial power France.
The Constitutional Council rejected Sonko's candidacy due to his six-month suspended sentence for defamation, which was upheld by the Supreme Court on January 4.
He had also been handed a hefty fine for defamation and insults against Tourism Minister Mame Mbaye Niang.
- Crowded field -
In other legal cases, Sonko was sentenced in June to two years for morally corrupting a young person and has been jailed since the end of July on other charges, including calling for insurrection, conspiracy with terrorist groups, and endangering state security.
He has denied the charges, saying they are intended to prevent him from running in February's election, which the government rejects.
The published list of candidates also includes two women, gynaecologist Rose Wardini and entrepreneur Anta Babacar Ngom.
It is the first time Senegal has organised a presidential election with so many candidates, constitutional lawyer Babacar Gueye told AFP. Five candidates stood at the last contest in 2019.
Karim Wade, who served as a minister when his father was in power, was ruled ""inadmissible"" because of his dual French and Senegalese nationality, according to the Constitutional Council.
He denounced the move Sunday on X, formerly Twitter, calling the decision ""scandalous"" and a ""blatant attack on democracy"".
The 25 deputies in Wade's party called for a parliamentary inquiry into the circumstances in which certain candidates had been excluded, in particular Wade, in a statement sent to AFP.
According to the constitution, presidential candidates ""must be exclusively of Senegalese nationality"" and aged between 35 and 75 on election day.
Wade, who was born in France to a Senegalese father and a mother of French origin, had presented documents showing he has renounced his French nationality.
But the council rejected them, saying the decree confirming his loss of French nationality was ""not retroactive"" and his sworn declaration was ""inexact"" at the time of its filing.
With just a month to go, there is total uncertainly as to the outcome of the two-round election, Senegal's first without the participation of the outgoing president.
Sall, elected president in 2012 for seven years and re-elected in 2019, declared in July that he would not stand again.

U13HOU96I1_14DQ4ZT0G8Y8AB3,"DeSantis suspends presidential campaign, endorses Trump","Emily L. Mahoney, Jay Cridlin, Tampa Bay Times","Updated January 22, 2024 at 11:10 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-suspends-presidential-campaign-201300872.html,"Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that he is dropping out of the presidential race Sunday, ending the long-held ambitions of the man whom his backers previously deemed “America’s Governor” and who had positioned himself as the torchbearer for the next generation of Republican leadership.
DeSantis made the announcement in a video posted to the social media site X just before 3 p.m.
“Following our second-place finish in Iowa, we’ve prayed and deliberated on the way forward. If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome ... I would do it,” he said. “But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am, today, suspending my campaign.”
In the video, DeSantis threw his support behind former President Donald Trump, despite ramping up his attacks against Trump on the campaign trail.
“While I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,” DeSantis said. “I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that (former South Carolina Gov.) Nikki Haley represents.”
The move suggests his team saw no viable path forward after placing a distant second behind Trump in the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 15, a state on which DeSantis had staked his campaign.
It was an unceremonious end to a campaign that previously had soaring expectations following DeSantis’ landslide 2022 reelection victory, a win that prompted many observers to predict that DeSantis could be the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination. Some early polls in late 2022 and early 2023 showed DeSantis leading Trump, in some cases by double digits.
But the reality was quite different.
Even after DeSantis’ campaign and supportive super PACs spent more than $100 million — including money spent to promote DeSantis in states that will now vote after he has dropped out — Florida’s governor could not pry Republican primary voters from Trump.
DeSantis was not expected to fare well in New Hampshire’s primary on Tuesday. DeSantis had consistently fallen into fourth place in that state in publicly available polls, behind Trump, Haley and ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, before the latter dropped out.
DeSantis’ departure highlights how difficult the path may be for Haley in trying to loosen Trump’s grip on the party, even as the former president faces unprecedented criminal indictments.
Haley was stumping in Seabrook, New Hampshire, on Sunday when she learned DeSantis had dropped out. Haley and DeSantis had been locked in a political brawl for months as it became clear they were in a heated battle for second place.
”I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race, he’s been a good governor, and we wish him well,” Haley said to the voters at her event, according to a video posted to social media. ”Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left,” she said to cheers.
In a statement, Trump’s campaign bashed Haley and called for “all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat Crooked Joe Biden and end his disastrous presidency.” Speaking at his campaign’s Manchester, New Hampshire, office, Trump on Sunday told reporters that his favorite nickname for DeSantis, “Ron DeSanctimonious,” was “officially retired.”
Less than 24 hours before he dropped out, DeSantis had packed a town hall in Lexington, South Carolina — his third Palmetto State stop of the day — where he reiterated his stance that he would not accept the role of Trump’s vice president. He also addressed the prospect of endorsing the former president.
“(Trump) expects everyone to endorse him,” DeSantis told supporters. “And if you don’t, you could be the most conservative, successful elected official in America, and he will trash you.”
Within hours of DeSantis’ campaign suspension, several state lawmakers who had endorsed DeSantis for president announced they were switching their support to Trump.
“Nobody will work harder than I will in making sure we return President Donald J. Trump to the White House,” state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia posted on X, days after he’d flown to frigid Iowa to campaign for DeSantis. “Let’s gooooooo!!!!”
Just earlier in the day on Sunday, DeSantis’ campaign sent out a text to supporters asking them to “make your voice heard with Ron DeSantis.” And DeSantis had several events lined up in New Hampshire leading up to Tuesday’s primary, as well as Sunday appearances on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and CNN’s “State of the Union.”
When he pulled out of those interviews Saturday evening, spokesperson Bryan Griffin posted on X that it was because of “a scheduling issue” and that DeSantis would be traveling to New Hampshire Sunday morning for “public events scheduled Sunday evening through Tuesday.”
Once news broke that DeSantis was suspending his campaign, Griffin wrote that his Saturday post was true at the time, and that DeSantis’ decision “was made today after rerouted travel to Florida to make it at home with family.”
While his bid for president may be over, DeSantis will still be the chief executive of Florida through 2026. What was less clear, though, is how DeSantis’ once-enormous clout in Tallahassee could be impacted by this loss in the national arena.
“His ridiculous obsession with the presidency has had real consequences here, from his refusal to address our property insurance and affordability crises to the effects of his made-up culture wars,” said Nikki Fried, the chairperson of the Florida Democratic Party. “His lack of people skills and political instincts — not to mention complete inability to surround himself with a competent team — finally brought him to the most predictable place we could imagine: a whimper of an ending almost as embarrassing as his failure to launch in May.”
At his final campaign stop Saturday night, DeSantis took questions from the audience for about an hour before shaking hands and posing for photos with supporters near the stage. He left with a wave, saying “thank you” as Fleetwood Mac’s “Don’t Stop” played overhead.
Times/Herald Tallahassee bureau reporter Romy Ellenbogen contributed to this report.

Donald Trump looks to knock out Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis,"David Jackson, USA TODAY","Updated January 22, 2024 at 6:56 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/hampshire-death-knell-donald-trump-191706587.html,"MANCHESTER, N.H. - Former President Donald Trump is looking for a Republican campaign knockout punch.
Former United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley is trying to keep her 2024 campaign alive - something Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was unable to do during the New Hampshire campaign.
Given the stakes, the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday will be a big turning point in the Republican presidential race.
And perhaps end it altogether.
""We have to win by a lot,"" Trump told backers Saturday in a chilly hockey arena in Manchester, later adding: ""Now's the time for the Republican Party to unify.""
The night before, in Concord, Trump said of the New Hampshire primary: ""This could end it.""
DeSantis accommodated Trump early, announcing Sunday he was suspending his campaign and endorsing the former president.
This despite the fact that Trump faces up to four criminal trials in months ahead, that he is in the middle of a civil damages trial in which he is accused of sexual abuse, and that he's made shaky statements on the stump, including mixing up Haley and former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Haley, the former South Carolina governor, has surged in New Hampshire polls and put herself in position for a possible upset.
After finishing third in Iowa, is banking on a unique feature of the New Hampshire primary: Independents can vote in party primaries.
While Haley is pursuing these independent voters, Trump remains the favorite in New Hampshire. As of Sunday, the average of polls compiled by the Real Clear Politics website puts Trump at 50.3%, Haley at 35.3%, and DeSantis at 6.3%.
Haley and her supporters, including New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, said that even a strong second place will propel her into her home state primary in South Carolina on Feb. 24.
At the present time, Trump also enjoys a huge lead in South Carolina.
Haley has said little about Trump's legal troubles, preferring instead to emphasize his political baggage.
All the ""drama"" surrounding Trump would make him unelectable in a fall race against President Joe Biden, Haley has said. She holds Trump responsible for Republican election reversals in 2018, 2020 and 2022.
""The problem with Joe Biden and Donald Trump is we've seen they take all of politics personal,"" Haley told Fox News. ""That's what's gotten us into this situation with the country where we are, where it's divided and it's toxic.""
Coming off a convincing win in the Iowa caucuses last week, Trump has repeatedly said he would pressure rivals to get out of the race if he takes a ""big vote"" in New Hampshire.
While Trump has spent most of the campaign going after DeSantis, he has recently intensified his attacks on Haley as she displaced the Florida governor as the biggest electoral threat to the former president.
The Trump attacks have been called racist, toxic and in some cases just plain strange.
During his rally in Concord, Trump confused Haley with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when discussing Trump supporters' attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
Trump has also made references to Haley's Indian heritage. He has repeatedly mangled Haley's given first name − Nimarata − as “Nimbra."" He has re-posted a ""birther"" hit piece questioning whether Haley is eligible for the presidency (she is, having been born in the United States).
Haley said Trump's attacks show he is ""scared"" of her rise in the nomination race.
In addition to asking for votes, Trump is defending himself against many legal accusations by claiming that accusers are using the legal system to play politics.
Trump's future trials include two cases in which he is accused of trying to steal the 2020 election, triggering the violence of Jan. 6, 2021.
The New Hampshire primary is taking place in the middle of a civil defamation trial in which Trump is accused of sexual assault.
Writer E. Jean Carroll testified that Trump lied about her and about he assaulted her in a department store in the 1990s.
On two days last week, Trump attended the Carroll trial in the morning and then flew to New Hampshire for campaign rallies in the evening.
The former president may testify in the Carroll trial as soon as Monday, the day before the New Hampshire primary.
Throughout the campaign, Trump has claimed that the indictments are politically motivated. Polls indicate that many Republicans agree with him, while moderates and independent voters are more concerned about Trump's behavior.
DeSantis, the governor of Florida, had insisted he was in the race to stay − right before announcing by video Sunday that he was withdrawing.
It wasn't a total shock. Since finishing a distant second in Iowa, DeSantis has split his campaign time between New Hampshire and South Carolina, for some reason.
DeSantis was in single digits in New Hampshire polling and canceled a pair of national television interviews on Sunday, ratcheting up questions about his political future.
All this after saying he planned to live up to the New Hampshire state slogan.
""‘Live free or die’ is the motto I have led by in Florida, and it’s the mindset I’ll bring to the White House as president,"" DeSantis said on the social media site X (formerly Twitter).
As they head to the polls Tuesday, New Hampshire voters have been known to deliver surprises, a quality that Haley is counting on.
In the Democratic primary of 2008, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama was coming off a big win in Iowa and was heavily favored to defeat New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Clinton won.
In 2000, Arizona Sen. John McCain defeated Republican frontrunner George W. Bush in New Hampshire, a surprise blowout fueled by the kinds of independent voters being wooed by Haley.
Many New Hampshire Republicans forecast a Trump win after a relatively lifeless campaign conducted recently in cold January weather.
""There's low energy around the whole race,"" said Fergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party who is backing Haley.
One reason, he said, is the sense that New Hampshire and the rest of the country are headed ""for something nobody wants: A rematch between Biden and Trump.""
Nationwide, many Republicans said Haley will need at least a very close loss in New Hampshire in order to be competitive down the line.
""If Trump beat her in New Hampshire by a very narrow margin − say 1 point − she might be able to make a last stand in South Carolina,' said Liz Mair, a Republican political strategist who opposes Trump.
The problem, she said, is that ""Trump is extremely popular in South Carolina, so she needs a lot of momentum going into the state. It’s hard to see how she gets that without a win"" in New Hampshire.
Trump backers who saw him in Manchester expressed total confidence, though they said Haley and/or DeSantis will stay in the race for a while if anti-Trump activists keep giving them money.
Roger Sylvester, 71, a retired farmer from Clarksville, N.H., said that, one way or another, a big New Hampshire win would be eventually fatal to any stop-Trump effort.
""It'll be the beginning of the death knell,"" he said.

UABZGA5C39_A6884MPIGR3VES9,Larry Sabato: Haley attacks on Trump ‘too little too late’,Filip Timotija,"January 21, 2024 at 1:23 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/larry-sabato-haley-attacks-trump-042316702.html,"Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said that former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley’s (R) attacks on former President Trump came too late for it to potentially make a difference in the GOP primary.
During his appearance on CNN Saturday night, Sabato said that Haley’s diggs against Trump were long overdue and noted that the only other candidate in the Republican field who took on Trump directly was former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who dropped out of the race two weeks ago.
“It is definitely too little too late,” Sabato said, referencing Haley’s recent digs at Trump, including her questioning Trump’s mental fitness when he appeared to mix her up with former House Speaker Nanci Pelosi (D-Calif.) when talking about the Jan. 6 attack during a rally Friday.
“Chris Christie is the only Republican candidate running for president, no longer running now, but in the campaign, he was the only one who really took out after Trump,” Sabato said.
He noted that even with Christie’s approach, all other Republican candidates, including Haley, have a difficult job distinguishing themselves from the former president while still being able to gather enough support to secure the party’s nomination.
“Of course, he’s no longer in the campaign, which tells you the very difficult situation that all of these candidates, including Nikki Haley, found themselves in,” Sabato said. “This is the MAGA party. This is the Donald Trump party and so to get the nomination against Donald Trump, you have to somehow convince people that Trump is no longer up to the job or can’t win in November, but not offended so much that they won’t vote for you. And it’s a near impossibility.”
Sabato’s analysis comes after Trump won the Iowa Caucuses by over 50 points and is bringing that momentum to New Hampshire, where he is looking to win the first-in-the-nation primary on Jan. 23.
The editor-in-chief of the “Crystal Ball,” a nonpartisan political analysis newsletter, cautioned that New Hampshire is “different” and that it might be one place where Haley, who has slowly climbed up in the polls, might be able to pull “an upset” victory.
“We know New Hampshire is very different,” Sabato said. “It’s the one place where someone like Haley might be able to pull an upset —might — but it isn’t looking like it yet,” he added.
Trump is currently leading in the Granite State with 46.7 percent, outpacing second-placed Haley by 11.4 percent. The former South Carolina governor has 35.3 percent, far ahead of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) who is at 5.8 percent, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ aggregate of polls.
“There are times when they [New Hampshire voters] will shock everybody, you never know for sure until you see the votes coming in there,” Sabato concluded.

MANCHESTER, N.H. (NEXSTAR) – Manchester is home to New Hampshire’s well-known political institute and to get questions answered ahead of Tuesday’s first in the nation primary, we heard from an expert in the department.
Donald Trump is well ahead in the polls, yet still people question how. Voters who don’t back Trump want to know what his backers see in the former president.
Executive Director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anslem College, Neil Levesque, spoke about the loyalty of Trump supporters. Levesque is from New Hampshire and has hosted four presidential primary debates.
“Donald Trump has a connection with a certain segment of republican primary voters that I’ve never seen before in politics.”
Levesque’s says his loyal backers trust, love, and believe in him.
“No one really has been able to make an argument to a solid Trump voter as to why they shouldn’t vote for Trump.”
Even with four criminal indictment charges, Trump supporters have not turned their backs on him. New Hampshire voters have not penalized Trump for his lack of engagement in debates either which is evident from the polls.
“It’s a fascinating situation because he’s almost like a goal post. He’s been about 45% popularity here in New Hampshire for a whole year, despite all the indictments all the things going on all the opponents attacking him, all the money spent, still 45%.”
While the debate that was supposed to be held at Saint Anslem College was canceled, Trump is still making his way through the state to reach the people of New Hampshire. He has speeches and rallies scheduled throughout the weekend in Concord, Manchester and Rochester.

UESDDOIPSS_Y3EA5BU89LIOX1N,"More tech grads are applying to jobs in Boise, Madison, and other small cities",Lakshmi Varanasi,"January 22, 2024 at 12:08 AM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/tech/more-tech-grads-applying-jobs-150801569.html,"Young workers are applying to cities outside traditional tech hubs, according to a new report.
They're looking for a lower cost of living and a wider range of industries to apply their skills.
From Columbia, Maryland to El Paso, Texas, here are 10 US cities attracting new talent.
Forget Silicon Valley, Austin, or even Miami — young workers are hunting for tech jobs in smaller cities across the country.
Columbia, Maryland, followed by Boise, Idaho, and Fairfax, Virginia top the list of places trending among college students and recent grads with tech-related majors, according to a January report from Handshake. The job and internship platform, used by millions of college students every year, tracked job applications from students with technical degrees like computer science and statistics.
Handshake determined which US cities saw the biggest increase in job applications between 2021 and 2023, based on the number of full-time job applications submitted on its platform. The surge in job applications to cities outside the country's traditional tech hubs comes as tech giants have slowed down hiring or made massive cuts to their workforces over the past couple of years. Handshake's report found that the number of applications submitted to tech jobs in California, Washington, and New York — where companies like Amazon, Meta, and Google have headquarters — declined significantly in the past year. So it's not surprising that Handshake found that applications to traditional internet and software companies also dropped by more than 30% between 2021 and 2023. The waning interest in Big Tech has made way for a host of new opportunities. Retail and consumer goods companies have amped up their efforts to recruit young tech talent, and the number of applications tech majors submitted to government jobs also doubled between 2021 and 2023, per Handshake.
The cities on the list ""tend to be more affordable, have less stressful commutes, and are starting to feature many of the elements people enjoy in larger coastal cities,"" Christine Cruzvergara, Handshake's chief education strategy officer told Business Insider by email. ""I expect to see interest in moving to these smaller cities grow as more and more Gen Z workers prove that a location or specific industry does not define what a 'tech job' is.""
And it's not just recent college grads. Tech workers of all ages are gravitating to mid-size cities in search of lower cost of living and a more laid-back lifestyle.
Handshake found these 10 cities had the biggest year-over-year increase in job applications on its site:
10. Cleveland, Ohio
Year-over-year increase in job applications: 44%
Population: 361,607, according to 2022 data from the US Census
Cleveland's low cost of living has attracted a growing population of Gen Z and millennial workers. Major industries in the city include healthcare – the city's biggest employer is the Cleveland Clinic – plus manufacturing and retail.
9. Orlando, Florida
Year-over-year increase in job applications: 48%
Population: 316,081, according to 2022 data from the US Census
Several major tech companies, including Oracle and Verizon, have offices in Orlando and have helped attract new tech talent to the city. And with thousands of college students within commuting distance to downtown, it's no surprise that young workers are trying to continue their careers in Orlando. Handshake's report found that applications to jobs in both Orlando and Florida as a whole increased between 2022 and 2023.
8. Richmond, Virginia
Year-over-year increase in job applications: 51%
Population: 229,395, according to 2022 data from the US Census
Richmond has long been known for its rich history, museums, and historical landmarks, but it's also become a hot spot for young workers. Aside from the presence of major consulting firms like Deloitte and financial institutions like Capital One, the city is also a hub for biotech, transportation, and manufacturing.
7. Madison, Wisconsin
Year-over-year increase in job applications: 60%
Population: 272,903 according to 2022 data from the US Census
Young workers are eyeing Madison for its affordable housing and college town flair. Major local employers include healthcare software company Epic Systems, doll manufacturer American Girl, and the University of Wisconsin.
6. El Paso, Texas
Year-over-year increase in job applications: 65%
Population: 677,456, according to 2022 data from the US Census
Job applications to roles in El Paso increased over the past year, even as applications to roles in Texas decreased overall, according to Handshake. The border city is also expected to have one of the hottest housing markets in 2024 as young workers move in to capitalize on the affordable housing costs.
5. Saint Paul, Minnesota
Year-over-year increase in job applications: 79%
Population: 303,176 according to 2022 data from the US Census
St. Paul is a great bet for fans of snowy winters, lakes, and laid-back energy. And between St. Paul and nearby Minneapolis, the Twin Cities are home to major corporations like Target and key players in the healthcare space, including UnitedHealth Group and Mayo Clinic.
4. Las Vegas, Nevada
Year-over-year increase in job applications: 80%
Population: 656,274 according to 2022 data from the US Census
Las Vegas isn't just known for its vibrant nightlife — it's one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. Young workers are flocking to the city for affordable housing, job opportunities, and no income tax.
3. Fairfax, Virginia
Year-over-year increase in job applications: 103%
Population: 24,835 according to 2022 data from the US Census
For those who work in Washington D.C. but want the convenience of a suburb, Fairfax is a good option. The city is just a short commute from Washington, D.C., and housing costs are more affordable than the capital. Major employers in the county include Amazon, government consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, home loan lender Freddie Mac, and Capital One.
2. Boise, Idaho
Year-over-year increase in job applications: 116%
Population: 236,634 according to 2022 data from the US Census
Boise is a growing tech hub. In the past few years, two local companies have been acquired by Equifax and Intuit. Chip manufacturer Micron is also building a $15 billion manufacturing facility in Boise set to open in 2025. So it's an attractive spot for young tech workers who are increasingly opting for jobs in hardware, semiconductors, and manufacturing, over traditional internet and software companies, per Handshake.
1. Columbia, Maryland
Year-over-year increase in job applications: 190%
Population: 104,681 according to 2020 data from the US Census
Columbia is a planned community within commuting distance of Washington D.C. and Baltimore. Popular employers among tech majors include electronics company Rohde & Schwarz — which has its Americas headquarters — insurance company AFLAC, and government entities like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, according to Handshake.

(NEXSTAR) – Nikki Haley’s rally was interrupted by climate protesters from the Sunrise Movement in the audience Saturday night at her rally at the Courtyard Hotel.
It started when a young girl emerged from the crowd and shouted out Haley’s name before continuing:
“Why are you letting our homes be destroyed in climate disasters., She’s taking millions of dollars from the fossil fuel industry.”
Haley took a moment after the initial protest to let security search the crowd for any more protesters. After the incident, Haley addressed the crowd.
“Don’t boo someone like that,” Haley said. “My husband and other military men and women sacrifice for us every day for her to do that.
“We are blessed to live in a country with free speech.”
But she did not speak for much longer before another young girl rose from her seat and started yelling.
“My community is suffering through asthma and cancer from the fossil fuel money that you are seeking,” the second protester shouted. “How can you look at me in the eyes? How can you look at my generation?”
Again, Haley’s security quickly removed the protester and escorted them directly out of the building.
Haley supporters were quick to stand behind the former governor and started chanting “USA” and “Nikki” to drown out the voices of the protester as they were leaving and continuing to shout.
However, over the course of the next minutes, five to six fellow protestors stood up from the crowd and shouted similar accusations before being escorted out of the rally by police. Each drew out a yellow banner with “CLIMATE CRIMINAL” emblazoned on the front. One of the protesters was shoved by an audience member and fell down while being escorted from the rally.
After each protester was escorted out, Haley said:
“Anyone else?”

While the US has launched at least seven rounds of strikes against Houthi positions in Yemen – with the UK also involved in the first strikes last week – experts have told The Independent that the strikes amount merely to a short-term solution to a problem that requires a long-term answer.
“There is nothing in the Houthis’ narrative to suggest they have any intention to stop, whatever the cost,” says Alessio Patalano, a professor specialising in maritime strategy and doctrine at the department of war studies at King’s College London.
US president Joe Biden said on Thursday that airstrikes would continue, even as he acknowledged that they may not halt the Houthi attacks. “Are they stopping the Houthis? No. Are they gonna continue? Yes,” he said.
The Houthis began their attacks along the key maritime trade route in November, with the Hamas-allied group claiming they are aimed at bringing a halt to the war in Gaza. Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis, and took 240 more hostage – around half of whom are still captive in Gaza – during an attack on 7 October. In response, Israel vowed to eradicate Hamas, and has launched airstrikes and ground operations inside Gaza, backed up by a blockade. Health officials in the Hamas-controlled territory say more than 25,000 people have been killed.
While claiming to target vessels bound for Israel, the Houthis have fired at more than 30 commercial ships since 19 November.
Utilising positions in northwestern Yemen that surround the Bab al-Mandab Strait, through which around 12 per cent of global maritime traffic travels, the Houthis have threatened to destabilise supply chains between Asia and Europe.
Their attacks have forced hundreds of commercial vessels to reroute around the Cape of Good Hope, a lengthy detour beneath Africa, and more than doubled the insurance premiums on shipping companies looking to operate in the area.
In late December, the US established a naval coalition in the Red Sea – Operation Prosperity Guardian – supported by the UK, to counter this threat.
Professor Patalano says the initial strikes on Houthi positions have clearly had an effect. “We went from upwards of 20 missiles and drones per [Houthi] attack to just single shots,” he notes, citing this as evidence of the degradation of the group’s offensive capabilities. But he describes the wider intention, to prevent Houthi attacks altogether, as “naive”.
Baraa Shiban, an expert on Yemen at the Royal United Services Institute, a security think tank based in London, suggests that the US ability to destroy Houthi capabilities longer-term is the issue.
“This is something [the Houthis] are used to,” he says. “They are very mobile. They have adapted their military capabilities around how to sustain an aerial campaign against [targeted strikes].”
According to Offshore Energy, a trade publication that specialises in maritime energy, “oil supplies have not been endangered” as companies such as BP and Shell have redirected their vessels away from the Red Sea. War insurance premiums, a tariff that must be paid by shipping companies to sail in dangerous waters, may have doubled to 0.7 per cent, but the industry can swallow larger rises, Prof Patalano says, citing the roughly 10 per cent premiums that applied during the tanker war between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s.
But, as Mr Biden said, the Houthis still pose a threat, and the economic impact will grow if strikes continue for months.
Going forwards, Prof Patalano says he believes the US will look to evolve its strategy with this new reality in mind. He says destroying the Houthi’s offensive capability, or convincing them to stop, appears impossible now, although the US will probably continue to try.
“It needs to be a combination of different strategies that minimise risks in different settings,” he says. “The US must also reduce the number of convoys going through the Red Sea, and look at extended escorting of commercial vessels in the area.
“That should be enough to keep the war insurance premiums at bay for a little longer.”
There has been some acknowledgement from officials that there is a need for longer-term planning. The Royal Navy missiles that have been used to shoot down Houthi drones in the Red Sea will be upgraded, the UK government has said.
The Sea Viper air defence system will get more effective missiles featuring a new warhead, and a software update that will enable it to defeat ballistic missile threats. It will help to protect the navy’s Carrier Strike group, and allow tracking, targeting and destruction of a variety of air threats more than 70 miles away. The £405m upgrade will be completed by 2032. It is hoped that the upgrade will help navy ships to better deal with more complex threats in the future.
The defence secretary, Grant Shapps, said: “As the situation in the Middle East worsens, it is vital that we adapt to keep the UK, our allies and partners safe. Sea Viper has been at the forefront of this, being the navy’s weapon of choice in the first shooting down of an aerial threat in more than 30 years.
“Our strong and enduring relationship with British industry has ensured we can deploy the latest technological capabilities wherever they are required, while supporting hundreds of jobs across the country and bolstering UK prosperity.”
In the meantime, however, the US runs the risk of the Houthis improving their reputation in the region, says Shiban, who spent years in the Yemeni government negotiating with the Houthis.
“Many Arab countries have been celebrating what the Houthis are doing as the only group that is trying to push back against Israel,” he says. “Maybe they are doing it for other reasons, to try to deflect from internal issues, but that is not what [many] Arab people see.”
For Shiban, this is something the US has not considered, and it risks serious adverse consequences. US hopes that attacks will cease if the war in Gaza ends are also misplaced, he believes.
“The Houthis want to have long-term leverage on the international community, and now they have demonstrated that, they have got that leverage,” he says. “The Houthis are here to stay.”"
UHOXYSIEVI_QVLGNRMBXX1UILD,French protesters ask Macron not to sign off on an immigration law with a far-right footprint,Associated Press,"January 22, 2024 at 3:48 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/french-protesters-ask-macron-not-184845317.html,"PARIS (AP) — Tens of thousands of people marched in the streets of cities across France on Sunday to call on President Emmanuel Macron not to sign into law tough new legislation on immigration that they say bears the footprint of the far right and betrays French values.
According to the Interior Ministry, 75,000 people took part across the country, with 16,000 protesters turning out in Paris. The hard-left CGT union put the number of protesters nationwide at 150,000.
The timing of the protests was critical, coming four days before the Constitutional Council decides on Thursday whether all articles in the law — passed in December — conform with the French Constitution.
The bill strengthens France’s ability to deport foreigners considered undesirable and makes it tougher for foreigners to take advantage of social welfare, among other measures.
The protest was called by 200 figures from various sectors, including the arts and the unions. The law “was written under the dictate of the merchants of hate who dream of imposing on France their project of ‘national preference,’” the signatories of the call to march wrote.
National preference, under which the French, not foreigners, should profit from the riches of the land, has long been the rallying cry of the far-right National Rally party.
Macron backed the law in its tortuous course through parliament, but, in an unusual twist, has said that some articles appear unconstitutional. Le Monde newspaper recently quoted an unnamed Interior Ministry official as saying that “a good dozen” of articles could be struck down by the Constitutional Council.
Some articles of the law make it more difficult to bring family members to France, for instance, an applicant trying to join their spouse will have to show knowledge of the French language. The court is also likely to scrutinize tougher standards for receiving social services and housing or re-establishing a law done away with in 2012 that makes it illegal for a foreigner to be in France without residence papers.
The immigration law reflects what appears to be centrist Macron's most recent effort to tilt the government to the right, notably ahead of European elections in June with the far right bounding forward in popularity, according to polls.
Also on the horizon is the possibility of a victory in 2027 presidential elections by National Rally leader Marine Le Pen. After two presidential mandates, Macron will not be in the running."

Scott Wagner, head of the Never Back Down political action committee, has come under fire from staff within the group after Mr DeSantis finished in a distant second place in Iowa.
They shared a photograph with NBC News of Mr Wagner working on the puzzle at the group’s headquarters in West Des Moines, just days before the caucuses.
“Staffers are putting their dedication and devotion to electing Governor DeSantis and they come in and the CEO, the chairman of the organisation, is sitting there working on a puzzle for hours,” one member of the group said.
Mr Wagner told the network the puzzle was “there when we arrived” and “became a sense of pride for the entire team and everyone chipped in a few minutes a piece to get it done”.
“We worked non-stop together on operations in terrible weather conditions,” he added. “I am so proud of what we achieved in Iowa and will achieve beyond.”
The multi-million dollar Never Back Down operation had staked much of its capital on a strong showing in the first state to vote in the Republican nomination contest.
Mr DeSantis was so confident of victory, he declared just last month: “We’re going to win Iowa”. However, he trailed Donald Trump, who secured 51 per cent of the vote, by 30 points.
It is just the latest criticism of Never Back Down, which entered the 2024 race with more than $80 million and spent huge sums recruiting staff to knock on hundreds of thousands of doors and make phone calls to potential voters in Iowa.
The New York Times suggested the effort “could go down as one of the most colossal bonfires of cash in American political history”.
Mr DeSantis’s political campaign group is now laying off staff as it shifts operations out of Iowa.
Throughout the latter half of last year several prominent Republican donors pulled or paused their contributions to the governor’s coffers as his poll numbers plateaued.

The Philippine Arena, the world's largest indoor arena, saw an influx of 40,000 concert-goers resulting in ""unforeseen traffic complications along the route,"" the Presidential Security Group said in a statement.
The traffic situation posed a security threat to Marcos who attended the Friday night concert with his wife, prompting the use of the presidential chopper, it added.
But social media users criticised the use of taxpayer money by Marcos, the son and namesake of the late strongman president whose rule ended nearly four decades ago in a historic ""people power"" revolution.
""Using official resources, like the presidential chopper, for personal and non-official activities is generally considered an abuse of power or misuse of government resources,"" Facebook user James Patrick Aristorenas said in a post on Saturday.

UPOOZZ89F2_QJ56WOJ1F44AICR,The attacks on Donald Trump’s age may be at a tipping point,Shelby Talcott,"January 21, 2024 at 8:43 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/attacks-donald-trump-age-may-234300710.html,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Donald Trump is 77 years old. After he repeatedly mixed her up with Nancy Pelosi during his speech last night, Nikki Haley wants voters to know that.
“I’m not saying anything derogatory, but when you’re dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do this,” she said Saturday in Keene. “We can’t.”
On Fox News, she continued that focus: “These are people making decisions on the future of our economy. Do we really want them throwing out names and getting things wrong when they’re 80 and having to deal with Putin and Xi and Kim and North Korea? We can’t do that.”
And at a stop in Petersborough, she mentioned Trump’s prior habit of describing Barack Obama as if he’s the current president, a recurring story that drew enough attention late last year for Trump to address it on Truth Social, claiming it was deliberate.
“He got confused and said he was running against Obama — he never ran against Obama!” she said. “Don’t put our country at risk like this.”
Lines like these have been a long time coming: Haley launched her presidential bid calling for politicians over 75 to be required to take a “mental competency test,” a proposal she continues to tout in speeches.
But since coming in third in Iowa last week, the attack has sharpened. On the campaign trail this week, the former South Carolina governor has repeatedly mentioned Trump’s age, tying him in with President Joe Biden for good measure: “The majority of Americans think that having two 80-year-olds running for president is not what they want,” she told voters on Tuesday. And on Saturday, she noted how he “got confused” when discussing her culpability in security failures on January 6th as if she were speaker — even though “I wasn’t even in D.C. on Jan. 6. I wasn’t in office then.”
She’s not alone either: DeSantis has argued for months that Trump has lost a step. “If you put a side by side between him in 2016 riffing and really at the top of his game versus now in 2024, I mean, it’s just a different guy that you’re seeing there,” he told Iowa radio host Steve Deace earlier this month.
There’s little sign attacks on Trump’s age, let alone his cognitive fitness, have swayed Republican voters — and it’s pretty late for this angle to start working now. But Democrats are watching closely as well for signs they may be able to neutralize Biden’s vulnerabilities on the issue in a general election.
“Trump is all about projecting,” New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley said. “Trump’s a crook so he calls Hillary a crook. Trump is feeble minded, so he calls Biden feeble.”
Last year, the Biden campaign, frustrated with the ongoing narrative about Biden’s own age and health, began trying to flip the script — or at least bring Trump into the conversation — by highlighting Trump’s gaffes while out on the campaign trail. Their campaign accounts have continuously shared every little example they can find of Trump stumbling on his words or going off on an odd tangent.
The Haley/Pelosi mixup, under the glare of peak primary campaign coverage, may be the most traction this angle has gotten, and Democrats now have clips of Republicans validating the attack.
On Saturday, the Biden campaign even shared Haley’s comments on the episode, writing on X: “Haley reacts to Trump’s delusional and confused rant last night where he suggested that she was Speaker of the House on January 6: He got confused. I question if he’s mentally fit.” (Left out: The part where she directly compared him to Biden).
Making Biden look younger is a tough task. But a critical part of his re-election hinges on convincing some Democratic-leaning voters worried about his age that it should not be a decisive concern relative to the alternative. An encouraging Marist poll this week showed him leading Trump in New Hampshire, thanks to solid support from people who “somewhat disapprove” of his job as president — an example of what a winning map around the country might look like.
The former president is (once again) starting to brag about his cognitive abilities on the campaign trail this week. During a speech in New Hampshire on Wednesday, Trump declared that he feels “like I’m about 35 years old.”
“I actually feel better now than I did 30 years ago,” Trump said. “Tell me, is that crazy? I feel better now, and I think cognitively I’m better than I was 20 years ago.”
After a house party in Concord organized by the Write In Biden campaign, California Rep. Ro Khanna said that Democrats didn’t need to pile on Trump for a moment of confusion.
“I think there are plenty of reasons to campaign against Donald Trump — January 6, his two impeachments,” Khanna said. “This is sort of gotcha politics. Anyone who’s spoken a long time makes mistakes. This is the type of politics they do to Biden, and I don’t think we have to reciprocate.”
At The Atlantic, McKay Coppins recommended Americans of political stripes visit a Trump rally, which are rarely carried live and unedited this election cycle. One of the biggest changes from 2016 he noticed at a recent event: Trump “often turned rambly, and the crowd seemed to lose interest.”"

Those who knew Goldwater might have chuckled at another detail. Although his family had genuine 19th century Arizona roots, they had made their fortune in department stores, not ranching.

But even as the real trade of cowboying has virtually disappeared in modern Arizona — direct cattle sales make up less than 0.0014% of the state’s GDP — the strategic use of Western attire to broadcast right-leaning ideology has only increased and seems to be getting even stronger.

“As big as Arizona has grown, it is in our political DNA,” Republican political consultant Stan Barnes said of cowboy iconography. “When you come to Arizona, you’re subject to the culture, and if you’re in political life, you see that culture distilled.”
Of the 90 members of the 2024 Arizona Legislature, five are wearing cowboy hats in their official state portraits. All of them are Republicans. But only one is an actual rancher with cattle. “It means someone who rides for the brand,” said that lawmaker, Rep. David Cook, known at the Capitol as a down-to-earth deal maker. He compares his governing philosophy to moving livestock. “You get them all together and move them together,” he said.

The politician-cowpoke theme comes drenched in several ironies, not least of which is that when Arizona was run by a Democratic Party machine for most of the 20th century, there were far more ranchers serving in public office and their livery was both more common and less partisan.
Gov. Jack Williams declared the bolo tie “Arizona’s official neckwear” in 1971, and when Tom Prezelski, a Democrat from Tucson, wore his own ornamental leather cravat on the floor of the Legislature 15 years ago, nobody blinked. Now he gets a different question when he wears it: “Have you turned into a Republican?”
“You now adopt the fashion to make a political statement,” Prezelski complained. “It’s all code. It didn’t used to be that way. Now you get all these Republicans looking like norteño musicians.” Anyone who wants a front row to Deep Arizona should go to the state Capitol whenever the state’s 15 county sheriffs arrive to lobby for something. Nearly all of them wear cowboy hats, looking like a family reunion out of Wyatt Earp days.
Here lies another irony. As a profession, cowboying flourished only for a brief period, roughly from 1865 to 1895, when it was a low-paid agricultural job, often taken up by Mexican immigrants and African Americans — not the core of today’s Republican base, to say the least.
The equestrian tradition of Western cattle raising is derivative not of anything Anglos brought to conquered Indigenous land but of the northern Mexican vaquero tradition. The cowboy hat is a modified sombrero. Even the core lingo comes from the Spanish language: lariat, corral, chaps.
But historical details don’t seem to matter. The aesthetics are used to conjure up a politics of frontier individualism — they go hand in hand. “One does affect the other,” said Barnes. “They feed off each other.”
These signifiers work because voters embrace them too. It’s a common story for newcomers to Arizona to lean into the fantasy Western lifestyle by decorating their homes with oil paintings of shootouts and roundups. Even interior design carries political influences these days.
“A lot of people respond to it,” said Jim West, a longtime Phoenix country disc jockey. “It boils down to looking out for yourself, taking care of your people, and small government.”
But not every politician can pull off the look.
Mark Finchem, a former police officer from Michigan, ran a heavily MAGA conspiracy-oriented campaign for secretary of state in 2022. On the campaign trail, he sported an unconvincing combination of string tie and cowboy hat. That earned him the nickname Kalamazoo cosplay cowboy.
Some see a darker message in the aesthetic. J. Gray Sweeney, a professor emeritus of art history at Arizona State University, wrote in an article,  “Racism, Nationalism, and Nostalgia in Cowboy Art,” that “the supporters of western art are willing to do everything in their power to protect the cherished fantasy of America's 'winning of the West,’ ” which is “premised on nationalistic and conservative values.”
That impulse has gotten only stronger in recent years, especially in the Trump era, Sweeney explained to me. “I can tell you without any reservations whatsoever that the people who collected this kind of nostalgia-ridden art are uniformly conservative politically, as the art is about preserving some values that are regressive and largely of a white supremacist type.”
Of course, the supposed golden age of the Arizona rangelands in the late 19th century was also a time when Anglo settlement depended on government largesse in the form of land giveaways to the railroads, loose mining concessions and military supply contracts. A later generation of ranchers would never have stayed in business if it weren’t for generous public grazing leases, plus federal dams for all that water.
So when Arizona politicians take to dressing up Western-style, they’re paying homage to an era not of rugged individualism but of a Washington-driven economy subsidized by taxpayers. Giddyup!

USHEQFD80C_I54PIVWO1NRDDE0,Wall Street billionaires plan Haley fundraiser after New Hampshire: Report,Lauren Sforza,"January 22, 2024 at 5:46 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/wall-street-billionaires-plan-haley-204627983.html,"A group of Wall Street billionaires is planning a fundraiser for GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley in New York City after the New Hampshire primary, Bloomberg News reported.
Billionaires Stanley Druckenmiller, Henry Kravis, Ken Langone and Cliff Asness are reportedly planning a fundraiser for Haley on Jan. 30, according to an invitation viewed by Bloomberg. A donor speaking on the condition of anonymity told the outlet that the event is just one part of a fundraising swing slated for Haley in between the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries.
The donor told Bloomberg that Haley will be visiting Miami and Palm Beach, Fla., after the Jan. 30 fundraiser in New York to meet with wealthy donors. She will then travel to California and Texas in the first two weeks of February to meet with additional donors, according to the source.
Bloomberg reported that tickets for the fundraising event in New York City start at $3,300 and may be purchased for as much as $33,200. Bloomberg noted that Puck News first reported on the fundraiser.
The Hill has reached out to Haley’s campaign for comment.
Haley’s campaign announced earlier this month that she had hauled in $24 million in fundraising during the fourth quarter last year. The campaign said 83,900 new people donated to her between October and December and that she had $14.3 million in the bank by the end of 2023.
The political wing of the conservative network led by billionaire Charles Koch endorsed Haley last year, marking the first time the deep-pocketed group threw its support behind a Republican candidate in the GOP primary.
Haley is the only GOP challenger to former President Trump after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced he was dropping out of the race Sunday. She is hoping to pull off an upset in New Hampshire’s primary this week, where she is trailing Trump by about 11 percentage points, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ.

Ambassador Nikki Haley had a curt goodbye for GOP primary rival Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday after DeSantis announced he will suspend his presidential campaign.
DeSantis, who has for months feuded with Haley in debates and on the campaign trail, endorsed Trump.
“Ron DeSantis has been a good governor, and I wish him well,” Haley said in a statement.
Haley painted a hopeful picture for her White House bid, as she is now the last candidate standing between Trump and a third consecutive GOP nomination. Trump did well in last week’s Iowa caucuses, but the Haley campaign hopes a good performance in New Hampshire could provide the needed momentum to upset Trump.
“So far, only one state has voted. Half of its votes went to Donald Trump, and half did not,” she said. “We’re not a country of coronations. Voters deserve a say in whether we go down the road of Trump and Biden again, or we go down a new conservative road.”
“New Hampshire voters will have their say on Tuesday. When I’m president, I will do everything in my power to show them they made the right decision,” she added.
The former South Carolina governor has sharpened her attacks on Trump in recent weeks as Republican voters begin to go to polls, claiming that Trump couldn’t beat President Biden in the 2024 election.
“All the evidence says that if it’s a Trump-Biden rematch, it’s going to be another toss-up election. It could go either way,” Haley said in remarks after Iowa’s caucuses last week. “And then look at what happens when I go head-to-head against Biden. We win in a landslide. It’s not even close.”
Polls support her sentiment, with Trump leading Biden by a single point according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ average of polls, while Haley would lead Biden by 3 points.
In New Hampshire, Haley trails Trump by about 11 points, according to The Hill/Decision Desk HQ average of state polls. Nationally, she is behind by a massive 55 percentage points. Both figures use polls that included DeSantis.

UWMWVPHK52_8JFFGVKB9EKB35P,North Korea says Putin could visit at an 'early date' amid US tensions,Euronews,"January 21, 2024 at 8:02 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-says-putin-could-110216227.html,"North Korea has said it has agreed to further strategic and tactical cooperation with Russia to establish a “new multi-polarised international order,” as the two countries work to build a united front in the face of their separate, intensifying tensions with the United States.
In describing North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui’s meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow last week, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said Putin also reaffirmed his willingness to visit Pyongyang and said that could come at an “early date.”
North Korea has been actively strengthening its ties with Russia, highlighted by leader Kim Jong Un’s September visit to Russia for a summit with Putin. Kim is trying to break out of diplomatic isolation and strengthen his footing as he navigates a deepening nuclear standoff with Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.
In a separate statement on Sunday, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry condemned the UN Security Council for calling an emergency meeting over the country’s latest ballistic test, which state media described as a new intermediate-range solid-fuel missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead. The ministry said the test-firing on 14 January was among the country’s regular activities to improve its defence capabilities and that it didn’t pose a threat to its neighbours.
South Korea on Thursday urged the Security Council “to break the silence” over North Korea’s escalating missile tests and threats. Russia and China, both permanent members of the council, have blocked US-led efforts to increase sanctions on North Korea over its recent weapons tests, underscoring a divide deepened over Russia’s war on Ukraine.
The alignment between Pyongyang and Moscow has raised international concerns about alleged arms cooperation, in which North Korea provides Russia with munitions to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine, possibly in exchange for badly needed economic aid and military assistance to help upgrade Kim’s forces. Both Pyongyang and Russia have denied accusations by Washington and Seoul about North Korean arms transfers to Russia.
North Korea's Foreign Ministry, in comments published by state media, said Choe and the Russian officials in their meetings expressed a “strong will to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in defending the core interests of the two countries and establishing a new multi-polarized international order.”

Russia expressed “deep thanks” to North Korea for its “full support” over its war on Ukraine, the North Korean ministry said. It said Choe and the Russian officials expressed “serious concern” over the United States’ expanding military cooperation with its Asian allies that they blamed for worsening tensions in the region and threatening North Korea’s sovereignty and security interests.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at their highest point in years, after Kim in recent months used Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction to ramp up his weapons tests and military demonstrations. The United States, South Korea and Japan have responded by strengthening their combined military exercises, which Kim portrays as invasion rehearsals, and sharpening their deterrence plans built around nuclear-capable US assets.
In the latest tit-for-tat, North Korea on Friday said it conducted a test of a purported nuclear-capable underwater attack drone in response to a combined naval exercise by the United States, South Korea and Japan last week, as it continued to blame its rivals for tensions in the region.

Choe’s visit to Moscow came as Kim continues to use domestic political events to issue provocative threats of nuclear conflict.
At Pyongyang’s rubber-stamp parliament last week, Kim declared that North Korea is abandoning its long-standing goal of a peaceful unification with war-divided rival South Korea and ordered the rewriting of North Korea’s constitution to cement South Korea as its most hostile foreign adversary. He accused South Korea of acting as “top-class stooges” of the Americans and repeated a threat that he would use his nukes to annihilate the South if provoked.
Analysts say North Korea could be aiming to diminish South Korea’s voice in the regional nuclear standoff and eventually force direct dealings with Washington as it looks to cement its status as a nuclear weapons state."

In addition to driving under the influence, 40-year-old Brandy Porter Browne was arrested on open container and pointing and presenting a firearm charges, the sheriff’s department said in the release.
Browne was stopped by a South Carolina Highway Patrol trooper at about 1 a.m. at Interstate 77 and Bluff Road, according to the release. That’s by Exit 5 on I-77 in Columbia, about 13 miles from Williams-Brice Stadium.
During the traffic stop the trooper determined Browne was under the influence, and she was taken to the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center, the sheriff’s department said.
There was not an immediate response to a message left with the sheriff’s department looking to determine if Browne was on duty or if she was driving a patrol vehicle.
There was no word why the traffic stop was initiated or what led to the pointing and presenting a firearm charge.
Information about Browne’s bond was not available, but as of 1 p.m. Sunday she was not listed on the jail’s inmate roster.
Browne was suspended without pay pending termination, according to the release.
She had been with the sheriff’s department since August 2018 and was currently serving as a school resource officer, the sheriff’s department said. Information about the school where Browne was stationed was not available.
“I’m extremely disappointed at the choices she made; but we are all responsible for our actions,” Sheriff Leon Lott said in the release. “I expect my deputies to hold themselves to a much higher standard. Her actions are unacceptable!”"

Ron DeSantis suspended his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination Sunday, ending a bid that began as the best-funded and most high-profile challenge to former President Trump but fizzled over the course of a year.
He endorsed Trump, saying in a video posted to social media that it was now clear that ""a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance.""
DeSantis said he and his team had “prayed and deliberated” about how to move forward after he finished a distant second in last week's Iowa caucuses.
“I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory,” DeSantis added. “Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.”
""Fire sale on all Ron DeSantis merch today!"" Gov. Gavin Newsom, who predicted DeSantis would not be the Republican nominee when the pair debated on Fox News in November, gleefully wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

DeSantis received 21.2% of the vote in Iowa, well behind Trump's 51% and just two points ahead of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who won 19.1%.
DeSantis said he disagreed with Trump over his handling of the pandemic and his ""elevation"" of chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci, but argued that the former president ""is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden.”
In a visit to his New Hampshire campaign headquarters Sunday afternoon, Trump acknowledged the endorsement from DeSantis, whom he called a “very capable person.”
“Without the endorsement, I think we would have gotten almost all of those votes because we have very similar policies — strong borders, great education, low taxes, very, very few regulations,” Trump said.
In his farewell video, DeSantis also took a dig at Haley, who has steadily risen in the polls.
""We can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents,"" DeSantis said.
“He ran a great race, he’s been a good governor, and we wish him well,” Haley said at a New Hampshire event Sunday afternoon, minutes after DeSantis exited the race. “Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left. … All the fellas are out except for this one. And this comes down to, what do you want? Do you want more of the same or do you want something new?”

DeSantis' sudden departure from the contest effectively makes Tuesday's New Hampshire primary a head-to-head battle between Haley and Trump. But DeSantis, several other Republican dropouts and a collection of lesser-known candidates will all still appear on Tuesday's ballot.
Haley has staked her campaign on the Granite State, hoping to slow the Trump juggernaut by winning over moderate New Hampshire voters. Polling over the last two months showed her gaining on the former president, and by early January she appeared to be within striking distance. But after her less-than-impressive showing in Iowa last week, Haley's New Hampshire outlook began to look grimmer.
Earlier on Sunday, the closely watched Suffolk University/NBC 10 Boston/Boston Globe tracking poll had Trump finishing with 55% of the vote to Haley’s 36%. In the same poll released Sunday, DeSantis was a distant third, polling at just 6%. Even if all DeSantis voters switched to Haley, the shift would not be enough to eliminate Trump’s lead.
DeSantis’ decision to drop out will not greatly benefit Haley, said Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire.
“It makes the hill even steeper,” he said. “Most of those DeSantis voters are not going to Haley. Some will stay with DeSantis anyway. Of those remaining, I’ve got to think the split will favor Trump. That makes things a little steeper for Haley on Tuesday.”
Scala marveled at how quickly Trump appeared to be securing the GOP nomination. “How rapidly Trump is wrapping things up is remarkable,” Scala said.
“It’s been over from Day 1 and it just takes some of these knuckleheads time to figure out they never had a shot in the first place,"" Ray Buckley, the chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, said in an interview. ""Trump’s margin is growing by the hour and he’s going to have a blowout on Tuesday.”
A year ago, DeSantis appeared to represent a formidable challenge to Trump and surpassed him in many polls of potential Republican primary voters.
A mid-February UC Berkeley IGS/Los Angeles Times poll of California Republicans, for example, found DeSantis leading Trump 37% to 29% in the state, which sends the largest delegation to the Republican National Convention. At the time, Republicans were still smarting from the defeats they suffered in the 2022 midterm elections, which many in the party blamed on Trump, and many voters were open to DeSantis' argument that he could offer Trump-like policies without the attendant baggage.

But the strength of that argument waned as memories of the midterm losses began to fade. At the same time, three other developments undermined DeSantis' hopes: Criminal indictments of Trump caused many Republican voters to rally around the former president; Biden's standing in polls started to slip, blunting the argument that Republicans needed someone other than Trump to defeat the incumbent; and Trump pummeled DeSantis with attacks that the Florida governor largely left unanswered, fearing that attacking back would alienate the Trump supporters he needed.
When DeSantis was riding high, polls showed that much of his support came from Republicans skeptical of Trump — college-educated voters and more moderate Republicans who disliked the former president's style and some of his policies. But DeSantis aimed his appeals primarily at Trump's core supporters, who make up the largest part of the Republican primary electorate. For a brief time, that approach appeared to work — conservative voters were attracted to DeSantis because of his issue stands and his pugnacious attacks on liberals and culture-war targets, while moderates saw him as the best bet to beat Trump.
But the strategy only worked so long as DeSantis seemed to be beating Trump. Once his poll numbers started to decline, many of those moderate voters pulled away. Meantime, most conservatives seemed uninterested in anyone other than Trump.
That set in motion a downward spiral that DeSantis proved unable to reverse. Between January and July, he lost roughly half his support in the average of national polls maintained by FiveThirtyEight, a polling aggregator. In California, Trump retook the lead by mid-May and never relinquished it.
Over the course of the fall, DeSantis’ aides fought bitterly — sometimes publicly — over strategy, and the candidate often appeared to be flailing as he sought a way forward. DeSantis’ campaign was plagued by a series of blunders, starting with his campaign launch, which took place on Twitter and was interrupted by technical problems.

Jason Roe, a top DeSantis supporter who helped lead Mitt Romney and Marco Rubio's presidential bids, said the Florida governor's media strategy and unwillingness to trust advisors outside his Florida circle led to his downfall. Roe also said the campaign should have focused more on fundraising and communications.
“The campaign never found its footing,” said Roe, who also served as strategist for San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer. “The rollout was clunky, the restarts were clunky. I think Trump brilliantly bracketed everything they tried to do to find their sea legs. Once [Trump] got indicted, I think that made him unstoppable.”
A former staffer at Never Back Down, the super PAC that formed the backbone of DeSantis’ campaign, was deeply disappointed by the Florida governor’s decision to drop out. But the person, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, questioned the organization's decision to hire staff in Super Tuesday states, including California and Texas, before it was clear that DeSantis could survive the early-state contests.
“He’s amazing. He did the 99 counties,” the staffer said, referring to DeSantis’ barnstorming of Iowa. “He’s not lazy. He’s a hard worker. I truly wish he was the guy.”

“He’s just not at the same level he was in 2016,” the former South Carolina governor said Sunday of Trump on CBS’s Face the Nation. “I think we’re seeing some of that decline.”
Haley, 52, has mostly steered clear of strong attacks on the 77-year-old former president, whom she served as United Nations ambassador. But she seized on Trump’s mental acuity after he repeatedly appeared to confuse her with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at a rally on Friday night.
Her shift in tone comes as the critical vote looms Tuesday, with a new CNN poll showing Trump holds 50% of support among likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire versus 39% for Haley.

On CBS, Haley ticked off “multiple” examples of Trump possibly being “confused.”
“He claimed that Joe Biden was going to get us into World War II. I’m assuming he meant World War III,” she said. “He said that he ran against President Obama. He never ran against President Obama. He says that I’m the one that kept security from the Capitol on January 6th, I was nowhere near the Capitol on January 6th.”
“Don’t be surprised if you have someone that’s 80 in office, their mental stability is going to continue to decline,” Haley said.
“It should be enough to send us a warning sign,” she said. “Joe Biden, he’s very different than he was two years ago.”
Biden, 81, added his voice to the tumult over Trump’s repeated assertions Haley was responsible for security on Jan. 6.
“I don’t agree with Nikki Haley on everything, but we agree on this much: She is not Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said on X, formerly Twitter.
New Hampshire so far presents the strongest opportunity for Haley to upset Trump, owing to the state’s more moderate electorate and the ability of undeclared voters to participate in the GOP primary.

But even if she defies the polls and wins in New Hampshire, Haley faces a steep climb toward the GOP nomination. Other polls show Trump dominating around the nation, including in her home state of South Carolina. That primary is on Feb. 24.

Artificial intelligence could help bring such problems to light, a new analysis suggests.
The study, published in the journal Alcohol: Clinical & Experimental Research, used a natural language processing model to assess the medical records of 53,811 patients who underwent surgery between 2012 and 2019.
Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.
Patients’ electronic medical records contain diagnostic codes, but they can also include information such as notes, test results or billing data that may hint at risky alcohol use.
To pick up on contextual clues, the researchers programmed a natural language processing model to identify both diagnostic codes and other indicators of risky alcohol use, such as drinks per week exceeding recommended thresholds or a history of medical issues associated with alcohol misuse.
Misusing alcohol around a surgery is associated with higher infection rates, longer hospital stays and other surgical complications. Among the patients studied, 4.8 percent had charts that included a diagnosis code related to alcohol use. With the help of contextual clues, the model classified three times as many as being at risk, for a total of 14.5 percent.
The model did about as well as a panel of human alcohol-use experts, matching their classifications for a subset of records 87 percent of the time.
The findings point to AI as a potential partner for clinicians looking to identify patients who need intervention or postoperative supports, the researchers concluded.
The analysis could “lay the groundwork for efforts to identify other risks in primary care and beyond, with appropriate validation,” V.G. Vinod Vydiswaran, an associate professor of learning health sciences at the University of Michigan Medical School and the paper’s lead author, said in a news release. “Essentially, this is a way of highlighting for a provider what is already contained in the notes made by other providers, without them having to read the entire record.”
The researchers say they plan to eventually make the model public, but note that it will have to be trained on medical records from individual facilities.

The era of certainty is gone. The modern age is defined by heightened confusion and inexplicable world events. Britain's decision to leave the European Union. The election (and possible re-election) of Donald Trump. Attempted coups-d’état in the U.S., Russia and Germany. The first global pandemic in a century.
In the face of all this, it’s difficult to escape the feeling that our current system is dysfunctional. There is mass uncertainty about the future in America and other Western nations, bolstered by a series of alarming trends.
The U.S. is currently the only country in the developed world where life expectancy is declining. This is partly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the trend actually began a few years earlier. From 2014 to 2017, life expectancy fell for three consecutive years; this hadn't happened in the U.S. since 1918, and is virtually unheard-of in modern societies not facing war or disease. According to data from the Center for Disease Control, U.S. life expectancy is now at its lowest since 1996. COVID erased two full decades of life-expectancy growth in the U.S, whereas average life expectancy in peer countries decreased only marginally, to about the level of 2018.
Why is this happening in the richest country in the world? The reasons are not obscure. It’s largely happening because of an increasing number of what have been called “deaths of despair” (this mostly means suicides and alcohol- or drug-related fatalities), which disproportionately occur among white middle-class or working-class Americans. The term comes from Princeton researchers Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who speculate that the phenomenon is related to economic inequality and inadequate health care. In 2017, the number of deaths of despair in the U.S. was estimated at 150,000. The U.S. appears to be facing the worst drug epidemic in its history right now. Overdoses have joined car crashes and gun violence as a leading cause of death, and suicide rates hit an all-time high in 2022.
Last year, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a public advisory about loneliness in America, declaring it to be a public health crisis. The mortality impact of being socially disconnected, Murthy reported, was similar to that caused by smoking nearly a pack of cigarettes a day. In 2018, the British government created an unofficial ""minister of loneliness"" position. Japan did the same in 2021, partly in response to the ""Hikikomori phenomenon,"" a severe form of social isolation in which young men stay in their rooms for periods of six months or more. By some estimates, more than half a million Japanese men have become Hikikomori.
The U.S. is suffering from an inability to provide basic, reliable social services. Although the Biden administration has ramped up infrastructure spending, the American Society of Civil Engineers still grades U.S. infrastructure at C-minus, its second lowest ranking. The U.S. exhibits higher wealth inequality than almost any other developed country, and is the only major developed country that does not guarantee health care to all citizens.
In other words, these symptoms of decline did not come out of nowhere. We have been following this trajectory for decades. America now ranks as a “developing nation” on a number of international indexes. Our condition is not terminal, but it is moving in the wrong direction. The overall health of our society is backsliding, and it seems conceivable that we could be approaching a major upheaval on the scale of the collapse of communism in the 1990s.
No one can predict the future with certainty. But what is so striking about the current moment is that the most serious threat to America's existing social order is not some better-performing alternative model advocated by our adversaries. It is coming from within. For decades after World War II, anticommunism was the driving force behind our geopolitical strategy. But since the collapse of the Soviet Union, this antagonism has been directed internally.
In the 1970s, power began to shift away from the manufacturing sector and toward financial institutions, constituting a new economic reality no longer organized around the means of production and distribution. Around the same time, we saw a precipitous decline in union membership and collective bargaining. Financial regulations were dismantled. Wages began to stagnate. Speculation increased. Following the collapse of the Democratic coalition forged by Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, political figures from both parties were unable to envision or enact anything approaching major economic reforms, even after the crash of 2008, the worst since the Great Depression.

In the 1960s and 70s, Republicans capitalized on the backlash to civil rights legislation with the “Southern strategy,” drawing Southern white voters away from Democratic Party. They also mobilized evangelical Christians by championing bans on abortion. This has led directly to today’s partisan split, where the domestic agenda is dominated by culture-war issues involving race, sex and gender. Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections, yet have managed to hold power almost half the time — a form of minority sabotage. The ideal of national unity seems increasingly precarious.
Mitch McConnell, of all people, accurately summarized the nation's polarization crisis: “We cannot keep drifting apart into two separate tribes with a separate set of facts and separate realities with nothing in common except our hostility toward each other and mistrust for the few national institutions that we all still share.”
The days when the public could debate a set of shared facts are over. The news media in America today has become increasingly fragmented, not unlike the situation in nations divided by civil war, where information must be pieced together from conflicting reports delivered by sources loyal to opposing oligarchies. There was once a sort of monoculture in American news media, where people responded to the same set of basic facts. This had its downsides, of course, but today, there is no longer any consensus reality at all. The internet democratized information, but degraded its quality. Incompatible worldviews have been isolated within bubbles where contradictory points of view or unresolved complications cannot reach.
America is effectively becoming two societies, who agree about almost nothing except blaming the other side. This has contributed to a larger culture of social fragmentation: People of all demographic groups feel more alone than ever before, while public trust in the government has been at record lows for years. This kind of turmoil provides fertile ground for populist demagogues.
In recent years, we’ve seen far-right movements emerge around the globe, and far-right leaders come to power, at least temporarily, in the U.S., the U.K., Brazil, Italy, Hungary, Argentina and the Philippines, among other countries. There has also been a resurgence of left-wing politics, though with less electoral success: Bernie Sanders never became the Democratic presidential nominee; Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the British Labour Party ended in defeat. Meanwhile, the previously dominant political center has all but collapsed in many Western nations, although perhaps Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak offer evidence that it has not become obsolete.
This goes far beyond electoral spectacle; it could be seen as symptomatic of a death-drive. Since 1947, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has maintained the Doomsday Clock, a symbolic measurement of how close the world is to nuclear annihilation. Midnight marks the theoretical destruction point. Last year, because of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Board placed the clock's hands at 90 seconds to midnight — the closest to Armageddon it has ever been.
Last March, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its annual climate change synthesis report, which concluded that uncontrolled greenhouse-gas emissions will lead to “widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related losses and damages to nature and people.” Last June, smoke from wildfires in Canada drifted hundreds of miles down to the eastern seaboard of the U.S., turning the skies orange over New York City. July was the hottest month ever recorded on Earth.
We should consider what Sigmund Freud in ""Civilization and its Discontents"" called ""the fateful question for the human species"":
[W]hether and to what extent their cultural development will succeed in mastering the disturbance of their communal life by the human instinct of aggression and self-destruction. It may be that in this respect, precisely the present time deserves a special interest. Men have gained control over the forces of nature to such an extent that with their help, they would have no difficulty in exterminating one another to the last man. They know this, and hence comes a large part of their current unease, their unhappiness and mood of anxiety. And now it is to be expected that the other of the two ""Heavenly Powers,"" eternal Eros, will make an effort to assert himself in the struggle with his equally immortal adversary. But who can foresee with what success and with what result?
In an era when multiple catastrophes are competing for primacy, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that our society is entering a death spiral. We are in a period of what UC Berkeley professor Alexei Yurchak calls ""hypernormalisation,"" a term he coined to describe life in the Soviet Union during the last years of the Communist regime. It describes a moment when everyone knows the system is failing but no one has a viable alternative vision, so the state of decay comes to seem normal. Is this where we are?
Alternative paths are, in fact, possible, and opinion polling suggests that most Americans want them. Majorities favor raising the minimum wage, increasing taxes on the wealthy, creating national health insurance, enacting the Green New Deal and rebuilding public infrastructure. They oppose cutting or privatizing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. In this and many other ways, the gap between what Americans want and what those who supposedly represent them are willing or able to do is stark, even shocking.
History is clear enough: Positive change nearly always begins with mass movements: the civil rights movement, women’s rights, the Vietnam War protests, the anti-apartheid movement, LGBTQ activism and many more. For a variety of reasons, protest movements in the 21st century — from the Iraq war to Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter and climate justice — have not succeeded in creating large-scale social and economic change, although they have shifted public consciousness to some degree. What the future will require, I believe, is a level of sustained street activism in conjunction with labor militancy and workplace democracy, the likes of which America had in the 1930s. We can see hints of this in the renewed power of labor unions, although these still represent a small proportion of America's workers.
This kind of unified movement could assert power from outside government by controlling key sectors in the economy, with the goal of improving living standards, increasing wages and providing equal access to health care benefits for everyone. More optimistically, such a movement could, in the longer term, help encourage a return to communal life. People engaged in cooperative efforts for their mutual benefit feel less alone — because they are not alone — and feel a greater sense of purpose and stability in their lives.
In one direction lies a future built on citizen engagement and a shared vision. In the other lies the Soviet Union in 1991, a superpower that no one imagined could collapse — until it did."

Those survivors included plaintiffs of a 2021 lawsuit, which alleged that several agencies, including APD (led by Acevedo at the time), failed to properly investigate sexual assaults between 2006 and 2019.
Flanked by those plaintiffs, Garza, along with Travis County Judge Andy Brown, Austin City Council Member Alison Alter and Congressman Greg Casar, championed survivors of sexual assault for their bravery.
Garza mentioned Acevedo’s return in his remarks, saying that many of the changes implemented from the lawsuit were related to errors in leadership made during Acevedo’s time at APD.
He said that under Acevedo and other officials “a backlog of untested rape kits grew and a culture of disrespect for survivors of sexual assault festered.”
“His return is a step backwards for survivors of sexual assault. His appointment represents a stunning disregard for their pain and for the values of this community. We are here to remember, but we are also here to celebrate, because even if Art Acevedo is coming back, we are never going back,” Garza said.
Numerous sexual assault survivors attended the event, which debuted the start of an art installation honoring the bravery of local survivors. They also created stained glass mosaics during the event, which will eventually be displayed at the Travis County DA’s office.
Kelly McWilliams, a plaintiff of the lawsuit, attended the art event. She said news of Acevedo’s return to the city has made her concerned for other victims of violent crime.
“My incident happened 20 years ago, I’ve waited 20 years for justice. I don’t even have justice, because of the way APD handled the case,” McWilliams said.
Heather Sin, also a plaintiff, said she hopes the public outcry about Acevedo’s hiring will be enough to reverse his employment with the city.
“I’m hoping that we have enough voices out here now, even this public statement that happened today with different officials that sometimes a lot of people making enough noise is enough,” Sin said.

V4PUUM9VVP_VDEHXREV8ZBEZE7,"For the co-founder of the Detroit-Windsor Dance Academy, dance provides a 'reason to live'","Scott Talley, Detroit Free Press","January 21, 2024 at 8:03 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/co-founder-detroit-windsor-dance-110336778.html,"Before the old Kronk Recreation Center on Detroit’s west side became known worldwide for churning out amateur and professional champions in boxing — a sport known as the “sweet science” by boxing devotees — a little girl from the neighborhood witnessed another activity that left a sweet and lasting impression on her.
“I was mesmerized,” recalls Debra White-Hunt, who came to the rec center at 5555 McGraw that day in 1961 to play softball, but afterward found her 10-year-old eyes glued to a group of dancers that were putting on an exhibition at Kronk. “My dad was an athlete and the recreation centers in Detroit were very prevalent at that time, so he got us involved in the activities and my cousins and I would all be together.
“But that day, I just remember seeing the dancers.”
It could be said that the proud daughter of Jean and Sylvester White has never stopped seeing dancers. And White-Hunt’s connection to dancers has included co-founding and serving as the artistic director of the nonprofit Detroit-Windsor Dance Academy (DWDA), the oldest and largest dance institution of its kind in the city of Detroit, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary throughout 2024.
Today, DWDA operates a 10,000-square-foot dance studio located on the second level of New Center One, 3031 W. Grand Blvd. Like the venerable Detroit recreation centers of White-Hunt’s childhood, DWDA has enriched Detroit by serving up dance and life lessons to more than 15,000 students ranging in age from 2 to 95 since its creation.
As a result, White-Hunt has received numerous accolades for making significant contributions to the community, including induction into the Michigan Women’s Hall of Fame in 2021. However, as White-Hunt explained while speaking from her northwest Detroit home on Jan. 16, being a “community leader” or even an inspiration to others was not exactly her intention when she began her journey with dance that has now extended more than 60 years.
“I never looked at it like that (as something that would lift my community),” White-Hunt, who has helped to shape the lives of dancers that have performed on five continents, said. “I just knew that dance was on my heart and on my spirit.”
“The Dance Theatre of Harlem came to campus and I had never seen anything like that in my life,” remembers White-Hunt, who, while pursuing a bachelor’s degree in theater education at Michigan State with a minor in dance, also began making trips to New York for further dance training. “To see Black dancers doing ballet —something they said we couldn’t do — was outside of my head until that moment. Then it became a dream that I knew I had to follow.”
White-Hunt’s first experience watching the dancers at Kronk immediately led to her being signed up for dance classes at the rec center. Also working in White-Hunt’s favor as she was discovering a new passion was a Detroit Public Schools system, which offered what White-Hunt described as the “best-kept secret” in the form of vibrant dance programs during the time she attended Detroit schools, including Sill Elementary, Condon Middle School and Mumford High School, where White-Hunt graduated in 1968 at the tender age of 16. But it was an experience outside of Detroit, which took place roughly 90 miles west of her hometown on the campus of Michigan State University, where White-Hunt says she began to think about dance in a more expansive way.
By pursuing her dream, White-Hunt says she also discovered that dance was in sync with another passion she had as a young girl that had yet to be extinguished — science.
“In school, I had been interested in studying the sciences — I wanted to do something to save the world,” explained White-Hunt, who seemed to be having a brief flashback to one of her earlier science classes in school as she enthusiastically identified “rainforests” and “curing diseases” as topics and challenges that she once wanted to tackle. “But through dance, I began to experience a ‘clear sense of the divinity’ and I said to myself: ‘That’s it!’ I was able to see that movement and dancing and exercise was a way to save the world.”
As an artist, dancer, choreographer, writer, artistic director and educator, White-Hunt has tried her best to use her multiple talents for the betterment of her community and the world. However, out of all of the hats that she has worn so well, there is something about being an “educator” that has caused White-Hunt to go the extra mile. In fact, it was the educator in White-Hunt that led her and her husband, Bruce Hunt, to launch DWDA in 1984 inside a small studio space in the Harmonie Park neighborhood, because White-Hunt had been teaching a group of inspired students during the summer who wanted to continue, and the dedicated teacher refused to let her pupils down.
“I’ve seen dance bring out the best in our students,” said White-Hunt, whose students have gone on to experience success in a broad spectrum of careers, including Broadway performers, doctors, entrepreneurs, government officials, lawyers, movie and television actors, television news anchors and more. “We strive for perfection, but we accept excellence. And we do that by providing a space where our students can evolve, grow, learn, make mistakes and be challenged.”
When White-Hunt speaks softly but passionately about how DWDA has transformed thousands of lives, and how her life has been transformed by her loving family, friends and community members that have embraced her “dream” during the past 40 years to make DWDA successful, it is a little hard to believe other words she has spoken to those who know her best about she and Bruce wanting to “pass the torch” of leading the organization to the next generation. And on Jan. 16, moments before she reeled off a host of “wonderful plans” that DWDA has in store for the community during 2024, including a Black History Month Concert; Crystal Ball in April; Annual Concert in June; collaborations with Detroit artists; and even a spelling bee to complement DWDA’s vast menu of dance classes — White-Hunt confirmed that she and Bruce are indeed looking forward to handing over the leadership reins. But for that to happen, White-Hunt says that any future leaders of DWDA must embrace the “values and integrity” of an organization that has literally withstood some of the coldest days Michigan has dished out, as she described in a story about Bruce from DWDA’s early days.
“We had classes in places with no heat, but a couple of hours before class Bruce would come in with heaters to heat the place up and class would go on,” recalls White-Hunt, who was reliving that moment on a frigid morning that matched the scene she was describing.
White said that act on a cold day, and the countless other “heroic” deeds that have been performed to keep DWDA going for 40 years, represents what the community has felt about her organization. But also the immense importance of dance as an art form.
“Dance frees us; liberates us; heals us! It gives us a reason to live,” White said with a smile that could be felt through the phone.

Work on the Grade II listed building at Yarm, in Stockton, has seen bricked arches opened up and fitted with glass.
The focal point is a permanent display called Island in a River, including artefacts paired with 10 related films.
Among the items is a replica of a 10th-Century Viking helmet said to be the first found in Britain.
Also on show is a silver nose, inspired by local man Tom Brown who lost part of his in battle and was reputedly the last soldier to be knighted on the battlefield.
The exhibited nose was cast on a veteran from Yarm.
Recent history comes in the form of a stone lion from the entrance of the former Tall Trees nightclub, with a film featuring the venue's owner and contributions from clubbers who went on to live on the site.
The objects are housed in a replica Iron-Age canoe carved by a volunteers from a tree trunk washed up at Tees Barrage.
It was inspired by a prehistoric canoe found when the foundations of Yarm Viaduct were being dug in the 19th Century.
""That's possibly the earliest known sign of habitation in Yarm and it all links back to the river,"" said artist Matthew Rosier, who created the exhibition.
""The idea was to contain all of these objects and so bring that ancient connection to the River Tees back into the middle of Yarm and into this heritage centre, which feels like an island in the river of this amazing high street.""
A holographic film of the River Tees will be projected on to the canoe installation at night, referring to floods which have submerged the area over the years.
Mr Rosier said it had been ""an absolutely massive community endeavour"" with almost 100 people contributing to the displays.
The work was paid for with money from the government's Levelling Up fund and contributions were also made by Stockton Council and Yarm Town Council.
Councillor Peter Monck, town council chairman, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service the exhibition was ""absolutely fantastic"".

Pressed by ABC “This Week” co-anchor Martha Raddatz on the dip in support among Black voters, Quentin Fulks, the principal deputy campaign manager for the Biden campaign, said, “Well, I think what a lot of people are expressing is urgency.”
“They sense a sense of urgency because of the threat that Republicans pose to, you know, America right now, and that’s precisely why the president and the vice president are running for reelection to make sure that that doesn’t happen,” Folks continued. “When it comes to African American voters, I want to be very clear about this, that no administration has done as much for the African American community as President Biden and Vice President Harris.”
Fulks pointed to the increase in the Black wealth gap and claimed the racial wealth gap is the lowest it’s “ever been in recorded history.”
Multiple polls in recent months have shown Biden struggling with Black voters. A November poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that 22 percent of voters in six battleground states said they would support former President Trump in this year’s election. While 71 percent of Black voters said they would support Biden, the numbers for Trump are the highest percentage a Republican presidential candidate has seen in a half-century.
One in five Black voters said they would vote for “someone else” rather than Biden or Trump in the 2024 presidential election, according to a GenForward survey released last month.
Fulks on Sunday touted a series of actions taken for the African American community and claimed the campaign has attempted to send a “clear signal” to these voters that they understand the importance of their vote.
“We’ve come out of the gate with very large buys targeted at African American voters, organizing in their communities to send a clear signal that one, we don’t take them for granted; two, we recognize that we need to earn their support in this campaign, and communicate with them all the way that what’s this administration has — all the work that this administration has done to make their lives better, and that has to also be in juxtaposition to the contrast of what, you know, the Republicans are putting forward,” Fulks said.
Fulks argued Republicans have “ripp[ed] away health care,” and he reminded viewers of Republicans’ vow to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

(AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)
RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The Palestinian death toll from the war between Israel and Hamas has soared past 25,000, the Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip said Sunday, while the Israeli government appeared far from achieving its goals of crushing the militant group and freeing more than 100 hostages.
The level of death, destruction and displacement from the war already is without precedent in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Yet Israeli officials say the fighting is likely to continue for several more months.
The slow progress and the plight of the hostages held in Gaza has divided ordinary Israelis and their leaders even as the offensive threatens to ignite a wider war involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that support the Palestinians.
The United States, which has provided essential diplomatic and military support for the offensive, has had limited success in persuading Israel to adopt military tactics that put civilians at less risk and to facilitate the delivery of more humanitarian aid. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has rejected U.S. and international calls for postwar plans that would include a path to Palestinian statehood.
GAZA DEATH TOLL CLIMBS AMID BLISTERING OFFENSIVE
The war began with Hamas’ surprise attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, during which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostages back to Gaza.
Israel responded with a blistering three-week air campaign and then a ground invasion into northern Gaza that laid waste to entire neighborhoods. Ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation.
Israel continues to carry out airstrikes throughout the besieged territory, including areas in the south where it told civilians to seek refuge. Many Palestinians have ignored evacuation orders, saying nowhere feels safe.

Since the war started, a total of 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, while another 62,681 have been wounded, the Health Ministry reported Sunday. The death toll included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza’s hospitals since Saturday, Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra said. Another 300 people were wounded in the past day, he said.
The overall toll is thought to be even higher because many casualties remain buried under the rubble from Israeli strikes or in areas where medics cannot reach them, Al-Qidra said.
The Health Ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its figures but says around two-thirds of the people killed in Gaza were women and minors.
The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but its casualty figures from previous wars were largely consistent with those of U.N. agencies and even the Israeli military.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense neighborhoods, often near homes, schools or mosques.
The military says 195 of its soldiers have been killed since the start of the Gaza offensive.
The war has displaced some 85% of Gaza’s residents from their homes, with hundreds of thousands packing into U.N.-run shelters and tent camps in the southern part of the tiny coastal enclave. U.N. officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as only a trickle of humanitarian aid reaches them because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions.
ISRAELIS INCREASINGLY DIVIDED
Netanyahu has vowed to keep up the offensive until Israel achieves “complete victory” over Hamas and returns all the remaining hostages. But even some top Israeli officials have begun to acknowledge that those goals might be mutually exclusive.
Hamas is believed to be holding the captives in tunnels deep underground and using them as shields for its top leaders. Israel has only managed to rescue one hostage since the war began, and Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations.
A member of Israel’s War Cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, said last week that the only way to free the remaining hostages was through a cease-fire. In an implicit criticism of Netanyahu, he said claims to the contrary amounted to “illusions.”
Hamas has said it will not free more hostages until Israel ends its offensive. The group also is expected to make any further releases conditional on securing freedom for thousands of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, including high-profile militants involved in attacks that killed Israelis.
Israel’s government has ruled that out for now, but it faces rising pressure from families of the hostages, who are pushing for another exchange, and from Israelis frustrated by the security failures that preceded the Oct. 7 attack and by Netanyahu’s handling of the war.
Thousands of people gathered in Tel Aviv over the weekend to call for new elections.
Netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners are meanwhile pushing him to step up the offensive, with some calling for the “voluntary” emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from the territory in 2005, two years before Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces.

Wells Fargo shouldn’t put its signage on the former Duke Energy building. This advertisement covering one of the tallest buildings in Charlotte would be a giant eyesore. The Truist building has words on it, but they’re smaller and the building doesn’t draw as much focus in our skyline. The proposed Wells Fargo sign is very big and would drastically change the beauty of the very recognizable building.

Pat Ryan’s Jan. 14 Opinion piece lost all credibility for me when he brought up UNC-Chapel Hill’s interim chancellor, Lee Roberts. A university chancellor with absolutely no experience in education? Colleges in the U.S. have been providing quality education for centuries without political interference. It’s a shame they can’t go on doing that in North Carolina.

Regarding “Three reasons we can’t seem to step off of the government-shutdown merry-go-round,” (Jan. 18 Opinion Extra):
There are more than three reasons we are unable to break the cycle of budget dysfunction. Leading the way? Courage.
Members of Congress know that doing the right thing and making the hard decisions means slashing the federal budget, reducing the non-Defense federal employment headcount, eliminating departments that are relics, and modifying the social safety net to ensure it remains sustainable long term — all of which will upset the status quo and put their reelection in jeopardy.
Primaries are not always a bad thing — not if they put the republic on stable financial footing.

Evangelical pastors are fostering comparisons of Donald Trump with Jesus. I understand that anything goes in politics, but ministers should be expected to stay within the vicinity of truth and accuracy.
Unlike Trump, Jesus never committed fraud, sexually abused a woman, lied constantly, sought revenge or retribution, or demeaned the weak, disabled or immigrants. It is disheartening to see “Christians” on TV earnestly make these comparisons. They honestly feel they represent true Christian understanding and values. The question is, whose Christianity? It seems some people are making it up as they go.

Regarding “For some, student debt forgiveness starts in February,” (Jan. 14):
Joe Biden should never have made a campaign promise to forgive student debt in the first place. It was a ploy to buy votes. The U.S. Supreme Court should declare the SAVE plan illegal. Parents and students knew what they were doing when they took out these loans. They should be held responsible for paying them back. Get a job, two or three jobs if necessary, and earn the living they need to pay their bills — just as we did.

A variety of local issues featured on the BBC News website, BBC Radio Solent and South Today.
We have picked five stories to keep you up to date.
A firefighter had his pickup truck stolen from outside a fire station while he was working a night shift.
The black Mitsubishi L200 was taken from the forecourt at Hartley Wintney station on Brewhouse Lane, Hampshire.
The fire station has appealed on social media to anyone who has any information that could help the police to find it, and those responsible for taking it.
A police car travelling at more than 100mph (160km/h) had to swerve to avoid an oncoming vehicle on the wrong side of a dual carriageway.
The near-miss happened on the eastbound A303 in Hampshire at about 20:45 GMT on 12 January.
A dashcam video captured the police car travelling at 117mph (188km/h) when the oncoming vehicle came into view, prompting an exclamation from the police driver.
Officers have appealed for help in tracing the driver of the red car which was travelling westbound between Norton and Micheldever Station.
A man has won the right to buy his late parents' farm after a judge dismissed claims of improper conduct involving stuffed fish.
Alister Cutts, 51, was offered Folds Farm near Fordingbridge, Hampshire, through a trust, the High Court heard.
However, his family challenged the £4.2m price, adding that exchanges of stuffed fish between Mr Cutts and a trustee were a sign of favouritism.
The judge, Master Julia Clark, said the fish allegation was ""unarguable"".

VGIBSIHGAH_DM4ZDOCZSIJUHVI,Ron DeSantis ends his struggling presidential bid before New Hampshire and endorses Donald Trump,The Associated Press,"January 22, 2024 at 5:24 AM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-desantis-ends-struggling-presidential-202450492.html,"MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended his Republican presidential campaign on Sunday, ending his 2024 White House bid just before the New Hampshire primary while endorsing his bitter rival Donald Trump.
The decision leaves Trump and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley as the last major candidates remaining in the race ahead of Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary. This is the scenario Trump’s foes in the GOP have long sought, raising the stakes for this week’s contest as the party’s last chance to stop the former president who has so far dominated the race.
But as some Trump critics cheered, DeSantis nodded toward Trump’s primary dominance — and attacked Haley — in an exit video he posted on social media.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” DeSantis said in the straight-to-camera video, delivered in a cheerful tone.
He continued: “I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
Haley spoke at a campaigning stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, just as DeSantis announced his decision.
“He ran a great race, he’s been a good governor, and we wish him well,” she told a room packed with supporters and media. “Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left.“
DeSantis’ decision, while perhaps not surprising given his 30-point blowout loss last week in Iowa, marks the end of an extraordinary decline for a high-profile governor once thought to be a legitimate threat to Trump’s supremacy in the Republican Party.His record wasn’t enough to overcome Trump
He entered the 2024 presidential contest with major advantages in his quest to take on Trump, and early primary polls suggested DeSantis was in a strong position to do just that. He and his allies amassed a political fortune well in excess of $130 million, and he boasted a significant legislative record on issues important to many conservatives, like abortion and the teaching of race and gender issues in schools.
Such advantages did not survive the reality of presidential politics in 2024. From a high-profile announcement that was plagued by technical glitches to constant upheavals to his staff and campaign strategy, DeSantis struggled to find his footing in the primary. He lost the Iowa caucuses — which he had vowed to win — by 30 percentage points to Trump.His departure was days in the making
DeSantis’ allies said that private discussions began shortly after Iowa to decide how to bow out of the race gracefully.
The Florida governor notified top donors and supporters of his decision through a series of phone conversations and text messages between senior campaign officials to top donors and supporters on Sunday afternoon, according to two people who received such communications. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose the private conversations.
DeSantis had returned to Florida by then after a roller-coaster weekend that included stops in South Carolina ahead of an event in New Hampshire Sunday evening that was ultimately canceled. The campaign also canceled a series of national television appearances earlier in the day, blaming the cancelation on a miscommunication with DeSantis’ super PAC.
DeSantis was physically worn after spending weeks on the campaign with little, if any, time off, even as he stormed across frigid Iowa and New Hampshire, often without a winter coat.A bitter rivalry comes to a meek end
He ultimately decided that he needed to endorse Trump given his popularity in the party despite the deeply personal feud between them.
“While I’ve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,” said DeSantis, who is in his second and final term as Florida’s governor, which ends in January 2027.
The endorsement was a stunning tail-between-his-legs moment for DeSantis, whom Trump has mercilessly and relentlessly taunted in deeply personal terms for the better part of a year now.
For Trump, whose team includes many former DeSantis staffers, the attacks have often felt more like sport than political strategy. Trump and his aides have blasted the governor as disloyal for running in the first place, mocked his eating habits and his personality, and accused him of wearing high heels to boost his height.
DeSantis’ team joined Trump in attacking Haley as news of his departure rippled across the political landscape. Some doubt Haley, who was seen as splitting Republican votes and preventing a head-to-head matchup between Trump, would benefit from DeSantis’ decision.
“She will not be the nominee,” key DeSantis supporter Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told AP. “She will not be the president of the United States.”
Trump had already shifted his focus to Haley in recent weeks, but minutes after DeSantis’ announcement, the former president’s campaign released a new memo highlighting the pressure on Haley to win New Hampshire.
“Now that we are a mere 48 hours from the primary, the tone has shifted mightily. We see it, you see it, but make no mistake, if Nikki Haley loses in New Hampshire — there are only two options,” wrote senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.
“Option A: Nikki Haley drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden,” they wrote. “Option B: Nikki Haley prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARRASSED in her home state of South Carolina,” which votes on Feb. 24.
“Now, for some important advice,” they continued. “Choose wisely.”
Trump himself addressed DeSantis’ departure shortly after it was announced during a stop at Manchester campaign headquarters, according to a video shared by his staff.
“We just got some word that one of our opponents, very capable person, is dropping out of the race — Ron DeSantis. And Ron is dropping out and, in doing so, he endorsed us,” Trump said to cheers, before a “Trump!” chant broke out in the room of volunteers.
Asked if he would be using the nickname “Ron DeSanctimonious”: “I said that name is officially retired,” he said to loud cheers.
At roughly the same time not far away, DeSantis’ dejected supporters gathered privately in the Manchester restaurant where he had been scheduled to speak.
Rep. James Spillane, of Deerfield, said he had initially backed Trump, switched to DeSantis and will now vote for Trump.
“I had a suspicion this morning, and I had talked to some friends of mine saying the way I was hearing things shake out, I thought this was going to happen, and I was right,” he said. “Unfortunately, DeSantis is not going to be able to make it forward. However, in the future, hopefully we can have a viable way forward in 2028.”

VHJVDP30IA_N6FK7D6U1FKFRGC,"Protests against Germany's far right draw hundreds of thousands — in Munich, too many for safety",Associated Press,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 11:01 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/across-germany-anti-far-protests-165910398.html,"BERLIN (AP) — A protest against the far right in the German city of Munich Sunday afternoon ended early due to safety concerns after approximately 100,000 people showed up, police said. The demonstration was one of dozens around the country this weekend that drew hundreds of thousands of people in total.
The demonstrations came in the wake of a report that right-wing extremists recently met to discuss the deportation of millions of immigrants, including some with German citizenship. Some members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, were present at the meeting.
In the western city of Cologne, police confirmed “tens of thousands” of people showed up to protest on Sunday, and organizers spoke of around 70,000 people. A protest Sunday afternoon in Berlin drew at least 60,000 people and potentially up to 100,000, police said, according to the German news agency dpa.
A similar demonstration Friday in Hamburg, Germany’s second-largest city, drew what police said was a crowd of 50,000 and had to be ended early because of safety concerns. And Saturday protests in other German cities like Stuttgart, Nuremberg and Hannover drew tens of thousands of people.
Although Germany has seen other protests against the far right in past years, the size and scope of protests being held this weekend — not just in major cities, but also in dozens of smaller cities across the country — are notable. The large turnout around Germany showed how these protests are galvanizing popular opposition to the AfD in a new way.
The AfD is riding high in opinion polls: recent surveys put it in second place nationally with around 23%, far above the 10.3% it won during the last federal election in 2021.
In its eastern German strongholds of Brandenburg, Saxony and Thuringia, the AfD is leading the polls ahead of elections this fall.
The catalyst for the protests was a report from the media outlet Correctiv last week on an alleged far-right meeting in November, which it said was attended by figures from the extremist Identitarian Movement and from the AfD. A prominent member of the Identitarian Movement, Austrian citizen Martin Sellner, presented his “remigration” vision for deportations, the report said.
The AfD has sought to distance itself from the extremist meeting, saying it had no organizational or financial links to the event, that it wasn’t responsible for what was discussed there and members who attended did so in a purely personal capacity. Still, one of the AfD’s co-leaders, Alice Weidel, has parted ways with an adviser who was there, while also decrying the reporting itself.
Prominent German politicians and elected officials voiced support for the protests Sunday, joining leaders from major parties across the spectrum who had already spoken out.
“The future of our democracy does not depend on the volume of its opponents, but on the strength of those who defend democracy,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a video statement. Those turning out to protest, he added, “defend our republic and our constitution against its enemies.”"
VHRSAKFHJ5_KBHPFHSHBCM1Y70,Why Horizon is just the tip of the iceberg for Britain’s crumbling IT,James Titcomb,"January 21, 2024 at 7:00 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-horizon-just-tip-iceberg-100000076.html,"Imagine if four in every five bridges built in Britain fell down. There would be national outrage. The companies building those bridges, the civil servants who ordered them and the ministers in charge would all likely pay with their jobs or worse.
Fortunately, the majority of bridges do not tend to fall over. But there is one area that suffers such rates of failure.
Twenty years ago, researchers at Oxford calculated that 84pc of large IT projects in the UK failed in some form – either by being cancelled, failing to deliver, arriving late, or going significantly over budget.
Software and bridges are not the same. But growing anger about the Post Office Horizon scandal has shone a new light on the dismal record in building IT systems.
Faulty software built by the Japanese tech giant Fujitsu led to hundreds of sub-postmasters’ lives being ruined after misguided prosecutions.
We are becoming increasingly reliant on computer systems across our lives. Could another Horizon scandal be lurking in the code?
In 2011, a committee of MPs called the Government’s approach to IT a “recipe for rip-offs” while researchers have called Britain “a world leader in ineffective IT schemes for government”.
Insiders describe a sclerotic approach to computer systems and a chronic shortage of skilled staff, with Westminster captured by an oligopoly of IT giants growing rich.
Last year, Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee warned that Britain’s IT infrastructure continued to be utterly reliant on ageing computer systems, with civil servants more likely to expensively prolong the lifespan of old programmes rather than risk starting afresh.
This, critics say, has led to an embarrassing litany of failures in the computer systems that the country relies on for everything from pensions to stopping airliners from crashing into one another.
The failures of Fujitsu’s Horizon system, in which transactions were often double-counted, leading to artificial deficits at Post Offices, have attracted enormous attention because of the miscarriages of justice it led to: sub-postmasters being prosecuted, jailed and committing suicide.
Those cases emerged because the Post Office vigorously pursued private prosecutions aided by its own investigative branch.
But it is only one of a series of notorious public computing projects that have failed to deliver. They include New Labour’s botched National Programme for IT in the NHS, which was abandoned more than a decade after it was announced and as it was billions over budget; and Fujitsu’s Libra, designed to provide a national system for magistrates, which was described as “one of the worst IT projects ever seen” and partly taken away from the Japanese giant after going hugely over budget.
There are also the systems that did come into use and failed those who rely on them. In 2020, a botched Ofqual algorithm caused mayhem in schools when it was used to deliver A-level results while schools were shut.
Last year, 2,000 flights were cancelled after a bespoke air traffic control software system crashed.
“Horizon is an extreme example of this but from a technical point of view there are other systems that are similarly parlous and poorly designed,” says Mike Bracken, who ran the Government Digital Service and is a founding partner at the Public Digital consultancy.
He adds that the Post Office scandal was made worse by inadequate technical knowledge and governance.
“The other key issue with Horizon is that the Post Office was judge and jury and could choose to prosecute.”
Britain was once a world leader in major IT systems. Colossus, the pioneering programmable computer used by the Bletchley Park codebreakers during the Second World War, was actually designed by a Post Office engineer.
The Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency was credited with developing technical skills within government until it was wound down at the end of the century.
Instead, in the Nineties, successive governments embarked on a series of giant IT projects, outsourced to a handful of large companies.
In 1994, Inland Revenue awarded a 10-year £3bn contract to the US software giant EDS, founded by the two-time presidential candidate Ross Perot. As part of the deal, 1,900 IT staff at Inland Revenue moved to the company.
The deal would eventually go wrong when EDS’s system failed to handle new tax credits, but at first it was seen as enough of a success to be imitated across the public sector. Enormous contracts were awarded, almost exclusively to the major IT companies large enough to handle them: the likes of Capgemini, Accenture, IBM – and Fujitsu.
Helen Margetts, a professor of internet and society at the Oxford Institute and director of the Alan Turing Institute’s Public Policy Programme, says this separated Britain from many other countries modernising their own systems.
“What was unique about the UK was the size and length of the contracts, these were really big contracts that fewer and fewer companies could bid for, we were outsourcing entire IT divisions,” she says.
“All the expertise was stripped out. Contracts got bigger and bigger and people in government became less and less keen on being involved. The companies promised to take over all the misery and risk of these great big contracts.”
Very public failures such as the fiasco around the National Programme for IT at the NHS, combined with pressure on the public finances, led the Coalition government to declare in 2010 that the era of “mega IT contracts” had come to an end.
Techies returned to Whitehall as part of a Government Digital Service division, which led to relative successes such as the unified gov.uk website.However, reversing the mistakes of the last three decades has been slow. Fujitsu has won £4.9bn of public contracts since a court found in 2019 that the Horizon system was at fault.
Much of that has been spent on extending the life of existing systems, leaving services reliant on ageing technology.
Last year, the Public Accounts Committee found that departments were continuing to use outdated “legacy” systems instead of building new ones fit for the 21st century, in part because of a lack of skills.
“These have resulted in services which, although they might look good on the surface, are costly and problematic to run,” it said.In one case in 2014, Whitehall struck a £5.8m deal with Microsoft to support tens of thousands of computers still running Microsoft’s 13-year-old XP operating system, rather than upgrade to a modern version.
Some systems such as those for paying pensions and managing borders date back to the 1970s.In a blog post last week, Bracken decried a “yawning gap in knowledge and curiosity around technology [that] remains true across senior levels of government, the civil service, parliament, and the judiciary… buttressed by a marriage of convenience between those leaders and large enterprise IT companies like Fujitsu”.
He added: “When the alternative is for them to engage in wicked problems that are unglamorous, difficult to understand and do their careers little good, many are all [too] happy to hand over cash and control to the contractors.”
Margetts says a continued reliance on old computer systems, rather than replacing them with modern ones, has set us up poorly for advances in areas such as artificial intelligence.
Both the Conservatives and Labour believe they can modernise the state using AI. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt last week said at Davos that he hoped to harness the technology to make public sector services more efficient.
However, these systems rely on vast quantities of data that are inaccessible on our ageing computer systems.
Margetts says: “It makes it difficult for agencies to innovate when you’re operating from a very old system that doesn’t generate data.”
Outrage about the Post Office scandal has led to promises that the victims’ injustices will be resolved swiftly. Fixing Britain’s shaky IT systems will take far longer.

VHXQHJOD72_62C0PXXZGHGUU1A,The past three years for Artis Real Estate Investment Trust (TSE:AX.UN) investors has not been profitable,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 9:34 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/past-three-years-artis-real-123426916.html,"While it may not be enough for some shareholders, we think it is good to see the Artis Real Estate Investment Trust (TSE:AX.UN) share price up 15% in a single quarter. But that cannot eclipse the less-than-impressive returns over the last three years. Truth be told the share price declined 36% in three years and that return, Dear Reader, falls short of what you could have got from passive investing with an index fund.
Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
View our latest analysis for Artis Real Estate Investment Trust
There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
Over the three years that the share price declined, Artis Real Estate Investment Trust's earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. Extraordinary items contributed to this situation. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. But it's safe to say we'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result!
The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).
We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Artis Real Estate Investment Trust's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Artis Real Estate Investment Trust the TSR over the last 3 years was -19%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!
Investors in Artis Real Estate Investment Trust had a tough year, with a total loss of 20% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 2.9%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.0% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted  3 warning signs for Artis Real Estate Investment Trust  (of which 2 make us uncomfortable!) you should know about.

VIRD43FTXU_GFTUZMLIQ8MRSEQ,Penny Mordaunt raises fears over Navy failing to ‘keep pace’ with Russia and China,Charles Hymas,"January 21, 2024 at 10:32 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/penny-mordaunt-warns-britain-national-115925417.html,"Cabinet tensions over defence spending have surfaced as Penny Mordaunt warned Britain’s national interests are at risk unless the Royal Navy keeps pace with nations such as Russia and China.
Ms Mordaunt, a former defence secretary and leadership candidate, tweeted her warning above an image of a press article chronicling the decline in the size of the Royal Navy to a fraction of what it was in the last century.
It came as Defence Secretary Grant Shapps failed to set a date for hitting the Government’s target of increasing defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP, saying it would only be achieved “when economic conditions allow”.
It emerged earlier this month that the Navy is facing such a severe recruitment crisis that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is planning to decommission two ships to free up sailors for a new fleet of frigates.
The size of the Royal Navy fleet has fallen from 232 ships, including eight aircraft carriers, in 1960 to 30 in 2022, including two new aircraft carriers.
But, in her tweet, Ms Mordaunt, an honorary captain in the Royal Navy Reserve and MP for Portsmouth North, said: “The Royal Navy and its partners must keep pace with the growing capabilities of other nations. If not, Britain’s interests cannot be secured.”
In the article in The Sunday Times, she added: “We must not just ask ourselves by how much Russia and China are increasing their fleets, but why.
“The future Royal Navy must be able to continue to secure our interests, which are entirely predicated on being able to thwart attempts to deny us access to the seas of certain parts of the world.”
Mr Shapps was challenged on the BBC to set a date for hitting the 2.5 per cent target at a time when he had warned about rising global threats.
He said it was “comfortably” above 2 per cent of GDP – the Nato benchmark – but not at 2.5 per cent yet. “There is a trajectory upwards. I can’t give you the exact date because we’ve always said it’s as the economic conditions allow. But the point is we’re working to a plan,” he added.
Responding to Ms Mordaunt’s comments, Mr Shapps said: “I’m in a post where there are a lot of people with opinions and a lot of people who’ve been in the military and armed forces will often express them.”
He defended the Chancellor’s focus on tax cuts rather than increasing defence spending, arguing “people do want to see more of the money that they earn kept”.
Last week, Mr Shapps made the case for increased Western defence spending, saying the UK was facing a “pre-war world”. In a speech last Monday, he set out the risks posed by countries, including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, as well as terrorist groups in an increasingly dangerous world.
The speech was seen as a pitch by Mr Shapps for extra defence spending. Before taking on the defence brief, Mr Shapps had backed a level of spending in excess of the Government’s goal, arguing it should rise to 3 per cent.
Last week, Lord Dannatt, a former chief of the general staff, hit out at the shrinking size of the Army, which he said had fallen from 102,000 in 2006 to 74,000 today “and falling fast”.
He drew parallels with the 1930s when the “woeful” state of the UK’s armed forces failed to deter Hitler, saying there was “a serious danger of history repeating itself”.
But Mr Shapps insisted the size of the Army would not dip below 73,000 under the Tories. He said: “It’s not projected to go down to 50,000. It’s actually, specifically, to 73,000, plus the reserves.”

VJFMN8UO8V_IGQ0PYBHQGH6VQD,Japan is now the 5th country to land on the Moon – the technology used will lend itself to future lunar missions,"Mariel Borowitz, Georgia Institute of Technology","January 21, 2024 at 11:03 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-now-5th-country-land-140329119.html,"Japan landed its Smart Lander for Investigating the Moon, or SLIM, craft on the surface of the Moon on Jan. 20, 2024. Despite a power issue with the lander, the event holds both political and technical importance. It’s Japan’s first lunar landing – making it only the fifth country in the world to successfully land on the Moon. This is a significant achievement and solidifies Japan’s position as a leader in space technology.
While the craft landed successfully on the lunar surface and deployed its rovers, SLIM’s solar cells were not functioning properly – meaning that the craft could likely only operate for a few hours.
I’m a scholar of international affairs who studies space. Like NASA and other space agencies, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA, wants to advance research and technology by demonstrating new techniques and collecting scientific data. The landing is also a part of something bigger – a growing global interest in lunar activity.
Japan’s achievement isn’t only symbolic – Japan is demonstrating a number of new technologies with the lander. The name, Smart Lander for Investigating the Moon, refers to the spacecraft’s new precision-landing technology.
This technology could assist future landings by allowing spacecraft to land in relatively small areas amid rocky or uneven terrain, rather than having to find large clearings. This ability will be particularly important in the future as countries focus on very specific areas of interest at the lunar south pole.
The lander also carried two small rovers, each of which will demonstrate a new technology for moving on the Moon.
Lunar Excursion Vehicle 1 includes a camera, as well as scientific equipment, and uses a hopping mechanism to maneuver on the Moon.
Lunar Excursion Vehicle 2, developed in a partnership among government, industry, and academia, is a sphere small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Once on the surface, its two halves separate slightly, allowing it to roll around.
SLIM is designed to land within a 328-foot (100-meter) zone, far smaller than previous lunar landers which have had landing zones spanning multiple kilometers.
SLIM used a vision-based navigation system that took images of the lunar surface. Its system rapidly compared these images to crater patterns on lunar maps that JAXA developed with data from previous missions.
As countries identify areas that are most likely to hold useful resources, such as water in the form of ice, precision landing technology will allow agencies to avoid nearby hazards and reach these areas without incident.
There is a geopolitical element to these activities. China, India and Japan – the three nations that have successfully landed on the Moon since 2000 – engage in regional competition across a number of areas, including space. In addition to regional considerations, these accomplishments help to establish nations as leaders on a global scale – capable of something that few nations have ever done.
Japan’s launch comes only six months after India’s Moon landing and just weeks after a failed attempt by a U.S. company, Astrobotic.
Both Russia and the private company iSpace made unsuccessful landing attempts in 2023. Japan’s success in landing on the Moon – even with solar panel issues shortening the timeline for the mission – demonstrates that JAXA is a major player in this global endeavor.
Despite recent setbacks, such as NASA announcing delays to its next Artemis mission, the U.S. is still a clear leader in space and lunar exploration. NASA has multiple spacecraft orbiting the Moon right now, and it’s already successfully launched the SLS rocket, which is capable of taking humans back to the Moon.
NASA is developing very large and complex systems internally – like the Gateway space station, planned to orbit near the Moon, and the infrastructure for the Artemis human Moon missions. It’s not uncommon for these large and complex efforts to experience some delays.
NASA has also turned many smaller-scale efforts over to commercial entities lately – like in the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program that supported Astrobotic’s attempt. This is a new approach that involves some risk, but provides the opportunity for commercial innovation and growth of the lunar economy while giving NASA the ability to focus on big, complex aspects of the mission.
With regard to the Moon, JAXA has partnered with the U.S. and taken on a very important component of the Artemis missions – the development of a pressurized lunar rover. This is a new and complex technology that will be critical to human missions on the Moon in coming years.

Ahead of his sentencing next week for stealing the famous shoes, an ageing mobster has appealed to a US court not to transport him to prison.
Terry Jon Martin, 76, who broke into the Judy Garland Museum in 2005, was lured into “one last score” by an associate who told him the shoes must have been festooned with real jewels to be worth the $1 million they were insured for.
Martin was convinced the slippers were encrusted with real rubies and kept them at a trailer next to his home, his lawyer said in a statement ahead of his client’s sentencing on Jan 29.
His hopes of seeing out his final days on the proceeds were thwarted when a fence said the rubies were, in fact, glass.
The mobster gave the slippers away within two days of stealing them.
They were recovered by the FBI in 2018 and Martin was charged with stealing them last year.
Dane DeKrey, defending, told the court Martin had not committed a crime since being released from prison nearly a decade before the theft of the slippers.
“At first, Terry declined the invitation to participate in the heist. But old habits die hard, and the thought of a ‘final score’ kept him up at night.
“After much contemplation, Terry had a criminal relapse and decided to participate in the theft.”
He had never seen The Wizard of Oz and had no idea of the significance of the slippers, Mr DeKrey added.
Now wheelchair-bound, requiring oxygen at all times and living in a hospice, Martin has a life expectancy of less than six months.
“I think when someone is at the end of their life, they are making decisions that are right for their affairs, and this short answer is because he’s guilty,” he added. “I think he wanted to take responsibility and move on with his life – the little life he has left.”
Both Mr DeKrey and prosecutors are recommending that Martin be sentenced to “time served”, rather than being returned to prison.
In any case, they argue, his poor health might be grounds for release on compassionate grounds.
Martin’s life had been difficult, his lawyer added, having been mistreated in childhood by a cruel stepmother and his three brothers.
Leaving home at 16, he embarked on a life of crime, being convicted of a string of offences including burglary and receiving stolen goods.
When Martin left prison in 1996 he turned his back on crime and became a “contributing member of society”.
But tragedy struck when his month-old twins were killed when his girlfriend’s car was hit by a train after a prison visit.
It drove him back to his old ways.
Martin had never sought to claim a share of the $200,000 reward offered for the slippers.
It was claimed by an associate who approached the insurers in 2017 and the slippers were recovered following an FBI sting operation the following year.
They were in “pristine” condition.
The slippers had been loaned to the Garland Museum by Michael Shaw, a collector of Hollywood memorabilia.
They were one of four pairs worn by Judy Garland in the 1939 classic, which won five Oscars including Best Film.
Their authenticity was confirmed by comparing them to another pair which was held at the Smithsonian’s Museum of American History in Washington.
“The slippers are instantly recognisable,” Colin Gardner, distinguished professor emeritus of critical theory at the University of California Santa Barbara, told The Telegraph
“The Wizard of Oz is absolutely central to the history of American cinema, much like Star Wars for the next generation.
“America in 1939 was Roosevelt’s New Deal-era and there was a lot of money being pumped into the arts.
“The film was trying to give Americans a picture of optimism at the end of the depression just as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies were about raising people’s spirits during the 1930s.
“The disappearance of the slippers was a tragedy. But they have been been recovered. This is a really sad story. But given how sick the culprit is now, they shouldn’t jail him.”’

VR95DF6WFS_N1NKIGK5DSS93DM,Zelenskiy counts on more Western defence aid for Ukraine in next two months,Nick Starkov,"January 21, 2024 at 8:24 AM·1 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/zelenskiy-counts-more-western-defence-232406210.html,"By Nick Starkov
KYIV (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that he expected a number of new Western defence packages for Ukraine to be signed this and next month.
""We are preparing new agreements with partners - strong bilateral agreements,"" Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.
""January and February should bring corresponding results. There are already specific dates when new and strong documents can be expected.""
After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv's Western allies united in providing unprecedented military and other aid to help Zelenskiy defend his country.
But with the war now dragging on towards its third year, little change along the front line in the past 12 months and growing opposition to more aid in the United States, funds and equipment in recent months have been slow coming in.
Zelenskiy did not name the countries with which he hoped to finalise agreements. The Ukrainian president has spent weeks on an international diplomatic frenzy trying to secure more political and military support.
He has often repeated that Russia's increased winter air strikes and Moscow's slow but gruelling offensive in Ukraine's east have underlined the need for more reinforcement of Kyiv's air and ground defences.
Earlier this month, Britain, one of Kyiv's staunchest supporters, said it will increase its support for Ukraine in the next financial year to 2.5 billion pounds ($3.19 billion).
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he would head to Ukraine in February to finalise a bilateral security guarantee deal under which Paris would deliver more sophisticated weaponry, including long-range cruise missiles.

""The one thing that we've got is time,"" Gordon Chang, Gatestone Institute senior fellow and China expert, explained. ""The United States is not ready to defend itself and its allies and partners, and by appeasing China we have bought a little bit of time.""
""Biden has bought time, and the Pentagon has done nothing. It hasn’t done as much as it’s needed to do, so we have wasted time. … Apart from that, I don’t think we’ve gotten very much.""
""Clearly, the United States is no longer deterring China as we once did, so this is the time to change a policy that has worked but is no longer sufficient in today’s setting.""
BIDEN ADMIN FAILING TO TRACK CHINESE OWNERSHIP OF US FARMLAND: GOVT WATCHDOG
President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2022 held their first face-to-face meeting since Biden took office while attending the G-20 summit in Indonesia. Last year, Xi visited the U.S. for the first time since 2018 and met with Biden in San Francisco on the sidelines of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
Xi and Biden agreed to military-to-military communications and aggressively tackle the manufacture and distribution of fentanyl, which largely originates in China and Mexico. Nearly all ""precursor chemicals"" needed to produce fentanyl originate in China, according to The Associated Press.
Last week, Biden National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos about the administration's progress with China.
""The United States is competing with China across multiple dimensions, and we make no bones about that. But we are not looking for confrontation or conflict. And we are seeking to manage that competition responsibly, intensifying diplomacy to reduce the risk of miscalculation,"" Sullivan said.
Sullivan also highlighted the recent meeting between the two leaders and noted the resumption of military-to-military communications, claiming the move was ""good for our relationship but also for regional and global stability. It will help reduce the risk of unintended conflict.""
Yet critics like Chang harbor major criticism of the Biden administration for not taking action in response to the many deaths from COVID-19 and fentanyl, both originating in China. Over 1.1 million Americans died from the pandemic, according to numbers published in April 2023, and over 73,000 Americans died from fentanyl overdoses in the U.S. in 2022.
TAIWAN ELECTION: RULING PARTY CANDIDATE WINS TIGHTLY CONTESTED PRESIDENTIAL RACE, UPSETTING CHINA'S AMBITIONS
""To me, it's incomprehensible that we would allow this, but we have allowed the killing of Americans in great numbers,"" Chang said.
Critics and analysts had also expected stronger action from Biden following a tumultuous year for China-U.S. relations. The U.S. caught China sending spy crafts into sovereign American airspace, and China increased its incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ).
The Biden administration instead has spent time ramping up military drills with regional allies and strengthening ties with partners like Australia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan.
Japan this week agreed to buy 400 U.S.-made long-range Tomahawk missiles, just one day after holding a massive naval drill with both the U.S. and South Korea in a show of force against North Korea. But China will have paid attention to such a demonstration.
CHINA CONDEMNS PHILIPPINES AFTER PRESIDENT CONGRATULATES TAIWAN ELECTION WINNER
Matt McInnis, senior fellow for the Institute for the Study of War’s China program, told Fox News Digital he would hesitate to label the Biden administration’s total approach to China as one of appeasement, but he argued that the White House does show ""too much concern about provoking China.""
""The Biden administration has continued many of the policies of the Trump administration on China and is actually taking some strong steps in many areas with China, but I do think that inherent fear of provocation is setting us up — especially this year — for some concessions that are going to be detrimental.""
In addition to the spy balloon incident and a lack of significant U.S. response, the U.S. has not managed to convince China to curb North Korea, which continues to make greater and greater shows of force as the hermit kingdom’s Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un seeks to establish his country as a legitimate world power.
Chang argued that the soft touch with China has allowed the international system to break down as ""bad actors now feel they can do what they want."" He cited the escalating tensions last week between Iran and Pakistan as an example.
CHINA'S POPULATION FALLS AGAIN AS RECORD-LOW BIRTHS POSE ECONOMIC STRAINS
Chang criticized the Biden administration’s policy of ""strategic ambiguity,"" which administration spokespeople have cited in a variety of responses regarding America’s approach to China.
""Strategic ambiguity"" sees America oscillating between clear support for the One China Policy, which necessitates opposition to Taiwan’s independence, even as the Pentagon continues to arm Taiwan and prepare it for possible invasion.
Both China and North Korea have provided backdoor support for Russia, with North Korea providing basic munitions in a bid to obtain more advanced weapons from Moscow. China reiterated support for Russia after the failed Wagner mercenary rebellion against the Russian Ministry of Defense over disagreements regarding progress in Ukraine.
China has also only emboldened Iran, which has continued to push its proxies in the Middle East and fund their attacks against American military assets and allies in the region.
While the Iran-backed Houthis double down on their attacks against international commercial ships in the Red Sea, China looks to fold Iran into the BRICS economic bloc and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
""The more we restrict ourselves, that is going to set new norms that China can exploit and pressure us,"" McInnis said. ""We end up deterring ourselves and not getting much in return for it.""

VRY1HYITT9_GS9BA3ZUQQB1QCT,"In small-town Wisconsin, looking for the roots of the modern American conspiracy theory",TIM SULLIVAN,"January 21, 2024 at 9:12 PM·7 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/small-town-wisconsin-looking-roots-121208885.html,"APPLETON, Wis. (AP) — The decades fall away as you open the front doors.
It’s the late 1950s in the cramped little offices — or maybe the pre-hippie 1960s. It’s a place where army-style buzz cuts are still in fashion, communism remains the primary enemy and the decor is dominated by American flags and portraits of once-famous Cold Warriors.
At the John Birch Society, they’ve been waging war for more than 60 years against what they're sure is a vast, diabolical conspiracy. As they tell it, it’s a plot with tentacles that reach from 19th-century railroad magnates to the Biden White House, from the Federal Reserve to COVID vaccines.
Long before QAnon, Pizzagate and the modern crop of politicians who will happily repeat apocalyptic talking points, there was Birch. And outside these cramped small-town offices is a national political landscape that the Society helped shape.
“We have a bad reputation. You know: ‘You guys are insane,’” says Wayne Morrow, a Society vice president. He is standing in the group’s warehouse amid 10-foot (3-meter) shelves of Birch literature waiting to be distributed.
“But all the things that we wrote about are coming to pass.”
___
Back when the Cold War loomed and TV was still mostly in black and white, the John Birch Society mattered. There were dinners at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York and meetings with powerful politicians. There was a headquarters on each coast, a chain of bookstores, hundreds of local chapters, radio shows, summer camps for members’ children.
Well-funded and well-organized, they sent forth fevered warnings about a secret communist plot to take over America. It made them heroes to broad swaths of conservatives, even as they became a punchline to a generation of comedians.
“They created this alternative political tradition,” says Matthew Dallek, a historian at George Washington University and author of ""Birchers: How the John Birch Society Radicalized the American Right.” He says it forged a right-wing culture that fell, at first, well outside mainstream Republican politics.
Conspiracy theories have a long history in the United States, going back at least to 1800, when secret forces were said to be backing Thomas Jefferson’s presidential bid. It was a time when such talk moved slowly, spread through sermons, letters and tavern visits.
No more. Fueled by social media and the rise of celebrity conspiracists, the last two decades have seen ever-increasing numbers of Americans lose faith in everything from government institutions to journalism. And year after year, ideas once relegated to fringe newsletters, little-known websites and the occasional AM radio station pushed their way into the mainstream.
Today, outlandish conspiracy theories are quoted by more than a few U.S. senators, and millions of Americans believe the COVID pandemic was orchestrated by powerful elites. Prominent cable news commentators speak darkly of government agents seizing citizens off the streets.
But the John Birch Society itself is largely forgotten, relegated to a pair of squat buildings along a busy commercial street in small-town Wisconsin.
So why even take note of it today? Because many of its ideas — from anger at a mysterious, powerful elite to fears that America’s main enemy was hidden within the country, biding its time — percolated into pockets of American culture over the last half-century. Those who came later simply out-Birched the Birchers. Says Dallek: “Their successors were politically savvier and took Birch ideas and updated them for contemporary politics.”
The result has been a new political terrain. What was once at the edges had worked its way toward the heart of the discourse.
To some, the fringe has gone all the way to the White House. In the Society's offices, they’ll tell you that Donald Trump would never have been elected if they hadn’t paved the way.
“The bulk of Trump’s campaign was Birch,” Art Thompson, a retired Society CEO who remains one of its most prominent voices, says proudly. “All he did was bring it out into the open.”
There’s some truth in that, even if Thompson is overstating things.
The Society had spent decades calling for a populist president who would preach patriotism, oppose immigration, pull out of international treaties and root out the forces trying to undermine America. Trump may not have realized it, but when he warned about a “Deep State” — a supposed cabal of bureaucrats that secretly controls U.S. policy — he was repeating a longtime Birch talking point.
A savvy reality TV star, Trump capitalized on a conservative political landscape that had been shaped by decades of right-wing talk radio, fears about America’s seismic cultural shifts and the explosive online spread of misinformation.
While the Birch Society echoes in that mix, tracing those echoes is impossible. It's hard to draw neat historical lines in American politics. Was the Society a prime mover, or a bit player? In a nation fragmented by social media and offshoot groups by the dozens, there’s just no way to be sure. What is certain, though, is this:
“The conspiratorial fringe is now the conspiratorial mainstream,” says Paul Matzko, a historian and research fellow at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “Right-wing conspiracism has simply outgrown the John Birch Society.”
___
Their beliefs skip along the surface of the truth, with facts and rumors and outright fantasies banging together into a complex mythology. “The great conspiracy” is what Birch Society founder Robert Welch called it in “The Blue Book,” the collection of his writings and speeches still treated as near-mystical scripture in the Society’s corridors.
Welch, a wealthy candy company executive, formed the Society in the late 1950s, naming it for an American missionary and U.S. Army intelligence officer killed in 1945 by communist Chinese forces. Welch viewed Birch as the first casualty of the Cold War. Communist agents, he said, were everywhere in America.
Welch shot to prominence, and infamy, when he claimed that President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the hero general of World War II, was a “dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy.” Also under Kremlin control, Welch asserted: the secretary of state, the head of the CIA, and Eisenhower’s younger brother Milton.
Subtlety has never been a strong Birch tradition. Over the decades, the Birch conspiracy grew to encompass the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, public education, the United Nations, the civil rights movement, The Rockefeller Foundation, the space program, the COVID pandemic, the 2020 presidential election and climate-change activism. In short, things the Birchers don't like.
The plot’s leaders — “insiders,” in Society lexicon — range from railroad baron Cornelius Vanderbilt to former President George H.W. Bush and Bill Gates, whose vaccine advocacy is, they say, part of a plan to control the global population. While his main focus was always communism, Welch eventually came to believe that the conspiracy's roots twisted far back into history, to the Illuminati, an 18th-century Bavarian secret society.
By the 1980s, the Society was well into its decline. Welch died in 1985 and the society’s reins passed to a series of successors. There were internal revolts. While its aura has waned, it is still a force among some conservatives — its videos are popular in parts of right-wing America, and its offices include a sophisticated basement TV studio for internet news reports. Its members speak at right-wing conferences and work booths at the occasional county fair.
Scholars say its ranks are far reduced from the 1960s and early 1970s, when membership estimates ranged from 50,000 to 100,000. “Membership is something that has been closely guarded since day one,” says Bill Hahn, who became CEO in 2020. He will only say the organization “continues to be a growing operation.”
Today, the Society frames itself as almost conventional. Almost.
“We have succeeded in attracting mainstream people,” says Steve Bonta, a top editor for the Society’s New American magazine. The group has toned down the rhetoric and is a little more careful these days about throwing around accusations of conspiracies. But members still believe in them fiercely.
“As Mr. Welch came out with on Day One: There is a conspiracy,” Hahn says. “It’s no different today than it was back in December 1958.”
It can feel that way. Ask about the conspiracy’s goal, and things swerve into unexpected territory. The sharp rhetoric re-emerges and, once again, the decades seem to fall away.
“They really want to cut back on the population of the Earth. That is their intent,” Thompson says.
But why?
“Well, that’s a good question, isn’t it?” he responds. “It makes no sense. But that’s the way they think.”

Ron DeSantis, who entered the 2024 presidential race with a bankroll rivaling that of coup-attempting former President Donald Trump, dropped his bid for the GOP nomination on Sunday — and endorsed Trump on his way out.
“Nobody worked harder and we left it all out on the field,” DeSantis said in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, before going on to say, “If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome ― more campaign stops, more interviews ― I would do it.”
“But I can’t ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don’t have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.”
DeSantis then added that he was backing Trump over former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the remaining major candidate in the race.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” he said, adding, “He has my endorsement because we can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.”
At a campaign stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, Haley acknowledged DeSantis’ announcement.
“I want to say to Ron, he ran a great race. He’s been a good governor, and we wish him well. Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left,” she said.

The announcement comes just days after DeSantis claimed he had gotten his “ticket punched” to continue his campaign despite finishing a distant second to Trump in the Iowa caucuses. Late polls in that state showed that DeSantis could finish third behind Haley. When DeSantis ultimately finished just two points ahead of her, he tried to spin it as a victory ― even though he had previously said he had to win Iowa to win the nomination.
DeSantis was polling even worse in New Hampshire and South Carolina than he had been in Iowa, and his campaign seemed uncertain of a strategy going forward. His first stop after Iowa was a campaign visit to South Carolina, a contest that is a full month after New Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation primary on Tuesday. He was to return to New Hampshire on Friday, but then was planning to head back to South Carolina on Saturday.
Republicans who feared Trump could not win a general election, particularly wealthy party donors, had initially lined up behind DeSantis after his nearly 20-point reelection as governor in November 2022. That star power allowed him to continue collecting donations of unlimited size in a state account and eventually transfer more than $80 million into a federal super PAC created to support him.
But DeSantis’ high point in the campaign turned out to be just after that reelection victory, when some polls showed him actually ahead of Trump for the 2024 nomination.
However, that began to change quickly. Trump entered the race just weeks after those midterm elections and soon began attacking DeSantis in speeches, online and even in television ads.
DeSantis chose not to enter the race himself until the end of Florida’s legislative session in May, by which point he was polling only in the 20s both nationally and in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The poor polling resulted in weaker fundraising, which resulted in two rounds of staff layoffs and shakeups ― even though much of the logistical work of the campaign was effectively outsourced to the relatively flush Never Back Down super PAC.
An even bigger problem for DeSantis, though, may have been something even the best fundraising could do nothing about: his personality. Longtime Florida Republicans told HuffPost a year ago that DeSantis has never seemed to enjoy interacting with people.
That trait, as it turns out, became a major liability in a primary race that still places a high value on personal interactions with primary voters in the early voting states.
“His problem is that the more people see him, the less they like him,” said one influential New Hampshire Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Ron DeSantis ends presidential campaign, endorses Trump","Zac Anderson, Sarasota Herald-Tribune","Updated January 22, 2024 at 9:57 AM·9 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-gov-ron-desantis-ends-201330385.html,"After a meteoric rise that made him one of the most prominent Republicans in the country and led many to believe he was the GOP leader best positioned to move the Republican party past former President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday ended a presidential campaign that had been on a downward slide for months.
DeSantis immediately backed former President Donald Trump's campaign despite months of criticizing his performance in office, saying ""he has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear.""
DeSantis entered the race last May with sky high expectations after a dominating reelection victory in Florida vaulted him to the top of the list of presidential prospects. Polls in early 2023 showed him competitive with Trump.
Yet his campaign never came close to delivering on that early hype, and end up losing badly in Iowa last week. Polls showed DeSantis trailing by large margins in other early states, and he dropped out before what was likely to be a big loss in New Hampshire Tuesday.
""Nobody worked harder, and we left it all out on the field,"" DeSantis said in a video posted on X Sunday. ""Now following our second place finish in Iowa we've prayed and deliberated on the way forward. If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome ‒ more campaign stops, more interviews ‒ I would do it but I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign.""
DeSantis added that he believes most GOP primary votes want ""to give Donald Trump another chance.""
Trump's campaign said in a statement Sunday that ""we are honored by the endorsement of Governor Ron DeSantis"" and ""it is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump to defeat"" President Joe Biden. The comments mark an abrupt change in tone after more than a year of Trump mercilessly mocking DeSantis.
Once dubbed ""DeFuture"" of the GOP, DeSantis is now facing an uncertain political future after a bruising campaign marred by dysfunction and marked by GOP voters overwhelmingly rejecting him in favor of the former president.
DeSantis pledged to continue showing ""the country how to lead"" through his work ""down here in Florida."" He will be governor for nearly three more years and hinted that he may still harbor national political ambitions, quoting a line he attributed to Winston Churchill ‒ but that the International Churchill Society says the former United Kingdom prime minister never spoke ‒ that ""success is not final, failure is not fatal ‒ it is the courage to continue that counts.""
Yet the ineptitude his presidential campaign displayed from the beginning left many political observers marveling at how badly things went wrong.
DeSantis ran a hard right campaign that courted Trump's MAGA base, arguing he could deliver conservative policy victories that Trump failed to achieve and without the chaos and drama.
The pitch boiled down to Trump without the baggage, or ""Trump Lite.""
It didn't work.
Polls show most Republicans like DeSantis, but they like Trump more and the governor didn't offer them a good enough reason to move on from the former president.
DeSantis also found himself fighting against the powerful effect produced by Trump's four indictments, which led many Republicans to view him as a victim and rally around him. DeSantis' poll numbers began to sharply decline in April when the Manhattan district attorney issued the first indictment.
Trump's emotional hold on the GOP base always was going to be tough for DeSantis to break, but he made it more difficult by running a campaign plagued by frequent missteps.
There were problems right from the start. Technical glitches turned DeSantis' campaign launch on social media site X into a disaster. It proved to be a sign of things to come.
By July, DeSantis was laying off staff after burning through cash too quickly, and in August he switched campaign managers.
A decision to outsource much of his campaign to a super PAC, Never Back Down, also proved problematic. The PAC imploded amid friction with campaign staffers; top PAC leaders were fired or left.
Team DeSantis' troubles mastering the mechanics of running a presidential campaign were matched by the candidate's own struggles. Widely viewed as stiff and somewhat awkward when he started out, DeSantis took months to warm up and become more comfortable in the spotlight.
DeSantis later said he regretted shunning the mainstream media in the early part of the campaign and not making himself more available. That decision limited his reach early on, and may have stunted his growth as a candidate.
The question of how best to take on Trump also proved problematic for DeSantis, who for months before launching his campaign allowed the former president to routinely mock him and define him in the public eye without responding. Even after getting in the race, DeSantis was careful about how he attacked Trump, leading some supporters to express frustration that he was going easy on him.
Trump, meanwhile, savaged DeSantis in highly personal terms, branding him ""DeSanctimonious.""
Trump's aggressive criticism of DeSantis before he even announced his campaign is a sign that he once viewed him as a major threat.
Indeed, by the end of 2022 DeSantis had emerged as the most prominent Republican in the country other than Trump.
A little-known former congressman who eked out a narrow win in his first race for governor in 2018, DeSantis' rise to rock star status nationally in the GOP began during the COVID-19 pandemic when he fought to keep schools and businesses open.
The governor's strident stance against many COVID restrictions, including mask and vaccine mandates, thrilled conservatives and vaulted him into the national spotlight.
Subsequent culture war battles centered around race and LGBTQ issues only increased DeSantis' national standing within the GOP.
His record in Florida became the touchstone for DeSantis' presidential campaign. Battling with Disney, removing left-wing prosecutors and flying migrants to Martha's Vineyard became part of his presidential pitch as he sought to ""Make America Florida.""
Yet while Republican voters in interviews often said they liked DeSantis' record in Florida, it wasn't enough to sway them from Trump. That become clear in Iowa last week.
DeSantis launched his presidential bid with ambitions to run a national campaign, but recalibrated after a series of setbacks and instead focused heavily on Iowa, traveling the state relentlessly across all 99 counties and scoring key endorsements.
Fueled by $82.5 million DeSantis raised for his re-election bid and transferred over from a state committee, the Never Back Down super PAC flooded Iowa with door knockers as part of the most robust ground game mounted by any candidate. DeSantis also spent much of the $35 million he raised in his campaign account in Iowa.
DeSantis predicted he would win Iowa but ended up losing to Trump by 30 points. He initially said the second place finish meant his campaign “got our ticket punched out of Iowa,” and vowed to continue in the race, but many viewed the results as a resounding rejection.
Fundraising would have been be difficult going forward, and he faced the likelihood of trying to compete with significantly fewer resources.
At just 45, and with a broad network of supporters from his time as governor and running for president, DeSantis may still have a future in national politics.
A Des Moines Register/NBC News/Mediacom Iowa Poll from earlier this month show that 58% of GOP voters in that state view him favorably.
But that's a decrease from his 66% favorability rating from just a month ago.
The campaign took a toll on DeSantis' popularity, including in Florida where just 50% of voters in November – down from 54% four months earlier – said they approve of the job he is doing as governor, according to a Florida Atlantic University Survey.
With his eyes on winning a GOP presidential primary, DeSantis pushed through a series of highly controversial bills, such as a ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The FAU poll shows that nearly 60% of independents now disapprove of his job performance.
A prolonged battle with Trump was likely to erode DeSantis' standing with the GOP base and his hopes of running for another office. Exiting now and endorsing Trump could help preserve some of that political capital, even if it marks a jarring turnabout after months of fighting between the GOP heavyweights.
DeSantis took a shot at Trump's remaining primary challenger, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, in his remarks Sunday, saying she represents ""a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism.""
""The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology, are over,"" DeSantis said in remarks that may indicate he still hopes to inherit the MAGA wing of the party from Trump someday.
Haley, meanwhile, said that DeSantis ""ran a good race... he's been a good governor and he added a lot to the campaign.""
Democratic National Committee Press Secretary Sarafina Chitika said in a statement that DeSantis ""pinned his entire campaign’s hopes on the same extreme MAGA agenda that both Donald Trump and Nikki Haley are still running on, and now he is the latest member of the GOP to fall in line behind the original MAGA brand.""
DeSantis endorsed Trump a week after declaring in Iowa during one of his final rallies that “you can be the most worthless Republican in America but if you kiss the ring, he’ll say you’re wonderful.”
Even as DeSantis backed Trump Sunday, it was clear that the acrimony between the two campaigns has been intense, and often personal.
Trump campaign manager Susie Wiles, who once worked for DeSantis before being pushed out of his orbit, responded Sunday to a post on X foreshadowing his departure from the race with two words: ""Bye, bye.""

The software corporation disclosed in a regulatory filing that it detected a ""nation-state attack"" on its systems on Jan. 12. Microsoft identified the culprit as Midnight Blizzard, a Russian-state sponsored actor also known as Nobelium, and put a stop to the attack on Jan. 13.
According to the filing, Nobelium in November used a ""password spray attack"" -- a method of trying commonly used passwords -- to infiltrate a ""legacy"" account and then use that account's permissions to access a ""very small percentage"" of corporate email accounts.
The hacker group infiltrated email accounts belonging to Microsoft senior leadership, as well as employees in cybersecurity, legal and other departments, the company said.
Microsoft said Nobelium was initially searching for information regarding the group itself. There was no evidence that the group had any access to customer accounts or AI systems. Microsoft said it is currently notifying employees whose emails were accessed, and it will notify customers if any action is required on their end.
The company said the attack was not due to a vulnerability in its products or services, but it did highlight the continuous risk organizations face from ""well-resourced nation-state threat actors"" like Nobelium.
Nobelium also orchestrated the infamous 2020 attack on government software contractor SolarWinds, by which it sought to breach numerous government agencies, including the Pentagon.
Microsoft's report follows new government requirements for disclosing cybersecurity incidents. Under the new rules, companies must disclose any cybersecurity incident they deem to have a ""material impact"" and the scope and nature of that impact.
The company said it did not believe the attack had any material impact, but it still wanted to ""honor the spirit"" of the new rules."
WBZ4IGNRZE_QROQYH4E9LXNI1T,Trifast plc (LON:TRI) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 73% of the company,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 5:34 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trifast-plc-lon-tri-largely-083420882.html,"Significantly high institutional ownership implies Trifast's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions
54% of the business is held by the top 5 shareholders
Insiders have been buying lately
To get a sense of who is truly in control of Trifast plc (LON:TRI), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 73% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Trifast.
Check out our latest analysis for Trifast
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Trifast does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Trifast's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.
Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. It looks like hedge funds own 8.1% of Trifast shares. That catches my attention because hedge funds sometimes try to influence management, or bring about changes that will create near term value for shareholders. Slater Investments Limited is currently the largest shareholder, with 13% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 13% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 12% by the third-largest shareholder.
On looking further, we found that 54% of the shares are owned by the top 5 shareholders. In other words, these shareholders have a meaningful say in the decisions of the company.
While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.
The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.
We can see that insiders own shares in Trifast plc. In their own names, insiders own UK£6.9m worth of stock in the UK£125m company. This shows at least some alignment, but we usually like to see larger insider holdings. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 11% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Trifast that you should be aware of before investing here.
But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

NASHUA, New Hampshire (Reuters) -U.S. Representative Dean Phillips, attempting a longshot bid for the Democratic nomination, assailed Joe Biden as ""unelectable and weak"" on Saturday as he tried to take advantage of the president's absence from New Hampshire's primary.
Biden did not register for the New Hampshire after national Democrats opted to move their first primary to South Carolina, which offers a more diverse population.
But Biden's supporters are mounting a write-in campaign in New Hampshire to ensure a win in the state on Tuesday, and a CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released on Sunday showed Biden drawing 63% of the primary vote in that state, with Phillips at 10%.
The Democratic National Committee has ruled that the New Hampshire election effectively won’t count and the winner won't amass New Hampshire's 23 delegates in the march to the party's nomination.
Phillips, a wealthy Democrat from Minnesota, said during a campaign event in Nashua, New Hampshire, that he hoped to do well in Tuesday's voting.
Phillips said a strong showing by him would be getting upwards of 20% or more of the vote - ""going from zero to somewhere in the 20s would be pretty awesome, I think.""
""Sadly it's going to demonstrate that our incumbent president is unelectable and weak and I think it's going to show this country that there's a candidate here who can actually do here what has been promised for generations,"" Phillips told reporters after addressing dozens of people at a senior citizen activity center.
He also noted Biden's age, 81.
""If you listen to the voters, people feel he's at a stage of life that makes it incompatible to leading the free world. And the same is true of Donald Trump,"" said Phillips, 55.
Trump, 77, is the leading Republican candidate. The former president was defeated by Biden in his bid for a second term in 2020.
The White House has repeatedly dismissed concerns about Biden's age, though polls show voters are concerned about it.
""Our perspective is that it's not about age, it's about the president's experience,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Biden's 81st birthday. ""We have to judge him by what he's done, not by his numbers.""
The Biden re-election campaign did not respond to a request for comment and has avoided commenting directly on Phillips's challenge. When the congressman launched his challenge in October, it issued a statement saying Biden's ""campaign is hard at work mobilizing the winning coalition that President Biden can uniquely bring together to once again beat the MAGA Republicans next November.""
Minnesota's Democratic Governor, Tim Walz, in a fundraising email at the time said: ""You know, I have to say this about Minnesota: it’s a great state, full of great people. And sometimes they do crazy things.""
The New Hampshire primary on Jan. 23 offers the first at-the-polls gauge of Biden’s political strength this election cycle, and the unprecedented situation will be closely watched amid polls showing him tied with Trump.
A poor showing by Biden against Phillips and self-help author Marianne Williamson would likely fuel concerns that Biden is weak heading into the general election.
Both Phillips and Williamson appeared to have little chance of defeating Biden.
Backers of the write-in campaign are staging events throughout the weekend to educate voters on how to write in Biden's name and generate support for him.
Williamson told several dozen people at an event in Manchester that she also felt Biden was weak and questioned the wisdom of nominating him for a second term just because he beat Trump in 2020.
""To say he beat Trump once and therefore he'll beat him again - for me it's like saying to an actor who's nominated for an Oscar twice. 'He won last time so it's only reasonable to think he'll win this time. Well, it's a different movie,"" she said.

Rainfall is expected through Monday with around 0.5 to 2 inches of rain across the coastal and valley regions and 2 to 4 inches in the foothills and mountains, according to the National Weather Service. Southwest-facing slopes will receive even more rainfall.
On Saturday, showers across Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties, along with the Inland Empire, will continue through Monday night. Lingering showers across San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties could last through Wednesday.
Chances of thunderstorms will be most active on Monday from noon through the evening.
The wet weather will create hazardous driving conditions throughout the Southland, with limited visibility and possible road flooding.
“If you are headed out, please be very careful driving over the next couple of days, especially when heading to work or school on Monday morning,” Goldberg advised. “Monday morning will be very dicey. Streets will be slick. Leave yourself plenty of extra time to get to work or school.”
A Winter Weather Advisory will be in effect through Sunday, Jan. 21 at 1 p.m., but will likely be extended into Monday, Goldberg said.
Snowfall is expected at elevations over 6,500 feet with 6-12 inches of snow possible above resort levels, according to NWS.

WQ2J2YYXZX_YF2MMPAHZI5PKRT,4 local police officers in eastern Mexico are under investigation after man is shot to death,ALBA ALEMÁN,"January 21, 2024 at 8:55 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/4-local-police-officers-eastern-235507513.html,"LERDO DE TEJADA, Mexico (AP) — Four local police officers in Mexico were placed under investigation in connection with the shooting death of a man in the Gulf of Mexico state of Veracruz, after neighbors in the town surrounded the officers and attacked them.
The Veracruz Public Security Department said in a statement the officers from Lerdo de Tejada, a coastal town in the south of the state, were detained late Friday. They were handed over to the prosecutor’s office to investigate the death of 27-year-old Brando de Jesús Arellano Cruz, it said.
The identities of the officers were not released.
Arellano Cruz was shot Friday night while in his vehicle. His family speculated the police may have flagged Arellano Cruz down and he didn't stop out of fear of the local security forces, who are highly mistrusted by local residents.
The victim phoned his father, Delfino Arellano Ramírez, and told him that the officers were following him and that he was on his way to his grandmother’s house.
Arellano Ramírez said that just after the call he went to the grandmother's house and that when he arrived, his son’s vehicle was stopped and he heard two gunshots. “He stopped the car because he arrived at his grandmother’s house ... and once the car was stopped there, they shot him with impunity,” he said.
When Arellano Ramirez approached the car, he saw the impact of the bullet in the glass and he looked through the window. “I saw that my son was on his face and was already dripping blood,” he said. Arellano Cruz had been shot in the head.
Arellano Cruz's father and mother — who arrived at the scene shortly afterwards — said they rebuked the officers, asking for explanations but the officers intimidated them and told them that they had nothing to do with what happened.
Soon, dozens of neighbors surrounded the local police officers and began to beat them angrily. One policeman fled, the family said. The other four were rescued by state police and the National Guard and taken to a hospital. Apparently, those are the four officers who are under investigation.
Residents said the crowd was furious and went on to set fire to the town hall. When Associated Press journalist arrived, two patrol cars, a van and part of the town hall building had been burned and dozens of angry people were still there.
Mayor María Esther Arroniz said on social media that she lamented Arellano Cruz's death but condemned people who used the event “to feed hatred, vandalism and social instability.”
Residents have repeatedly denounced abuses by security forces.
Shopkeeper Julio Cesar Ramirez recounted Friday night how he was detained twice and falsely accused of carrying illegal substances. “Perhaps this is not the correct way the people should have acted, but we must also understand that the people are tired of abuses, tired of arbitrariness,” he said.
Impunity runs rampant in Mexico. Only 1% of all crimes committed were reported, investigated and resolved in 2022, according to a survey by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography.
Veracruz has for years had high levels of violence linked to organized crime as it is located on the fastest highway route from Central America to the United States. Security forces from different agencies have been linked several times to cases of corruption and human rights abuses."

Several wooden buildings went up in flames on the so-called Main Street of Pullman City amusement park in the southern state of Bavaria, police said. The cause of the early morning fire was not immediately known.
About 200 people, including around 180 overnight guests, were able to escape to safety from the park, which pulls in hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.
Pullman City, which fashions itself on the horseback-riding cowboys of the 19th-century American West, covers around 200,000 square metres near the city of Passau, close to the Austrian border.
Firefighters battled the flames for hours on the park's Wild West-styled street, which features a replica saloon, steakhouse and a music hall.
By midday Sunday only the skeletons of some of the buildings remained as smoke continued to rise from the remains.
A police spokeswoman said one park employee was slightly injured in the shoulder while trying to extinguish the blaze, and a firefighter was injured in the leg.
""The fire was discovered by employees at around 6 am,"" said a police spokeswoman. ""They tried to put it out with a fire extinguisher. But that didn't work.""
According to the website, a free admission family day had been planned on Sunday featuring magic and light shows. Pony rides were also supposed to be on offer, among other activities.
""I could cry for an hour. But that doesn't help. We now have to look forward,"" the theme park's managing director, Claus Six, told dpa.
The employees who noticed the fire reacted with presence of mind and brought the guests to safety, he said. The Pullman City park opened in 1997 and employs 500 permanent and freelance staff members.
Six said he believes the park will have to remain closed until at least March but hopes to rebuild as much as possible. ""We'll start planning tomorrow,"" Six said.
Although the buildings that burned make up only a small portion of the park itself, Six said the facilities are particularly important for providing services like catering to guests."
WRUDB6FZPK_CRO08TJXA7VYCXV,Opinion: Here’s why voters in New Hampshire will be writing in Biden’s name on the ballot,Opinion by Maggie Hassan,"January 22, 2024 at 8:44 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/opinion-why-hampshire-really-first-144800881.html,"Editor’s Note: US Senator Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, is in her second term representing New Hampshire. She served as governor of New Hampshire from 2013 to 2017. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.
As we approach New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary on Tuesday, America’s democracy is more challenged than at any point during my lifetime. The threat of a second term for Donald Trump means that our country’s fundamental values and electoral system itself are on the ballot in 2024.
Despite the attempt to change the primary calendar, Granite Staters on Tuesday will write in President Joe Biden precisely because of our passion for citizen-led democracy and our commitment to protecting the future of our country.
This year, President Biden’s name will not be on the primary ballot over a dispute with the Democratic National Committee, which voted to change the date of the New Hampshire primary. It decided to disqualify the state from receiving any delegates after determining that South Carolina should be the first primary — but that has not stopped Granite Staters from organizing a write-in campaign and continuing our engagement with the democratic process.
Since its inception, the New Hampshire presidential primary has helped strengthen our democracy and elect better presidents. The “all-hands-on-deck” spirit of our state means we participate in town meetings, volunteer for our community and elect a 424-member volunteer citizen legislature to serve a population of 1.4 million.
Our commitment to civic participation is in part why the people of New Hampshire helped create the modern primary — Granite Staters were among the first in the nation who decided that instead of selecting party delegates in the backrooms, all voters across the state should have a say. We helped wrestle nominating contests from the grips of party bosses, holding our first in the nation primary — where voters choose party delegates — for the first time in 1920. In 1952, voters started directly selecting their preferred presidential nominee.
The New Hampshire primary has always helped strengthen our democracy. In our polarized political moment — where social media, algorithms and some partisan politicians sow discord and drive more Americans to the extremes — it has become challenging for voters to sort truth from misinformation. In order to help bridge this divide, voters need the opportunity to engage with candidates face-to-face and in real time.
In other larger states, campaigns are won and lost by massive ad buys or flashy rallies where candidates may never come face to face with a question from a voter, but the small size of our state provides candidates the opportunity to do things differently. Our primary provides an ideal proving ground for candidates to have direct, person-to-person interactions with the people who they wish to serve.
In our state, candidates can travel in just an hour or two from our largest cities that grapple with challenges like homelessness to our rural communities where the lack of high-speed internet continues to hold back families and the economy.
Successful candidates in our primary have to be prepared to win one conversation at a time, talking to voters of all ages, backgrounds and — particularly in a state where independents are a plurality of voters — all political stripes. Because New Hampshire’s government requires an unusually high degree of citizen engagement, direct access to elected officials is routine for most Granite Staters and we are not easily swayed or impressed by slick advertising or large entourages.
In our state, candidates who expend shoe leather and spend time listening have a shot against those who start the contest well known or with big war chests, which is why it is critical that New Hampshire goes first. It is also important to note that New Hampshire is not the only early state; while our state continues to grow in its racial diversity, especially among young people, the group of early primary states has strong racial and geographic diversity.
New Hampshire’s person-to-person style of campaigning also forces candidates to answer direct questions from the voters. Just last month we were reminded how skilled Granite Staters are at holding candidates to account when Nikki Haley was pressed about what was the cause of the American Civil War and she refused to say that it was caused by slavery. She later backpedaled her comments and said “of course the Civil War was about slavery.” These direct questions that get to the heart of a candidate’s character are just one of the ways that our primary helps produce stronger nominees.
In this time of polarization, having a primary that places a premium on direct conversations between candidates and citizens is invaluable; it is not only how citizens can hold candidates to account, but it gives us a chance to see how democracy works at its best. It bridges divisions and helps us see the priorities and heartaches that we have in common. New Hampshire’s commitment to empowering citizens — and in treating those who would lead us as “citizens in chief” — has made our first in the nation primary indispensable and our democracy stronger.
Granite Staters’ commitment to democracy is why we will continue to hold our primary and why we organized a write-in campaign to support President Biden.
The dangers of another Trump presidency are clear. As just one example, at a rally last November in Claremont, Trump echoed fascist dictators by calling his political opponents “vermin,” and he has continued to repeat the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.
President Biden, on the other hand, is committed to protecting our democracy and to working on behalf of the American people — regardless of political party — to deliver results. At a time when many believed that bipartisanship was impossible, President Biden has demonstrated that our democracy can work, passing bipartisan legislation to lower costs, invest in manufacturing here at home and rebuild our infrastructure.
There are those who suggest that — given the DNC’s wrongheaded decision to forego New Hampshire’s first in the nation primary — Granite Staters should stay home, or refuse to vote for President Biden. We’re not going to do that. I know that New Hampshire Democrats and many independents will join me in writing in President Biden’s name on Tuesday because we understand the importance of this election for our country. We have long known that staying on the sidelines is not an option and we will put our country first.

WW6WXPVDT4_74S7OW1PU6BPGIW,Josh Acevedo claims victory in District 2 low turnout race for El Paso City Council seat,"Adam Powell, El Paso Times","January 22, 2024 at 4:47 AM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/josh-acevedo-claims-victory-district-194725748.html,"El Paso Independent School District trustee Josh Acevedo will take a seat on the El Paso City Council after his victory in a low-turnout election in the Central and Northeast core of the city.
Though only 5.7% showed up to cast ballots, voters in West-Central District 2 elected Acevedo to serve out the remainder of city Rep. Alexsandra Annello's term, which expires at the end of the year.
Elections 2024: Democrat El Paso district attorney candidates call for sweeping changes in DA's office
Despite the constant lament from residents that their neighborhoods have languished amid inaction at City Hall, an abysmally low voter turnout defined every step of the special election — only 4.6% showed up to cast ballots in December and only about 600 more turned out for the runoff.
And taxpayers will likely be on the hook for more than $500,000 to pay for the two elections.
Still, Acevedo ended Election Night more than 300 votes ahead of opponent Veronica Carbajal and will take his seat at the dais alongside the rest of the City Council.
""I am thrilled and I am so thankful to the voters of District 2 for placing their trust in me,"" Acevedo said as the final numbers rolled in on Election Night. ""I'm so excited to get to work on our issues and make sure District 2 has a strong voice on City Council.""
For Carbajal, an activist at her core, the Election Night defeat did little to stifle her resolve to enact change in the city, most notably in the form of campaign finance reform.
""This little race for a one-year term in City Council was so important that those who continue to colonize El Paso ... who expect our property taxes to pay for their riches, it was so important to them that they decided to pour crazy amounts of money into it,"" she said during a tear-filled speech before supporters during an Election Night watch party at Old Sheepdog Brewery. ""They raised a lot of money, but we're going to raise even more hell.""
The road to the District 2 seat began after Annello announced her resignation from City Council last October to pursue a seat in the Texas House of representatives, leading to a December special election between four candidates.
Carbajal and Acevedo ended the night with only tenths of a point separating them, leading to the January runoff.
Despite the razor-thin margins, Acevedo enters City Council with a laundry list of priorities.
""I have a very long list of many different concerns that many of my constituents have told me at the door,"" Acevedo said. ""So, I look forward to starting the work on that list.""
District 2 covers a swath in the middle of El Paso on the east side of the Franklin Mountains, bordered by Hondo Pass Drive in the north and running south to the Ascarate Park area and the U.S.-Mexico border.
District 2 concerns are myriad, Acevedo said, from miles of unpaved alleys, stray animals and code enforcement issues that have gone unresolved — a big part of resolving those issues, he said, lies in the hunt for a new city manager.
Elections 2024: Pete Faraone faces primary contest against Jackie Arroyo Butler for El Paso County Commissioner
""I want to make sure the search firm that has been hired for the city manager is not going to be an impediment to getting a final candidate for that position,"" he said. ""I also want to understand how we can reimagine the budget. As we start looking at the budget in the next few months, I want to know why all these departments are understaffed and we can do to try to find a solution for that.""
Additionally, Acevedo wants to make sure the next city manager is treated like any other city employee, which means a contract void of many of the lavish benefits afforded the previous city manager.
""A salary, retirement and healthcare,"" he said. ""I think that's all that belongs in a contract.""
While he's already eying what he can accomplish before the end of the year, Acevedo is also planning a bid for reelection to a full term in November, something he said that residents will need if they hope to see significant change.
""I will be running for reelection in November,"" he said, ""and I'm hoping to get that reassurance from voters for a full four-year term.""
Carbajal trailed Acevedo the whole night, but the mood was far from somber at her Election Night watch party in the heart of Central El Paso.
She praised the more than 60 volunteers that made up her ground game during the campaign and vowed to keep pushing for accountability at City Hall.
""We have listened to complaints that date back 10, 12, 15 years ago,"" she said of her time campaigning. ""We have stood on corners where people have been runover, have died, because no one cared to put in a speed bump. We have listened to so many folks who wonder when somebody's going to do something about the abandoned school next door.""
Carbajal asserted that the influx of big money into such a small race, which saw Acevedo collect nearly $8,000 from the Texas Association of Realtors PAC, the El Paso Electric Company Employee PAC and the El Paso Association of Contractors, means the fight for campaign finance reform is more important than ever.
""This time around, we're not just calling out those who donated to my opposition, we're calling out the politicians who stood against us,"" Carbajal said. ""Those who claimed to be progressive, those who claim to be grassroots ... and yet stood against us.""
For his part, Acevedo rebuffed that criticism and asserted that donors have never had an impact on his decision-making process and ""that's not going to change.""
""I think my campaign speaks for itself,"" he said. ""I have run a very community-oriented campaign and I have a public service record as an employee of many government entities throughout my career and the last four years on the school board.""
Even though she fell short in the District 2 contest, Carbajal vowed to keep pushing for progressive change in El Paso.
""I am so proud of what we've done,"" she added. ""Tomorrow's a new day and we're going to keep fighting.""

WX69L07NR4_DMGVWE5KVVEC6PF,Why are there dips and humps in roads in MS? | Curious Mississippi answers,"Charlie Drape, Mississippi Clarion Ledger","January 21, 2024 at 7:30 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/why-dips-humps-roads-ms-103049847.html,"Editor's note: This is the debut of Curious Mississippi, a service to the readers of the Clarion Ledger. Readers can submit questions by email to CuriousMississippi@ClarionLedger.com and editors will pick out the best and reporters will answer them in an upcoming edition.
The conditions of Mississippi's roads have everything to do with the soil underneath. In Jackson and throughout Central Mississippi, one soil can be blamed for most of the dips and humps in the roads — Yazoo clay.
A majority of the Yazoo clay deposits can be found in ― wait for it — Yazoo County, as well as northeast Hinds County, through Madison County, Rankin County, Scott County and all the way to the state line.
""Central Mississippi, particularly the tri-county area, sits on top on top of a type of clay soil called Yazoo clay, a type of highly expansive clay soil that expands when water is added and contracts when water is withdrawn,"" said Robert Lee, Jackson's city engineer and interim director of the Department of Public Works.
The public works staff, with Lee in-charge, maintains the city's infrastructure, such as bridges, traffic lights, stormwater management and, of course, streets. Lee has been battling the Yazoo clay for years now, which is responsible for most of Jackson's extensive road problems.
MDOT preps for freeze: MDOT official say the department is preparing for extreme polar weather ahead
2024 freeze in Jackson: Jackson weather and water update: Hard freeze coming. How many remain with out water?
Highways across the state are handled by the Mississippi Department of Transportation. Griffin Sullivan, MDOT's state materials engineer, who is responsible for testing soils throughout Mississippi, agreed with Lee.
""It has everything to do with water. High-volume change soils, when they're exposed to moisture will actually swell up like a sponge and that would cause a hump in the road,"" Sullivan said. ""Then vice-versa, in drought conditions these soils will change volume again and they'll actually shrink and that will cause a dip in the road.""
Unusually rainy seasons or exceptional droughts, like the one the state faced this past summer, create a lot of movement in the soils.
""It's really a cycle and that cycle just continues depending on the amount of rainfall that happens or the amount of rainfall that doesn't happen,"" Sullivan said.
Engineers can try to dig out the clay and replace it with a higher quality soil, but that can be difficult because a lot of Yazoo clay soil deposits are hundreds of feet deep. They can also try to treat the soil chemically with hydrated lime, which hardens the clay and stabilizes it before building roads on top of it.
""You can't really get rid of the clay, so you just have to mitigate it as best you can,"" Sullivan said.
MDEQ's environmental fines: Which MS companies and cities faced environmental fines in November?
According to Lee, the city purchased a pothole repair machine years ago that used a tar-and-slag mix, a common material used to fill potholes. But long-term use determined the machine was not ideal for three main reasons:
The pothole-repair machine had repeated maintenance issues with the tar-and-slag system that limited its use.
Asphalt is a much better material to fill potholes, which the machine didn't use.
The tar-and-slag material had to be purchased from a vendor in Vicksburg, causing further delays, whereas there are multiple plants in Jackson where the city can purchase asphalt.
""Based on our experience, the tar-and-slag pothole repair machine was not an improvement over more traditional pothole repairs,"" Lee said.
Look at this pothole in Jackson: Weeding out the problem: 6-foot ragweed plant grows out of pothole in west Jackson
Upkeep of the city's streets is the job of the Paved Streets Division, which is currently facing a staff shortage like most of the city's departments. Lee said patching streets and filling potholes ""is only a Band-Aid for these streets,"" and most need to be totally repaved.
In October, the Jackson City Council voted to approve phase one of the city's ""Street Resurfacing Project,"" which is repaving a total of 31 neighborhood streets in Ward 3 and Ward 7. Deciding what streets are next for the project is the job of the One Percent Sales Tax Commission. The commission uses 1% of tax revenue earned by sales tax — about $12 to $13 million per year — to fund capital improvement projects.

Judge Kevin Randolph received an unsigned note from a juror in the trial of Michelle Troconis Friday morning, accusing another member of the panel of making the comment in the presence of other jurors.
Missing 85-year-old man found dead in lake in Palm Harbor: PCSO
The juror “discussed something about the case and it was all over social media,” Randolph said the note read. “Said it was like ‘Gone Girl’ — a brief mention. Several other jurors said, ’Don’t discuss this.’ “
Randolph then cleared the courtroom to question jurors about the comment. He ultimately dismissed the juror, identified only as “Juror 186,” who acknowledged making the “Gone Girl” comment, the judge said.
“Every (other) juror indicated that they would be able to afford the state and defense a fair and impartial trial,” Randolph said after reconvening the trial.
“Gone Girl,” a 2012 novel by Gillian Flynn that was turned into a 2014 film starring Ben Affleck, is about a woman who fakes her own disappearance and her husband, who becomes a suspect.
Troconis, 49, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder and other crimes on allegations that she helped her then-boyfriend, Fotis Dulos, cover up the killing of his wife, Jennifer Dulos, in 2019. Troconis has pleaded not guilty and denied any involvement.
Adam Harrison, a son of ‘Pawn Stars’ celebrity Rick Harrison, has died in Las Vegas at age 39
Police believe Fotis Dulos attacked his wife in the garage of her home in New Canaan, Connecticut, in May 2019, after she dropped off the children at school. Then, authorities said, he drove off in her own SUV with her body, which has never been found. Fotis Dulos denied having anything to do with her disappearance. He died by suicide in early 2020, shortly after being charged with murder.
Testimony on Friday focused on the patterns of what police said appeared to be blood stains that had been cleaned from the garage of Jennifer Dulos’ home.
At the time she vanished, Jennifer and Fotis Dulos were going through a contentious divorce and child custody proceedings that had limited his time with the children. Jennifer Dulos had moved out of the family home in Farmington, Connecticut, and Fotis Dulos was living there with Troconis and her daughter.
The case drew widespread attention and was itself the subject of a made-for-TV movie, titled “Gone Mom.” Jennifer Dulos, 50, was a member of a wealthy New York family whose father, the late Hilliard Farber, founded his own brokerage firm. She also was a niece by marriage of fashion designer Liz Claiborne. Fotis Dulos was a luxury home builder originally from Greece.
This is the second case of alleged juror misconduct in the trial. On Wednesday afternoon, Randolph dismissed an alternate juror who reportedly said “We love you” to two prosecutors, both involved in the case, outside the courtroom during a lunch break. Randolph said the comment gave the appearance of favoring the prosecution.
The trial now has three alternates remaining, along with six regular jurors.

That was bombastic, given that it had taken her department a full year to rework the restrictions to cut off Nvidia’s previous workaround. But America’s five-year campaign against Chinese technology is intensifying. Earlier this month it was reported that Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, and two fellow chip bosses had been summoned to testify in Congress about their Chinese business. On January 19th ABB, a Swiss industrial group, revealed that American lawmakers were investigating its links with China. ABB said it was co-operating with the investigation; Nvidia has said that it is working closely with the government to ensure compliance with the export controls.
Neither Democrats nor Republicans are likely to relent. In a presidential-election year Joe Biden, the unpopular Democratic president, cannot afford to look weak on China. His Republican predecessor and main rival, Donald Trump, has long been America’s China-basher-in-chief. China hawks in Washington want to stymie Chinese efforts both to get around the rules and to recreate the necessary technological capabilities at home. However, the mixed record of export controls so far shows why harsher measures will be difficult to design—and not necessarily more successful.
China has found some ways to work around the existing controls. To Ms Raimondo’s chagrin, for instance, it is possible to train AI models using chips that are not necessarily at the cutting edge, so long as you have enough of them. If the sale of any chip which can “do AI” is to be banned, as she implies, America must restrict the flow of a much broader array of chips to China.
It is hard to know just how much broader. Trade statistics do not break out the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to train and run AI models from the larger flow of integrated circuits. But a sense of the scale of such a ban can be gleaned by examining the financial statements of Nvidia, which sells a range of GPUs. It has earned between 21% and 26% of its revenues from China over the past few years. In the nine months to October the company took in $8.4bn from the Chinese market. Almost all of Nvidia’s products can be used to “do AI”. Mr Huang has said that his firm has no “contingency” for being cut off from China.
Another difficulty for America stems from enforcement. The Department of Commerce is empowered to punish any transgressions it discovers. Last year it fined Seagate, a hard-drive manufacturer, $300m for allegedly breaching export controls by sending components to Huawei, a blacklisted Chinese tech champion. But it is the chip firms themselves that are largely responsible for enforcement. That includes ensuring that their customers are not, in fact, a buying front for Chinese entities with which trade is prohibited. This is hard. “You have coin-sized devices and technologies that are widely commercially available, and indistinguishable from the controlled technologies, distributed around the planet,” says Kevin Wolf, an American lawyer and former official.
The result is a situation ripe for smuggling, which experts say is impossible to quantify but doubtless rife. It also encourages transshipment. Firms in countries that have not signed on to the American export-control regime, like Singapore, can buy chips and send them on to Chinese entities without the knowledge of the American firms or the Department of Commerce. Nvidia’s most recent quarterly earnings for 2023 show that its sales to Singapore grew by a factor of five over the same period in 2022, faster than anywhere else.
Of all customers in China, the one best placed to use such workarounds to get the chips it needs is the People’s Liberation Army. If one of America’s main aims is to deny China access to advanced technology for developing military AI, it is probably failing. Instead the controls are raising the costs to Chinese buyers of acquiring American AI chips. That in turn is aligning China’s tech sector with its government’s policy of indigenous technological development. Chinese tech giants used to prefer buying higher-quality American technology to investing in research and development. Their incentives have changed.
The clearest evidence that this is happening comes from Huawei. The company, whose core business is making telecoms gear, was first targeted by America in 2019 for allegedly breaching sanctions on Iran. A measure called the “foreign direct product rule” (FDPR) cut Huawei off from any chips that had been produced using American technology (which is to say virtually all sophisticated ones). In 2022 the FDPR was deployed against the entire Chinese AI industry, and broadened in October to encompass a wider range of AI chips and chipmaking tools, and to require licences to ship products to countries such as the United Arab Emirates (albeit not Singapore) that are thought to serve as middlemen for Chinese buyers.
Before it was blacklisted, Huawei had its microprocessors manufactured by TSMC, a Taiwanese contract chipmaker. It spent $5.4bn on TSMC-made chips in 2020, before America’s export controls extended to the Taiwanese firm. Now it is doing more business with SMIC, China’s biggest chipmaker. SMIC’s capabilities were thought to be many years behind those of TSMC. But last year it came to light that the company was making a Huawei-designed AI chip, the Ascend (and a smartphone chip, the Kirin, which raised many Western eyebrows after Huawei unexpectedly launched a handset containing it in September).
With their access to foreign chips curtailed, Chinese AI companies are now turning to Huawei and SMIC for chips. China’s government is encouraging them, and continuing to shower the industry with subsidies in the hope of creating an industry to rival Nvidia and other American companies. Export controls have, in effect, forced China to embrace import substitution.
The designers of America’s controls foresaw some of this. That is why, from the start, they also targeted China’s ability to recreate advanced technology at home. The controls restrict trade not just in chips themselves but also in tools used to make them. That has involved bringing on board allies such as the Netherlands and Japan, home to many of the toolmakers. As with chips, the tool controls place limits on the sophistication of the equipment that can be sold to Chinese buyers. And as with chips, just how sophisticated a tool has to be to fall under the controls has been the subject of intense debate.
The critical machines are those used to etch transistors onto silicon wafers. The most cutting-edge equipment of this sort is made and sold exclusively by ASML, a Dutch company, and has been blocked from China for years. But older generations of such lithography tools can still be sold there. ASML’s sales to China have grown dramatically over the past year, as have those of companies that produce other chipmaking tools. In the most recent quarter Chinese sales made up almost half of ASML’s total revenue. Other toolmakers also sell lots of their wares to China (see chart).
But, as with chips, export controls are giving Chinese toolmakers a strong incentive to invest in catching up technologically with foreign rivals. Already domestic toolmakers’ sales are growing. On January 15th one of them, NAURA, which manufactures other etching tools, said it expected its revenue to have risen by almost 50% in 2023.
America’s campaign against Chinese technology may, then, be both ineffective and counterproductive. Ineffective, because China is adept at exploiting loopholes. And counterproductive, because it is leading to the creation of a more sophisticated Chinese industry. It may also be predicated on a wrong assumption: that the future economic and military balance of power depends on AI, and that AI depends on computing power. “Both of these are guesses,” points out Chris Miller, a historian of technology at Tufts University in Boston. It is far from clear that AI will have strategic importance. And even if it does, computing power may not be the overriding factor in its development. As Mr Miller points out, oomph is expensive, so AI developers will try to use it as sparingly as possible.
Despite all this, America seems likely to toughen up its export controls on ai chips, as Ms Raimondo all but promised in December. And Republican lawmakers are eyeing more expansive controls still. Some of them see a new threat coming from the other end of the sophistication spectrum, which is less about China’s techno-military might and more about its economic power. Chips are required in growing volumes as components in everything from electric vehicles and heat pumps to electricity grids. By 2027 China could be making almost 40% of such semiconductors, reckons TrendForce, a research firm. The current export controls do nothing to curb China’s dominance of this business, which uses a lot of older American technology.
Three congressional Republicans, Mike Gallagher, Elise Stefanik and Michael McCaul, are thus working on a bill which will force the commerce department to cut China off from all American chip technology, not just the most advanced stuff. Gaining support from allies for such an extreme policy will be hard. Japanese and Dutch businesses—and their governments—rankle even at the porous controls that are in place today. But if Mr Trump, an alliance sceptic, returns to power, the lack of support is unlikely to matter one bit.

XEBLA5FZZ7_XRSV9K8AE2ICNV6,Reformed mobster went after 'one last score' when he stole Judy Garland's ruby slippers from 'Oz',JOSH FUNK,"January 21, 2024 at 2:02 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/reformed-mobster-went-one-last-050212091.html,"The aging reformed mobster who has admitted stealing a pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in “The Wizard of Oz” gave into the temptation of “one last score” after an old mob associate led him to believe the famous shoes must be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value.
Terry Jon Martin's defense attorney finally revealed the 76-year-old's motive for the 2005 theft from the Judy Garland Museum in the late actor’s hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in a new memo filed ahead of his Jan. 29 sentencing in Duluth, Minnesota.
The FBI recovered the shoes in 2018 when someone else tried to claim an insurance reward on them, but Martin wasn't charged with stealing them until last year.
Martin pleaded guilty in October to using a hammer to smash the glass of the museum door and display case to take the slippers. He had hoped to harvest real rubies from the shoes and sell them. But a fence, a person who deals in stolen goods, informed him the rubies were glass and Martin got rid of the slippers less than two days after he took them, he said.
Defense attorney Dane DeKrey said in his memo that an unidentified former mob associate tempted Martin to steal the shoes, even though he hadn't committed a crime in nearly 10 years after his last prison stint.
“At first, Terry declined the invitation to participate in the heist. But old habits die hard, and the thought of a ‘final score’ kept him up at night,"" DeKrey wrote. ""After much contemplation, Terry had a criminal relapse and decided to participate in the theft.”
DeKrey and prosecutors are recommending the judge sentence Martin to time served because he is physically incapable of presenting a threat to society. Martin is in hospice care with a life expectancy of less than six months. He needs oxygen at all times because of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and was in a wheelchair at his most recent court appearance. Even if he were sentenced to prison, his poor health might be grounds for a compassionate release.
Martin had no idea about the cultural significance of the ruby slippers and had never seen the movie. Instead, DeKrey said he was just looking for one last big score, and the “old Terry” with a lifelong history of crimes like burglary and receiving stolen property beat out the “new Terry” who seemed to “finally put his demons to rest” after being released from prison in 1996 and became “a contributing member of society.”
DeKrey urged the judge to consider the major events of Martin's life when deciding whether a lenient sentence is appropriate.
Martin suffered under a cruel stepmother who mistreated him and his three brothers so badly for several years that he left home at the age of 16 and began drinking and stealing.
While on parole from prison, Martin's girlfriend became pregnant with twins, but he missed their birth after his parole was revoked. Right after his girlfriend brought the 1-month-old twins to prison to meet him, they died after a train struck her vehicle.
“This was truly the turning point in Terry’s life — his villain origin story — and the reason he not only went down his dark path but accelerated towards it,” DeKrey wrote. ""His son said it best: ‘the twins’ death made (my dad) just give up on life; he decided on a life of crime.’”
Martin's lawyer also said the judge should consider that Martin had not committed any other crimes in nearly a decade before stealing the slippers nor in the years since then. DeKrey said Martin didn't even try to claim a slice of the insurance reward money when some of his former associates tried to collect.
Garland wore several pairs of ruby slippers during filming of the classic 1939 musical, but only four authentic pairs are known to remain. The stolen slippers were insured for $1 million, but federal prosecutors put the current market value at about $3.5 million.
The FBI said a man approached the insurer in 2017 and claimed he could help recover them but demanded more than the $200,000 reward being offered. The slippers were recovered during an FBI sting in Minneapolis. The FBI has never disclosed how it tracked down the slippers, which remain in the agency’s custody.
The slippers were on loan to the museum from Hollywood memorabilia collector Michael Shaw when Martin stole them. Three other pairs worn by Garland in the movie are held by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Smithsonian Museum of American History and a private collector.
Several rewards were offered over the years in hopes of figuring out who stole the slippers, which were key props in the film. Garland’s character, Dorothy, has to click the heels of the slippers three times and repeat, “There’s no place like home,” to return to Kansas.
Garland was born Frances Gumm in 1922. She lived in Grand Rapids, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Minneapolis, until she was 4, when her family moved to Los Angeles. She died in 1969.
The Judy Garland Museum, located in the house where she lived, says it has the world’s largest collection of Garland and Wizard of Oz memorabilia."
XLULIQIKUI_GQ56H2WYSEYBXFJ,New study makes unsettling discovery about supposedly harmless household products: ‘There’s very little that people can do’,Tina Deines,"January 21, 2024 at 7:00 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/study-makes-unsettling-discovery-supposedly-100000762.html,"New research has revealed that exposure to BPA-free plastic, which was previously considered safe for humans, could have major impacts on reproductive health.
A team led by researchers at Rutgers University looked at the effects of breathing in tiny plastic particles, which they say is a common exposure method in our homes. The nanoplastics, which were free of a common additive called bisphenol-A (known commonly as BPA), were aerosolized and inhaled by rats.
Previously, the scientific community has shown that chemical additives commonly used in plastics, like BPA, act as endocrine disruptors, meaning that exposure to these chemicals can increase, slow, or interfere with the body’s endogenous natural hormone function. This led to the popularization of BPA-free products.
However, the new research suggests that even plastic without BPA can have comparable endocrine-disrupting effects — at least in lab animals.
Plastic is all around us — it’s in our clothing, everyday household products, and even in our water — and it’s probably not going anywhere anytime soon. The production of single-use plastic rose globally by about 6.6 million tons per year from 2019 to 2021 despite tougher regulations, Reuters reported.
Meanwhile, many scientists think that the disruption of sex hormones caused by exposure to plastics could account for declining fertility rates in the Western world, as Salon reported.
One way the chemicals in plastics are affecting fertility is by contributing to dropping sperm counts, according to Dr. Shanna Swan, a professor of environmental medicine and public health at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, interviewed by Salon.
Swan also indicated that exposure to endocrine disruptors in pregnant women can disturb prenatal development during pregnancy, which impacts later reproductive health and function in the child.
“Unfortunately, there’s very little that people can do to reduce exposure at the moment,” senior author of the study Phoebe Stapleton said in a statement quoted by Salon. “You can be aware of your flooring, wear natural fibers and avoid storing food in plastic containers, but invisibly small plastic particles are likely in nearly every breath we take.”
That said, we can help reduce the amount of new plastics being produced by investing in reusable, more reliable items like metal razors, water bottles, shampoo bars, dissolvable dishwasher/laundry pods, and non-plastic sandwich bags.
You can also recycle old products that contain plastic instead of throwing them out. For instance, Nikon has a program that lets you trade in your used camera for credit on a new one.
Plus, some governments, corporations, and academics are trying to cut down on plastics. For instance, scientists have discovered how to break down plastic using hungry wax worms and fungus. Countries like England and France now have bans on plastic cutlery for most fast food and takeout meals, while major cities like Los Angeles have banned Styrofoam takeout containers.

The duo conducted a number of scientific experiments along the way while raising more than £9,000 for the Royal Marines Charity.
Mr Thomas said passing the 1,000km milestone a few days before the end of the trip was a ""huge milestone for us, emotionally"".
""Although we knew then we were on the final push and we still had several days of hard hauling we doggedly stuck to our routine,"" he said.
""We were determined to keep to our planned pace and resist any temptation to try and sprint for the finishing line!""

XO9DH1GGPK_C6MC44TQWGR6KP0,Biden abortion ad marks campaign shift to emphasize reproductive rights,Edward Helmore,"January 22, 2024 at 2:08 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-abortion-ad-marks-campaign-170823681.html,"The Biden re-election campaign rolled out a new campaign ad on Sunday, signaling a shift in emphasis to reproductive rights that the White House hopes will carry and define Democrats through the 2024 election cycle.
The campaign ad, titled Forced, is designed to tie Donald Trump directly to the abortion issue almost 18 months after his nominees to the supreme court helped to overturn a constitutional right to abortion enshrined in Roe v Wade, which would have turned 51 this week.
Dr Austin Dennard, a Texas OB-GYN and mother of three tells the camera her story about traveling out of her state to terminate her pregnancy after learning her fetus had a fatal condition, calling her situation “every woman’s worst nightmare”.
In Texas, she said, her choice “was completely taken away and that’s because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v Wade”.
The launch of the ad comes as anti-abortion activists descended on Washington DC this weekend. One event, the National Pro-Life Summit, activists came to celebrate anti-abortion activism in the US. At another, the March for Life, marchers called for advocacy against abortion rights.
Vice-President Kamala Harris is now being placed to the forefront of the administration’s messaging on reproductive rights, a position Biden has said he is not “big on” because of his Catholic faith, though he believes the landmark 1973 decision “got it right”.
On Monday, Harris will embark on a nationwide tour to focus attention on the administration’s efforts to protect the right of women to choose. Her tour will start in Wisconsin, where abortion rights propelled a Democratic victory in a key state supreme court election.
Related: Democrats condemn ‘cruel’ abortion bans ahead of 51st anniversary of Roe
A statement from Harris’s office said the vice-president will “highlight the harm caused by extreme abortion bans and share stories of those who have been impacted in Wisconsin and across the country”.
“She will also hold extremists accountable for proposing a national abortion ban, call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe, and outline steps the Administration is taking to protect access to health care,” the statement added.
Democrats this year are hoping to emphasize that a second Trump presidency would establish new personal health restrictions.
“Donald Trump is the reason that more than 1 in 3 American women of reproductive age don’t have the freedom to make their own health care decisions. Now, he and MAGA Republicans are running to go even further if they retake the White House,” Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden-Harris 2024 campaign manager, said in a statement to The Hill.
On Sunday, the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, told CBS Face the Nation that “it would be good” if Biden talked about abortion more than he does. “I know that one tenet of his belief system is that women and only women with their families and healthcare professionals are the one who know what decision is right for them.”
Asked if the president needs to take up that message more forcefully, Whitmer said: “I don’t think it would hurt. I think people want to know that this is president that is fighting … but maybe to use more blunt language would be helpful.”"

Current share price of AU$10.48 suggests Treasury Wine Estates is potentially 47% undervalued
Our fair value estimate is 51% higher than Treasury Wine Estates' analyst price target of AU$13.10
Does the January share price for Treasury Wine Estates Limited (ASX:TWE) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.
We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.
See our latest analysis for Treasury Wine Estates
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = AU$3.6b
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.1%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = AU$880m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.1%) = AU$22b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= AU$22b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= AU$12b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is AU$16b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of AU$10.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Treasury Wine Estates as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Doctors performed the procedure in December 2023 with a pig liver developed by biotech outfit eGenesis, the university reports. Scientists modified the pig liver so that it would not be rejected by the human immune system.
Unlike previous procedures where doctors transplanted pig organs directly into the human body, doctors in Pennsylvania chose to perform an ""extracorporeal perfusion,"" in which the pig liver is hooked up outside the human body.
In the case of this experiment, doctors had the pig liver stored in a mini-fridge sized device that is usually used to keep human organs alive and perfused with blood for eventual transplant into a patient. They then hooked up the pig liver device to the brain-dead patient and were able to have the unique Rube Goldberg contraption filter blood successfully with no sign of inflammation in the pig organ.
The researchers see this experiment being used clinically as a critical bridge for very ill patients as they wait for a human transplant. Unlike a transplant that's implanted inside a person's body and which is meant to stay put for years, the doctors see the pig livers for this procedure being used temporarily for a way shorter period of time.
The researchers also see this kind of procedure being used for patients who suffer from an acute liver injury and who need time to recover normal liver function. In that case, the pig liver device combo could serve as high tech crutches until the patient's own liver fully heals.
""Any time a patient dies while waiting for a transplant, it is a tragedy, and we are always working to develop new ways to extend their lives,"" said the presiding surgeon Abraham Shaked in a statement. ""The success of the first part of our study is significant for those facing liver failure, offering a glimpse into a future where innovative solutions can bring hope to patients who might otherwise be destined to die while waiting for a transplant.""

Source: Zelenskyy in an interview for British TV programme Channel 4 News
Details: The interviewer asked Zelenskyy about the situation concerning independent journalists in Ukraine who have been ""intimidated, some of them physically"".
Quote: ""A criminal case was opened right away – this is very important. I summoned the head of the Security Service of Ukraine and got the details from the Prosecutor General. Some people might say: ‘Well, there was some video recording of journalists, but nothing happened.’ I think something did happen. And we have to find all the answers. So the Security Service will investigate this and solve the case.""
More details: The question about intimidation may have been referring to the situation around journalist Yurii Nikolov. But the President’s reply about the ""video recording of journalists"" indicates that he was talking about the illegal surveillance conducted against the team from the investigative journalism project Bihus.Info.
Background:
On 16 January, a video was leaked online showing employees of the Bihus.Info investigative project apparently using drugs. The project's head, Denys Bihus, recorded a video message giving explanations and stated that everyone who works with Bihus.Info would take drug tests.
Later, Bihus said that after talking to the people involved in the video, it transpired that members of the Bihus.Info editorial team had been under surveillance for about a year, and that fragments of intercepted conversations had been edited together from several episodes that took place months apart.
The Security Service of Ukraine has reported that it is investigating the circumstances of the illegal bugging and filming of Bihus.Info staff. A criminal investigation has been opened under Article 359 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (illegal acquisition, sale or use of special technical devices for obtaining information).
On 17 January, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting with law enforcement officials, including Vasyl Maliuk, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU), to discuss the surveillance of the Bihus.Info journalists.
Yurii Nikolov, an investigative journalist, has claimed that unknown people broke into his house on 14 January in an attempt to intimidate him. Anonymous Telegram channels have posted a video of some men knocking on his apartment door and threatening him.
On 21 January, the Prosecutor’s Office stated that Kyiv's law enforcement agencies had identified the individuals who broke into Nikolov’s home in order to impede his work.

Entries to the sixth form at Boroughbridge High School were suspended in September 2022.
Now the wider community and pupils' parents are being asked for their views on what should happen next.
North Yorkshire councillor Annabel Wilkinson said: ""This is an important consultation, and it is essential we take everybody's views into account.""
Ms Wilkinson, executive member for education, learning and skills at North Yorkshire Council, said the school had worked to ensure students had access ""to a wide post-16 offer"".
However, she said a decline in pupil numbers had made it more difficult to maintain ""viable sixth-form class sizes in terms of quality of experience, subject breadth and financial viability"".
She urged parents and residents of the Boroughbridge community to have their say.
The consultation closes at 17:00 GMT on Friday 1 March.
North Yorkshire Council will also hold a public meeting at the school at 18:00 GMT on Thursday 8 February.
If the closure is approved, sixth-form provision at Boroughbridge High School would permanently shut from 31 August, the council said.

Muhammad Hassam Ali, 17, was attacked in the city centre on Saturday afternoon.
West Midlands Police said its officers were called to Victoria Square after the teenager was found seriously injured. He was rushed to hospital, but later died.
A murder investigation is under way, but no arrests have yet been made.
Detective Inspector Michelle Thurgood, from the West Midlands Police homicide team, said: “This is a tragic case of a young man being killed in what appears to be a case of mistaken identity.
“We are still trying to establish the motive and are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area just before 3.30pm yesterday.
“We are especially looking for any photos or video footage from the surrounding area which may help us identify those responsible.
“If you were walking through the area at the time, or a visitor who may have been taking pictures by The River statue near the Council House, we would like to hear from you as you may have vital information or evidence.”
A cordon put in place around the crime scene has now been lifted, but the force said a “highly visible police presence” will remain in the area.
Chief Inspector James Spencer said: “The life of a 17-year-old boy has tragically been taken away and all our thoughts are with his family and friends at this awful time.”

XTZXWU5NNM_YCZZY3LJYMCKPRU,‘Very dangerous’: Zelensky on Trump’s claim he could end Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours,"Andrew Carey and Victoria Butenko, CNN","January 21, 2024 at 11:12 AM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/very-dangerous-zelensky-trump-claim-021252650.html,"For the first time, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed publicly unequivocal concern over Donald Trump’s suggestion he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within a day if he returns to the White House.
Speaking to Britain’s Channel Four News in an interview that aired Friday, the Ukrainian president described the Republican frontrunner’s boast as “very dangerous” – on the grounds that Trump has not said what his post-war scenario would look like.
Zelensky conceded it was possible Trump’s claim was just electioneering, or what he called a “political message.”
But he said the idea that Trump as president might unilaterally make decisions that do not work for Ukraine or its people, and seek to drive them through regardless, “makes me really quite stressed.”
Trump’s propensity to make sweeping pronouncements on foreign policy resurfaced in May last year, when he told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, “If I’m president, I will have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.”
Asked how, Trump said he would meet both Zelensky and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, telling Collins, “They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths and within 24 hours that war will be settled, that war will be over.”
Zelensky has generally stayed away from criticizing Trump, preferring not to lean-in too heavily to the split between Democrats and Trump-supporting Republicans, who have effectively put a block on further US funding for Kyiv.
At Davos earlier this week, responding to a similar question from a journalist, the Ukrainian leader answered rhetorically, wondering how Trump would respond if Putin rolled through Ukraine - in a scenario where Trump removed all US support - and began threatening NATO members with invasion.
It is widely believed that a Trump victory in November is something Putin would welcome, giving him the opportunity, at a minimum, to hold onto his territorial gains in Ukraine and declare a victory.
By contrast, Zelensky continues to insist there can be no peace deal that does not see the removal of all Russian forces from lands they have captured from Ukraine since 2014, including Crimea.
Ukraine’s ability to negotiate toward that result has been significantly weakened, at least in the short term, by the failure of the summer counteroffensive.
Even so, the Biden administration, and the NATO alliance, have repeatedly stressed Ukraine will not be coerced into any agreement with Russia, summed up in the phrase: “Nothing about Ukraine, without Ukraine.”
Offered the chance in the Channel Four News interview to invite Trump to Ukraine, Zelensky did not hesitate.
Turning to address the camera, he said, “Please, Donald Trump, I invite you to Ukraine, to Kyiv. If you can stop the war during 24 hours, I think it will be [reason] enough to come.”
“Maybe Donald Trump really has some idea, a real idea, and he can share it with me,” Zelensky added, returning to face the interviewer.

The strike appeared to be part of a shift in Israeli strategy toward targeted killings in Lebanon after more than three months of near-daily clashes with Hezbollah militants on the border against the backdrop of the war in Gaza.
Hezbollah announced that one of its members, identified as Fadel Shaar, had been killed in the strike in the town of Kafra.
Several hours later, Lebanon’s National News Agency reported that a civilian woman wounded in the strike, Samar al-Sayyed Mohammed, had died of her injuries.
Local civil defense and hospital officials said several others were wounded.
Video from the scene showed a passenger sedan in flames next to a small truck stopped in the middle of the road.
The Israeli military did not comment on the strike.
Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on Oct. 7, Hezbollah forces have engaged in near-daily clashes with Israeli troops along the border.
While the clashes had previously been limited mainly to a narrow strip within a few kilometers (miles) from the border, Israel in recent weeks appears to have moved to a strategy of targeted killings of figures from Hezbollah and allied groups, sometimes hitting in areas relatively far from the border, as was the case in Sunday’s strike.
On Saturday, another strike near the Lebanese port city of Tyre killed two people in a car — one of them a Hezbollah commander — and two people in a nearby orchard. The commander, Ali Hudruj, was buried Sunday in south Lebanon. The other occupant of the car, tech sector businessman Mohammad Baqir Diab, was identified as a civilian and was buried in Beirut on Sunday.
On Jan. 2, a presumed Israeli airstrike killed a top Hamas official, Saleh Arouri, in a suburb of Beirut, the first such strike in Lebanon’s capital since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brutal one-month war in 2006.
Speaking at Hudruj’s funeral Sunday, Hezbollah Member of Parliament Hussein Jeshi said Israel had “resorted to the method of assassinating some members of the resistance"" to compensate for being unable to reach a military victory against Hamas after more than 100 days of war in Gaza.
The Lebanese militant group said in a statement later Sunday that it had launched an attack against the town of Avivim in northern Israel in retaliation for the strike in Kafra and for other “attacks that targeted Lebanese villages and civilians.”
Israel did not comment on the strike specifically but announced it had struck Hezbollah targets in several locations in Lebanon on Sunday. It later said that an anti-tank missile had hit a house in Avivim and no injuries were reported.
With dangers of a regional conflict flaring on multiple fronts, officials from the United States and Europe have engaged in a flurry of shuttle diplomacy in recent weeks between Israel and Lebanon, attempting to head off an escalation of the conflict into a full-on war on the Lebanese front.

XVJAMITI20_9IOGSC5AWKTZO1E,Two opposition leaders in Senegal are excluded from the final list of presidential candidates,BY BABACAR DIONE,"January 22, 2024 at 1:19 AM·2 min read",20231222,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/two-opposition-leaders-senegal-excluded-161916569.html,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — Senegal's highest election authority has excluded two top opposition leaders from the final list of candidates for the West African nation’s presidential election next month. The party of the main challenger called the move a “dangerous precedent” on Sunday.
The list published Saturday by Senegal’s Constitutional Council named 20 candidates, including Prime Minister Amadou Ba, who has the backing of outgoing President Macky Sall and is seen as a major contender.
Opposition leader Ousmane Sonko, who finished third in the country’s 2019 presidential election,was disqualified from the ballot because he faces a six-month suspended sentence following his conviction for defamation, the Constitutional Council said.
“This conviction renders him ineligible for a period of five years,” the council said.
Sonko, who currently is imprisoned on a different charge, was widely seen as the politician with the best chance of defeating Sall’s ruling party. His PASTEF party, which authorities dissolved last year, called Sonko's disqualification “the most dangerous precedent in the political history of Senegal.”
The council also deemed Karim Wade, another opposition leader and the son of former Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade, as ineligible for the ballot. It said Wade had dual citizenship at the time he formally declared his presidential candidacy, although he had renounced his French nationality three days earlier.
“The recent decision of the Constitutional Council is scandalous, it is a blatant attack on democracy (and) violates my fundamental right to participate in the presidential election,” Wade wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
The Constitutional Council’s decision could further complicate preparations for the Feb. 25 election. Opposition supporters accused Sall’s government last year of clamping down on their activities, and some protests in support of Sonko turned deadly."
XWBDQH1UZ9_3I3CO53F7JEAW5M,Shareholders in Neo Performance Materials (TSE:NEO) are in the red if they invested three years ago,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 9:18 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-neo-performance-materials-tse-121835046.html,"Investing in stocks inevitably means buying into some companies that perform poorly. But the last three years have been particularly tough on longer term Neo Performance Materials Inc. (TSE:NEO) shareholders. So they might be feeling emotional about the 56% share price collapse, in that time. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 27% in the last year.
With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.
Check out our latest analysis for Neo Performance Materials
Because Neo Performance Materials made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.
In the last three years, Neo Performance Materials saw its revenue grow by 20% per year, compound. That's a fairly respectable growth rate. That contrasts with the weak share price, which has fallen 16% compounded, over three years. To be frank we're surprised to see revenue growth and share price growth diverge so strongly. So this is one stock that might be worth investigating further, or even adding to your watchlist.
The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Neo Performance Materials will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).
It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Neo Performance Materials' TSR for the last 3 years was -51%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.
Neo Performance Materials shareholders are down 23% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 2.9%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 8% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Neo Performance Materials better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified  1 warning sign for Neo Performance Materials that you should be aware of.
Neo Performance Materials is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.

The Board of Carroll County Commissioners unanimously approved Thursday a contract renewal for a part-time traffic engineer with Wallace Montgomery at a cost not to exceed $52,000. The contract states that the traffic engineer will work up to two days per week for six months.
In the past, the county contracted for three days per week at a cost of $78,000.
“Since November of 2021 we’ve had a consultant onsite assisting us. That has worked well for us. It’s not our preference, but we’ve not been successful in hiring anyone to fill the position,” said Chris Letnaunchyn, bureau chief of engineering. The full-time position became vacant in 2020.
Carroll County has been competing with nearby counties to hire for the position, Letnaunchyn said.
Letnaunchyn said he would prefer to hire a full-time county employee. “Five days a week, 40 hours a week, would be great, he said.
District 2 Commissioner Ken Kiler said that he has heard from residents questioning why the cost of a part-time engineering consultant is $52,000, for two days of work per week.
“There seems to be a misunderstanding with some of the people questioning it and comparing it to a [full-time] salary,” Kiler said. “This [cost] includes overhead and a lot of other things, other than just salary. I think you all are working very hard to do this as inexpensively as possible.”
The county continues to advertise a job posting for a full-time traffic engineer, at a salary of $66,664 to $119,996.
According to the job posting, the individual would be responsible for the evaluation of traffic control devices, traffic signal operations and maintenance, traffic barrier evaluations, traffic calming evaluations, and other traffic and transportation-related engineering functions in the county.

This year, the free petrol starts pumping at 1 p.m. Sunday.
While supplies lasts, residents can pull up at the Kwik Star at 4105 Hubbell Ave. in Des Moines to celebrate Johnson's birthday. Johnson's goal was to raise $40,000 with the ""I Got 5 On It Campaign."" That amount could fill 800 tanks for Iowans who need it, according to a news release.
More: This Iowan wants to celebrate his birthday by filling your gas tank — for free. Here's how
Last year, ""The Kelly Clarkson Show"" recognized Johnson for spending his birthday by giving away free gas to hundreds of Iowans and this year, he's upping his game for his 36th birthday.
""We are committed to making a meaningful impact and enhancing the lives of our community members, transcending factors such as race, religion, gender, political affiliations, income, or orientation,"" the website for the giveaway stated.
Participants will also received one of 1,000 swag bags with information on local businesses, public libraries, childcare assistance and more.
The campaign has partnered with Back 2 School Iowa, an education-based nonprofit organization that aims to ""to inspire youth to continue in their educational endeavors and build upon their future careers,"" through educational services, scholarship and other resources.
In December 2021, just days after Christmas, Johnson said he was filling up his tank when he noticed a woman at a pump nearby was unable to pay for her gas. He said her credit card was declined, and without hesitation, he went over and paid for it.
Later, Johnson thought: Why stop there? Why not help others, too?
So, he picked up the phone, called his friends, some of whom led community groups and churches or were business owners, and asked them to lend a hand in his project. With their support, Johnson celebrated his 34th birthday with volunteers, pumping nearly $5,000 worth of gas at the Hy-Vee on Southeast 14th Street and Park Avenue in Des Moines.
Since, Johnson has partnered with community leaders and organizations to make an impact every year for his birthday.

Kia Pulford Stone, who was a police constable based in Merseyside, was charged following separate incidents which took place in Wigan, Greater Manchester, on March 4 and March 16, 2023.
She assaulted a woman and in the second incident damaged the same victim’s Vauxhall Adam car.
Pulford Stone, from Wigan, pleaded guilty to both offences at Manchester Magistrates’ Court during October 2023.
She only became a full-time officer with Merseyside Police the same month that the offences had occurred, according to her LinkedIn profile.
During Merseyside Police’s Professional Standards Department hearing, chaired by Chief Constable Serena Kennedy earlier this month, it was concluded that Pulford Stone would have been sacked for gross misconduct had she remained with the force.
Ms Kennedy, in a decision notice posted by the force, wrote: “The evidence in this case is incontrovertible and the former officer entered a guilty plea and was convicted by a court on October 26 2023.
“I also note that this was not a one-off occasion - the victim was subjected to an assault and then damage was caused to her car. As a result, I am satisfied that former officer Pulford Stone has breached the standards of professional behaviour, namely discreditable conduct.
“The communities of Merseyside should quite rightly be able to have trust and confidence that the officers and staff working for Merseyside Police not only uphold the law but also abide by the law.
“The former officer has completely disregarded the standards expected both by the force and the communities of Merseyside by committing and being convicted of a criminal offence.”
Pulford Stone has been blocked from taking on a policing role in Britain by being added to the College of Policing Barred List.
Det Supt Cheryl Rhodes, from Merseyside’s Professional Standards Department, said: “Merseyside Police is committed to ensuring that everyone meets the high expectations of the public and when they don’t we will take robust action.
“Our officers are the public face of Merseyside Police and it is vital that our communities feel confident that we will hold officers and staff to account when required.

At the W. 191st St. station on the No. 1 line, NYC Transit installed platform barriers.
The barriers — a kind of fence at the edge of subway platforms meant to keep people from falling down to the tracks — were installed at the station over the weekend.
The barriers are to be spaced out along platforms’ edges. A bulletin sent Friday to subway train operators advises them to make “an extremely precise stop” so subway doors line up with the gaps between the barriers.
“Your safety is our highest priority, and we’re committed to reducing track intrusions and increasing safety,” the MTA wrote in a post on X.
The MTA plans to also try out the barriers in Brooklyn at the West 8th St./NY Aquarium station of the F and Q lines in Coney Island and the Clark St. station on the Nos. 2 and 3 lines in Brooklyn Heights.
A fourth station yet to be determined will also get the barriers, MTA officials told the Daily News.
Maryland in December began testing a similar idea on the Baltimore Metro Subway — but instead of metal fences, the state is installing bollards spaced on platform so they prevent people from stepping into the spaces between train cars.
Straphangers had mixed feelings Saturday about the barriers’ debut at W. 191st St.
“My thought about them was that someone can still push you through the opening, so I’m not sure,” said commuter Maria Delvalle, 34.
Leny Disla, 52, said the barriers were “a waste of time and money.”
“I don’t think they’ll make anybody safe,” Disla said.
Disla said sliding gated doors — which are used in London, Paris, Tokyo and on other train and subway systems around the world — would be a better solution even if they are more expensive to install.
The MTA in February 2022 announced plans to test safety gates similar to those Disla was thinking about.
But the agency has yet to act on its plan for a pilot program. The JFK AirTrain is the only rail line in New York City to use such technology.
Another concern is how the barriers might increase crowding, said Jeremy Lagual, 19, who got his first look at the W. 191st St. barriers on Saturday night.
“If it’s a lot of people around, and we all have to get in through the door, it’s gonna be hard because it [the barrier] is in the way,” said Lagual. “It should have a better design.”
Lagual concurred with Disla’s criticism — “something sliding would be better,” he said.
Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, who has called for the installation of the sliding safety gates, visited the W. 191st St. station on Saturday.
“It doesn’t provide the protection of full sliding doors,” Levine said of the new barrier setup. “But it does give you a sense of security when the train is not in the station. You can lean up against it.”
Levine has been calling for the installation of sliding door barriers since the death of Michelle Go, 40, who was shoved to her death by a homeless man in January 2022.
“I’ve talked to people who position themselves on the platform to avoid being vulnerable to being pushed,” Levine said.
He called the barriers at W. 191st St. “a good step forward.”
Similarly, straphanger Chandler Forsythe called the barriers at W. 191st St. a “starting point.”
“It’s very low tech,” said Forsythe, 28. “But if it’s a scalable solution that works — if the alternative is, a few stations have really nice doors and most have none or we have this — I think this is a good trade-off.”

Y42JILCRWO_EELE8USX4YTPY63,Wisconsin Assembly approves bill guaranteeing parental oversight of children’s education,The Associated Press,"January 22, 2024 at 1:37 AM·1 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/wisconsin-assembly-approves-bill-guaranteeing-163701076.html,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Republicans who control the Wisconsin state Assembly approved a bill Thursday that would guarantee parents the right to determine their children’s pronouns and pull them out of any classes that conflict with their personal beliefs.
The Assembly passed the GOP-authored measure 62-35, sending it on to the state Senate. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is almost certain to veto the proposal if it reaches his desk. The governor vetoed a similar Republican proposal in 2022.
The bill would guarantee parents a host of rights, including the right to determine the pronouns their children are known by at school.
These baby names are expected to trend in 2024 and these could go extinct
The bill also would give parents the right to pull their children out of class based on religious reasons or personal convictions. They would have a right to be told of any surveys or evaluations that would reveal their or their children’s political leanings, sexual behavior or illegal behavior; any vaccinations the school offers; and whenever a “controversial subject” such as gender identity, sexual orientation or racism will be discussed. Parents could sue schools that violate those rights.
The bill’s supporters say schools are ignoring parents, and the legislation will force administrators to listen to them. Parents in Waukesha County, a Republican stronghold, won a lawsuit in October that alleged Kettle Moraine School District officials used a male name and male pronouns to address their 12-year-old daughter without their consent. The girl was questioning her gender identity at the time.
Opponents say the bill is an attempt to disrupt school protocols and amounts to censorship.

The new charge that Alec Baldwin faces in connection with the fatal 2021 Rust shooting have been ""frustrating"" for the actor and his wife Hilaria Baldwin, a source tells PEOPLE exclusively.
After Baldwin, 65, was indicted by a New Mexico grand jury and charged with involuntary manslaughter this week, a source close to the family says that the pair find the news ""very stressful.""
“They had a great Christmas and New Year. Hilaria also just turned 40. This is not how they wanted to start the new year,"" the source says, referencing the new charge, which come over two years after the October 2021 death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.
""It’s stressful for Hilaria. It’s frustrating for them both that Alec is being recharged. They knew there was a possibility there would be a new indictment,"" they add. ""The back and forth is hard. It’s very stressful.”
Reps for the couple, as well as legal reps for Baldwin, did not respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.
Related: Alec Baldwin Charged Again with Involuntary Manslaughter in Fatal Rust Shooting
Alex Spiro and Luke Nikas of Quinn Emanuel, Baldwin's lawyers, said in a statement Friday that they ""look forward to our day in court.""
While filming Rust in October 2021 on a New Mexico set, a prop gun that Baldwin was holding was discharged, killing Hutchins and injuring Joel Souza, the director of the film. Baldwin has previously said that he did not pull the trigger and wasn't aware that the gun held a live bullet.
Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, armorer for the film, previously pled not guilty after being charged with involuntary manslaughter and is expected to stand trial in February.
Baldwin is now being charged with involuntary manslaughter (negligent use of a firearm) or alternatively, with involuntary manslaughter (without due caution or circumspection), months after involuntary manslaughter charges were initially dropped in April 2023.
Per New Mexico law, he faces up to 18 months in prison given the new charge.

Gloria Allred, an attorney for Hutchins' family, said in a statement that her clients ""have always sought the truth about what happened on the day that Halyna Hutchins was tragically shot and killed.""
""They continue to seek the truth in our civil lawsuit for them and they also would like there to be accountability in the criminal justice system,"" she continued in response to Friday's indictment.
""The grand jury has decided that there is sufficient evidence to indict Alec Baldwin on the charge of involuntary manslaughter,"" Allred added. ""We are looking forward to the criminal trial which will determine if he should be convicted for the untimely death of Halyna.""

Baldwin was initially charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter last year.
He was accused in a statement of probable cause filed in the First Judicial Court in New Mexico of not receiving required firearms training and not asking the armorer to show him that the gun did not contain live rounds.
In the document, Baldwin was also alleged to have placed his finger “on the trigger of a real firearm when a replica or rubber gun should have been used.""
Special prosecutors Kari Morrissey and Jason J. Lewis cited “new facts” in the case when Baldwin's charges were dropped in April, and revealed two months later that the gun was sent to an independent expert for additional testing.
Expert Lucien C. Haag wrote in a forensic report obtained by PEOPLE in August that the prop gun's trigger must have been pulled “sufficiently” enough to cause the incident. But, according to The New York Times, ""parts of the gun"" were ""damaged by the F.B.I. during its own analysis.""
The prosecutors announced in October their intention to present the case to a Santa Fe grand jury.

A study published by the journal, Science, on Thursday found that patients experiencing long COVID symptoms had proteins that indicated part of their immune systems remained active after an infection.
According to experts, this discovery could lead to diagnostic tests and treatment for long COVID, which has left people with persistent fatigue, brain fog, chest pain, stomach issues, and a broad range of other symptoms.
The study focused on 113 COVID patients and 39 healthy controls. After six months, 40 patients had developed characteristics of long COVID.
Blood samples for those patients contained a group of proteins which showed the body’s complement system, a part of the immune system, continued to be on high alert long after the COVID virus.
As the complement system remains active without COVID to fight, it “starts damaging healthy cells,” according to Dr. Onur Boyman, a professor of immunology at the University of Zurich in Switzerland and one of the study’s authors.
Blood samples from long COVID patients revealed a common group of proteins which indicated a heightened immune system response.
According to experts, any resulting tissue damage and microclots in the blood could reduce the level of oxygen and nutrients delivered to different organs, leading to long COVID symptoms.
“If your brain, for example, isn’t getting enough oxygen, obviously there will be a lot of issues with memory, brain fog and fatigue,” Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology, and molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the Yale School of Medicine, told NBC News.
Dr. Monica Verduzco-Gutierrez, chair of rehabilitation medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and head of its long COVID clinic, told NBC News that the study was a huge advance in the study of the virus.
“Understanding the mechanisms of long COVID is how we’re going to figure out treatments,” she said.
Around 14% of adults report experiencing long COVID, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey.

YBVAYEKIVI_170XXDLQ0W4OXOP,A Louisiana teen traveled to the West Bank to learn about his roots. He was shot dead.,Chantal Da Silva and Raf Sanchez and Lawahez Jabari and Shira Pinson and Dave Copeland,"Updated January 23, 2024 at 3:01 AM·8 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/louisiana-teen-traveled-west-bank-222102283.html,"AL-MAZRA’A AL-SHARQIYA, West Bank — Tawfic Hafeth Abdel Jabbar was born and raised in Louisiana, in the city of Gretna, across the Mississippi River from New Orleans.
It’s a long way from the mountains of the occupied West Bank, but when Tawfic, 17, arrived in May, he was excited to properly explore the landscape of the village where his dad grew up, and to learn more about his roots as a Palestinian American.
“He loved the outdoors,” his father, Hafeth Abdel Jabbar, told NBC News — and Tawfic was eager to spend more time in Al-Mazra’a Al-Sharqiya, about 10 miles northeast of Ramallah, and to enjoy all the reasons Palestinians “love their homeland,” he said.
He never imagined he would end up burying his son on that very same land.
“Tawfic is gone,” said Abdel Jabbar, 40. “He was killed in cold blood.”
Tawfic’s family says he was a victim of mounting settler violence in the territory, which has been on the rise since the war began.
As an American, Abdel Jabbar said, he would have expected the U.S. to seek justice for his son. But he says the Biden administration’s support of Israel, including with weapons, and what he sees as a tepid response from the White House to Tawfic’s death make him doubt that his government will act in his son’s interest.
In video from his funeral shared by his father, Tawfic's head is wrapped in a keffiyeh, the traditional Palestinian scarf. There are cuts and bruises on his face. Flowers surround him as his family says their final farewells.
“They all say they took the best of us,” Abdel Jabbar said, describing his son as a lovely and outgoing teen who was “very loved.”
He hoped to study engineering in college — and was considering pursuing his degree in the West Bank.
Abdel Jabbar said Tawfic had gone out for a picnic with friends on Friday when he was shot by a person witnesses told Abdel Jabbar appeared to be an Israeli settler, who initially opened fire, followed by someone wearing a uniform for the Israel Defense Forces.
The IDF said it had received a report regarding an “off-duty police officer and a civilian who fired toward a Palestinian individual suspected of hurling rocks” in the area. It confirmed an IDF soldier was also in the area and said it was investigating a claim that the soldier fired at the Palestinian.
The Israel Police said it was also investigating the incident. Asked to confirm whether the civilian was an Israeli settler, the IDF referred NBC News to the Israel Police, which did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the civilian’s identity.
Abdel Jabbar dismissed the suggestion his son might have been “hurling rocks” as a “lie.” But, he said, even if rocks were thrown in the area, “so what?”
“If they were throwing rocks 150 meters to the street, what is it going to do to a tank? Or to a jeep? Or to a car full of soldiers? You’re gonna shoot the car 10 times because a guy threw a rock?” he said.
Speaking with NBC News shortly after his son’s funeral, Abdel Jabbar described racing to the scene when he heard his son had been shot. He found him bleeding in a truck with two gunshot wounds — one to the head and another in the chest. “I took him with my bare hands out of the car,” he said.
The grieving father said people in IDF uniforms were already on the scene when he arrived — and he said they “pointed their guns at us, warning, ‘We will shoot you,’” if he and others did not leave the area.
“We didn’t care. We went to the car and we grabbed him,” he said.
The IDF did not immediately respond to a question about that specific claim.
Blood could be seen on the shattered windshield and seats of the truck Tawfic was shot in. Shards of glass were strewn along the terrain where his family says the vehicle rolled over before coming to a halt over a section of Highway 60.
The incident comes as human rights groups have documented a rise in settler violence in the occupied West Bank since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began.
Since Oct. 7, at the start of the war in Gaza, 344 Palestinians, including 88 children, have been killed by security forces and settlers across the West Bank, according to data from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Dror Sadot, a spokesperson for B’Tselem, an organization that documents human rights violations against Palestinians, told NBC News in a phone interview on Sunday that cases of reported settler violence are rarely thoroughly investigated by Israeli authorities — and even more rarely prosecuted.
Settlements, which are considered illegal under international law, are Jewish communities that have formed in the West Bank after it was occupied by Israel in 1967. Israel maintains that only settlements built without permits or on state land should be considered illegal.
Even as settler attacks in the West Bank increased, Abdel Jabbar thought the small village he grew up in would remain far from the violence.
He repeatedly assured friends and family in the U.S. that Al-Mazra’a Al-Sharqiya was safe when they expressed mounting concerns over violence in the territory.
Karim Taha, a board member of the mosque Tawfic belonged to in Louisiana, Masjid Omar, said the 17-year-old's community was devastated by his death.
""We are like brothers and sisters. We all lived here in the 'West Bank',"" he said, referring to the West Bank of the Mississippi River. ""We all share happiness and sadness. We’re just like a family here.""
""Everybody's sad and I guess there's nowhere safe in Palestine now,"" he said. ""Either you get hit by a soldier or the settlers.""
Abdel Jabbar said his own anger and despair is deepened by his shock over what he sees as the U.S. government’s indifference to his son’s killing.
On Friday, the U.S. State Department confirmed that a U.S. citizen had died in the West Bank and offered condolences to the family. It said U.S. officials were still working to understand the circumstances and had asked the Israeli government for more information.
Hours before, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said in a briefing that while U.S. officials didn’t have “perfect context about exactly what happened,” the White House was “seriously concerned about it.”
The response, Abdel Jabbar said, was “humiliating” for his family. “He didn’t say a child — he didn’t say who was the killer.”
Abdel Jabbar also questioned the U.S. government’s allegiances, should it conduct an investigation into his son’s death, “when my government is supporting” Israel, including in its offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 25,000 people since the war began, with more than 62,000 injured and thousands more missing and considered dead, according to Palestinian health authorities.
Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attacks that killed about 1,200 people in Israel and saw more than 260 taken hostage into the enclave, where more than 100 people remain captive, according to Israeli officials.
“Where’s your concern there?” Abdel Jabbar said, addressing the White House. “Where’s the weapons that you send them to kill all these children?” he said, referring to the billions of dollars Israel receives from the U.S. in military assistance annually, including emergency arms transfers to further bolster Israel’s war chest last month.
“Americans, us, our government backs it up,” Abdel Jabbar said. “Takes our money to give it to them,” he said, referring to Israel.
Since the start of the war, President Joe Biden has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza, but the death toll has continued to skyrocket in the months since. And Biden’s administration has expressed mounting concerns over settler violence in the West Bank.
Abdel Jabbar said his family had been contacted by U.S. officials about his son’s case and was expecting a visit from them. As an American citizen, he said, he expected the U.S. to seek justice over his son’s death.
“[I] work hard, built myself, pay taxes ... I married there, had all my children there. I’m a part of the community there. I’m an American citizen,” he said. “I live that American dream. But where’s the humanity?”
“My son is an American before Palestinian. He was born in the U.S.,” he said. “On his passport, [it] says ‘We will protect you. ... We will protect you and bring you justice.’”
“Where’s my son’s justice?” he said.

Under the latest agreement, wireless technology firm TD Tech will be jointly controlled by Huawei and a group of entities that include the government-owned Chengdu High-Tech Investment Group and Chengdu Gaoxin Jicui Technology Co, as well as venture capital firm Huagai, according to a disclosure published on Friday by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR).
The document did not reveal how much equity each of the new participants will hold. Before the sale, Nokia owned 51 per cent of TD Tech, while Huawei held 49 per cent.

Regulators said they had no antitrust concerns on the deal and would solicit public feedback until January 28. Huawei and TD Tech together control no more than 10 per cent of China's smartphone market, according to the SAMR, which did not specify the time frame for that data.

Huawei had a 14 per cent share in the Chinese smartphone market in the third quarter last year, putting it in fifth place behind its spin-off Honor and rivals Oppo, Vivo and Apple, data from market intelligence firm Counterpoint Research showed.
TD Tech, founded in 2005, had been a joint venture between Huawei and German tech conglomerate Siemens until 2007, when Siemens sold half of its stake to Nokia. In 2013, Siemens divested all its shares, making Nokia the major shareholder.
Known for its wireless communications equipment, including 4G and 5G networking gear, TD Tech has a presence in more than 100 countries serving 8 million industry customers, according to its website.
While Nokia had been the majority owner of the joint venture, Huawei has been the de facto controller, according to industry observers.
""The management are former Huawei employees, with product solutions based on Huawei products but fine-tuned for the industry market,"" Yang Guang, an analyst covering the telecoms sector at research firm Omdia, said last year.
When Nokia last year tried to sell its majority stake to Shanghai-listed ink maker New East New Materials, Huawei threatened to stop licensing technology to TD Tech. That deal ultimately collapsed.
Huawei likely did not want to lose control of TD Tech, which could help the Chinese tech giant circumvent some US sanctions and help it address certain market segments more efficiently, Yang said at the time.
TD Tech in 2021 started selling what amounted to rebranded Huawei phones under its own brand. They included the M40 5G, which used a 7-nanometre chip from Taiwan-based MediaTek instead of Huawei's own Kirin processors.
Sanctions imposed by Washington currently bar companies from selling to Huawei advanced chips made with US-origin technology, which includes MediaTek processors made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's largest contract chip maker.
Despite the US restrictions, Huawei last year launched its Mate 60 Pro, a handset equipped with an advanced, home-grown 5G processor.

YFLYVOS3C2_5Q59OMSXD7I95EZ,Too many renters in San Luis Obispo are getting cheated. Here’s what might help | Opinion,Brenden Jacoby,"January 22, 2024 at 3:00 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/too-many-renters-san-luis-180000576.html,"In San Luis Obispo, too many tenants are being cheated.
Renters make up 60% of households in SLO, but are often given a raw deal by their landlords. An astonishing lack of checks and balances provides tenants with few tools to stand up for themselves.
My friend Susan was cheated. For over two months, Susan lived with black mold in her closet because her landlord refused to take action to protect her health. Susan contracted multiple illnesses and was forced to move out. Despite not having lived in her home for months, her landlord insisted she continue to pay rent.
Opinion
My friend Chris was cheated. After three months of living with exposed insulation and wiring, a leaking fridge, broken windows and collapsed fences — conditions that landlords are required to address — Chris attempted to withhold rent to spur his landlord to act. His landlord threatened to evict him and lied by claiming it’s illegal to withhold rent, despite California law saying otherwise.
According to a 2020 Tribune survey of nearly 200 SLO County renters, 83% of renters polled reported living with unsafe conditions. However, only 4% reported their issues to a city or county authority.
Many tenants cite fear of landlord retaliation as the primary motivator for keeping their complaints secret. Even when tenants do decide to report their issue directly to their landlord, 30% of renters polled reported that their landlord refused to fix it.
To provide safe, affordable and secure housing to SLO tenants, we need to measure so that we can manage. Unfortunately, we aren’t measuring enough. The lack of data on rental units in SLO County is a consequence of the tenant-landlord power imbalance. According to PolicyLink, a national research and action institute advancing racial and economic equity, “there is little to no comprehensive, timely data available to understand the housing conditions and experiences of renters across the country.”
When basic information about rental units — such as the address of the unit or contact information of the landlord — is not reported to a housing authority, code inspectors must rely on tenant complaints to become aware of potential code infractions. However, the reality is that many tenants are afraid to report issues with their rentals.
SLO needs a rental registration program that provides information on housing availability, helps connect prospective renters with available properties and eases tenants’ fear of unlawful eviction. These programs provide key information to municipalities by collecting information on the price of rent, occupancy status of the unit, contact information for the landlord and more. Additionally, the programs often create online pathways for tenants to report landlord negligence or abuse directly to local agencies.
Measuring more puts a check on cheaters. According to a study by The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, “North Carolina cities with mandatory, proactive rental registration ordinances also found that the ordinances resulted in landlords bringing their properties into code compliance more rapidly, a decrease in residential fires and a reduction in code complaints.”
Rental registration programs are a ruler to measure fairness. Landlords who comply with codes lose nothing, and landlords who violate the rules are punished.
Two municipalities on the Central Coast recently passed rental registration programs. In July 2023, the Salinas City Council adopted a residential rental registration ordinance, which will help the city “develop and implement housing element requirements, support additional production of rental units and ... provide a robust platform to provide much-needed fair housing services and supports.” Monterey’s rental registration program launched Jan. 1 and aims to “inform future policy decisions about the regulation of the rental market.”
Not all landlords cheat their tenants. My friend Jim’s water heater recently broke and, without a second thought, his landlord paid for its replacement. However, not all tenants in SLO have Jim’s landlord, and they might lack Jim’s knack for self-advocacy. Many tenants in our city and county are discriminated against due to language barriers, immigration status or income levels.
We all deserve safe, secure, affordable housing. We must advocate for a rental registration program that fills the information gap that perpetuates tenant abuse and protect our neighbors from being taken advantage of. It’s harder to cheat when everyone is watching.

Changed Lives said Lily was raised in an orphanage, and had to flee her foster home when life became dangerous.
She became pregnant whilst sleeping rough, and the charity made an appeal for support with Mustard Seed Jersey.
The sponsor, who wishes to remain anonymous, said she came forward to ensure Lily and her daughter had long term and sustainable support.
Nelu Radu, from Changed Lives, said life had been very hard for Lily.
He said: ""She didn't have food to eat and she had to live on garbage - the father of her baby left her and she was pregnant on the street.
""She was pregnant on the street with no one to accept her and we agreed to take her in.""
The charity shared the appeal for help with the Jersey-based Mustard Seed charity, which has helped people in Romania for nearly 30 years.
""She now understands that someone will take care of her and not abandon her, it was very impressive from people in Jersey to be so generous,"" Mr Radu said.
Rose Pallot, founder of Mustard Seed, said the sponsor knew how important her donations were.
She said: ""She told me how she's going to continue to pray for Lily and her daughter.
""I can never get over how compassionate this island is, and I keep thinking compassion fatigue will set in, but it never does.""
Lily said the support from Jersey would change their lives.
""I want to thank you very much. God bless you - thank you.""

YHPC90DMG6_IVMQNVFSXXMQW1O,New Hampshire primary: Attacks fly as Donald Trump grows lead,"Bernd Debusmann Jr - BBC News, Washington","January 22, 2024 at 7:16 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/hampshire-primary-attacks-fly-donald-172746764.html,"Nikki Haley has gone on the offensive against Donald Trump, just days before the Republican New Hampshire primary.
She has previously avoided lashing out at the former president, but Mr Trump's attacks have become more personal as his commanding lead in the polls has grown.
Mr Trump is leading with 50% of likely Republican voters in the state, with Nikki Haley trailing far behind.
On Sunday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis dropped out of the race altogether.
With his campaign faltering, Mr DeSantis admitted he had no path to victory - setting up a two-horse race in New Hampshire. And he endorsed Mr Trump.
In last week's Iowa caucus, Mr Trump dominated Ms Haley and Ron DeSantis.
But even with that decisive win and a clear lead in the upcoming New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, Mr Trump has gone on the attack against Ms Haley.
His criticisms appear to have convinced her to turn up the heat on the former president.
Mr Trump went after his former UN ambassador at a campaign rally over the weekend, but he seemed to confuse her for another political foe - former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - when speaking about the Capitol riot.
On CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, Ms Haley seized on the slip up and struck back at the former president, saying that his ""mental stability will probably continue to decline"".
""No matter what it is, chaos follows,"" she added. ""In some cases he [Mr Trump] causes it. In some cases he doesn't... he's like a magnet to it. What happens is that puts the rest of America in chaos, and people are tired.""
The former UN ambassador also blasted her onetime boss as soft on undemocratic leaders, alleging he did not hold Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and China's Xi Jinping accountable.
""You can't have someone who's trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us,"" Ms Haley said on CBS. ""Instead, you have to let them know what we expect of them. That's the difference.""
Characterising Mr Trump as a mayhem and temper-fueled candidate appears to be a new counter deployed by Ms Haley. It comes after he has ramped up personal insults on her in recent days.
On Friday, for example, Mr Trump took to social media to refer to Ms Haley as ""Nimbra"", a misspelling of her birth name Nimarata, and to baselessly suggest she was ineligible to serve as president or vice president in the US.
The jab against the US-born Ms Haley - whose parents emigrated to the US from India in the 1960s - was reminiscent of the false birther attacks Mr Trump deployed against former President Barack Obama.
Ms Haley responded to the baseless claim by telling reporters in New Hampshire that Mr Trump is ""clearly insecure if he goes and does these temper tantrums"".
Her decision to fight back against Mr Trump - something she has been loath to do on the campaign trail - may have come too late in this primary, however.
While Ms Haley appeared to have some momentum a few weeks ago, polls released before Mr DeSantis quit showed Mr Trump dominating ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
Mr Trump led with 55% support among likely Republican voters, compared to 36% for Ms Haley and just 6% for Mr DeSantis.
Haley's uphill battle to catch Trump in New Hampshire
What to watch for in the New Hampshire primary
A separate poll, from CNN, had Mr Trump with 50% support, compared to 39% for Ms Haley and 6% for Mr DeSantis.
The former president's lead has prompted Haley campaign officials and political allies to temper and downplay expectations for New Hampshire after previously expressing optimism.
New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, who has campaigned for Ms Haley, told NBC News that she ""doesn't have to win"" in his home state. He claimed that any momentum from this week's race offers an ""amazing opportunity to turn this around"".
Additionally, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney repeatedly declined to offer a prediction during an on-the-record briefing with Bloomberg News, telling reporters only that Ms Haley needs ""incremental progress"".
""I know everyone wants us to put a number on it,"" she said. ""We have never done that. We never will.""
Mr Trump's campaign has also received a boost from the endorsements of two former opponents for the Republican nomination, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.
Ms Haley also received an endorsement from a former rival, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who never earned much support and ended his bid for the Republican nomination last week.
""Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years,"" he said in a post on X. ""Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so.""
Still, Ms Ankney said that ""beating Donald Trump is not easy"" and appeared to push for a longer view of the campaign.
""He is a juggernaut,"" she said of Trump. ""But how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. We have to continue to show incremental growth and progress until we are the last man, or woman, standing against him."""

The Kyiv Independent is reposting it with permission.
Ukrainian SOE Weekly is an independent weekly digest based on a compilation of the most important news related to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and state-owned banks in Ukraine. The contents of this publication are the sole responsibility of the editorial team of the Ukrainian SOE Weekly. The SOE Weekly is produced and financed by Andriy Boytsun.

Cabinet completes the composition of Naftogaz’s supervisory board. On Dec. 29, 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed Kostiantyn Marievich as a state representative and seventh member of Naftogaz’s supervisory board. This completes the board, Naftogaz said.
Marievich had already served as a state representative on Naftogaz’s supervisory board from June 26-Sept. 11, 2019 when his powers were terminated early. Marievich served on that board together with another current board member, Ludo Van der Heyden, who had been appointed as an independent member on the same day as Marievich.
As we reported in SOE Weekly’s Issue 83, Marievich was also a state representative on the first supervisory board of Main Gas Pipelines of Ukraine (MGU) from Feb. 28, 2018 to Sept. 18, 2019. According to SOE Weekly’s estimates, he received around Hr 6.40 million (around $239,000) in this post.
In addition, Marievich served as a state representative on Ukrzaliznytsia’s supervisory board from June 20, 2018-Dec. 18, 2019.
The Cabinet also approved him for appointment as a state representative on the supervisory board of Polygraph Combine Ukraine on March 7, 2023. We are not aware if the actual appointment took place.
According to the Government Portal, Marievich joined the Cabinet’s staff in April 2016 as deputy chief of staff of Deputy Prime Minister Volodymyr Kistion. He was the State Secretary of the Economy Ministry from June 2020 to June 2021. In June 2021, he was appointed as a Deputy State Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers.
As we reported in June 2023 (Issue 95), the Cabinet had yet to appoint the seventh member to Naftogaz’s supervisory board, five months after the appointment of six members on 24 January 2023.

The supervisory board members appointed back then included Anthony Marino (board chair), Tor Martin Anfinnsen, Richard Hookway, and Ludo Van der Heyden as independent members. The state representatives included Rostyslav Shurma and Nataliya Boyko (deputy board chair). See Issue 72 for detail.
Note that according to Naftogaz’s charter, the supervisory board should consist of seven members: a majority of independent members and a minority of state representatives. This meant that one more member of the supervisory board remained to be appointed, which could be either a state representative or an independent member.
In Issue 104, we reported that the White House sent Ukraine a list of priority reforms, which, among other things, included appointing a seventh member on Ukrenergo’s and Naftogaz’s supervisory boards. Following this, Naftogaz’s CEO Oleksiy Chernyshov said that “this is not a problem at all."" “One more state representative will be added. This condition is absolutely feasible,” he said.
Cabinet officially converts Energoatom into a joint-stock company. On Dec. 29, 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the long-awaited transformation. According to YouControl, joint-stock company Energoatom was registered on Jan. 11, 2024.
According to the Cabinet’s resolution, the joint-stock company is the legal successor of all property and non-property rights and obligations of the State Enterprise National Nuclear Energy Generating Company (SE NNEGC) Energoatom from the date of the company’s state registration.
The Cabinet also approved the new company’s charter and supervisory board regulations and issued an ordinance for a competitive selection of independent supervisory board members.
In addition, acting executive board members have been appointed until a permanent executive board can take their place. Petro Kotin, the CEO of SE NNEGC Energoatom, was appointed as an acting CEO of the newly established Joint-Stock Company Energoatom.
Besides Kotin, the acting members of the company’s executive board are:
Yurii Sheiko – former Acting First Deputy CEO / Chief Technical Officer of SE NNEGC;
Hartmut Jacob – former Deputy CEO; and
Oleksandr Ostapovets – former Inspector General / Director for Safety.
In February 2023 (Issue 74), we reported that the Verkhovna Rada passed Draft Law No. 8067 on the corporatization of Energoatom on Feb. 6, 2023.
According to the Rada’s Energy Committee, establishing good corporate governance of SOEs is one of Ukraine’s obligations under the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU.

Energoatom remains 100% owned by the state, specifically the Cabinet of Ministers. Its shares cannot be privatized or divided.
As we wrote two and half years ago in Issue 40, decisions to launch Energoatom’s corporatization have been in the works for a decade, starting at least with the National Action Plan for 2012 on the Implementation of the Program of Economic Reforms in Ukraine for 2010-2014.
One year ago (Issue 79), we reported that corporate governance reform of Energoatom was among the government’s top priorities for 2023. According to the Cabinet of Ministers’ Priority Action Plan, Energoatom was to be converted into a joint-stock company by May 2023. The nuclear power operator was also slated to receive a competitively selected supervisory board with an independent majority. The deadline was November 2023.
In Issue 80, we reported that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a law on the corporatization of Energoatom on March 17, 2023.
As we wrote in Issue 86, the Cabinet approved the conversion of Energoatom into a joint-stock company to comply with the law. The Cabinet established a commission for this purpose. It was chaired by Oleksii Sobolyev, Deputy Minister of Economy, and included Petro Kotin, Energoatom’s CEO, Farid Safarov, Deputy Minister of Energy, and another eight members.
As we reported in Issue 113, on Dec. 1, 2023, the Energy Ministry announced an agreement with the head-hunter firm hired to find Energoatom a supervisory board – Executive Search Ukraine LLC (doing business as Amrop). See Issue 113 for more detail.
For a detailed account on the corporatiaation of Energoatom, see SOE Weekly’s Issues 40, 41, 53, 58, 69, 74, 79, 80, 86, and 113.

Cabinet appoints the supervisory board of UDI. On Dec. 29, 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers appointed the supervisory board of the joint-stock company Ukrainian Defense Industry (UDI).
According to the Cabinet’s ordinance, the supervisory board members from Jan. 10 are:
Oleksiy Honcharuk (Ukraine; former Prime Minister of Ukraine – from August 2019 to March 2020) – independent member;
Serhiy Konovets (Ukraine; previously a member of the supervisory board at Ukreximbank and earlier, CFO at Naftogaz, currently, an independent member of the supervisory board at the Gas Transmission System Operator of Ukraine – GTSOU) – independent member;
Tymofiy Mylovanov (Ukraine; President of the Kyiv School of Economics, Associate Professor of the University of Pittsburgh, former Economy Minister – from August 2019 to March 2020, former chair of Ukroboronprom’s supervisory board) – state representative nominated by the Economy Ministry;
David Lomjaria (Georgia; a state representative on Ukrzaliznytsia’s supervisory board, Executive Vice President of Iberia Group, Managing Partner of Four Seas Trading and chair of the supervisory board of SunEnergy Bank – all based in Georgia) – state representative nominated by the Defense Ministry; and
Linndy Smith (USA; President and CEO of an NGO called Arizona Defense & Industry Coalition – AZDIC) – state representative nominated by the Strategic Industries Ministry.
The term of office of the supervisory board members is three years.
According to UDI, on Jan. 16, Lomjaria was elected as the board chair. Board committees were also formed and the schedule of meetings for 2024 was approved, UDI added.
As we wrote in June 2023, the State Concern Ukroboronprom was dissolved and replaced by a joint-stock company called Ukrainian Defense Industry (UDI).
The concept of corporate governance reform and conversion of Ukroboronprom, including its target model and detailed action plan, was drafted by Andriy Boytsun, Oleksandr Lysenko, and Dmytro Yablonovskyi, members of the SOE Weekly team, as well as the international law firm Kinstellar, in March 2020. For a discussion of these documents, see the OECD Review of the Corporate Governance of State-Owned Enterprises in Ukraine.

We also reported that Ukroboronprom’s CEO Yuriy Husiev resigned, and the Cabinet of Ministers appointed Herman Smetanin as the CEO of newly established UDI. See SOE Weekly’s Issue 95 for more detail.
Cabinet unblocks the work of Ukreximbank’s supervisory board after more than seven months. On Jan. 12, the Cabinet of Ministers approved an ordinance allowing Ukreximbank’s supervisory board to start working despite being incomplete.
As we reported in December 2023 (see Issue 113), even though the Cabinet appointed new independent members of Ukreximbank’s board on May 30, 2023, the same ordinance blocked the board’s work.
Under the ordinance, supervisory board members serve for three years from the date on which all independent members officially assume their roles. At the same time, only five out six independent board members have been appointed after NBU’s approval. See Issue 113 for detail.
On Jan. 12, the Cabinet amended its May 30, 2023 ordinance, removing the requirement that all independent board members must be appointed in order for the board to assume its duties. Following that, the renewed supervisory board started its work on Jan. 17.
Oleksandr Bevz, Yuriy Butsa, and Viktoriya Strakhova are state representatives, Sylvia Gansser-Potts, Razvan Munteanu, Robert Kossmann, Dominique Menu, and Rostyslav Futalo are independent members.

Sense Bank appoints a new CEO. On Dec. 20, Sense Bank reported that its supervisory board had elected Oleksii Stupak as the new bank’s CEO following a competitive selection.
According to Sense Bank, the selection was carried out with the assistance of the recruitment company Odgers Berndtson, with more than 30 candidates considered in the process. Stupak’s candidacy is yet to be approved by National Bank of Ukraine (NBU).
According to Sense Bank, Oleksii Stupak has 21 years of experience in the banking sector. He started his banking career in 2002 at Pravex Bank, where he was responsible for corporate and VIP clients. Since 2008, he has held senior positions at Credit Agricole Ukraine.
Stupak joined Sense Bank in June 2019. He held the position of Corporate Business Director, after which he moved to the position of Head of Corporate Investment, Small and Medium Businesses. He has held this position to this day, the bank added.
As we reported in Issue 98, Sense Bank, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and Andrey Kosogov, was nationalied in late July 2023.
On July 23, 2023, the Individuals Deposit Guarantee Fund (DGF) appointed the supervisory and executive boards of Sense Bank, based on proposals from the Finance Ministry, with the approval of the NBU. On July 24, 2023, Sense Bank announced the start of work of the new executive and supervisory boards. See more in Issue 98.
As we wrote in Issue 100, as soon as Aug. 14, 2023, Sense Bank reported that its CEO Dmytro Kuzmin had resigned for personal reasons.
Deputy CEO Olena Zubchenko then started temporarily acting as CEO. The supervisory board would begin selecting and appointing a new permanent CEO as soon as possible, Sense Bank then added.

HACC sets bail for Kudin in the Sennychenko corruption case. On Jan. 17, the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) reported that the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC) set bail of Hr 9 million ($240,000) for the former First Deputy Head of the State Property Fund (SPFU) Denys Kudin in the case of misappropriation of funds from Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC).
According to SAPO, Kudin has the following procedural responsibilities:
to appear at every request of the detective, prosecutor and court;
not to leave Kyiv without the permission of the detective, prosecutor, or court;
notify the detective, prosecutor, or court of any changes in his place of residence and place of work;
refrain from communicating with other suspects in the case and witnesses;
deposit his passport for travelling abroad and other documents entitling him to leave or enter Ukraine with the relevant state authorities.
The obligations are valid until March 17.
As we reported in Issue 80, in March 2023, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and SAPO said that they exposed a criminal group run by the former head of the SPFU, Dmytro Sennychenko.
Sennychenko headed the SPFU from September 2019 to February 2022. He filed his resignation letter in November 2021, but the Verkhovna Rada only approved his resignation on Feb. 17, 2022.

According to NABU, the criminal group headed by Sennychenko misappropriated over Hr 500 million ($13 million) from Odesa Portside Plant (OPZ) and United Mining and Chemical Company (UMCC) throughout 2019-2021, but it did not end there. The criminal group’s members allegedly received Hr 2 billion ($53 million) in benefits while controlling the Odesa plant, NABU stated. See Issue 80 for more detail.
As we reported in Issue 83, in April 2023 the suspects in this case, including Sennychenko, were placed on the wanted list.
In November 2023 (Issue 112), we wrote that NABU and SAPO updated charges against all members of the criminal group allegedly led by Sennychenko. They are now also suspected of legalising criminal proceeds worth over Hr 10 billion ($267 million).
According to NABU, Sennychenko had nine accomplices. See Issue 112 for detail.
As we reported in Issue 114, on Dec. 12, 2023, NABU and SAPO served a notice of suspicion to Denys Kudin, former First Deputy Head of the SPFU. He also served on the supervisory board of OPZ.
Kudin then confirmed that he had received the notice of suspicion. He stated that he would legally prove his innocence.
In February 2023, Ukrnafta’s CEO Serhiy Koretskiy wrote that Kudin, who had recently stepped down as First Deputy Economy Minister, was appointed to head Ukrnafta’s department for strategy, development, and government relations. See Issue 75.
Kudin was the First Deputy Economy Minister from November 2021. Earlier, he was First Deputy Head of the SPFU. Prior to that, he worked with Koretskiy for the WOG chain of petrol stations in 2013-2018.
Ukrainian banks make a profit of Hr 130 billion in the first 11 months of 2023; state-owned banks earn more than 60% of the total. Opendatabot wrote that the top 10 banks account for 87% of the total profit, or Hr 112.95 billion ($3 billion).
The five state-owned banks made 61.5% of Ukrainian banks’ total profits.
Hr 54.46 billion ($1.5 billion), or 41.7% of the total, was earned by PrivatBank, which has consistently held the lead. PrivatBank’s earnings have doubled from Hr 26.33 billion ($169 million) compared to the first 11 months of 2021, the year before Russia’s full-scale invasion, Opendatabot added.
Oschadbank is in the second place, with Hr 11.56 billion ($308 million) against Hr 1.37 billion ($36 million) in the first 11 months of 2021.

The recently nationalized Sense Bank is third with Hr 5.25 billion ($140 million), up from Hr 3.08 billion ($82 million) in the corresponding period of 2021. As we reported earlier, Sense Bank, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and Andrey Kosogov, was nationalized in late July 2023. See more in SOE Weekly’s Issue 98.
Ukreximbank earned Hr 4.93 billion ($132 million) in the first 11 months of 2023, compared to Hr 2.25 billion ($60 million) in the same period of 2021.
Ukrgasbank earned Hr 4.08 billion ($109 million) against Hr 3.48 billion ($92 million), respectively.
Naftogaz Group paid over Hr 90 billion in taxes in 2023. On Jan. 15, Naftogaz Group reported that it paid Hr 83.4 billion ($2.2 billion) in taxes to the state budget and another Hr 6.8 billion ($181 million) to local budgets in 2023.
As we wrote in 2023, Naftogaz Group paid:
Hr 33 billion ($881 million) in taxes for the first four months (January–April 2023, see SOE Weekly’s Issue 87);
over Hr 48 billion ($1.3 billion) for the first seven months (January–July 2023, see Issue 99);
over Hr 70 billion ($1.9 billion) for the first nine months (January–September 2023, see Issue 107); and
over Hr 75 billion ($2 billion) for the first ten months (January–October 2023, see Issue 111).
Ukrnafta paid over Hr 25 billion in taxes in 2023. On Jan. 17, Ukrnafta reported that it paid over Hr 25.7 billion ($686.8 million) in taxes in 2023. According to the company, this includes Hr 4.36 billion ($116.5 million) of income tax.
As we reported in Issue 111, Ukrnafta’s CEO Serhiy Koretskiy said in November 2023 that the company paid Hr 12.3 billion ($328.7 million) in taxes in the first half of 2023, including Hr 3.3 billion ($88 million) in income tax. According to him, Ukrnafta planned to pay Hr 27 billion ($721.5 million) in taxes for the entire year 2023, including about Hr 5 billion($133.6 million) in income tax.
Koretskyi also said back then that Ukrnafta projected Hr 95 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue in the first year after the company was seized by the state. This would double the average annual figure over the past decade, he added.

According to Koretskyi, Ukrnafta’s net profit for the first half of 2023 was Hr 14.1 billion ($376.8 million). As of November 2023, the net profit exceeded Hr 20 billion ($534 million).
We have not been able to find Ukrnafta’s audited or unaudited financial statements for 2021, 2022, or the first half of 2023 in the public domain to verify the above information.
According to Ukrainian law, joint-stock companies, particularly those publicly traded, are obligated to publicly disclose various types of information, such as their financial statements.
However, after the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion, the National Security and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC) allowed companies to withhold such disclosure.
In June, NSSMC decided that this exemption would be effective until Jan. 1, 2024. After that date, joint-stock companies must resume public disclosure of the above information, including information that was not disclosed during the exemption period.
As we wrote in SOE Weekly’s Issue 90, Ukrnafta’s financial plan for 2023, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, expected Hr 74 billion ($1.8 billion) in net income from operations, Hr 12 billion ($320 million) in net profit, and Hr 25 billion ($668 million) in tax payments.
As we wrote in Issue 100, in his analysis for Forbes Ukraine, CASE Ukraine’s economist Vasyl Povoroznyk contested Koretskyi’s statements on the company’s quarterly profits, lower costs, higher production, and transparency.

He concluded that Ukrnafta’s financial performance was driven by two factors: higher market prices for petrol and diesel (45% and 54%, respectively) and Ukrnafta’s sale of gas which the company received as repayment of part of Naftogaz’s historical debt to Ukrnafta.
Povoroznyk also said that the financial reporting disclosed by Naftogaz – Ukrnafta’s majority shareholder who includes Ukrnafta’s reporting in its consolidated reporting – did not square with numbers named by Koretsky.
In Issue 68, we reported that the shares of Ukrnafta, Ukrtatnafta, Motor Sich, AvtoKrAZ, and Zaporizhzhiatransformator (ZTR) were seized “for the needs of the state” and transferred to the Defense Ministry on Nov. 6, 2022.
Former CEO of the WOG chain of petrol stations, Sergii Koretskyi, became the CEO of both Ukrnafta and Ukrtatnafta on Nov. 8 and 10, 2022, respectively. See Issue 68 for detail.
Energoatom fully paid compensation of tariffs for households under PSO for 2023. On Jan. 11, Energoatom reported that it has fully fulfilled its public service obligations (PSO) to provide households with affordable electricity.
According to Energoatom, it has paid almost Hr 128 billion ($3.4 billion) for the PSO service to the Guaranteed Buyer since the start of 2023 while the expected cost was more than Hr 7 billion ($187 million) less. As a result, the company managed to reduce the total debt for PSO services by almost Hr 4 billion ($106 million) in 2023, Energoatom added.

Former owner of Sense Bank sues Ukraine over nationalization, demands $1 billion. On Jan. 4, ABH Holdings S.A. (ABHH), the previous nominal owner of Sense Bank’s shares, owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman, announced that it filed a request for arbitration and a statement of claim against Ukraine on Dec. 29 2023.
According to ABHH, it seeks full compensation “for the unlawful expropriation” of Sense Bank by the Ukrainian authorities through enforced nationalization.
The claim has been filed with the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), the world’s leading body for investor/state dispute resolution under the aegis of the World Bank in Washington, D.C. The amount claimed is more than $1 billion, ABHH’s release reads.

Later, ABHH told Forbes Ukraine that it specifically demanded compensation “for the illegal expropriation of the bank."" “No other form, such as the return of the bank or shares, is considered,"" the company said.
The NBU told Ekonomichna Pravda (EP) that it was confident in the legitimacy of the decision to nationalize the bank. Kateryna Rozhkova, NBU’s First Deputy Governor, told EP that the NBU would help the Justice Ministry to prepare for hearings on ABHH’s claim. According to Rozhkova, Ukraine has every chance of having this dispute resolved in its favor.
Rozhkova said that in deciding to nationalize Sense Bank, the regulator acted in the interest of the bank’s depositors and financial stability. By law, bank owners are obliged to maintain their capital and liquidity at an appropriate level. As Sense Bank’s former owners were under sanctions, they were unable to do so, she said.
As we reported in Issue 98, Sense Bank, previously owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven, and Andrey Kosogov, was nationalized in late July 2023.

The original Anthropologie mirror costs $1,198 while the dupes cost $149.
The mirror dupe comes after the internet's obsession with Stanley cups.
Some shoppers are rushing to their local Costco and Sam's Club to snag a dupe of a pricey floor-length Anthropologie mirror.
While much of the internet is still obsessed with the viral Stanley Cups, some shoppers are shifting their attention to the Ravena Floor Mirror sold at Costco for $149.99. The mirror, which has silver and gold frame options, is 65 inches tall and 30 inches wide.

The item appears to no longer be available on the website and has excited some online users, including the Instagram account @costcohotfinds. The account shared a video about the mirror on January 9 and amassed 15.3 million views.
""FINALLY!!! The Costco mirror is making its rounds through the regions and it was worth the wait!!!"" the account wrote in the caption.
A separate video shared by the Instagram account @costconew on January 7 also drew attention, gaining 3.3 million views.
The original gold-framed Anthropologie mirror, dubbed the Luisa Mirror, is available on the luxury retailer's website for $1,198. It's 72.5 inches tall and 34.75 inches wide.
While some commenters talked about getting their hands on the Costco dupe, others said they preferred a dupe from Sam's Club. The Azalea Park Filigree Floor Mirror is available on the company's website for $149.98. The Sam's Club version is 72 inches tall and 36 inches wide with a gold frame.
""I got a Sam's Club membership solely for their anthropology dupe a year ago,"" one user wrote in @costcohotfinds' comment section on TikTok.

These 2 Stocks Are Trading Near Their 52-Week Lows and Are Cheap Buys Right Now","David Jagielski, The Motley Fool","January 21, 2024 at 7:23 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/got-5-000-2-stocks-102300057.html,"Did you know that achieving a 10% return over a period of 25 years would turn a $5,000 investment into more than $54,000? And that's just if you average the S&P 500's long-run return of 10%. If you invest in market-beating stocks that average greater returns, then your investment could be worth even more than that. At 15%, that investment would grow to nearly $165,000. If you knock it out of the park and average 20%, then that $5,000 investment would be worth close to $477,000.
Those would be incredible returns -- and they wouldn't be easy to achieve. One way you can increase the odds of netting a big return is by investing in stocks that have low valuations today, and that investors may be discounting too heavily. Two stocks that look like they fit those criteria right now are Alibaba Group Holdings (NYSE: BABA) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX).
Here's why investing $5,000 into one or both of these stocks could be a great move for long-term investors.
Alibaba Group is one of the largest Chinese stocks in the world, with a market cap of $180 billion. But it has been struggling for multiple years. Poor relations between China and the U.S. have resulted in investors being bearish on the e-commerce stock. Its sluggish growth rate hasn't been all that exciting, either.
The stock has declined by a whopping 70% in just three years, and investors are paying a multiple of only 7 times its estimated future earnings to own a piece of the company. That's a dirt cheap multiple, as the S&P 500 average is nearly 22.
The valuation appears too low because while Alibaba has struggled to generate growth in recent years, it has been improving in recent quarters. COVID restrictions have affected the Chinese economy in recent years, but in the long run, there's still lots of potential for the e-commerce giant to succeed.
BABA Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts
Alibaba could potentially be a big player in artificial intelligence (AI) as well, rolling out its own chatbot last year -- Tongyi Qianwen. In October, it launched its second version of the chatbot. And with 80% of Chinese tech companies using Alibaba Cloud, the company could have plenty of opportunities to upsell its customers on the latest, cutting-edge AI technologies.
For AI investors, Alibaba could make for an underrated buy. A $5,000 investment in this stock has the potential to go a long way in the future.
Chevron's stock has done well over the past three years, with its share price rising by 54% during that time, thanks to rising oil prices. But recently, investors have been less bullish as Chevron's valuation has dipped 17% over the past 12 months. However, it's inevitable that as oil prices rise and fall, so too will Chevron's valuation, since the oil and gas producer depends so much on the price of the commodity.
CVX Total Return Level data by YCharts
The oil and gas stock is trading within $10 of its 52-week low, and its forward price-to-earnings multiple is just 11. Investors are getting a potential bargain of a buy for one of the top oil and gas companies in the world. Chevron is also one of the top holdings in Warren Buffett-owned Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, representing 4.5% of its total value.
A big reason investors may want to buy shares of the stock, besides just its low price, is that Chevron also offers a high yield of 4.1%. The company has also increased its dividend for 36 consecutive years.
While investors may worry about the long-term prospects of a top oil and gas producer at a time when global economies are trying to be greener, the company is attempting to do its part. By 2028, Chevron plans to invest $10 billion into investments and projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions. It's also investing in hydrogen and renewable fuels.
For investors willing to take a bit of a contrarian position on this oil and gas giant, there's the potential for this to also be a market-beating investment in the long run.

The parent company of the stations, New York-based Townsquare Media, was ordered Wednesday to pay $500,000 to the U.S. Treasury.
The penalty follows an investigation by the Media Bureau, a division of the FCC, which licenses radio stations, that found that KIDO-AM (580) in Nampa and KLIX-AM in Twin Falls broadcast political advertisements and episodes of a hour-long program called “Keep Idaho Red” for over a year without disclosing that it was paid to do so by the Idaho Republican Party and later by Tom Luna, on behalf of Luna’s company Tom Luna and Associates.
Luna and Victor Miller, chairman of the Ada County Republican Party, were the hosts of each episode, and were solely responsible for producing the show and selecting guests, according to the order. Luna, former state superintendent of public instruction, was chair of the Idaho GOP for two years before being unseated by state Rep. Dorothy Moon in 2022.
The order from the FCC said neither station provided on-air sponsorship identification announcements for the “vast majority” of episodes, nor advertisements that would have informed listeners who was paying for the content they were listening to.
The violations occurred between October 2021 and March 2023.
“In addition, multiple episodes of the program contained appearances that constituted uses by legally qualified candidates for public office and communicated messages relating to political matters of national importance,” FCC Media Bureau Chief Holly Saurer said in the order, was first reported by BoiseDev. “Neither station uploaded records of any such candidate uses or messages to their respective online political files.”
Townsquare Media in a consent decree admitted to the violations and agreed to implement a comprehensive plan to ensure future compliance with its sponsorship identification and online political file obligations, as well as submit annual compliance reports to the Media Bureau, in addition to paying the fine.
The media company is publicly traded and has an office off East Park Boulevard in Boise. A call to that office was referred to a Townsquare Media executive who did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.
Townsquare Media owns several other radio stations that serve the Treasure Valley, including Kiss FM, Lite FM, Power FM, Mix 106 and Wow Country.

Norm Eisen, who was the House of Representatives special counsel during Trump’s impeachment, said that the Georgia law does not require Wade to remove himself from the case, but that it would be a good thing to consider.
“My view is that the law does not require Mr. Wade to step down, but I think it would be the wise thing for him to voluntarily consider doing so,” Eisen said during an interview with The Hill on Saturday. “The advice that I would give Mr. Wade, if he asked me would be that this is a good time to step away from the case.”
Wade is an Atlanta-area attorney whom Willis hired as a special prosecutor to lead the case.
The former special counsel’s remarks represent the first instance that a Willis ally acknowledged the severity of the damages the allegations added to her and the ongoing case. Eisen also added that the facts of the relationship between the two “are not fully known, so we need to see how that develops.”
Eisen said that the case against Trump and his co-conspirators is “strong” and that the evidence is “powerful,” but that the parties involved should not waste time since the growing controversy could slow down the case.
“Trump could not have done that alone and his alleged co-conspirators, like Mr. Rome…need to be the focus of these proceedings,” Eisen said. He was referring to co-defendant Mike Roman, who sought to disqualify both Willis and Wade from the case in the allegations included in the fillings two weeks ago.
Eisen added that Willis should not step aside because of the importance of the case and because she was elected by her constituents to prosecute crimes.
“Willis has no legal obligation to step down,” Eisen said. “Their management of the case has been successful. She was elected by the people of Fulton County to prosecute crimes, and this is a serious one that impacted her jurisdiction. So I not only think that she can remain, but I think that she must remain and continue working on the case.”
The accusations against Wills and Wade were filed by Roman’s attorney last week, claiming that Willis and Wade engaged in an “improper” romantic relationship, therefore making the indictment “fatally defective.”

YQC5PIMY7U_01POP6K7C1YX40S,The Farmers Had What the Billionaires Wanted,Conor Dougherty,"January 22, 2024 at 12:05 AM·19 min read",20231222,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/farmers-had-billionaires-wanted-160525488.html,"RIO VISTA, Calif. — When Jan Sramek walked into the American Legion post in Rio Vista, California, for a town hall meeting last month, everyone in the room knew that he was really just there to get yelled at.
For six years a mysterious company called Flannery Associates, which Sramek controlled, had upended the town of 10,000 by spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy every farm in the area. Flannery made multimillionaires out of some owners and sparked feuds among others. It sued a group of holdouts who had refused its above-market offers, on the grounds that they were colluding for more.
The company was Rio Vista’s main source of gossip, yet until a few weeks before the meeting no one in the room had heard of Sramek or knew what Flannery was up to. Residents worried it could be a front for foreign spies looking to surveil a nearby Air Force base. One theory held the company was acquiring land for a new Disneyland.
Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times
Now the truth was standing in front of them. And somehow it was weirder than the rumors.
The truth was that Sramek wanted to build a city from the ground up, in an agricultural region whose defining feature was how little it had changed. The idea would have been treated as a joke if it weren’t backed by a group of Silicon Valley billionaires who included Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist; Reid Hoffman, an investor and co-founder of LinkedIn; and Laurene Powell Jobs, the founder of the Emerson Collective and the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. They and others from the technology world had spent some $900 million on farmland in a demonstration of their dead seriousness about Sramek’s vision.
Rio Vista, part of Solano County, is technically within the San Francisco Bay Area, but its bait shops and tractor suppliers and Main Street lined with American flags can feel a state away. Sramek’s plan was billed as a salve for San Francisco’s urban housing problems. But paving over ranches to build a city of 400,000 wasn’t the sort of idea you’d expect a group of farmers to be enthused about.
As the TV cameras anticipated, a group of protesters had gathered in the parking lot to shake signs near pickup trucks. Inside, a crowd in jeans and boots sat in chairs, looking skeptical.
Sramek, 36, who is from the Czech Republic and had come to California to try to make it in startups, was now the center of their economy. Flannery had become the largest landowner in the region, amassing an area twice the size of San Francisco.
Christine Mahoney, 63, whose great-grandfather established her family’s farm when Rutherford B. Hayes was president, said that, like it or not, Sramek was now her neighbor. Mahoney had refused several offers for her land, and Flannery’s lawsuit — an antitrust case in federal court — described her as a conspirator who was out to bilk his company.
But she had never met the man in person, so she came to say hello.
“You might be asking yourself, ‘Why is this guy with a funny accent here?’” Sramek began the meeting.
He spent about 20 minutes pitching his plans before submitting to questions and resentments. People accused him of pushing small farms out of business. They said Flannery’s money was turning families against each other.
“Good neighbors don’t sue their neighbors!” one man yelled to applause.
Sramek, who is tall, intense and practiced in the art of holding eye contact, stayed up front after the meeting to glad-hand.
When Mahoney and her husband, Dan, 65, approached him, Sramek said, “Hi, Christine!” as if they had met several times before and he wasn’t currently suing her.
“I’d like to welcome you as our neighbor, but it’s kind of difficult,” Christine Mahoney said.
She talked about how much stress the lawsuit had put on her family.
Sramek nodded, as if she were talking about someone else, not him. Then he asked the couple to dinner. The Mahoneys agreed.
Going to the Ballot
One key difference between building an app and building a city is that a city requires permission. On Wednesday, Sramek’s company officially filed a proposed ballot initiative that would ask voters to buy in. Specifically, the measure aims to amend a long-standing “orderly growth” ordinance that protects Solano County’s farms and open space by steering development to urban areas.
Solano’s residents have consistently backed the city-centered-growth laws, so Sramek’s project is bound to be controversial. To overcome resistance, the initiative includes a long list of promises like new roads, money to invest in downtowns across the county and a $400 million fund to help Solano residents buy homes.
Sramek also revealed that he hoped to build directly next to Rio Vista, with a half-mile-wide park separating the old farming town from the new tech city. Renderings that his company released this month portray a medium-density community that is roughly the opposite of a subdivision, with a grid of row houses that lie a short walk from shops and have easy access to bike lanes and bus stops. He said the first phase of building could accommodate about 50,000 people.
Even if the measure gets on the ballot and passes, it will be one step on a path requiring approval from county, state and federal agencies — a long list of ifs that explains why large projects are usually measured in decades, not the few years that Sramek seems to imagine.
It’s a crucial step, however. Beyond amending the ordinance, a win would pressure county officials to work with Sramek, so opponents are already lining up. A group called Solano Together, a mix of agricultural and environmental organizations like Greenbelt Alliance, recently created a website that characterizes the project as harmful sprawl that would destroy farms.
The fight is something of a throwback. Whether it was paving over San Fernando Valley orange groves to build out Los Angeles or ripping out apricot farms in what is now Silicon Valley, California became the nation’s biggest state and economy largely by trading open and agricultural land for population and development.
That shifted in the 1960s and 1970s, when a backlash against the growth-first regime and its penchant for destroying landscapes helped create modern environmentalism. In the half-century since, this turn has been codified in laws that aim to restrict development to existing cities and their edges. It has protected farms and open space, but also helped drive up the cost of living by making housing scarcer and more expensive to build.
Sramek framed his proposal as a backlash to the backlash, part of an ideological project to revive Californians’ appetite for growth. If the state is serious about tackling its dire affordable housing problem, he argued, it doesn’t just have to build more housing in places like San Francisco and its suburbs — it also has to expand the urban footprint with new cities.
As a matter of policy, this is hard to dismiss. This is politics, however, so the bigger question is whether voters share his desire to return California to an era of expansion. And whether — after six years during which Sramek obfuscated his role in Flannery’s secret land acquisition, along with the company’s billionaire backers and true purpose, all while pursuing farmers with aggressive tactics and lawsuits — they find him trustworthy.
The Golden Boy vs. 1877
Christine and Dan Mahoney’s house looks onto a barn that says 1877, the year Christine Mahoney’s great-grandfather built it.
When I met the couple for an interview at their house last year, Christine Mahoney had decorated the dining table with black-and-white pictures of relatives in button dresses and bonnets. Later we drove along roads named for her ancestors.
Winding through the hills, Christine Mahoney ticked off parcels that belonged to the family, others that were owned by neighbors and more owned by Flannery. When I asked how she discerned the lines of ownership in an expanse of yellow grassland, she said: “You live here a hundred years.”
Sramek, meanwhile, talks about growth in moral terms, as if progress and wealth are simpatico and the most consequential people are those who build big things and a fortune along the way.
Driving near the Mahoneys’ ranch recently, through the same yellow hills, he posited that the mix of wealth and innovation that has exploded in the Bay Area has happened only a handful of times in history. (Florence, Paris, London, New York, Chicago and “maybe LA” were some others.) We were 60 miles from San Francisco in a place where the tallest structures are wind turbines, but his message was that the region could be an economic sun, and that bringing more people in the orbit was worthy of the trade-offs.
An immigrant and striver who at 22 was a co-author of a book called “Racing Towards Excellence,” Sramek got his first spurt of publicity at Goldman Sachs, where the financial press hailed him as a “Golden Boy” trader and considered it newsworthy when he left, after two years of employment, to chase a bigger dream in startups.
His tech career was less sparkling. After Goldman, he moved from London to Zurich and started a corporate education company called Better. It operated for two years and prompted a move to San Francisco, where he founded a social media company, Memo, in 2015.
Memo was billed as a higher-minded version of Twitter and won praise from venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. That praise was delivered on Twitter instead of Memo, which was pretty much the story: Memo failed to rack up users and shut down after a year.
His failures aside, Sramek was smitten with the Bay Area’s culture of creative capitalism. He was less enamored with the actual place.
The mythical Silicon Valley was in reality a bunch of office parks and cul-de-sacs where subdivision-grade homes went for $2 million. The more picturesque and urban San Francisco was being consumed by rising rents and their attendant homeless problems.
Complaining about the cost of living, and the region’s inability to fix it, had become something of a side hustle for many Bay Area CEOs. And after Memo, Sramek started looking for a big disruptive idea for them to fund.
“If we go back six or seven years, the popular hit in the press was ‘Silicon Valley is not doing enough in the real world,’” he said. “And I was sitting there working on this.”
Flannery Associates
Sramek likes to fish. The way he tells it, around 2016 he and his girlfriend (now wife) started making the one-hour drive from San Francisco to Rio Vista to catch bass on the Sacramento River. One of those trips, driving past pastures and grazing sheep, sparked an idea.
“What if you could start from scratch?” he said.
In a state whose agricultural bounty has historically been a function of moving water great distances, the area is something of an anachronism. For generations, families like the Mahoneys have practiced “dryland farming,” which means they rely on rain, not irrigation.
The Mahoneys talk about this the same way they talk about their land and family: with an emphasis on tradition and the romance of continuity. Sramek described the land as “not prime.”
The phrase angered several farmers at the Rio Vista town meeting, but in dollar terms it’s accurate. At the time of Sramek’s first fishing trip, land in the area was trading around $4,000 an acre — a pittance compared with a Central Valley almond orchard (about $10,000 to $55,000 per acre) or a Napa Valley vineyard (anywhere from $50,000 to more than $500,000 per acre), according to the California chapter of the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers.
Sramek starting doing research and soon found himself immersed in zoning policy and poring over old development maps dreaming of a startup city. Investors were initially reluctant, he said, so he borrowed $1 million from friends and banks to put a deposit on a handful of properties, then hired consultants and land-use lawyers to assess what it would take to build there.
By now Sramek was well networked. He had done a fellowship at Y Combinator, a startup incubator. He was in a book club with partners at Sequoia Capital. He was friends with billionaires like Patrick and John Collison, the sibling founders of the payments company Stripe.
The Collisons became two of Flannery’s first investors. Andreessen and Chris Dixon, also of the Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, joined soon after, along with Moritz, who was Sequoia’s chair. All of them helped Sramek solicit others.
In a 2017 note to potential investors I obtained, Moritz wrote that if “done right” the project could help relieve congestion and housing prices in the Bay Area, and mused about the potential to experiment with new kinds of governance. It could also be spectacularly profitable, he said: Moritz estimated that investors could make 10 times their money even if they just got the land rezoned, and far more if and when it was developed.
Flannery Associates was named for Flannery Road, which borders the first property Sramek bought. Aside from that detail and its Delaware incorporation, residents and public officials could find almost nothing about its shareholders or intentions. Just that it wanted a lot of land, didn’t care about the price and was willing to strong-arm owners when money didn’t work.
In addition to working their own land, many farmers in the area lease parcels where they grow crops and graze animals. As Flannery consumed more and more property, people like Ian Anderson found themselves in the uncomfortable position of trying to rebuff its offers for parcels they owned — while at the same time farming land they rented from Flannery.
Anderson learned how vulnerable he was after a local newspaper quoted him saying that the company had begun insisting on short-term leases and that this made it increasingly difficult to farm. Later, Flannery’s lawyer sent him a letter informing him that it was terminating multiple leases covering thousands of acres.
“The Andersons have made it clear that they do not like Flannery,” according to the letter. “The Andersons are of course free to have their opinions, but they cannot expect that Flannery will continue to just be a punching bag and lease property to them.”
Rep. John Garamendi, a Democrat from the area, characterized moves like this as “mobster techniques.” The bigger concern was that Flannery’s holdings had grown into a giant mass that butted against Travis Air Force Base on three sides.
The proximity to the base alarmed both the county and the Department of Defense, which prompted local officials and members of Congress to call for investigations. The investigations elevated the mystery of Flannery Associates into a mainstay on local TV news.
“The FBI was investigating this, the State Department was investigating this, the Treasury Department was investigating this — all the local electeds were trying to get information and calling their legislators,” said Rep. Mike Thompson, another Democrat from the area.
The company remained silent.
Sramek said Flannery had operated in secret to prevent landowners from jacking up prices, and defended the lawsuits as just. He argued that while some farmers didn’t want to sell, most had done so willingly — at prices no other buyer could offer.
“We paid way over market value, and created hundreds of millionaires in the process,” he said. “We are glad that we have been able to settle most of our disputes, and we are open to settling the remaining ones.”
A Simple Case of Wealthy Landowners?
By 2023, Sramek and his investors were in deep. Flannery had spent some $900 million buying 60,000 acres. The first two rounds of funding, at about $10 million each, had ballooned to several more rounds at $100 million each. (Sramek said the company had now raised “more than $900 million” but would not be more specific.)
Big investors begot bigger investors, and the list expanded to a roster of Silicon Valley heavyweights including Hoffman and Powell Jobs.
The company’s offers became so generous that many farmers decided they couldn’t refuse.
The Mahoneys sold Flannery a few hundred acres early on. (Their land is owned by several different entities and hard to tally overall, but in the 1960s Christine Mahoney’s father told a newspaper that he had 16,000 acres in the area.) But as Flannery gobbled more of the land around them, Christine Mahoney said, she realized that something big was happening and that their entire farming business could be at risk. So the family stopped selling to Flannery. The company persisted with more offers, however, improving terms and increasing prices to levels that would have netted tens of millions of dollars. The family continued to say no.
Flannery arrived while the Mahoneys were in the midst of transition. Over 150 years, the family’s company, R. Emigh Livestock, had expanded from two dozen lambs to one of largest sheep farmers in California. Christine Mahoney’s father was in his 90s (he died last year) and she was passing leadership to her son Ryan, who said his wish was to stay there until he was in his 90s, too.
You wouldn’t know it from her jeans or penchant for nostalgia, but Christine Mahoney had spent her career running a corporation, one whose business was raising lambs and cattle. She was, like Sramek, a CEO.
And after years of back and forth, one thing Flannery’s entreaties had made clear was that there was one property the Mahoneys owned that it coveted above the others: Goose Haven Ranch. But Goose Haven was the one the family was most protective of. It had been the center of the lambing operation long enough that the road leading up to it was designed for wagon traffic.
Elsewhere in the county, Flannery had started buying into farms by acquiring shares from family members who wanted out, then becoming what amounted to unwelcome partners with the ones who remained. Two of these arrangements led to lawsuits between Flannery and the other owners. Both settled, but one of them netted a trove of emails and text messages among several neighbors including the Mahoneys.
In May, Flannery used those messages to file an antitrust suit against the Mahoneys and several holdouts. The suit contended that the farmers were colluding to raise prices, describing them as “wealthy landowners who saw an opportunity to conspire, collude, price fix and illegally overcharge Flannery.” It asked for $510 million in damages.
The complaint describes the messages (like Christine Mahoney writing to a neighbor, “That’s great that we can support each other!”) as “a smoking gun” proving that the defendants did want to sell but at even higher prices than Flannery was offering.
In a joint motion to dismiss, lawyers for the Mahoneys and other defendants described Flannery’s lawsuit as “a ham-fisted intimidation technique” designed to smother them with legal fees.
Even after being sued, the Mahoneys still had no idea who Flannery actually was.
The Campaign Apology Tour
In August, The New York Times broke the news of who was behind the purchases. Sramek confirmed his role, and soon topped his LinkedIn profile with a new title: CEO of California Forever, the company’s new name.
He has been in campaign mode ever since, meeting with elected officials, union leaders and environmental groups. California Forever has opened four offices across the county, and Solano’s freeways are now plastered with California Forever billboards.
In a state where it can take years to get a duplex approved, Sramek seems to have calculated that his project is too big to fail. Developers, planners and lawyers I spoke to all expected the project to either never happen or take at least 20 years. Whether out of bluster, delusion or confidence, Sramek, who recently bought a house in nearby Fairfield, said he had promised his wife that their infant daughter would start school in the development he wanted to build.
He didn’t find some secret hack that can make California an easier place to build. Rather, he believes the state’s attitude toward growth is changing. Californians, he thinks, have grown frustrated — with punishing housing costs, with homelessness, with the state’s inability to complete projects like the high-speed rail line that was supposed to connect the Bay Area and Los Angeles but has stalled. So just maybe his will, and gobs of money, can create a new posture toward growth.
“There’s a cultural moment where we realize the pendulum has gone too far,” Sramek said. “We can’t say we are about economic opportunity and working-class Californians are leaving the state every year.”
Last year’s event in Rio Vista was held at the end of lambing season in December. Before the meeting, I dropped by a barn with the Mahoneys where a group of “bummers” — lambs born weak or to overburdened ewes — were in sawdust pens drinking milk. They would be chops in less than a year, and Christine Mahoney cooed to them between my questions.
I asked her a crass but obvious one: why the money from Sramek, those tens of millions, wasn’t enticing.
“Everybody has their price, right?” she said. “I’ve heard that so many times. ‘Everybody has their number — what’s your number?’ I guess I haven’t found it yet.”
“When God calls us home, that’s our number,” Dan Mahoney joked. “Totally different philosophy.”
On Wednesday, Sramek returned to the American Legion post in Rio Vista. This time he had arrived as part of a kickoff event for the ballot initiative. Neighbors and protesters had returned but were prohibited from going inside, where slides of maps and renderings were presented to the press, and details about design were discussed.
The maps had a curious detail: On the edge of the proposed community’s downtown, was Goose Haven Ranch.
The night before the meeting, the Mahoneys sold it. They got about $23 million.

YSSKU1OBF2_AQLQQX5A30YFS5G,Two Idaho radio stations fined for not disclosing who paid for GOP-led political program,Angela Palermo,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/two-idaho-radio-stations-fined-110000395.html,"Two southern Idaho radio stations, including one in Nampa, were fined half a million dollars by the Federal Communications Commission for “willful and repeated violations” of rules related to on-air sponsorship disclosures.
The parent company of the stations, New York-based Townsquare Media, was ordered Wednesday to pay $500,000 to the U.S. Treasury.
The penalty follows an investigation by the Media Bureau, a division of the FCC, which licenses radio stations, that found that KIDO-AM (580) in Nampa and KLIX-AM in Twin Falls broadcast political advertisements and episodes of a hour-long program called “Keep Idaho Red” for over a year without disclosing that it was paid to do so by the Idaho Republican Party and later by Tom Luna, on behalf of Luna’s company Tom Luna and Associates.
Luna and Victor Miller, chairman of the Ada County Republican Party, were the hosts of each episode, and were solely responsible for producing the show and selecting guests, according to the order. Luna, former state superintendent of public instruction, was chair of the Idaho GOP for two years before being unseated by state Rep. Dorothy Moon in 2022.
The order from the FCC said neither station provided on-air sponsorship identification announcements for the “vast majority” of episodes, nor advertisements that would have informed listeners who was paying for the content they were listening to.
The violations occurred between October 2021 and March 2023.
“In addition, multiple episodes of the program contained appearances that constituted uses by legally qualified candidates for public office and communicated messages relating to political matters of national importance,” FCC Media Bureau Chief Holly Saurer said in the order, was first reported by BoiseDev. “Neither station uploaded records of any such candidate uses or messages to their respective online political files.”
Townsquare Media in a consent decree admitted to the violations and agreed to implement a comprehensive plan to ensure future compliance with its sponsorship identification and online political file obligations, as well as submit annual compliance reports to the Media Bureau, in addition to paying the fine.
The media company is publicly traded and has an office off East Park Boulevard in Boise. A call to that office was referred to a Townsquare Media executive who did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.
Townsquare Media owns several other radio stations that serve the Treasure Valley, including Kiss FM, Lite FM, Power FM, Mix 106 and Wow Country.

No, really, experts say — thanks to the way our biological clocks tick, how we start our waking day can have a significant impact on how it ends.
“The circadian rhythm, your internal biological clock, operates on a roughly 24-hour cycle and dictates when you feel awake or sleepy, largely influenced by light exposure,” Dr. Chester Wu, a double-board certified psychiatrist and sleep medicine specialist, told HuffPost.
“Health behaviors in the morning reinforce a strong circadian rhythm, promoting wakefulness during the day and sleepiness at night,” he said.
And while we all know the rules for winding down at night by now — distancing ourselves from screens, choosing the same bed time every night, getting enough exercise so we’re tired at day’s end, etcetera — what are the morning health behaviors we should be making a habit of?
“I try not to linger in bed because I definitely feel like that causes me to feel more lazy or groggy,” Wu said.
And while putting off the start to your day might feel too luxurious to give up, Wu isn’t the only expert declining to indulge — HuffPost interviewed multiple sleep gurus, who all agreed.
“I never stay in bed and do activities that aren’t related to sleep and intimacy. This means when I wake up, I get out of bed immediately and go somewhere else in my house,” said Chelsie Rohrscheib, a neuroscientist and sleep expert. “This helps to maintain my brain’s association that the bedroom is only a place of rest, which promotes high-quality sleep.”
“I never remain in my dark bedroom,” Dr. Chris Winter, a neurologist and sleep health expert, added. “It is essential to get into the light. Light effectively shuts off your brain’s production of melatonin and lets your body know the day has begun.”
Carleara Weiss, a sleep specialist and research assistant professor at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York makes sure not only to bolt out of bed first thing — but also resists the urge to sleep in, even on her days off.
“The reasoning for that relates to the circadian rhythms,” she explained. “Regular wake-up times help the biological clock regulate physiological functions, not just sleep. Sleeping in on the weekends leads to social jet lag and causes difficulty concentrating, fatigue, irritability, and headaches.”
Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a quadruple board-certified physician in internal medicine, pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine, had a similar warning.
“While occasionally sleeping in is unlikely to have a lasting impact on your overall sleep quality, it may affect your ability to fall asleep later in the evening,” he pointed out.
“Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, where you wake up and go to bed at the same time every day, is really important for ensuring you have a good night of quality sleep,” he said.
Duly noted, no laying about, no sleeping in — what should those looking to up their sleep game be doing in the morning, instead?
“One of the first things I do in the morning, usually within 30 minutes of waking, is exposing myself to natural sunlight by going outside or sitting by a window,” said Rohrscheib. “Light during the day is very important for keeping our circadian rhythm well-regulated. Studies have shown that a lack of sunlight exposure can reduce the quality of your sleep, contribute to insomnia, and negatively impact mood.”
Sun exposure is on Dasgupta’s mind, too.
“Getting sunlight exposure first thing in the morning upon waking up can increase alertness and energy during the day, leading to improved sleep at night,” he said.
And then — no groaning, please — there’s exercise.
“Getting active quickly is a fantastic way to signal to your brain that the day has begun,” Winter said.
“The exercise does not have to be particularly intense. I start my day off by walking my dogs every day or walking with my wife to work,” he revealed.
Also? Make your bed — but not just to be tidy.
“It’s not only symbolically powerful, but it’s also a great deterrent for individuals who might want to slip back into bed during the day and feel the napping might adversely affect their sleep the upcoming night,” Winter said."
YUA0F2BOHA_EPE2EL7U21FPP20,Defence secretary denies incompetence as Royal Navy ships crash: ‘Accidents happen’,Adam Forrest,"January 21, 2024 at 8:26 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/defence-secretary-denies-incompetence-royal-102146342.html,"Defence secretary Grant Shapps has denied that a collision between two Royal Navy ships in the Middle East shows incompetence – but admitted something “clearly” went wrong.
The Royal Navy is investigating after on warships was filmed reversing and crashing into the other at a harbour in Bahrain.
Mr Shapps told Sky News on Sunday that “accidents do happen” as he sought to defend the military over the incident.
“Just as in aviation or many other walks of life sometimes accidents and incidents happen,” he said, when asked if it showed “incompetence”.
The minister added: “We don’t say it’s incompetence when we see an aircraft come down … it’s right to leave the investigators some time to work out exactly what’s gone wrong. Something clearly did and we need to see what it is.”
The Royal Navy said there had been no casualties after HMS Chiddingfold was filmed reversing into fellow minehunter HMS Bangor.
The Chiddingfold is said to remain operational having sustained only minor damage. However, it is unclear for how long Bangor will be out of action.
Meanwhile, Mr Shapps also played down growing concerns about the capabilities of the British military – as he appeared to be at odds with his cabinet colleague Penny Mordaunt.
Ms Mordaunt, the Tory Commons leader, warned that the Royal Navy and its partners must keep pace with other nations – or Britain’s interests cannot be secured.
Asked about her warnings, Mr Shapps said: “There are a lot of people with opinions and a lot of people who’ve been in the military and armed forces will often express them.”
The defence secretary also insisted that the size of the British Army will not dip below 73,000, rejecting recent projections in the press that it could eventually sink to 50,000.
“It’s not projected to go down to 50,000. It’s actually, specifically, to 73,000 plus the reserves,” said Mr Shapps.

The defence secretary accepted that the UK’s defence spending was currently below the target of 2.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). “We are committed to spending more when conditions allow.”
Mr Shapps also said chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s focus on tax cuts – rather than upping defence spending at a time of huge international tension – saying his colleague had been “incredibly generous” with a nearly 10 per cent pay rise for the armed forces.
He also called for EU countries to “step up” and spend more in providing greater funding for Ukraine as it continues to fight the Russian invasion.
“Not just America, but Europe needs to step up and do their part to make sure that Ukraine can continue to defend herself,” he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, saying Britain had “led the way”.
Mr Shapps’ grilling on defence spending came as a report in the Sunday Times raised concerned that the Royal Navy was falling behind other nations.
Ms Mordaunt, the cabinet minister who was a Royal Naval Reserve, told the newspaper: “We must not just ask ourselves by how much Russia and China are increasing their fleets, but why.”
The senior Tory, who represents Portsmouth North seat with naval links, later tweeted: “The Royal Navy and its partners must keep pace with the growing capabilities of other nations. If not Britain’s interests cannot be secured.”
Meanwhile, Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper would not commit to a Labour government spending 3 per cent of GDP a year on defence if elected.
On Sky News, she said: “Decisions for future spending if Labour wins the election would be for a Labour chancellor... But we have been clear about the importance of our national security. National security is the bedrock on which everything else in the country and everybody’s wellbeing is built.”"
YUI7CJIW2D_NB6ZT9OUP5HZ9DR,Wild Mars plane concept could seek water from high in the Red Planet's atmosphere,Elizabeth Howell,"January 21, 2024 at 11:00 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/wild-mars-plane-concept-could-140001560.html,"The search for water on Mars could include a hunt from Red Planet skies.
An early-stage vehicle, affectionately called MAGGIE, would search for water on Mars from high in the planet's atmosphere. In fact, MAGGIE just received its first tranche of funding from NASA on the long road to getting ready for flight.
While there's no timeline yet for the craft's first flight, another flying vehicle on Mars continues to exceed and excel. The Ingenuity helicopter on the Red Planet, originally built for a mere five flights, is well past 70 liftoffs and is still going strong. It's currently helping its rover partner, Perseverance, search for ancient water and life on the arid world.
Ingenuity is an incredible nod, agency officials stated earlier this month, to the power of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program as it represents the heritage of this helicopter's technology. So, looking to the success of Ingenuity, there's hope that MAGGIE may one day follow in its flight-steps and further explore Mars from the air.
Related: NASA funds Venus sample-return, interstellar probes and other far-out space tech
MAGGIE, the Mars Aerial and Ground Intelligent Explorer, is a solar-powered aircraft designed to take off and land vertically. Its technical brief states it can fly as far as 111 miles (179 km) on a single charge and is rated to cruise for nearly 10,000 miles (16,048 km) during a single Mars year, which is equal to roughly 24 months on Earth.
Flying 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) above the Red Planet, MAGGIE would focus on three science investigations: the hunt for water, a better understanding of the source of the weak Mars magnetic field, and the search for signals of elusive methane (which may or may not be a signal of life, depending on the source.)

The caveat with MAGGIE is how early-stage the technology is, principal investigator Ge-Cheng Zha of Coflow Jet, LLC wrote in the mission's technical notes. While the concept ""appears to be feasible,"" Zha urges further study ""under Martian atmospheric conditions,"" which would be less than 1% that of Earth's at sea level.
Providing the Phase 1 funding from NIAC allows the concept to continue, Zha said, also explaining that the plane would be useful for large-scale surveys one day.
MAGGIE, Zha stated, ""would revolutionize our capability of exploring almost the entirety of the Martian surface"" and would get a lot of public engagement due to its ""audacity, and in the variety of environments it could explore, study and image.""
MAGGIE's funding under NIAC does not necessarily guarantee a future flight date, but there are other Mars flyers that may be on the way shortly — pending ongoing troubles with funding, that is. The Mars sample return mission, which may bring back caches from Perseverance in the 2030s, could include two helicopter fetchers if the rover is unable to get the caches to the return vehicle itself."
YVW1N0Q56K_350C02XFPAZODG1,EU ports urged to team up to fight 'very creative' drug smugglers,Anne-Laure MONDESERT,"January 21, 2024 at 3:07 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/eu-ports-urged-team-fight-060725282.html,"Drug smugglers in the EU have become so ""very creative"" that the bloc's seaports should join forces to combat their ever-changing tactics, Belgian Interior Minister Annelies Verlinden told AFP.
That idea is to be promoted Wednesday when Verlinden, along with the European Commission, meets top representatives from around 20 EU ports, Europol officials, other interior ministers and sea transport executives to launch the European Ports Alliance.
The inauguration will take place in Antwerp, the Belgian port city that is the main gateway for cocaine trafficked into Europe.
Despite stepped-up screening, cocaine seizures at the vast Antwerp port each year breaks records. Last year, 116 tonnes of the drug were intercepted there. And Antwerp is frequently rocked by violence linked to gangs fighting over the hugely lucrative smuggling.
The traffickers ""are always very creative and that is our challenge -- they pay no heed to laws on working time, right to privacy, borders,"" Verlinden said.
""So we need to cooperate to be effective,"" she said. ""We need to create this network to combat organised crime.""
The port alliance aims to crack down on both the smuggling and the infiltration of the ports by  criminal networks.
Private sector buy-in is needed because the steps to be taken could impact legal trading, so a good ""balance"" needs to be found, the Belgian minister said.
- Scanned containers -
The partnership has a goal of harmonising security measures, to reduce the ability of the gangs to cast around for ports with laxer checks -- and also to avoid trading companies moving away to ports with less red tape and security delays.
""We know that the companies are very flexible and, if something isn't working, that they can go elsewhere in a heartbeat. We also want to avoid that,"" Verlinden said, stressing how economically crucial Antwerp's hub was to Belgium.
""In Antwerp, we have a record number of seizures, but we never know what we didn't manage to seize,"" the minister said, listing reinforced measures with security services, customs officers and a port security corps.
Antwerp's hub now boasts a mobile scanner that passes over selected containers. Five other scanners are to be delivered this year.
Around 100 more customs officers are also expected to be assigned to the port.
According to Belgium's customs service, only 1-2 percent of arriving containers are scanned.
""What we want is to scan all containers coming from risk countries,"" including in Latin America and west Africa, Verlinden said.
She noted that some of those containers might transit through another port not considered a risk.
The minister also backed the increased use of cameras, but acknowledged that they raised problems when it came to companies wanting to protect trade secrets.
- Corrupt officials -
Communication is also key.
In 2021 Belgium had a breakthrough when, in collaboration with French and Dutch police, it cracked the encrypted communications network Sky ECC favoured by criminal gangs.
That led to a cascade of arrests and raids, and a drug trafficking trial of 120 suspects currently underway in Brussels.
""We know that we are upsetting the criminal groups and that is creating a reaction of panic, and that heightened violence could be linked to the panic,"" Verlinden said.
The decrypted Sky ECC messages also laid bare a high level of corruption in Belgium.
""We realised that members of the customs service, the police, courts, lawyers could have been implicated in these criminal networks,"" she said.
""On corruption, you have to be strict.... That's a fight that goes on,"" Verlinden said, after two Belgian police officers were recently charged in a drugs case.
""I don't believe -- and I say this sincerely -- that we are living in a narco-state. But we needn't go further in space or time to realise (the danger of) the mafia in Italy. Obviously we shouldn't head towards that sort of situation.""

YVWBRHIFUS_VUBOGOOK11XNJDM,King Ranch Chicken Casserole Is A Filling Meal You Can Freeze For Later,Maria Scinto,"January 22, 2024 at 2:42 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/king-ranch-chicken-casserole-filling-174231634.html,"King Ranch chicken casserole is named for a Texas ranch that covers over ¾ million acres, making it (the ranch, not the casserole) nearly twice the size of the one owned by Mr. Pioneer Woman. The recipe itself doesn't appear to have been created by a 19th-century analog of Ree Drummond but instead may have been concocted by some anonymous householder in the mid-20th century. Former FLOTUS Lady Bird Johnson was known to make this casserole, and a recipe of hers dating from the 1970s calls for the same blend of canned chicken and mushroom soups that developer Ting Dalton is using in her version. Dalton, however, says she eschews the condensed soups that most recipes (Johnson's included) call for, explaining, ""I like to use normal soup so there is plenty of sauce."" She also opts for a milder combo of sauteed bell peppers and diced tomatoes in place of the spicy Ro-Tel tomatoes favored by the Texan-born first lady.
Dalton calls her King Ranch chicken casserole ""comfort food at its finest"" and describes the dish as ""really delicious and very filling."" So filling, in fact, that you're likely to have leftovers even if you do have multiple mouths to feed (the recipe makes six servings). That's no problem since Dalton assures us that, like most casseroles, her King Ranch chicken takes very well to freezing.

To freeze your leftover King Ranch casserole, you should first let it come to room temperature since freezing food while it's still hot can lead to condensation forming, then freezing, and the resulting layer of ice inside the container won't add to the casserole's quality. Once the casserole has cooled, portion it out in individual serving sizes. Then package these in resealable tubs or bags. When you want to revisit the casserole, the frozen leftovers can be thawed and reheated in the oven or go directly into the microwave without thawing. Whichever method you choose, Dalton advises, ""Make sure you reheat [the casserole] thoroughly.""
So how long do you have to polish off your frozen casserole? Dalton feels that it will be best if eaten within three months, but you're in no danger if you let it stay in the freezer for longer than that. The truth of the matter, according to the USDA, is that few, if any, frozen foods actually expire, at least if by ""expire"" you mean become unsafe to consume. Still, it's best to plan on eating the leftovers before they become buried in ice crystals from your not-as-frost-free-as-advertised appliance or a freak storm knocks out the power long enough for your frozen food to start thawing out.

YW986HMSFC_B8Q2MW5NXTYKAXG,"Gaslit, gaslighted... gaslated? The word has flummoxed the internet for years. It turns out the answer is complicated.",Andrew Lloyd,"January 21, 2024 at 9:34 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/gaslit-gaslighted-gaslated-word-flummoxed-123401253.html,"Internet users have turned to the web for years to find the past tense of ""gaslight.""
A linguist TikToker went viral when he joked ""gaslighted"" and ""gaslit"" were both wrong.
An expert said this isn't the case, but there isn't exactly one right answer either.
People have been trying to agree on the past tense of ""gaslight"" for years, and a viral video has just added more confusion to the mix. Was someone ""gaslighted"" or ""gaslit""? Or something else entirely?
Gaslighting is a term originally associated with psychological abuse. It stems from the 1938 play ""Gas Light"" (and its multiple movie adaptations) about a woman who is manipulated by her husband into thinking she is losing her sanity. Throughout the story, her husband causes the gas lights in their home to dim but attempts to convince his wife that she is imagining it.
Victims of real-life gaslighting can find themselves questioning their own mind, as a perpetrator ""screws with your sense of reality to manipulate you, causing you to distrust yourself and trust them instead,"" psychologist Perpetua Neo previously told Business Insider.
But the popularity of the phrase has skyrocketed in recent years, especially online, where it's sometimes used to describe behavior that likely wouldn't be categorized as abusive, such as someone disagreeing with you on a topic or issue.
In 2022, Merriam-Webster reported they'd seen a 1,740% increase in searches for the term as it became ""the favored word for the perception of deception,"" and ""gaslighting"" was named their word of the year.
With the rise in the term's popularity has also come confusion about its past tense. If a light was ""lit,"" one would assume a victim of gaslighting was ""gaslit,"" yet it's often used interchangeably with ""gaslighted.""
Multiple people have turned to Reddit and X, formerly Twitter, in search of answers. In 2017, one user asked Meriam-Webster directly, which responded that the correct form of the verb was ""gaslighted.""
'Gaslit' is an adjective: ""illuminated by gaslight.""🔥The past tense of the verb is 'gaslighted'.😱 https://t.co/HlYngiif94 https://t.co/OLZYQ1Vq5y
— Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) May 9, 2017
But a language enthusiast recently went viral when he insisted both were incorrect.
Adam Aleksic is a 23-year-old TikToker who studied linguistics at Harvard University and shares videos on etymology, which examines the origin of words.
He's has gained 295,000 followers explaining linguistics to his audience, but told BI he likes to play around with the medium, which can range ""from serious, well-researched content to silly stuff like making animal languages or explanations of language in pop culture.""
On December 16, he decided to get playful, when he told his viewers to stop using ""gaslighted"" and ""gaslit,"" as he said they were both incorrect.
""You're wrong, you've always been wrong,"" Aleksic said in the video as he jabbed his finger at the camera.
As the background lights slowly dimmed throughout the course of the TikTok, he insisted the correct past tense was, in fact, ""gaslated.""
He falsely claimed that the root of the word ""light"" also led to the past tenses ""illuminated"" and ""elucidated,"" suggesting -ated is the correct suffix for all light-related words. (In fact, ""illuminate"" and ""elucidate"" come from Latin, while ""light"" has Germanic origins, and of course the past tense of ""to light"" is undoubtedly ""lit."")
Aleksic told Business Insider he thought the whole explanation was ""a pretty obvious bit,"" but not everyone picked up on the joke.
The upload received 1.3 million views and over 2,200 comments. Many joked that Aleksic was trying to gaslight them into using the wrong word but others appeared fully convinced that ""gaslated"" was correct.
""I guess that's what happens when you build up credibility for a while only to bait and switch with a manipulative meme video,"" Aleksic told BI.
Dr. Laura Bailey, a senior lecturer in English language and linguistics at the University of Kent, England, confirmed to BI that Aleksic's video was recognizably a joke — but couldn't quite settle the issue of what the right answer is.
The English language doesn't have an official body that governs its ""correct"" use, although dictionaries are often used as the arbiter of what is right and wrong.
According to the Linguistic Society of America, ""English is now changing in exactly the same ways that have contributed to making it the rich, flexible, and adaptable language so popular throughout the world today. Living languages must change, must adapt, must grow.""
Bailey agreed with Merriam-Webster that the word you're looking for is probably ""gaslighted,"" treating it as a regular verb that would take the suffix -ed for the past tense. But she said ""gaslit"" also works for her.
""Linguists don't tell people what's correct, only what people actually do,"" she said.
Aleksic echoed this sentiment.
""Don't ever trust a linguist who tells you how language is supposed to be used,"" he told BI. ""We're only here to observe, not to tell you what to say. But that doesn't mean I can't goof around with it.""
So if Aleksic's ""gaslated"" is your preferred option, no need to let the fact that it's made up put you off using it — even if you do get some confused looks.

YWFF1BSIQN_QLA9BORF4VRIX4H,Why do Arizona Republicans keep dressing up like cowboys?,Tom Zoellner,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/opinion-why-arizona-republicans-keep-110040166.html,"When Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater contemplated a run for president in the 1964 election, he introduced himself to a national audience by releasing a photo of himself dressed in a buckskin jacket, cowboy hat and jeans, holding an antique rifle on his knee. He looked every inch the frontiersman — except for the swimming pool in the background.
Those who knew Goldwater might have chuckled at another detail. Although his family had genuine 19th century Arizona roots, they had made their fortune in department stores, not ranching. One of Barry’s only contributions to the business before he left to chase a political career was designing a line of blouses and drapes featuring cattle brands.

The use of retail cowboy duds to project a conservative image of toughness, independence and suspicion of government is an Arizona tradition at least as old as Goldwater’s failed presidential campaign.
But even as the real trade of cowboying has virtually disappeared in modern Arizona — direct cattle sales make up less than 0.0014% of the state’s GDP — the strategic use of Western attire to broadcast right-leaning ideology has only increased and seems to be getting even stronger.
Read more: Opinion: Why is Arizona poised to give away groundwater to mining when it faces a devastating water crisis?
“As big as Arizona has grown, it is in our political DNA,” Republican political consultant Stan Barnes said of cowboy iconography. “When you come to Arizona, you’re subject to the culture, and if you’re in political life, you see that culture distilled.”
Of the 90 members of the 2024 Arizona Legislature, five are wearing cowboy hats in their official state portraits. All of them are Republicans. But only one is an actual rancher with cattle. “It means someone who rides for the brand,” said that lawmaker, Rep. David Cook, known at the Capitol as a down-to-earth deal maker. He compares his governing philosophy to moving livestock. “You get them all together and move them together,” he said.
Read more: Opinion: Reality deniers like Kari Lake fit right in with Arizona's history of wishful thinking
The politician-cowpoke theme comes drenched in several ironies, not least of which is that when Arizona was run by a Democratic Party machine for most of the 20th century, there were far more ranchers serving in public office and their livery was both more common and less partisan.
Gov. Jack Williams declared the bolo tie “Arizona’s official neckwear” in 1971, and when Tom Prezelski, a Democrat from Tucson, wore his own ornamental leather cravat on the floor of the Legislature 15 years ago, nobody blinked. Now he gets a different question when he wears it: “Have you turned into a Republican?”
“You now adopt the fashion to make a political statement,” Prezelski complained. “It’s all code. It didn’t used to be that way. Now you get all these Republicans looking like norteño musicians.” Anyone who wants a front row to Deep Arizona should go to the state Capitol whenever the state’s 15 county sheriffs arrive to lobby for something. Nearly all of them wear cowboy hats, looking like a family reunion out of Wyatt Earp days.
Here lies another irony. As a profession, cowboying flourished only for a brief period, roughly from 1865 to 1895, when it was a low-paid agricultural job, often taken up by Mexican immigrants and African Americans — not the core of today’s Republican base, to say the least.
The equestrian tradition of Western cattle raising is derivative not of anything Anglos brought to conquered Indigenous land but of the northern Mexican vaquero tradition. The cowboy hat is a modified sombrero. Even the core lingo comes from the Spanish language: lariat, corral, chaps.
But historical details don’t seem to matter. The aesthetics are used to conjure up a politics of frontier individualism — they go hand in hand. “One does affect the other,” said Barnes. “They feed off each other.”
These signifiers work because voters embrace them too. It’s a common story for newcomers to Arizona to lean into the fantasy Western lifestyle by decorating their homes with oil paintings of shootouts and roundups. Even interior design carries political influences these days.
“A lot of people respond to it,” said Jim West, a longtime Phoenix country disc jockey. “It boils down to looking out for yourself, taking care of your people, and small government.”
But not every politician can pull off the look.
Mark Finchem, a former police officer from Michigan, ran a heavily MAGA conspiracy-oriented campaign for secretary of state in 2022. On the campaign trail, he sported an unconvincing combination of string tie and cowboy hat. That earned him the nickname Kalamazoo cosplay cowboy.
Some see a darker message in the aesthetic. J. Gray Sweeney, a professor emeritus of art history at Arizona State University, wrote in an article,  “Racism, Nationalism, and Nostalgia in Cowboy Art,” that “the supporters of western art are willing to do everything in their power to protect the cherished fantasy of America's 'winning of the West,’ ” which is “premised on nationalistic and conservative values.”
That impulse has gotten only stronger in recent years, especially in the Trump era, Sweeney explained to me. “I can tell you without any reservations whatsoever that the people who collected this kind of nostalgia-ridden art are uniformly conservative politically, as the art is about preserving some values that are regressive and largely of a white supremacist type.”
Of course, the supposed golden age of the Arizona rangelands in the late 19th century was also a time when Anglo settlement depended on government largesse in the form of land giveaways to the railroads, loose mining concessions and military supply contracts. A later generation of ranchers would never have stayed in business if it weren’t for generous public grazing leases, plus federal dams for all that water.
So when Arizona politicians take to dressing up Western-style, they’re paying homage to an era not of rugged individualism but of a Washington-driven economy subsidized by taxpayers. Giddyup!

(Jan. 14)
The state policy makers who pushed for charter schools hoped to induce higher levels of learning and life skills through innovations in curriculum and instructional methods. Unfortunately, there is little evidence those laudable intentions are being achieved. In fact , the most notable achievement seems to be the unintentional (or maybe not ) increase in segregation.
The fact that a majority of charters do not score significantly above their local district brings into question their purpose. It suggests better accountability and oversight are much needed. After all, if charter schools are unable to perform at high levels of expectation, why have them at all?

Regarding “Friend, donor of insurance commissioner paid as his driver,” (Jan. 17):
In regards to North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey being chauffeured around, I just want to remind everyone that we’ve seen this movie before. It reminds me of “Driving Miss Daisy“ — the main differences being that the driving was not at taxpayer’s expense and the movie was enjoyable to watch. This version? Not so much!

Regarding “Should Triangle governments take a stand on Gaza? Hundreds speak out in Raleigh.” (Jan. 17):
The job of the Raleigh City Council is to take care of the needs of Raleigh citizens — not fix the greater world’s problems.
At any given time, 70 million refugees live in horrid conditions worldwide caused by ongoing conflicts. Should our city pick favorite conflicts? Is a life more important in Gaza than in Kibbutz Re’im, or in Darfur or Myanmar or Yemen?
Anyone with a minimum of human feeling has been heartbroken by the last 100 days and feels for victims’ families on all sides. But individual feelings need not interfere with the governance of a Southern town, a speck on a world map, that has no way of fixing humanity’s hubris and intolerance.
Roland Menestres, Raleigh
In the distant past, the idea of a city taking a position on wider world issues would have been dismissed (wrongly) as irrelevant to city affairs. But to refuse to address an issue that people want addressed by claiming insufficient authority doesn’t apply to a resolution on a moral issue.
Towns, cities and states have taken positions on immigration, abortion and environmental issues. Certainly, the 15 cities that have passed such resolutions don’t see a barrier to action. Our world is more connected today and global events have local impacts. Ignoring them will not alleviate their effects or mitigate their consequences. Knowledge of injustice demands a response from all of us.

Regarding the reluctance of some N.C. legislators to share their emails with the public, I must be missing something. I thought these legislators were elected by we the people, paid from the public purse, doing their official business in the people’s house and on the people’s dime. I guess Article I, Section 2, of our state doesn’t mean what it says, when it says: “All political power is vested in and derived from the people...is founded upon their will only, and is instituted solely for the good of the whole.” It sure doesn’t seem to say that government is for legislators to keep well hidden or direct to their own good.

Remember Barry Goldwater? Republicans ran the outspoken Arizona senator for president in 1964. At the GOP convention he said: “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice…and moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.” The crowd went wild for a full minute. Shock’m sock’m diplomacy.
Then, as now, Republicans were drunk on putting up a candidate with no couth, no restraint. Goldwater’s hair on fire was supposed to sway the electorate but he lost to Lyndon Johnson in a landslide. Gob-smacked Republicans slunk off wondering how they could have misjudged the contest so. History is repeating itself and it’ll soon be too late to find somebody else.

YYUXGPJ4B2_IPXET8YKD77631K,Nurseries warn over free childcare expansion plans,Emma Thomas - Political Reporter,"January 21, 2024 at 6:34 PM·3 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nurseries-warn-over-free-childcare-093412063.html,"A childcare provider is warning it may not have enough spaces or staffing to meet an increase in demand for places this year.
A government expansion of free childcare offered to working families comes into effect in stages from April.
Sarah McCormick, director of Little Owls Childcare, which manages three nurseries in Staffordshire, said ""our nurseries are full"".
The Department for Education (DfE) said it was confident ""in the strength of our childcare market"" and would be starting a national recruitment campaign.
Currently free childcare is only on offer to children aged three and four and the amount varies according to whether their parents or carers are in employment.
A 20% subsidy is also available for younger children of some working parents.
From April, two-year-old children will become entitled to 15 hours each week in term time, if their parents are working.
If the childcare is spread out over 12 months, the number of free hours on offer each week reduces.
In September, the age requirement for the weekly 15 hours of free childcare drops to nine months old.
Then from September 2025, the offer rises to 30 hours each week in term time, for all children of working parents from the age of nine months.
Ms McCormick said their nurseries could handle the funded hours for parents of the children who already use their sites.
""However it's going to be very difficult to invite new children to join us with their funded hours,"" she added.
""Where we have got space to have more children we haven't got enough staff to offer those places.
""This is a challenge the whole of the childcare sector is facing.""
The Department for Education calculated the policies, announced by the chancellor in the 2023 spring budget, could save some families £6,500 each year.
Mothers who used parent and baby groups run by a charity, Spark, in Burntwood, Staffordshire, gave their reaction to the changes.
Sophie Payne, who has eight-month-old twins, said she was not be able to go back to work full time due to the cost of childcare.
""The government contribution will be great as it allows me to go back to work more,"" she said.
Georgie Chetwood's two-year-old son would be entitled to 15 hours each week in term time from April, but she expected her cost-saving would be limited by the detail of the policy.
""The free hours don't cover the school holidays. I work in the NHS and so don't have holidays off,"" she said.
""We were under the impression we'd be saving quite a lot financially. But it turns out we won't be saving all that much at the end of it.""
Figures from the National Day Nurseries Association revealed 72 nurseries closed in the 12 months up to September 2023, a rise of 50% on the year before.
""The rising costs and the lack of rising funding has had massive implications on childcare providers' stability and ability to stay afloat. It's such a shame,"" Ms McCormick said.
The DfE said it was confident the childcare industry could deliver the expansion and was also investing up to £180m in training, qualifications and guidance.
“We are also investing hundreds of millions of pounds to increase rates paid for government-funded hours, which can be used to support staff salaries,"" a spokesperson added.
On top of the recruitment campaign, they added they were looking to bring in a ""new accelerated apprenticeship route"" into the sector."

“The only prerequisite is that the customer has commissioned it.""
MBDA, to which Taurus Systems belongs, stated in November 2023 that it was able to rapidly increase Taurus missile production and integrate new technical advances, according to DW.

The German Bundestag rejected a proposal on Jan. 17 to supply Ukraine with Taurus cruise missiles. Only 178 MPs voted in favor, with 485 voting against.
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, during a visit to Kyiv in November 2023, told journalists that Ukraine would not receive the missiles from his country.
These delays may be attributable to the hesitance of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who has expressed concern that Kyiv might use Taurus missiles to attack Russian territory.
The German government condemned Russian strikes on Ukrainian territory on Jan. 3, calling them a war crime. However, a representative from the German government, Steffen Hebestreit, said that the country was still not ready to provide Taurus missiles.

Anna Paulina Luna has been working to get better recognition of parental support in Congress after she was told she couldn't vote if she wasn't present to do so — that's even though she was pregnant and would need time off after giving birth.
She and California Democratic Rep Sara Jacobs have even co-sponsored legislation that would allow women lawmakers who have given birth the option to vote by proxy — something that was allowed under Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi due to COVID but was stopped when former Rep. Kevin McCarthy became speaker. Luna's push for this legislation has been supported by members of both political parties.
In a tweet on Friday, Luna expressed her frustration over being unable to vote in the House following the birth of her son and subsequent medical problems, attempting to contrast her situation with U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg's, who took leave to care for his newborn twins during his parental leave.
“Pete Buttigieg got maternity leave and I didn’t. And he’s a dude. It’s time Congress gets with the times,” Luna wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
In response to Luna’s remarks, Chasten Buttigieg, Pete Buttigieg’s husband, criticized Luna and said all parents should have parental leave.
“Every parent deserves parental leave. Those first weeks are so crucial for parents and newborns,” Chasten Buttigieg wrote. “What a shame to see Representative Luna tarnish this bipartisan effort with unnecessary homophobia. ‘Getting with the times’ would serve you well, Congresswoman.”
Every parent deserves parental leave. Those first weeks are so crucial for parents and newborns. What a shame to see Representative Luna tarnish this bipartisan effort with unnecessary homophobia. ""Getting with the times"" would serve you well, Congresswoman.
— (@)
“I’m a big proponent of parental leave. It’s an extremely important time for parents and their newborn, or, as was in our case, newborns. I am glad to see members of both parties come together and agree that equitable parental leave is deserved by all,” Chasten Buttigieg told The Advocate in an interview following his criticism.
He added that he saw the comment as a direct dig at his family.
“My kids remind me, daily, of what really matters in this world. The best thing I can do for them is to continue to show up for them and be the best dad that I can be,” Chasten Buttigieg said. “I know one day they will judge us for what we did to make the world a better place, so I’ll focus on that work and try my best to stay out of the petty fights some online or in Congress are so eager to pick. That doesn’t mean I’ll be silent when someone goes after my family, though. I’ll always stick up for my kids.”
Contrary to Luna’s claim of not receiving maternity leave, members of Congress and other eligible employees in the legislative branch have been entitled to paid parental leave since the enactment of the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act in December 2019. It amended the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave for the birth of an employee’s child or for the placement of a child with an employee for adoption or foster care, as overseen by the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights.
Luna’s proposed bill allows new mothers in Congress to designate a proxy voter for six weeks post-childbirth. The bill, however, only allows this for women who have given birth, which means other types of new parents would not be allowed. Some Democrats have voiced plans to expand legislation."

Pfister,"January 21, 2024 at 5:02 PM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/james-pfister-taiwan-election-international-080239953.html,"Recently, Taiwan conducted an election among three parties: the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the Nationalist or Kuomintang Party (KMT), and the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP). Lai Ching-te, of the DPP, won the presidency. China lobbied hard against Lai, the Vice President and a Harvard-educated medical doctor, close to the United States (U.S.), advocating the status quo and democracy, which means a de facto independence from China. What effect will this victory have? I hope, not much.
The other major player was Hou Yu-in, of the KMT, who advocated closer relations with China. The third player was Ko Wen-je of the TPP, who also has been described as “China-friendly.”
Lai received 40 percent of the vote, Hou 33 percent, and Ko 26 percent. Thus, even though the independence-oriented Lai won the presidency, 59 percent of the vote was “China-friendly.” Also, Lai’s party lost its majority in the legislature. His “agenda will be hamstrung by the DPP losing its majority in the legislature. The Kuomintang’s ability to block Lai will make him look fragile to Beijing …”
Lai, in his post-election comments, emphasized democracy saying the election was “writing a new chapter in our democracy. We have shown the world how much we cherish our democracy…Taiwan will continue to walk side by side with democracies from around the world. ... The Taiwanese people have successfully resisted efforts from external forces (i.e., China) to influence this election.” These words by Lai were provocative regarding an authoritarian China and tracked nicely with U.S. foreign policy as being a democratic versus authoritarian approach to the world. Lai was challenging China and siding with the U.S. He went too far, I believe.
We cannot let the tail wag the dog in the relationships among Taiwan, the U.S., and China. A vote in Taiwan cannot determine the future of Taiwan. It is a matter of international law and geopolitics. The U.S. recognizes China’s sovereignty over Taiwan in the One-China policy. This is based on sound history. China’s claim goes back to at least the 17th century. The U.S. fiction, after the Communist Party took over authority in 1949, that Taiwan (known then as Republic of China) was the
government of all of China and Mongolia, with the Republic of China being the representative of China in the UN, was the reason Taiwan is not a part of China today. This fiction cannot be allowed to divert our perception of legal reality. Moreover, once President Carter recognized China in 1979, with Taiwan as part of it as a result of the Shanghai Communique by Nixon of 1972, the U.S. tried to have it both ways by passing the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, whereby it arranged to provide Taiwan with military aid to defend itself. This was done under the leadership of the conservative Senator Barry Goldwater. But for the U.S. fictions and interference, Taiwan would no doubt be unified with China today.
From a geopolitical perspective, Taiwan is a mere 100 miles off China’s coast. As we move to a multipolar world, with China as a great power, the U.S. has no business operating right off of China’s coast. Perhaps, China could agree not to operate in Cuba off the U.S. coast if the U.S. agrees to not operate in Taiwan. Regional balance of power may be the formula for peace in the coming multipolar world order.
Taiwan is an attractive polity. According to Nicholas Kristof, who lived in Taiwan in the 1980s studying the Chinese language, and who has visited frequently, Taiwan is today “a thriving democracy with a free press and excellent quality of life ... a first-rate national health system, legalized same-sex marriage and greatly expanded opportunities for women and girls, longer life expectancy than the United States, minimal homelessness, safe from crime ... with some of the best food in the world.”
It will be hard for the U.S. accept Taiwan becoming a physical part of authoritarian China, as has Hong Kong. But this is reality under the rule of law and as part of a multipolar world. The U.S. cannot control the whole world, and we do not need to risk a nuclear war to try.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was recently admitted to the hospital for surgery without informing President Joe Biden or his own deputy of his absence. (Jan. 10, 3A, “Defense Secretary Austin has prostate cancer, doctors say”) Meanwhile, the U.S. took major military action against targets in Yemen. Who was in charge?
If a major department head of a huge private company took leave without informing the chief executive, he or she would face serious consequences. But not in the Biden administration. Both Austin, for not reporting his absence and for poor performance, and Biden, for not taking corrective action, share responsibility in this fiasco.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s open letter to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in Sunday’s Star-Telegram is laughable. (16A) His point is obviously to keep immigrants who are in the country illegally in Texas. Pritzker writes that Abbott is “dropping off asylum seekers without alerting us to their arrival at improper locations at all hours of the night.” Hello, welcome to the party. That is exactly what is happening at thousands of locations along the U.S. border.
Abbott is doing the right thing by letting Illinois share the burden of unfettered illegal immigration. Pritzker posits that federal reform is the key, however, as stated by Sen. Tom Cotton: The phrase “comprehensive immigration reform” is Washington code for amnesty, mass immigration and open borders in perpetuity.
And the cold weather in Illinois Pritzker worries migrants are being subjected to without proper clothing? Sunday’s forecast high temperature in North Texas is 37 degrees, with a low of 33. Next question.

While I agree that we went to school when it was this cold in the past, this time the schools made the right decision. (Jan. 18, 10A, “DFW schools shouldn’t have closed just over cold temps”)
In the past, parents bought coats, gloves and hats for kids having to wait for the bus, as the editorial suggests. Those waits sometimes are up to 30 minutes. But now, that isn’t always the case. Many parents buy their kids only hoodies, and many don’t have proper outerwear like we did in the past. Also, have you been in some of those classrooms in the winter? Even when it is above 32 degrees outside, some of them are freezing.

For most of the years I’ve lived here, I’ve viewed Texas proudly. We are a quirky bunch, lots of bluster and big talk. But lately, the big talk has turned mean, and the political bluster uncivil. And inhumane.
The border crisis is undeniable. But can anyone call themselves pro-life if they are only concerned with the survival of an embryo and not a child drowning in the Rio Grande, or a child bused to a northern state in the middle of winter with no warm clothing and left stranded on the outskirts of the city? None of that is pro-life. And it most definitely is not in Christian teachings.
To be pro-life is to care deeply about all life.

Dream Gillenwater, 19 was charged with one count of assault and battery and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (shod foot, sidewalk) for the brutal assault on her sister back on December 8, said officials.
Boston Police responded to a call for an unconscious person at 174 Ipswich Street and located the 24-year-old victim on the ground and seemingly out of breath.
Officials said Gillenwater, also on the scene, appeared intoxicated and was verbally abusive toward the officers. Gillenwater told the officers she and her sister, who has not been identified, had been out drinking, according to District Attorney Hayden.
A witness told police that he saw two arguing at a bus story and then saw Gillenwater “slugging” her sister in the back of the head as the sister attempted to walk away. Police said the witness intervened to stop the altercation while calling 911.
Video surveillance obtained from a nearby school by Boston detectives showed Gillenwater stomping on the victim’s head several times. Video also showed Gillenwater standing with both feet on the victim’s head, and then grabbing the victim’s head and slamming it against the sidewalk about four times, according to Hayden.
“The brutality of this assault is evident from the facts, but that it was an attack on a sibling gives it an added dimension of tragedy. It’s fortunate for the victim that the witness called 911 and police responded so quickly,” Hayden said.
Gillenwater was ordered to stay away from her sister, refrain from alcohol and drug use, and be fitted with a GPS tracking device if released, according to Hayden.
Gillenwater will return to court on February 8 for a pre-trial hearing.

The nonpartisan position will be selected by the voters in the May 14 primary.
""Berkeley County Magistrate Court is one of the busiest in the state. I know from experience that the problems our county has with drugs, domestic violence and other crimes is severe and I want to continue to work to resolve these issues,"" said Thompson, who was first elected in 2020.

The revelation by attorney Roberta Kaplan, who represents advice columnist E. Jean Carroll, means that the Republican front-runner in this year's presidential race could testify in Manhattan federal court as early as Monday, a day before the New Hampshire primary.
The jury is considering whether Trump owes more to Carroll than the $5 million awarded to her last spring by another jury that concluded Trump sexually abused but did not rape Carroll in the dressing room of a luxury Manhattan department store in spring 1996 and then defamed her in October 2022.
Trump attended the trial for two of its first three days, only skipping it on Thursday, when he attended the funeral of his mother-in-law in Florida.
Kaplan said late Saturday in a letter to the judge that she would not show jurors the 2005 tape in which Trump is caught on a hot mic speaking disparagingly of women to keep the issues in the trial “focused.”
For the same reason, she said she won’t call two other Trump accusers as witnesses: Natasha Stoynoff and Jessica Leeds.
Both women testified at the trial that ended last May. Leeds, a former stockbroker, said Trump abruptly groped her against her will on an airline flight in the 1970s, while Stoynoff, a writer, said Trump forcibly kissed her against her will while she was interviewing him for a 2005 article.
Kaplan noted that Trump's lawyers had said he is entitled to testify concerning the “Access Hollywood” tape and the allegations of Stoynoff and Leeds, though he would not be if they were not introduced into the case by Carroll's attorneys.
The judge in the case has instructed the jury that it must accept the findings of the jury last year and thus the evidence has focused almost exclusively on what harm has been caused to Carroll by Trump's continuous claims that he never attacked her and doesn't know her and that she is lying.
Trump, 77, has denied her claims in the last week during campaign stops, on social media and at a news conference. And he continues to assert that Carroll, 80, made false claims against him to sell the 2019 memoir in which she first revealed the allegations publicly and for political reasons.
The judge has severely limited what Trump can testify about if he takes the witness stand, and Carrol's lawyers likely decided to limit the introduction of more evidence to prevent Trump from straying into subjects such as what he maintains are many false claims against him.
However, Kaplan said she does plan to show the jury statements Trump has made since her client finished testifying in the case on Thursday.
Kaplan said Trump said he plans to repeat his claims that he never attacked Carroll and doesn't know her “a thousand times.”
“Such statements,” she wrote, “are of course relevant to the issue of punitive damages, as they illustrate that Defendant has no intention of ceasing his defamation campaign against Ms. Carroll, even in the face of judicial proceedings in which his liability for defaming her is settled.”
A lawyer for Trump did not return a request for comment on Kaplan's letter Saturday night."
ZAGTCSCMKF_Z8LSQWPTVC2P6DA,Russia suspends operations at fuel export terminal after suspected Ukrainian drone attack,Andrew Osborn and Maxim Rodionov,"Updated January 22, 2024 at 5:46 AM·4 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/fire-erupts-russias-novatek-baltic-084714265.html,"By Andrew Osborn and Maxim Rodionov
(Reuters) -Russian energy company Novatek said on Sunday it had been forced to suspend some operations at a huge Baltic Sea fuel export terminal due to a fire started by what Ukrainian media said was a drone attack.
The giant Ust-Luga complex, located on the Gulf of Finland about 170 km (110 miles) west of St. Petersburg, is used to ship oil and gas products to international markets. It processes stable gas condensate - a type of light oil - into light and heavy naphtha, kerosene and diesel to be shipped by sea.
It was not clear how long the disruption would last, how many tankers would have to idle outside the port, and what the knock-on effect would be on international energy markets.
Critical infrastructure facilities in the surrounding Leningrad region were placed on high alert, with security units and law enforcement agencies ordered to destroy any drones detected, the regional administration said on Telegram.
The Interfax-Ukraine news agency, citing unnamed sources, said the fire was the result of a special operation carried out by Ukraine's security services.
""The Ust-Luga Oil terminal ... is an important facility for the enemy. Fuel is refined there, which, among other things, is also supplied to Russian troops,"" it cited one source as saying.
""A successful attack on such a terminal not only causes economic damage to the enemy ... but also significantly complicates the logistics of fuel for the Russian military.""
Reuters could not confirm that the fire resulted from a Ukrainian drone attack.
If it did, such an attack would demonstrate Kyiv's ability to conduct strikes deeper into Russia than usual using what are believed to be domestically produced drones at a time when it is on the defensive on the battlefield and struggling to secure as much Western financing as it wants.
Such an attack, the latest in a spate of apparent strikes in recent days targeting Russian energy facilities, would also raise awkward questions about the quality of Russian air defence systems around key infrastructure facilities.
The incident, along with what Russia says was a Ukrainian artillery strike on civilians in a Russian-held city in eastern Ukraine that left at least 25 dead, could prompt wider Russian retaliation in a war which shows no sign of ending.
Alexander Drozdenko, the Leningrad region's governor, said on the Telegram messaging app, that there had been no casualties at the Ust-Luga terminal and all workers had been safely evacuated.
Russian news agencies reported that two storage tanks and a pumping station had been damaged, but that the fire had been brought under control.
Novatek, which is Russia's largest liquefied natural gas producer, said in a statement it had suspended some operations after the fire which it said was the result of ""external influence.""
""The technological process at Novatek-Ust-Luga has been stopped, and an operational headquarters has been established to eliminate the consequences. Damage assessment will be carried out later,"" the company said.
Russian news outlet Shot reported that local residents had heard a drone operating nearby followed by several explosions.
Russia and Ukraine have targeted each other's energy infrastructure in strikes designed to disrupt supply lines and logistics, each side seeking to demoralise the other.
On Friday, a drone attack hit an oil depot in Russia's western region of Bryansk, bordering Ukraine, for which Moscow blamed Kyiv. That came a day after an attack on a Russian Baltic Sea oil terminal that Russian officials said was unsuccessful.
Baza, a Russian news outlet known for its security services contacts, posted footage on Telegram on Sunday of large flames shooting into the sky over what appeared to be an industrial complex.
Three international tanker ships were anchored near the Ust-Luga terminal, though there were no reports of damage to them from the fire, the St Petersburg-based Fontanka outlet said.
Drozdenko said a ""high alert regime"" had been introduced and that officials had gathered for an emergency meeting.
Novatek processed 3.4 million tons of stable gas condensate at the complex in the first half of 2023, according to the most recent data available, up 0.6% from the same period a year earlier.

ZAM57FNV2X_NDKSG38SDRPTADP,Starmer defends the National Trust’s ‘woke’ agenda,Amy Gibbons,"January 22, 2024 at 7:30 AM·4 min read",20230121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/starmer-defends-national-trust-woke-223000950.html,"Sir Keir Starmer on Monday defends the National Trust against accusations of “woke” behaviour as he claims the Tories have gone to “war” with the charity.
The Labour leader accuses the Government of getting “so tangled up in culture wars of their own making” that they have ended up turning on the same organisations they “once regarded with respect” in a “desperate” attempt to cling to power.
In a major speech on his vision for the voluntary sector, Sir Keir tells an audience of faith, charity and community leaders that the Conservatives have undermined the “proud spirit of service in this country” by “trying to find woke agendas” in Britain’s valued ­institutions.
In particular, he accuses the Tories of demeaning the valuable work of the National Trust by taking a “divisive” approach led by the “politics of self-preservation”.
He also claims the party’s rhetoric on the small boats crisis has helped “demonise” the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), which had the late Queen as a patron for 70 years.
In recent years, the National Trust has faced growing anger over a series of decisions that have prompted claims it is following a “woke agenda”.
Bosses have been accused of “dumbing down” by removing important items from display and turning historic homes into “theme parks” designed for children.
There was also a significant backlash after it emerged Christian ­holidays had been excluded from the trust’s “inclusivity and wellbeing” ­calendar.
Last year, Lee Anderson, then a deputy Tory chairman, lashed out at the charity for publishing its own “manifesto” calling for “concerted action” on climate commitments, insisting: “Brits expect the National Trust to protect our heritage, not lecture them on net zero.”
In 2022, Conservative MP Andrew Murrison set up an All-Party Parliamentary Group to scrutinise the trust, citing “recent controversies” around its ­“strategic direction”.
And in 2020, the Daily Express reported that a powerful group of Tory MPs were demanding the charity’s ­status be reconsidered after it ­published its properties’ links to slavery and colonialism.
The Conservative Party’s official historian, Lord Lexden, also said the institution engaged in an “act of folly” by issuing the “tendentious report”, which singled out 93 sites connected to historical figures involved in the British empire.
Addressing the Civil Society Summit in central London Sir Keir says: “The Tories seem set on sabotaging civil society to save their own skins.
“They got themselves so tangled up in culture wars of their own making, that instead of working with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution – an organisation the late Queen was patron of for 70 years – to find real solutions to stop the small boats, their rhetoric has helped demonise them.
“Instead of working with the National Trust so more people can learn about – and celebrate – our culture and our history, they’ve managed to demean their work. In its desperation to cling on to power, at all costs. The Tory Party is trying to find woke agendas in the very civic institutions they once regarded with respect.
“Let me tell you, waging a war on the proud spirit of service in this country isn’t leadership. It’s desperate. It’s divisive. It’s damaging. It comes to something when the Tories are at war with the National Trust. That’s what happens when politics of self-preservation prevail over commitment to service.”
Sir Keir also uses his speech to say a Labour government would create a “society of service”, bringing “a new focus on those who build the bonds that connect us, the communities that nurture us, the institutions that support families and provide a bridge between the state and the market”.
He adds: “In a society of service, doing the right thing will be rewarded. Working hard will pay off for people. And building caring, compassionate communities will make our country stronger, more prosperous, fairer for everyone.”
The Tories reacted by accusing Labour of “sniping from the sidelines without putting forward any serious plan”.
Later this week, Sir Keir will tour the country to talk to people about his plan to make Britain’s streets safe.

ZNRUPWJKCI_TDYNDUQKGPHL2TY,Is Comet Holding AG (VTX:COTN) Trading At A 22% Discount?,editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St),"January 21, 2024 at 3:16 PM·6 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comet-holding-ag-vtx-cotn-061643997.html,"Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Comet Holding fair value estimate is CHF348
Comet Holding is estimated to be 22% undervalued based on current share price of CHF273
Analyst price target for COTN is CHF267 which is 23% below our fair value estimate
In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Comet Holding AG (VTX:COTN) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.
Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.
Check out our latest analysis for Comet Holding
We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.
A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = CHF926m
The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (0.08%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 5.7%.
Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = CHF172m× (1 + 0.08%) ÷ (5.7%– 0.08%) = CHF3.1b
Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= CHF3.1b÷ ( 1 + 5.7%)10= CHF1.8b
The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is CHF2.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of CHF273, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.
The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Comet Holding as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.114. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.
Strength
Debt is not viewed as a risk.
Weakness
Earnings declined over the past year.
Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electronic market.
Opportunity
Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the Swiss market.
Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.
Threat
Dividends are not covered by cash flow.
Revenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.
Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

ZO3TXNTNS3_8K2ZU07WFQ88XP9,DeSantis uses fake Winston Churchill quote as he ends disastrous presidential campaign,"Taylor Berman,Sonam Sheth","Updated January 23, 2024 at 2:49 AM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-uses-fake-winston-churchill-214223947.html,"Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida dropped out of the GOP presidential race on Sunday.
The onetime rival to Trump used a purported Winston Churchill quote in his announcement video.
According to the International Churchill Society, the quote is fake.
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida ended his 2024 presidential campaign on Sunday and endorsed former President Donald Trump.
Much like his disappointing campaign, perhaps one of the worst in history, DeSantis' video announcing the suspension missed the mark by including an apparently fake Winston Churchill quote.
""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,"" DeSantis wrote in a tweet accompanying his video, attributing the quote to Churchill.
“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.”- Winston Churchill pic.twitter.com/ECoR8YeiMm
— Ron DeSantis (@RonDeSantis) January 21, 2024
But as many people quickly pointed out, the International Churchill Society debunked the legitimacy of the quote over a decade ago.
""Not only did Churchill never say those words — he never said the similar words more usually attributed to him, which are: 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts,'"" the society wrote in 2013.
It added that the conclusion was based ""on careful research in the canon of fifty million words by and about Churchill, including all of his books, articles, speeches and papers.""
A DeSantis spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Florida governor was seen as Trump's strongest opponent in the early days of his campaign, but DeSantis' numbers took a nosedive in the months that followed.
He pinned his hopes on last week's Iowa caucuses but lost to Trump by 30 percentage points.
""I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory,"" DeSantis said in Sunday's announcement. ""It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance.""

(AP) — Nikki Haley on Saturday questioned whether Donald Trump is mentally capable of serving as president again after he repeatedly seemed to confuse her with former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a campaign speech.
As she campaigned in Keene, New Hampshire, Haley referenced Trump's speech the night before, in which he mistakenly asserted that Haley was in charge of Capitol security on January 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building seeking to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Trump first said that Haley turned down security offered by his administration on Jan. 6 and then again mentioned Haley, adding, “They destroyed all of the information, all of the evidence, everything, deleted and destroyed all of it.”
Trump, 77, has accused Pelosi of turning down security he says his administration offered, but a special House committee empaneled to probe the attack found no evidence to support that claim.
“They’re saying he got confused, that he was talking about something else, he’s talking about Nancy Pelosi,"" Haley said on Saturday.
“He mentioned me multiple times in that scenario. The concern I have is — I’m not saying anything derogatory — but when you’re dealing with the pressures of the presidency, we can’t have someone else that we question whether they’re mentally fit to do this,” Haley said. ""We can’t.”
Speaking at a Bloomberg News forum on Saturday in Manchester, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney referenced Haley's remarks and said Trump “made a pretty apparent gaffe last night.""
“It’s a distinction without a difference. It’s Nikki and Nancy,” Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said to reporters Saturday night. “What’s the difference?”
At his rally Saturday night in Manchester, Trump said that he took a cognitive test and “aced it.”
“I’ll let you know when I go bad. I really think I’ll be able to tell you,"" he added. “I feel my mind is stronger now than it was 25 years ago. Is that possible?”
Trump, who won Monday's Iowa caucuses and is the current GOP front-runner, picked Haley to serve as his United Nations ambassador and has ramped up his criticism of her campaign as the year's votes have gotten underway.
On Saturday, he stumped in New Hampshire with a robust complement of backers from Haley's home state of South Carolina, including Gov. Henry McMaster and several U.S. House members. A day earlier, Sen. Tim Scott — who ended his own 2024 bid in November and was appointed to the Senate by Haley in 2012 — endorsed Trump over Haley in a rousing call-and-response speech of his own in New Hampshire.
Since entering the GOP race nearly a year ago, Haley, 52, has advocated for “mental competency tests” for older politicians, a swipe at the ages of both Trump and Biden.

""These people give us all courage. They are defending our republic and our constitution against its enemies. They are defending our humanity,"" he said in a video message from Berlin on Sunday.
Steinmeier, who holds a largely symbolic role as the German head of state, noted that various groups of people had taken to the streets.
""But they all have one thing in common: They are now standing up against misanthropy and right-wing extremism. They want to live together freely and peacefully in the future.""
What Germany needs now is an alliance of all democrats, Steinmeier said. ""Regardless of whether they live in the country or in the city, young or old, with or without a history of migration,"" Steinmeier said.
""The future of our democracy does not depend on the volume of its opponents - but on the strength of those who defend democracy. Let us show that we are stronger together.""
German cities have been swept by large protests for over a week after the release of an investigative report which revealed that several far-right politicians had attended a meeting alongside far-right extremists where plans to forcibly deport millions of immigrants from Germany were discussed.
Protests were continuing on Sunday after more than 300,000 people took to the streets of Hamburg, Frankfurt and other German cities on Saturday to voice their opposition to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party and to support democracy."
ZSJVTIWBZV_ROHDJ3HIIKZ82XA,Letters to the Editor: Small landlords are being hounded out of L.A. Maybe that's what our leaders want,Los Angeles Times Opinion,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 PM·2 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/letters-editor-small-landlords-being-110042949.html,"To the editor: When I read Joshua Kamali's article on the plight of small L.A. landlords, I wanted to stand and applaud — and cry too.
We too are mom-and-pop landlords, and we own four units. We take our responsibilities as housing providers very seriously, but we and people such as Kamali have been completely abandoned and actually targeted by the Los Angeles City Council and L.A. County Board of Supervisors.
Phone companies, grocery stores, restaurants, gas stations, pharmacies — were any of these businesses expected to continue providing their service for free during the COVID-19 pandemic? Small landlords were, and we are still are being shackled.
We have glowing letters of thanks from tenants from 20 years in this business, but an experience we recently had with one squatter soured us. As Kamali stated, if policies such as rent freezes and free lawyers for tenants facing eviction become the norm, small landlords like us will leave Los Angeles.
But maybe that's what the City Council and County Board of Supervisors want.
Kathy McGrath, Sherman Oaks
..
To the editor: Kamali gave an excellent and accurate analysis of the eviction defense fund now available to rent-defaulting tenants.
The only defense for non-payment of rent is the unit's lack of habitability. The funds for this program should be used instead to help re-establish these people as paying renters. This would avoid many evictions and justify the use of public funds.
Defense attorneys merely delay the inevitable. In doing so, they obtain free rent for their clients while denying the housing provider their right to repossess and re-rent the apartment, a form of legalized theft.
Julia Araiza, Tustin
..
To the editor: Kamali owns ""only""12 units. And he wants us to believe he's a meager blue-collar worker scraping his pennies together to get by.
Twelve units is a lot of property, Mr. Landlord.
And Kamali has the answer to all our problems. Let's have the city run all housing proposals by him first for his input.
Really? Give me a break.
Michael Harold, West Los Angeles
..
To the editor: In his plea to protect small landlords against excessive legal charges incurred by tenants resisting eviction, Kamali misses one key point.
The more small landlords sell their local properties, the more likely large corporations will buy these properties with the intent of constructing luxury apartments and condominiums in their place, further depleting the availability of affordable housing.
As those most likely to rent out decent affordable housing, small landlords deserve protection against unscrupulous tenants.

(NEXSTAR) – Donald Trump maintains a double-digit lead in New Hampshire polls ahead of Tuesday’s first in the nation primary.
Some voters who don’t back Donald Trump raise questions about his suitability for president considering criminal cases he’s facing.
Trump has been sued in New York and indicted Georgia, Florida, Manhattan, and Washington, while Federal and State prosecutors have also opened several investigations in other locations.
At the Team Trump New Hampshire Headquarters, after a campaign event featuring House Representative, Elise Stefanik, Trump’s ardent supporters said the charges against him lack merit.
“I’m not a believer that most of these cases are legitimate, I think they’re political minded.” said Susan Ingrahm-Kelly, a mother in Bedford, who voted for Trump in both 2016 and 2020.
A resident of New Hampshire, Sully Sullivan, had the same idea, “I think a lot of it is unfortunately, and dangerously, political.”
“All that legal stuff, I think, is a smoke screen,” said Penny Hayes, a retiree from Manchester. “I think it’s to keep us from paying attention to the real problems we’re having here.”
Stefanik addressed Trump supporters and said it’s up to the American people to save this country by electing President Donald Trump this November.
“When you look at the facts, you look at the evidence, when you look at the state of America in the world during his tenure; Versus where we stand now, where our economy is, immigration issues, I mean go down the list. I think objectively looking at it, the world was better for Americans under President Trump.” Sullivan said.

Grant Shapps said it was regrettable to see Benjamin Netanyahu double down on his objection to the proposal, stressing the UK “certainly remains wedded” to the idea as there “isn’t another obvious way out of this”.
It comes after the Israeli leader said he dismissed US president Joe Biden’s call for a two-state solution, declaring that he reserves the right to say “no to our friends”.
His remarks appeared to knock back plans to tie Palestinian statehood to a peace agreement with Saudi Arabia, which would be brokered by the US.
Mr Netanyahu’s team went on to say that after Hamas is destroyed, Israel “must retain security control over Gaza” - a requirement that “contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty”.
Addressing the comments on Sunday, Mr Shapps said it was “disappointing” to hear Mr Netanyahu reject the idea, as Palestinians “deserve a sovereign state”.
“I think it’s very disappointing that Benjamin Netanyahu has said that. It’s not in some sense a surprise - he’s spent his entire political career against a two-state solution,” he told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg.
“But the point is, which other route is there to seriously resolve this? Palestinians deserve a sovereign state, Israel deserves to have the full ability to defend itself, its own security, in other words. And unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don’t see that there is another solution.”
He added that the UK will “very much distinguish between the views of individuals and our overall support for Israel as a country”, as the Israeli government is a “rainbow coalition” of politicians with a variety of different opinions.
Earlier, speaking to Sky News’ Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips, he emphasised the importance of a solution that is “sovereign” on the Palestinian side while providing “security guarantees” for the Israelis.
“There isn’t another option. The whole world has agreed that a two-state solution is the best way forward,” he said.
“The British Government absolutely backs that as a solution. It needs to be viable, it needs to be sovereign on the Palestinian side, it needs to provide security guarantees on the Israeli side. And there isn’t another obvious way out of this.
“So I thought that was a disappointing comment [from Mr Netanyahu]. The United Kingdom certainly remains wedded to that.”
It came as the EU urged member states to impose “consequences” on Israel if Mr Netanyahu continues to oppose Palestinian statehood.
In a document circulated to EU foreign ministers ahead of a meeting on Monday, Brussels proposed member states “set out the consequences they envisage to attach to engagement or non engagement” with their proposed peace plan, the Financial Times reported.
Meanwhile, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper reiterated Labour’s view that Mr Netanyahu’s remarks were “completely unacceptable”, referring back to a speech by her colleague David Lammy on Saturday.
“What you will have heard David Lammy talk … he was very clear that those words from Netanyahu were completely unacceptable,” she told Phillips.
“In David’s words this was morally and practically wrong. Statehood of a people is not in the gift of its neighbour, it is the right of a people and it is the right of the Palestinian people.”
Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, told Mr Netanyahu on a visit to Israel last week that the US hoped to see a pathway to an internationally-recognised Palestinian state.
The message was repeated by Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden’s national security adviser, in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week.
But in a televised broadcast on Thursday, Mr Netanyahu rejected the idea and suggested he would stand up to the US’s plans for the region, despite Washington’s backing for Israel since Hamas’s terror attacks on Oct 7 last year.
“In any future arrangement… Israel needs security control of all territory west of the Jordan,” he said. This collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can you do?”
He added: “The prime minister needs to be capable of saying no to our friends.”
Mr Biden has since voiced hope that a two-state solution is still possible even while Mr Netanyahu remains in office, following a call with the Israeli leader on Friday.
The US president said Mr Netanyahu was not opposed to all two-state solutions, and there were a number of possible ideas.
But in a statement, the Israeli prime minister’s office said Mr Netanyahu told Mr Biden that “after Hamas is destroyed, Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty”.
And Mr Netanyahu has continued to stand firm, taking to X late on Saturday to say: “I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over the entire area west of Jordan – and this is contrary to a Palestinian state.”

This most recent lawsuit was filed by 28-year-old Lauren Skerritt of Rhode Island, who claimed she was rushed to the emergency room after suffering heart problems caused by drinking the Charged Lemonade.
According to the lawsuit, Skerritt, an obstacle course racer, drank two-and-a-half Charged Lemonades back in April. After drinking them, she claimed she experienced brain fog, body shakes, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and difficulty thinking after drinking the beverages. Skerritt claims she has no underlying health conditions.
RELATED COVERAGE: Florida man dies after drinking Panera Bread's caffeinated 'Charged Lemonade,' according to lawsuit
Tests at the hospital revealed Skerritt experienced ""atrial fibrillation,"" which is described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as ""when the heartbeat is irregular"" and ""can increase a person's risk for stroke.""
In December, a lawsuit was filed alleging the Charged Lemonade caused the death of 46-year-old Dennis Brown of Florida.
That lawsuit claims Brown drank a Charged Lemonade during dinner and died while walking home. That lawsuit also alleged Brown was drinking the caffeinated beverage for six days.
According to Panera's menu, a large Charged Lemonade has 390 milligrams of caffeine, close to the FDA’s 400-milligram daily maximum intake.

Panera’s 30-ounce Charged Lemonade also contains more caffeine than both Red Bull and Monster energy drinks combined.
The first lawsuit was filed in October by the family of 21-year-old Sarah Katz, who died after drinking the Charged Lemonade. According to Katz's family and friends, the college student suffered from a heart condition and likely did not realize the drink was caffeinated, as she usually avoided caffeine.

In response to the deaths and lawsuits, Panera's mobile app now has a warning that states: ""Consume in moderation, not recommended for children, people sensitive to caffeine, pregnant or nursing women.""

ZX7IOBTL4I_LFVPHBE3GYYX3EH,"A century after Lenin's death, the USSR's founder seems to be an afterthought in modern Russia",JIM HEINTZ,"January 21, 2024 at 3:01 PM·5 min read",20240121,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/century-lenins-death-ussrs-founder-060121060.html,"Not long after the 1924 death of the founder of the Soviet Union, a popular poet soothed and thrilled the grieving country with these words: “Lenin lived, Lenin lives, Lenin will live.”
A century later, the once-omnipresent image of Vladimir Lenin is largely an afterthought in modern Russia, despite those famous lines by revolutionary writer Vladimir Mayakovsky.
The Red Square mausoleum where his embalmed corpse lies in an open sarcophagus is no longer a near-mandatory pilgrimage but a site of macabre kitsch, open only 15 hours a week. It draws far fewer visitors than the Moscow Zoo.
The goateed face with its intense glare that once seemed unavoidable still stares out from statues, but many of those have been the targets of pranksters and vandals. The one at St. Petersburg's Finland Station commemorating his return from exile was hit by a bomb that left a huge hole in his posterior. Many streets and localities that bore his name have been rechristened.
The ideology that Lenin championed and spread over a vast territory is something of a sideshow in modern Russia. The Communist Party, although the largest opposition grouping in parliament, holds only 16% of the seats, overwhelmed by President Vladimir Putin's political power-base, United Russia.
Lenin ""turned out to be completely superfluous and unnecessary in modern Russia,"" historian Konstantin Morozov of the Russian Academy of Sciences told the AP.
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov talks as if Lenin still was in charge: “100 years since the day when his big and kind heart stopped, the second century of Lenin's immortality begins,” he said.
Putin himself appears inclined to keep Lenin at arm's length, even aiming some darts at him.
In a speech three days before the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Putin dismissed its sovereign status as an illegitimate holdover from Lenin's era, when it was a separate republic within the Soviet Union.
“As a result of Bolshevik policy, Soviet Ukraine arose, which even today can with good reason be called ‘Vladimir Ilyich Lenin’s Ukraine.' He is the author and the architect,” Putin said.
In a speech a year earlier, Putin said that allowing Ukraine and other republics the nominal right to secede had planted “the most dangerous time bomb.”
Whatever objections to those policies, Putin also is clearly aware of the emotional hold that Lenin retains for many Russians, and he does not support initiatives that arise periodically to remove the body from the mausoleum.
“I believe it should be left as it is, at least for as long as there are those, and there are quite a few people, who link their lives, their fates as well as certain achievements ... of the Soviet era with that,” he said in 2019.
Such links may persist for decades. A 2022 opinion survey by state-run polling agency VTsIOM found that 29% of Russians believed Lenin's influence would fade so much that in 50 years he would be remembered only by historians. But that response was only 10 percentage points lower than one to the same question a decade earlier, suggesting Lenin remains important.
Lenin's hold on Russia's heart is still strong enough that three years ago, the Union of Russian Architects succumbed to a public outcry and canceled a competition soliciting suggestions for how the Red Square mausoleum could be repurposed. That competition did not even specifically call for the removal of Lenin's body.
Lenin died on Jan. 21, 1924, at age 53, severely weakened by three strokes. His widow, Nadezhda Krupskaya, wanted him to be buried in a conventional grave.
Lenin's close associates had feared his death for months. Artist Yuri Annenkov, summoned to do his portrait at the dacha where he was convalescing, said he had “the helpless, twisted, infantile smile of a man who had fallen into childhood.”
Amid those concerns, Josef Stalin told a Politburo meeting of a proposal by “some comrades” to preserve Lenin's body for centuries, according to a history by Russian news agency Tass. The idea offended Leon Trotsky, Lenin's closest lieutenant, who likened it to the holy relics displayed by the Russian Orthodox Church — a staunch opponent of the Bolsheviks— that had “nothing in common with the science of Marxism.”
But Stalin, once a divinity school student, understood the value of the secular analogue to a saint.
The weather may have tipped the scales. Temperatures were reportedly as low as minus 30 C (minus 22 F) when Lenin's body was displayed during a wake in Moscow, stalling decomposition and inspiring authorities to hastily build a small wooden mausoleum in Red Square and make further efforts to preserve the body.
A later version, a more modernist take on ancient stepped pyramids clad in somber deep red stone, opened in 1930. By that time, Trotsky had been forced into exile and Stalin was in full control, bolstered by a determination to portray himself as absolutely loyal to Lenin's ideals.
In the end, the cult of “Lenin After Lenin” may have worked against the Soviet Union rather than strengthening it by enforcing a rigid mindset, in the view of some historians.
“In many ways the tragedy of the USSR lay in the fact that all subsequent generations of leaders tried to rely on certain ‘testaments of Lenin,’” Vladimir Rudakov, editor of the journal Istorik, wrote in this month's issue.
The Mayakovsky poem that proclaimed Lenin's immortality was “a parting word, or a spell, or a curse,” Rudakov said.
About 450,000 people file past Lenin's corpse per year, according to Tass, about a third of the number of Moscow Zoo visitors and a sharp contrast from the Soviet era when seemingly endless lines shuffled across Red Square.
The honor guards whose goose-stepping rotations fascinated visitors were removed from outside the mausoleum three decades ago. At the annual military parade through Red Square, the structure is blocked from view by a tribune where dignitaries watch the festivities.
Lenin is still there — just harder to see.
