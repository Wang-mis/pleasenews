32F4W4ZLSB-0,"White House says it is not seeking wider conflict after US helicopters sink Houthi boats in Red Sea, killing crews","By Kevin Liptak and Nikki Carvajal, CNN","3 minute read Published 5:50 PM EST, Sun December 31, 2023",20240101,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2023/12/31/politics/us-helicopters-sink-kill-houthis-red-sea/,"The White House said Sunday it is not seeking a wider conflict in the Middle East after US helicopters sank three Houthi boats in the Red Sea after coming under fire.
The helicopters sank the boats and killed those aboard, marking the first time since tensions broke out earlier this year that the US has killed members of the Iranian-backed Houthi rebel group, which has been targeting commercial and merchant vessels in the Red Sea.
The US has avoided directly striking the group inside Yemen as it seeks to avoid escalating the crisis further. But a National Security Council spokesman said Sunday that the US would continue acting in self-defense.
“We don’t seek a conflict wider in the region and we’re not looking for a conflict with the Houthis. The best outcome here would be for the Houthis to stop these attacks, as we have made clear over and over again,” John Kirby said on ABC News.
Four small boats originating from “Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen” attacked the Maersk Hangzhou on Saturday with small arms and attempted to board the merchant vessel, according to a statement from US Central Command, which added that a security team on board had returned fire.

CENTCOM said helicopters from the USS Eisenhower and Gravely responded to the Maersk Hangzhou’s distress call, the second in less than 24 hours, and were fired on by the Houthi boats.
“The U.S. Navy helicopters returned fire in self-defense, sinking three of the four small boats, and killing the crews. The fourth boat fled the area,” the statement said, adding that there was “no damage to U.S. personnel or equipment.”
CNN has reached out to Maersk for comment on the incident.
The Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels since October 7, saying they are acting in solidarity with Hamas amid the group’s war with Israel.
The US has deployed warships to the Red Sea and last month launched Operation Prosperity Guardian, a multinational maritime coalition, to beef up security in the critical global shipping lane.
While President Joe Biden has authorized strikes on other Iranian proxy groups that have attacked American troops in Iraq and Syria, he has stopped short of striking the Houthis in Yemen.
“We’ve got significant national security interests in the region just on our own … and we’re going to put the kind of forces we need in the region to protect those interests and we’re going to act in self-defense going forward,” Kirby said.
Asked about the prospect of a preemptive strike in the region, Kirby reiterated the White House stance.
“We’re not ruling anything in or out, but we have made it clear publicly to the Houthis and privately to our allies and partners in the region we take these threats seriously, and we’re going to make the right decisions going forward,” he said.

V190CL5BXA-1,Japan Airlines jet bursts into flames after collision with earthquake relief plane at Tokyo Haneda airport,"By Mayumi Maruyama, Teele Rebane, Tamara Hardingham-Gill and Emiko Jozuka, CNN","4 minute read Updated 8:12 PM EST, Tue January 2, 2024",20240102,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/02/asia/japan-airlines-plane-fire-airport-intl-hnk/,"Five people were killed when a Japan Airlines plane carrying hundreds of passengers collided with an earthquake relief aircraft and burst into flames on landing at Tokyo’s Haneda airport on Tuesday.
All 379 people on JAL flight 516, including eight children under the age of two, were safely evacuated from the passenger plane, according to the airline, but there were fatalities on the second aircraft, operated by the Japan Coast Guard.
The Airbus A350-900 aircraft ignited after flying into Haneda from the northern Japanese city of Sapporo at 5:46 p.m. local time (3:46 a.m. ET). Video showed a huge fireball erupt as the plane ignited, leaving a fiery trail down the runway.
Five crew members died on the second aircraft, a De Havilland Canada DHC-8, according to Japan’s transport minister, Tetsuo Saito. Public broadcaster NHK said the plane’s captain was in a critical condition.
Japan Airlines said four of its passengers were taken to hospitals but the airline has not received any additional reports of injuries, the airline’s Senior Vice President Noriyuki Aoki said in a press conference Tuesday evening.
Japan Airlines is taking part in the investigation to determine who is responsible for the deadly crash, its senior vice president of corporate safety and security Tadayuki Tsutsumi told reporters. The French aviation agency is also sending its own investigators to Tokyo to probe the collision as part of the investigation team opened by Japan Transport Safety Board, it said in a statement.
In a later statement, Japan Airlines said its crew had been cleared to land by air traffic control before the collision. Audio from LiveATC.net appears to detail the crew reading back a clearance order for runway 34, saying “cleared to land 34 right.”
“According to interviews with the operating crew, they acknowledged and repeated the landing permission from air traffic control, and then proceeded with the approach and landing procedures,” Japan Airlines said.
The statement said that after landing, the Japan Air Lines Airbus A350 “collided with a Japan Coast Guard aircraft and caught fire.”
After the blaze broke out, the plane was seen at a standstill with people using emergency slides to flee the inferno as firefighters tried to battle the growing flames. More than 100 fire trucks were dispatched in response to the accident, NHK reports.
Guy Maestre, originally from France, was on board an adjacent plane at the time of the accident on Tuesday and describes hearing a “big bang.”
“I was hoping everyone was going to be safe,” Maestre, who had been visiting Japan from Philadelphia, told CNN, adding that it was “shocking to see.”
“I was in another plane in the window seat – we were getting ready to take off and we heard a big bang.
“We looked from our windows and saw a huge trail of flames running down the runway.
“Flames got higher and higher then we saw fire trucks go by the runway.”
Mika Yamake had been on her way to the airport to meet her husband, who was on board the JAL plane, when news of the accident broke.
“I didn’t realize it was such a big incident until I saw images on the news,” she told CNN. “At first it was just reports of smoke, but then I saw images of flames and I felt more worried. I only realized my husband was on that plane when he called me.”
“He called me from inside and told me he saw smoke coming out. I was relieved he was safe. He just came out with his mobile phone. He had to leave everything else behind.”
Mika’s husband, Satoshi Yamake, told CNN when the flight landed that he initially didn’t feel anything out of the ordinary.
“We landed normally, didn’t feel a shock or anything,” Yamake told CNN at Haneda airport after he was evacuated from the crash.
He added that he saw a fire shortly before an announcement was made to evacuate the plane.
“But then we saw fire coming out of the engines and I found it strange. Just as I was thinking why the fire was burning for so long, an announcement came and said we probably hit something on the runway and we have to now evacuate the plane,” Yamake said. “We could smell some smoke but passengers were not panicking a lot.”
He said he “was not really scared.”
“Since we have landed already, I was thinking the plane probably won’t explode by this point. We should be fine as long as everyone gets off the plane in an orderly manner.”
A Japan Coast Guard spokesman told CNN that its aircraft had been headed from Haneda airport to an airbase in Niigata prefecture to help with relief efforts following a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Monday.
Flight 516 had been heading inbound to Haneda from Sapporo’s New Chitose Airport in Hokkaido prefecture. The airline said it was carrying a total of 367 passengers, including eight infants, plus 12 crew members.
The majority of departures from Haneda Airport are now canceled and it’s unclear when flight services will resume, NHK reports.

KP857O2WXN-2,FDA approves first state request to import drugs from Canada,"By Tami Luhby, CNN","5 minute read Updated 8:09 PM EST, Fri January 5, 2024",20240105,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/05/politics/florida-canada-drug-imports-fda/,"The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved Florida’s request to import certain drugs from Canada, marking the first time a state has been authorized to buy lower-cost medications in bulk from abroad.
Florida’s plan calls for importing medications for several illnesses for residents covered by certain public programs, including Medicaid enrollees and inmates.
The historic move is the latest salvo in the long-running battle to lower drug prices, one of Americans’ biggest health care headaches and a major element of President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, is also highlighting his importation proposal as he seeks to curtail drug costs.
“After years of federal bureaucrats dragging their feet, Florida will now be able to import low-cost, life-saving prescription drugs,” DeSantis said in a statement Friday. “It’s about time that the FDA put patients over politics and the interests of Floridians over Big Pharma.”
While US law allows drug importation, it never gained traction because of federal health officials’ concerns over safety and actual savings as well as fierce opposition from American drug manufacturers and Republican lawmakers.
Former President Donald Trump, however, made drug importation a centerpiece of his effort to reduce drug costs and pushed for federal approval of Florida’s proposal. In 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a final rule establishing a path for states and certain other entities to set up drug importation programs. The next year, Biden issued an executive order directing the FDA commissioner to work with states that want to develop importation programs.
Though Biden, Trump and DeSantis are likely to take credit on the campaign trail for initiating drug importation in the US, major hurdles remain before Florida can actually start importing certain medications, and it could be a while before the state and its residents see savings. The drug industry is expected to continue its efforts to prevent the importation of drugs, and Canada has opposed the mass importation of its medications.
Florida, which filed its proposal with the FDA in 2020, initially wants to import drugs to treat chronic health conditions such as HIV/AIDS, mental illness and prostate cancer, the governor’s office said in a press release Friday.
The state would make the imported drugs available to patients at county health departments managed by the state Department of Health, inmates at state correctional facilities and certain others served by state agencies. The program would then expand to Medicaid enrollees.
Florida expects to save up to $180 million in the first year and around $183 million annually once the program is fully implemented, the state said.
“We’re creating a system with importers and vendors that we as a state will import drugs from Canada, relabel them, get them to Florida and send them out through various state programs that way,” Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration secretary, Jason Weida, told state lawmakers last month. “That guarantees safety. That guarantees cost savings.”
Seven other states, including Colorado, Maine and Texas, have passed laws that would allow them to create state drug importation programs. Some are in various stages of seeking FDA approval. New Hampshire’s application was rejected in 2022 because it did not identify a Canadian wholesaler.
Florida must meet certain FDA requirements before drugs can be imported. It must submit additional drug-specific information for the agency’s approval, ensure that the medications have been tested and comply with FDA standards, and relabel the medications consistent with FDA rules. In addition, the state must submit a quarterly report about the imported drugs, cost savings and potential safety and quality issues.
“These proposals must demonstrate the programs would result in significant cost savings to consumers without adding risk of exposure to unsafe or ineffective drugs,” said FDA Commissioner Robert Califf.
The state’s plan is authorized for two years from the date the FDA is notified of the first drug shipment.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, quickly issued a statement that said it is “considering all options for preventing this policy from harming patients.”
“We are deeply concerned with the FDA’s reckless decision to approve Florida’s state importation plan,” said Stephen Ubl, CEO of PhRMA, the main industry group. “Ensuring patients have access to needed medicines is critical, but the importation of unapproved medicines, whether from Canada or elsewhere in the world, poses a serious danger to public health. Politicians need to stop getting between Americans and their health care.”
The Canadian government, which is concerned about its own drug shortages, and independent experts have questioned whether importation would do much to help lower prices in the US since Canada’s drug market is relatively small. In 2020, Canada announced measures to protect its drug supply, including banning the distribution of certain drugs outside of the country that would cause or worsen a shortage. This includes all medications eligible for bulk importation to the US, according to Health Canada, which is responsible for national health policy.
“The Government of Canada is taking all necessary action to safeguard the drug supply and ensure Canadians have access to the prescription drugs they need and has been clear in its position: bulk importation will not provide an effective solution to the problem of high drug prices in the US,” Health Canada said in a statement Friday evening.
But others are more hopeful.
“This is a significant step in moving towards wholesale drug importation and residents of the United States accessing the same drugs at a lower cost,” said Maureen Hensley-Quinn, senior director of coverage, cost and value at the National Academy for State Health Policy, which developed drug importation model legislation that states can use.

DZK11D49A6-3,"Myanmar artillery shells land in China, wounding 5 people and angering Beijing",Story by Reuters,"2 minute read Published 11:27 PM EST, Thu January 4, 2024",20240105,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/05/china/myanmar-china-artillery-shells-protest-intl-hnk/,"China has protested to Myanmar after five people were injured by artillery shells lobbed during battles between its ruling junta and rebel groups that strayed into a small town near their border, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Thursday.
Armed conflict has surged in Myanmar’s north between the military and rebel groups since late October, spurring calls for a ceasefire from neighboring China, which has also facilitated dialogue between the two sides.
“China … strongly deplores the Chinese casualties caused by the conflict and has already lodged serious representations with the relevant parties,” said Wang Wenbin, the spokesperson.
“China once again asks all parties to the conflict to cease fire and stop fighting, and take measures to prevent the recurrence of such vicious incidents,” Wang told a regular news briefing.
China would take the necessary steps to safeguard the lives and property of its citizens, he added.
Earlier, the state-run Global Times newspaper said five people in Nansan, a subtropical town near Myanmar, were taken to hospital after being wounded on Wednesday by the stray shells.
A video of the incident circulated on social media by the paper showed one person lying on a pavement as people shouted, “Call the police!”
In the video, the paper added that officials in Zhenkang, a city in the southwestern province of Yunnan, had confirmed shelling had strayed from Laukkai, in Myanmar’s northern region of Kokang, at about 2 p.m. on Wednesday.
The incident comes after China’s embassy in Myanmar urged its nationals last week to leave Laukkai as soon as possible, citing growing security risks.
For years, Kokang in Myanmar’s Shan state has been a volatile and restive region.
In 2015, shells from the area also landed across the border in Yunnan amid fighting between Myanmar government troops and rebels, injuring one Chinese and four Myanmar nationals and angering Beijing.

Some battles took place as close as 500 meters (1,640 feet) from the China-Myanmar border at the time.
In 2009, clashes in the same area forced tens of thousands to flee across the border into China, Chinese state media and rights groups have said.
In mid-December, the United Nations estimated more than 660,000 people had been displaced in Myanmar since October 27, and put the corresponding nationwide total at a record 2.6 million.
China has urged citizens to avoid travel to northern Myanmar, and advised those already there to seek safety or return home."
PZPAHX90QH-4,"Russia is using North Korean missiles in Ukraine, US says. That’s bad news for Asia","Analysis by Brad Lendon, CNN","4 minute read Published 7:10 PM EST, Fri January 5, 2024",20240106,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/05/europe/russia-north-korean-missiles-ukraine-asia-intl-hnk-ml/,"Russia has fired North Korean-supplied short-range ballistic missiles into Ukraine twice in the past week, an “escalation” of Pyongyang’s support for Moscow that has serious implications for both the war in Europe and security on the Korean Peninsula, the White House said Thursday.
The North Korean-made missiles were fired at Ukraine on December 30 and January 2, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said at a White House briefing. They were among at least 500 missiles and drones fired at Ukraine around the New Year’s holiday, according to Kyiv.
The December 30 attack involved a lone missile that fell into a field, while Russia’s January 2 assault involved multiple missiles, he said. The impacts of missiles fired on January 2 are still being assessed, Kirby said, adding they were part of a “massive” Russian assault.
“Due in part to our sanctions and export controls, Russia has become increasingly isolated on the world stage and they’ve been forced to look to likeminded states for military equipment,” Kirby said in the briefing. “As we’ve been warning publicly, one of those states is North Korea.”
Kirby and analysts who spoke with CNN said the introduction of the North Korean weapons into the war in Ukraine will reverberate 7,500 kilometers (4,600 miles) east to the Korean Peninsula.
“This is a significant and concerning escalation in the DPRK’s support for Russia,” Kirby said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
“We expect Russia and North Korea to learn from these launches,” Kirby said.
Analysts echoed that sentiment, saying the use of North Korean missiles on the battlefield in Ukraine can give Pyongyang data it can’t get from a testing program that has seen dozens of the weapons fired over the past few years under the missile program of leader Kim Jong Un.
“It will be interesting to see how these missiles perform in a more operational environment and outside of North Korea’s propaganda machine, particularly any indication of accuracy and indeed the guidance systems utilized,” said Joseph Dempsey, research associate for defense and military analysis at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
North Korea says it will no longer seek reunification with South Korea, will launch new spy satellites in 2024
Ankit Panda, senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Russia’s use of the missiles against Ukraine allows North Korea to gather data on how they penetrated defenses similar to those South Korea and the United States might field on the Korean Peninsula.
“In technical terms, I suspect the North Koreans will be quite interested in how their missiles fare against Western missile defense systems,” he said.
Speaking at the White House, Kirby said the consequences for South Korea and the region go beyond Pyongyang’s ability to refine its missile programs.
“In return for its support we assess that Pyongyang is seeking military assistance from Russia including fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, war materials and other advanced technologies,” Kirby said.
“This would have concerning security implications for the Korean Peninsula and the Indo-Pacific region.”
The areas Kirby ticked off are ones where North Korea’s adversaries in East Asia – most notably South Korea, the US and Japan – are considered to have big advantages over the isolated nation.
For instance, all three possess advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets that would give them big advantages in trying to breach North Korean air defenses. But if Pyongyang were to acquire more modern Russian surface-to-air missiles with advanced tracking radars to go with them, the F-35 advantage could be cut back significantly.
Russia is also likely sending money to Pyongyang, said Lee Jang Wook, research fellow at the Center for Security and Strategy in the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses (KIDA).
“The first biggest benefit will be North Korea’s weapons to act as another export revenue” for Pyongyang, Lee told CNN.
“And this revenue can be another monetary support to mass create more nuclear weapons,” Lee said.
Meanwhile, Kirby and the analysts say Russia is likely seeing immediate benefits from any influx of North Korean armaments.
Russia appears poised to purchase ballistic missiles from Iran, official says
“The North Korean SRBMs are unlikely to provide a qualitive edge over anything already in the Russian inventory. Instead, the main benefit being quantitative, by boosting Russia’s depleting missile stocks and providing an additional supply line,” Dempsey said.
The North Korean missiles “will allow Russia to continue deep strikes without drawing down its own stocks of missiles,” Panda said. The North Korean missiles have a range of up to 900 kilometers (about 550 miles), Kirby said, allowing them to be fired from deeper in Russian territory where Moscow’s air defenses can keep launchers better protected from Ukrainian counterstrikes.
And a North Korean supply has another advantage for Moscow, Panda said.
“Given the land border between Russia and North Korea, it will be nigh impossible for Western states to interrupt transfers as long as Pyongyang is willing to continue cooperating with Russia,” he said.
For Ukraine, it all adds up to a troubling picture ahead.
“We anticipate that Russia will use additional North Korean missiles to target Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,” Kirby said.

7W6DSUAB1D-5,China says a foreign consultant was found to be spying for Britain’s MI6,"By Wayne Chang and Michelle Toh, CNN","2 minute read Updated 3:54 AM EST, Mon January 8, 2024",20240108,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/08/business/china-uk-mi6-spy-detained-intl-hnk/,"Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
China said Monday it has detained a foreign national who was the head of an overseas consulting firm for allegedly spying on behalf of the United Kingdom.
China’s civilian spy agency, the Ministry of State Security (MSS), said in a statement that it had apprehended an individual surnamed Huang working with Britain’s MI6 while leading a foreign consultancy.
The agency did not mention Huang’s full name, gender or nationality, nor identify the company they worked at.
According to the MSS, Huang started working with MI6 in 2015 on intelligence matters, with the British agency directing Huang to travel to China multiple times to collect intelligence and identify potential assets for it.
MI6 provided Huang with training, as well as professional spying equipment for the exchange of intelligence and communications, the MSS also claimed.
Capvision says it has addressed China’s concerns about national security
It alleged that Huang ended up providing Britain with 17 pieces of intelligence, including several “national secrets.”
During the MSS investigation, Huang was given access to consular visits from their home country in accordance with the law, it said. The British Embassy in Beijing referred CNN to the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) for comment on the case. The FCDO did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The news comes after China embarked on a months-long crackdown on international consulting firms.
Last May, state security authorities said they had raided several offices of Capvision, an advisory network with headquarters in Shanghai and New York. The announcement came after Chinese officials closed the Beijing office of Mintz Group, a US corporate due diligence firm, and questioned employees at the local branch of top consultancy Bain.
The measures were part of wider efforts by Beijing to increase oversight of what it deems sensitive information pertaining to national security.
Capvision later said in October that it had successfully completed a national security inspection overseen by the Chinese government, and come up with new compliance measures to address concerns.
The MSS, which oversees intelligence and counterintelligence both within China and overseas, is typically known for keeping a low profile. But it has expanded communications with the public recently, including launching an account on WeChat, the ubiquitous social networking platform in China.
The agency has used the platform to call on “all members of society” to join its fight against foreign spies, particularly after the passage of a counter-espionage law that took effect last July. The enacting of that law has also spooked businesses that are worried about whether the expanded scope could lead to higher legal risks."
RYHYYAQ8G7-6,Kenya goes visa-free for travelers – but there’s a catch,"By Bethlehem Feleke, CNN","4 minute read Published 1:06 PM EST, Tue January 9, 2024",20240109,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/travel/kenya-visa-free-electronic-travel-authorization/,"Traveling to one of Africa’s most popular destinations seemed to be about to get a lot easier in 2024 after the government of Kenya announced tourists would no longer need a visa.
And then people started reading the small print.
While many international visitors no longer need to buy a visa costing upward of $51, now almost everyone – including some countries whose citizens previously enjoyed free entry – must cough up $34 for an Electronic Travel Authorization.
The move has sparked blowback, with many taking to social media to voice their outrage. Some in the travel industry have warned it could have a serious impact on tourism at a time when the country is hoping to attract more visitors.
The new policy requires visitors to apply online at least three days before travel and pay the $34 as a processing fee.
Kenyan President William Ruto has advocated for a borderless Africa, urging countries to ditch visas and pursue the free movement of people and goods across the continent.
But since the new policy took effect in early January, people across the continent have taken to social media complaining it does the opposite.
China tries to lure foreign tourists with expanded visa-free scheme
When the ETA went into effect in the first week in January, Jones Ntaukira, a frequent business traveler from Malawi, expressed surprise at the move, calling it “hectic,” in a post on X.
The founder of startup power company Zuwa Energy told CNN that, for someone who frequently travels at short notice to Nairobi to meet with partners and investors, the new rules are an unwelcome obstacle.
“Now it means you don’t have that convenience, it’s gone, you have to plan four days in advance,” he said. “It’s not the $30 but I think it’s the process that you have to apply online and wait for three days and then submit documents. We didn’t have that before.”
Others took issue with new requirements placed on children. Previously children younger than 16 from several countries did not have to pay for a visa.
Kenya’s tourism board hopes to attract 5.5 million annual visitors in the next four years. But critics of the new policy question what effect it will have on arrivals.
“The time you put into these things [applications], sometimes it puts you off –  you decide not to do something you would’ve done and you do it somewhere else or in a different way,” Ntaukira said.
“This is one of the harshest visa regimes in Africa now, and it masquerades as liberalization of travel,” said Sean Mendis in a post on LinkedIn.
Mendis, who describes himself as an aviation executive, added: “The long term will not be kind to Kenyan tourism.”
There were also concerns that the new system could have an impact on Kenyan travelers if countries currently offering them unrestricted access seek to impose reciprocal terms.
Kenyan authorities insist the ETA is a step forward for the country.
On Sunday, a statement from the country’s Ministry of Interior said its introduction was “premised on the need to have a fair, faster and reliable system that also addresses Kenya’s security and other strategic interests.”
Citizens from countries in the East African Community (EAC) regional bloc, who are exempt from ETA for the next six months, may soon also be expected to apply to travel to Kenya.
“EAC nationals will be issued with ETA gratis (free ETA)” Nixon Ng’ang’a, director of communications at Kenya’s Ministry of Interior and coordination of national government, told CNN. “We are currently developing the system to recognize various types of EAC documents used for travel within the region.
“Some of these [travel documents] are not International Civil Aviation Organization compliant. The six months period will be used to align regional interests and compliance with international travel protocols,” he said.
Muthuri Kinyamu, co-founder of Kenyan tour operator Turnup.Travel, says the roll-out of the new measures caused confusion after announcements that focused on the visa-free aspect, but overall it could have a positive impact.
“We are yet to see the effects of what it means in terms of arrivals or ease of travel to Kenya, but the spirit of it is to make the destination an open and accessible destination by standardizing the rates,” he said."
KL9N8WB969-7,"Measles outbreak involving cases at a Philadelphia day care center expands, health officials say","By Carma Hassan, CNN","4 minute read Published 4:01 PM EST, Tue January 9, 2024",20240109,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/09/health/philadelphia-measles-outbreak/,"A cluster of measles cases in Philadelphia has widened to include eight people over the past month, including at least five children, according to the city’s health department.
All of the cases were in people who had no immunity to the virus, Philadelphia Department of Public Health spokesperson James Garrow said.
A person who contracted measles outside the United States went to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in early December, the health department said, exposing three people at the hospital who later tested positive for the highly contagious virus.
One of the people exposed at the hospital attended a Philadelphia day care. Days later, two children from the day care were hospitalized with measles.
“The Health Department was notified that a measles case attended a day care facility on December 20 and 21 and exposed children and staff there,” the department said in a statement.
Health officials said Friday that they learned of three additional children at the day care center with possible cases of measles.
Exemptions for required vaccines for US kindergartners reach record high
On Monday, the health department reported eight cases of confirmed measles: the first patient, four people at the day care and three people exposed at the hospital.
Philadelphia health officials added more locations and dates to the list of possible exposures that took place between December 19 and January 3. Anyone who might have been exposed is advised to quarantine for 21 days after exposure, Garrow said.
“It is important to stay home because it is so highly contagious and airborne and can hang around in the air for several hours,” said American Academy of Pediatrics spokesperson Dr. Christina Johns, a Maryland-based pediatric emergency physician at a PM Pediatric Care urgent care. “Additionally, I think that this is really a note for everyone to take about how quickly this infection can spread and so therefore the importance of vaccination. The only way to prevent the illness and then of course, the very concerning potential complications down the road from measles, is to get vaccinated.”
The department is offering free measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations for anyone in the city.
Experts recommend that children get the vaccine in two doses: the first between 12 months and 15 months of age, and a second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles if you come into contact with the virus. Two doses are about 97% effective.
The Philadelphia health department says that 93% of kids in the city are fully vaccinated against measles by 6 years old.
Measles can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, lingering in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves a room. An infected person can also share germs by touching objects or surfaces.
It starts with symptoms typical of many respiratory illnesses, followed by a rash that usually starts on the face and spreads downward three to five days after symptoms begin.
“Measles is dangerous for anyone who is not immunized. Also, for the very young, those tend to be the most at risk for measles and its complications,” Johns said.
“There are some post-infectious complications that can include blindness, even. It can include some encephalitis, which is a rare but serious neurological condition that can happen even years later in life. So it is definitely not something to take lightly,” she said.
Although measles is considered eliminated in the United States, outbreaks are possible if an unvaccinated person travels to a country where the disease is still common, becomes infected and brings it back to the US, transmitting the virus to anyone unvaccinated.

“For most people who are fully immunized, the risk of measles exposure is low. However, it is very possible to transmit it to others who are more vulnerable,” Johns said. “So it’s important for everybody to do their part in an outbreak like this, to have awareness of the ongoing situation and to follow public health recommendations closely.”
Johns said outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like this one are a “call to action” for members of a community to make sure they are up-to-date on their vaccinations.
“Many of these illnesses that people think are no big deal are really no big deal because we haven’t seen them in so long because of immunizations. And so it really is important to note that we’ve got to make sure that people are getting immunized, so we don’t see a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases,” she said.
About 92% of US children have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella by age 2, according to a 2023 report from the CDC.
