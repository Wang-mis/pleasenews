0BHK9D5IWW_3YU299GRJFHH5FL,Understanding a week of missile strikes across Middle East,By Raffi Berg,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68017051,"The past week has seen new rounds of violence across the Middle East, deepening fears of conflict spreading in an already unstable region.
Here is a brief guide to what has happened - and where it might lead.
On Tuesday, Iran unexpectedly carried out a missile and drone attack on Pakistani territory. Iran said it was targeting an Iranian Sunni Muslim militant group, Jaish al-Adl, that has staged attacks inside Iran. Pakistan said two children were killed and swiftly hit back, launching missiles at Pakistani ""terrorist hideouts"" on Iran's side of the border. Iran said three women, two men and four children were killed.
The flare-up has heightened tensions in a region already experiencing a multitude of crises. Although the area of the tit-for-tat strikes is far from the main theatres of fighting in the Middle East, the border is volatile and further incidents here could quickly escalate, for instance if Jaish al-Adl retaliates against Iran.
This week saw multiple rounds of US Navy missile strikes against the Houthi Zaidi Shia movement in Yemen, following Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a waterway crucial to world trade. The Houthis - backed by Iran - stepped up their attacks in November following the outbreak of the war in Gaza. They vowed to target ""Israeli-linked"" boats so long as Israel's offensive continued, to show solidarity with the Palestinians.
Consequently all merchant shipping in the international waters has been put under threat, something considered intolerable by Western powers. The US and UK, backed by allies, launched the first air strikes against the Houthis last week to try to deter them - but the group has remained defiant.
On Monday, the Houthis hit a US vessel in the Gulf of Aden in what appeared to be their first successful attack on an American ship since their campaign began. A second was hit in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday and the Houthis have vowed to continue - raising the prospect of further US strikes and the question of whether Iran will feel forced to respond.
An increasingly intensifying years-long shadow war between arch-foes Israel and Iran ratcheted up on Monday when Iran fired missiles at what it described as headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency in Irbil in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, killing four people. Iraq - an ally of Iran and hostile to Israel - denied Mossad was there and condemned the attack.
Iran said its attack was a response to the alleged Israeli killings recently of a senior Iranian commander in Syria and two top Iran-backed militants in Lebanon - one a commander of the Shia militant movement Hezbollah and the other the deputy leader of the Palestinian group Hamas.
The Israel-Lebanese border, where Israel and Hezbollah - heavily armed and funded by Iran - have frequently traded strikes since the Hamas attack on Israel and start of the Gaza war on 7 October, is one of the most dangerous fronts in the region.
On Wednesday Israel's military chief of staff said ""the likelihood of [war in the north] happening in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past.""
At the same time as it struck in Iraq, Iran fired missiles into a rebel-held province in north-west Syria, saying it had targeted bases of the Islamic State (IS) group in retaliation for IS suicide bombings in southern Iran on 3 January which killed 94 people. IS, a Sunni jihadist group, considers Shia Muslims heretical, and Iran is the dominant Shia power in the region.
While Iran is a key ally of the Syrian government, directly striking militants in the rebel-held region is a rare step and a signal to its adversaries that Iran is prepared to act far afield.
An air strike on the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Saturday killed 10 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five of them were senior members of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Syria and Iran blamed Israel, with Iran vowing revenge.
It follows similar strikes around Damascus earlier in the week. Israel has not commented, but has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of aerial operations in Syria involving attacks on targets it says are linked to Iran. An interception of a fighter aircraft by Syrian air defences - which has so far not happened - or deadly retaliation could ignite a new crisis in a region beset by wars.
Intense fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has continued, with the war there now in its 15th week. At least 891 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardment since last Sunday, raising the death toll there since 7 October to more than 25,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. On the Israeli side, nine soldiers were killed in the same period, bringing its combat death total to 189.
Israel intensified its offensive on the southern city of Khan Younis this week, while troops reached their furthest point south since the start of the war, the Israeli military said. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the conflict could go on until 2025, Israeli TV reported this week.
Israel was also hit by a car-ramming and stabbing attack on Monday, for which police arrested two Palestinian suspects from the occupied West Bank. The attack, which was praised by Hamas, killed a woman and injured 17 other people. It was one of the first such attacks inside Israel since the start of the Gaza war, heightening anxieties among Israelis still reeling from the 7 October attacks.
Violence has also escalated in the West Bank alongside the war. Israeli air strikes there on Wednesday killed nine Palestinians, medics said. Israel said at least five of the dead were planning an imminent attack.
Missiles were fired at an air base used by US-led coalition forces in western Iraq on Saturday, injuring several US military personnel, US Central Command said. Iranian-backed militants are suspected of being behind the attack.
Bases housing US and coalition forces in Iraq and north-east Syria have been attacked dozens of times by Iranian-backed militants in recent months, drawing US retaliation. The attacks are seen as part of Iran's indirect conflict with the US, where it can strike US assets at arms length.
About 3,400 coalition personnel are in Iraq and Syria as part of efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group, which still operates in pockets in the region.
Attacks by one country into another have also been happening in other places in the Middle East this week.
Turkey carried out air strikes against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq and a US-backed Kurdish-led militia alliance in northern Syria on Monday, its defence ministry said. The latest strikes are part of a decades-long and bloody conflict between Turkey and armed Kurdish groups which Turkey, which has a large Kurdish minority, regards as terrorist organisations. One of the strikes is reported to have hit a prison holding more than 3,000 IS prisoners.
There were also rare air strikes by Jordan across its border with Syria. Ten people, including children, are reported to have been killed. It is thought to have targeted drug smugglers. Iran-backed militias in Syria have been accused by Jordan of trafficking the amphetamine Captagon into the kingdom and on to Gulf Arab states."
12E1QXEDDX_OVQHJV0WRC2UR5F,Peatlands: New documentary to explore the secret life of bogs,By Finn Purdy & Richie Montague,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68029982,"Climate change, folklore and Ireland's natural history - there's more to peatlands than meets the eye.
And while holding an important place in Irish culture, these natural landscapes could also be crucial to our future.
That's according to Cormac Ã hÃdhmaill, presenter of a new BBC Northern Ireland documentary on the secret life of bogs.
In his new Irish language series, RÃºin na bPortach (Secrets Of The Peat), Ã hÃdhmaill visits bogs across the island of Ireland and throughout the world, exploring their role in the global ecosystem and how they have shaped Irish culture and identity.
One of the major benefits of bog lands, as the documentary explores, is that they can act as ""carbon sinks"" - sites that trap carbon out of the atmosphere and prevent it contributing to climate change.
However, damaged bogs, as 86% of them are in Northern Ireland, release their stored carbon, further contributing to climate change.
There are currently several projects across Northern Ireland to ""restore"" bogs, allowing them to once again act as a sponge for carbon in the atmosphere.
However, Ã hÃdhmaill told BBC News NI that these efforts are ""not the scale that will be needed"".
He said that bogs also slow the flow of water and that ""the government is starting to realise"" you can tackle the issue of flooding via peatlands.
""It's kind of a double whammy: preserve your bogs for the benefit of the climate, preserve your bogs also to alleviate the flooding in the future.""
Ã hÃdhmaill said that the programme doesn't just look at the issue of climate change, ""although that is probably the most important"".
""We looked at the mythology of bogs; we looked at the traditions associated with bogs; we looked at what we can learn from bogs as a storage of scientific facts and cultural artefacts from the past.
""It was an eye-opener, to be honest. We've neglected bogs for so long; bogs were something to be exploited; bogs were basically seen as sources of fuel.""
The series includes a trip to the National Museum of Ireland for a conversation about the human remains found in bogs in Ireland, and what they can tell us about ""a time before our history books began"".
It also examines the folklore and mythology surrounding bogs in Ireland.
Peatlands were long thought to be home to fairies and various superstitions developed regarding these landscapes.
""Some of our traditions have lists of prayers that you can arm yourself with against the dangers of the bog,"" said Ã hÃdhmaill
""They were difficult places, they were dangerous and places to be respected,"" he added.
And it's a respect that he is hoping we can all regain.
The first of three episodes of RÃºin na bPortach will be available at 22:00 on Sunday 21 January on BBC Two Northern Ireland, and BBC iPlayer. An English language version will be broadcast on BBC Northern Ireland later this year.

2ZRXXRHJVK_ZROSMVWZQMSS1RZ,Glenn Quinn murder: PSNI failed to deal with threat intel,By Aileen Moynagh,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68041272,"The brother of murdered Glenn Quinn has said a police apology for failings in how death threat intelligence was handled ""means nothing"".
Police failed to properly deal with intelligence that indicated he was under threat, an ombudsman has found.
Glenn Quinn, 47, was found beaten to death in his house in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, in January 2020.
No one has been convicted of the killing.
His family believe individuals linked to a loyalist paramilitary group - the South East Antrim Ulster Defence Association (UDA) - were responsible.
The ombudsman report has found that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) failed to warn Glenn Quinn about a threat to his life before he was murdered.
The PSNI has apologised to Mr Quinn's family.
Mr Quinn's mother, Ellen, said she is ""absolutely disgusted"" by the report's findings.
His brother Martin Quinn told BBC News NI that he feels ""angry and let down.""
""We knew it would be a difficult read and when we got into the detail of the missed opportunities and the inaction carried out by senior officers responsible for policing in Carrick, it's a disgrace,"" he said.
""It's an absolute indictment on the PSNI itself, almost to the point where the PSNI failed Glenn so much that the PSNI has Glenn's blood on their hands as well as the people that murdered him.""
The Police Ombudsman, Marie Anderson, said the PSNI received intelligence from an anonymous source on 1 January 2020, three days before Mr Quinn was found dead.
The intelligence referenced Mr Quinn's name and home address, and that he was to be shot dead at his home.
However, the ombudsman said Mr Quinn was not informed as he was not associated on police systems with the address provided in the intelligence.
""This led to the police failing to identify him as a target,"" she said.
""However, if police had visited the address it is likely that they would have been able to confirm that he lived there, which would have verified the credibility of the threat.""
Glenn's mother said it might have made a difference, but Martin said it ""definitely would have"".
""If Glenn had of contacted me and said he'd received a threat message from the police we would have immediately moved Glenn away from the danger and then sought to resolve the issue there,"" Martin said.
""But that wasn't done.
""The police didn't do it.""
She added: ""This would have led to Mr Quinn being given a threat warning notice which would have provided him with an opportunity to consider police advice in respect of appropriate precautionary measures.""
Two duty inspectors who each assessed the intelligence said that it did not constitute ""a real and immediate threat to life"", the ombudsman added.
Mrs Anderson recommended that one of the inspectors should be disciplined for this failing, and that she would have recommended the same for the second inspector but the officer retired before her investigation ended.
The ombudsman said the PSNI had decided the serving officer had no case to answer for misconduct and that they should receive additional training instead, a move that Mrs Anderson said was extremely disappointing.
""That is just rubbing salt in our wounds,"" Martin said.
""How on earth can they justify not disciplining the officer who blatantly took no action, absolutely no action and the ombudsman has identified it and the ombudsman recommended that he be disciplined, and it wasn't done?""
The Quinn family are due to meet PSNI Chief Constable Jon Boutcher on Tuesday and want this decision reviewed.
""They can't ignore it. They just can't whitewash it and push it away,"" said Martin Quinn
""This isn't a dog that was knocked down in the street.
""This was my brother.
""This was a human being. A happy go lucky, really decent guy and he was murdered for nothing, and the police could have stopped it,"" he added.
Glenn's mother said she will never give up fighting for justice.
""To the day I die I will fight for Glenn, for justice for Glenn, for justice for him and for these people to be punished for that they've done,"" she said.
In the report, Ms Anderson noted that the police had accepted her recommendation for the introduction of formal training for police officers to make critical 'life and death' decisions in responding to suspected death threats.
""I welcome that police last month commenced this essential basic training"", said Mrs Anderson.
PSNI Deputy Chief Constable Chris Todd apologised to Mr Qunn's family and said the police accepted Mrs Anderson's findings.
He said police has ""now implemented recommendations to ensure that incidents of a similar nature do not occur again"".
""In addition, instructions have also been issued to those involved in the management of threats to reinforce the importance of ensuring that all feasible operational steps are taken to mitigate the threat and ensure a consistent approach to the assessment of threat messages. We must be a learning organisation and I take responsibility for that.""
""Policing is a human endeavour and sometimes mistakes are made. The scale and complexity of this work is exceptionally challenging. Intelligence is not an exact science and police often have to work off a partial picture,"" he added.
The family of Glenn Quinn recently offered an increased reward of Â£40,000 to help to find his killers on the fourth anniversary of his murder.

4DPCP1ZJC1_MRV5B03DI7UZMSY,Shapps 'disappointed' by Netanyahu opposition to Palestinian state,_,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-68046625,"Creating two separate states is the only solution to ending the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, the defence secretary has said.
Grant Shapps said it was ""disappointing"" that Israel's prime minister has rejected the idea.
Benjamin Netanyahu's position was not ""a surprise"", he told the BBC.
But Mr Shapps said Palestinians ""deserved"" a sovereign state, adding ""I really don't see that there is another solution"".
Following a call with US President Joe Biden on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu's office released a statement saying he had ""reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty"".
Mr Shapps said the comments were ""very disappointing"".
""It's not in some senses a surprise - he's spent his entire political career against a two-state solution. But the point is, which other route is there to seriously resolve this?"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.
""Palestinians deserve a sovereign state, Israel deserves to have the full ability to defend itself, its own security.
""Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution.""
He added there were a variety of views within the Israeli government ""so we very much distinguish between the views of individuals and our overall support for Israel as a country"".
Labour has also described Mr Netanyahu's comments as ""completely unacceptable"".
Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told Sky News: ""Statehood of a people is not in the gift of its neighbour, it is the right of a people and it is the right of the Palestinian people.""
Mr Netanyahu's remarks appeared to deepen a public divide with the US.
Speaking to reporters after the call between the two leaders, Mr Biden insisted a two-state solution was still possible with Mr Netanyahu in office.
""There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that... don't have their own militaries,"" he said.
Hamas killed about 1,300 people and took 240 hostages in its surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October.
In response, Israel launched airstrikes and a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip.
According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, more than 25,000 people have been killed in the territory since the start of the conflict.
Also appearing on the programme, Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf, whose parents-in-law were trapped in Gaza for more than three weeks in the early stages of the war, repeated his call for an immediate ceasefire.
Asked if he thought people sometimes placed a different value on Palestinian lives, he said: ""Without a shadow of a doubt. If you talk to anybody who is Palestinian, you speak to many people in the Muslim community, they feel that the Palestinian blood is very cheap.""

Watch: Grant Shapps warns of 'a more dangerous world'
In his interview, Mr Shapps also said the UK needed to be prepared for ""a more dangerous world"".
In a speech on Monday he warned of growing risks posed by countries including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, as well as terrorist groups.
However, asked when the government would hit its target of spending 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the size of the economy, on defence, Mr Shapps said he could not give an exact date.
He told the BBC the trajectory was ""already upwards"", with spending ""comfortably above 2%"", and that the target would be met ""when economic conditions allow"".
It comes after former head of the British Army Gen Lord Dannatt warned the UK risked a repeat of the 1930s, when the ""woeful state"" of its armed forces failed to deter Hitler, unless it invested more in its military.
Writing in the Times on Friday, he criticised the shrinking size of the Army and called for the government to commit to spending 3% of GDP on defence.
Challenged over why the size of the Army was reducing if the threats to the UK were growing, Mr Shapps said: ""It's not the number of people alone that matters, it's the lethality, it's how capable our systems are of defence.""

They launched an investigation into the matter after they were contacted at about 23:45 GMT on Saturday.
The force said the man approached the woman in a dark red or burgundy car as she walked from the British Royal Legion pub on Tan Y Graig Road, Llanelli, in Carmarthenshire.
The man was said to have dark hair and an accent not local to the area.
He asked her to get into the car, but when she refused he got out and tried to drag her in.
Dyfed-Powys Police said the woman escaped to a nearby house.
A spokesman said: ""She was not harmed but is understandably shaken by the incident.""
The force added that its investigation had established the car drove along Hendre Road from Tan Y Graig Road.
The police are appealing for information and encouraging local people to check CCTV and doorbell or dashcam footage for sightings of the car.

5TQECI5WHD_N9AOVBMOJL4I99S,Tata Steel: Port Talbot apprentices worry about future,By Bethan Lewis,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-68041372,"Kieran Harris' great-grandfather was the first of four generations to work at Port Talbot's steelworks.
Now Kieran, 18, is doing an apprenticeship with Tata Steel, which has announced 2,800 jobs cuts, with most expected to be in Port Talbot.
He said he's worried for the community but still optimistic there will be job opportunities at the site.
The chairman of the Swansea Bay City region urged young people to ""stick with us"" despite ""devastating"" cuts.
Kieran has already spent a short time working at the coke ovens at Tata, which he ""really enjoyed"", before he started his mechanical engineering apprenticeship.
He's following in the footsteps of several family members including his father and uncle. ""It's been in my family the whole time I've known,"" he said.
He said the news about job losses was ""very nerve wracking"" and a huge blow to the area.
However, due to his non-production apprenticeship, he hopes his role will not be affected by the announced cuts.
""I'm quite optimistic that with the community, we can pull through the hard times and hopefully see out the brighter side when we can produce green steel and everybody can have a job,"" he said.
Jay Morris, 18, from Neath, like Kieran, is in the first year of a four year apprenticeship with Tata.
He understands the concern of workers fearing for their jobs but he thinks their skills will be in demand elsewhere.
""I think that even if jobs do go, there will be other roles for those employees to fill,"" he said.
Long term, he would like to work as an engineer at the Tata plant, where two new arc furnaces are set to be installed.
The planned electric arc furnace will produce steel in a greener way and will mean many roles are retained on site - little comfort for those who fear their jobs will go when the current blast furnaces are shut down.
Kathryn Dunstan, of NPTC Colleges, said there was a ""flurry of excitement"" when Tata released its apprentice applications.
""Our students see it as an opportunity. They aspire to work at Tata Steel, they see it as secure employment with good opportunities and good prospects,"" she said.
She said the news about the site was ""certainly worrying"" but said there was a range of ""exciting initiatives"" in Neath Port Talbot including a Global Centre for Rail Excellence and plan for offshore wind generation.
Ms Dunstan said it was up to government at all levels, as well as colleges and training providers, ""to make sure that there are employment opportunities for young people"".
And developing the area's economy is a core purpose of the Swansea Bay City Region - its plans now badly hit by the ""devastating"" news about steel jobs, according to its chairman Rob Stewart.
""It's really undermining the efforts that we have to create quality jobs in south Wales,"" said Mr Stewart, who is also leader of Swansea council.
""There are now going to be limitations to what you can do in the steel industry because of the decisions made,"" he said, addressing young people hopeful of finding work.
""I hope that we can reverse them, but there are going to be other opportunities coming along through the economy we're creating in south Wales.
""As those opportunities come along stick with us, look at the careers you could potentially have in the area and we'll support you to pursue those careers in this region.""

7L8JC7OR1R_2TKXQOO0G6TNUQ6,How old is too old to join Ireland's police force?,Eimear Flanagan,21 January 2024,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c14yk47829qo,"An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na previously would not accept recruits over the age of 35
At a glance
Ireland's police force has raised its maximum age limit for recruits to 50
An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, which needs 1,000 new officers to tackle staff shortages, recently lost an age discrimination case brought by two men who were too old to apply
Forces such as the Police Service of Northern Ireland and Metropolitan Police already allow candidates in their 50s to apply
However, a leading member of an officer organisation says he does not believe the move will solve recruitment issues
The Irish police force, An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, announced this week it is raising its upper age limit for recruits from 35 to 50.
People on the cusp of half a century can now compete for a place at the Garda College, alongside candidates as young as 18.
It follows a legal case taken by two men who successfully claimed they were victims of age discrimination as they could not apply to join after the age of 35.
But the rule change also comes amid an ongoing police shortage -  the force recently failed to meet a workforce target of 15,000 officers by 2021.
Its current membership is just more than 1,000 short of that target.
The move has faced opposition in the past, notably from the head of An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, Commissioner Drew Harris, who argued the age limit was necessary to ensure officers are physically able for the job.
However, the low cut-off point was out of step with other nearby forces - the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) accepts applications from candidates up to 57, while the Metropolitan Police's age limit is also ""typically"" 57.
Police Scotland has no upper age limit., external
Having recently celebrated his 50th birthday, County Donegal Garda (police officer) Brendan O'Connor would now be too old to apply for the job he has held since he was 24.
Brendan O'Connor works in the seaside town of Dunfanaghy, County Donegal
As well as being a front-line officer in Dunfanaghy, he is also president of the Garda Representatives Association (GRA), a union-like organisation which promotes the interests of rank-and-file officers.
Mr O'Connor told BBC News NI he does not object to widening the recruitment age bracket, but argued it will not fix staff shortages.
""We don't believe there's a pool of people in that age group who would be in a position financially, or with family commitments, to take that option,"" he said.
""Of course, anyone who meets the criteria and can do the job will be welcome, but we don't believe it's going to be any significant part of the solution to the problems we face.""
He explained officer numbers are being depleted by early retirements and ""an unprecedented level of resignations"".
The GRA president believes money will be the biggest deciding factor in how many middle-aged candidates apply.
""We imagine that most people in that age bracket may have financial commitments, may have dependents, may have mortgages, and will possibly be be seeing a significant drop in their income if they were to start training.""
The starting salary for a newly qualified garda is just over â¬35,000 (Â£30,000) in a  country with extremely high housing costs.
Recruits must also spend their first 36 weeks in the Garda College on a training allowance of â¬305 (Â£262) a week, well below minimum wage levels.
Justice Minister Helen McEntee said this ""significantly increased"", external payment followed the government's allocation of â¬2.3bn (Â£2bn) to the force for 2024 - its highest ever annual budget.
Minister Helen McEntee raised the training allowance from â¬184 to â¬305 a week
She added the age limit change would open policing ""to a new cohort of people who will bring a range of different life and career experiences to the table"".
But Mr O'Connor said the â¬305 allowance was ""wholly inadequate,"" and a ""paltry sum for anyone to try to exist on with the cost-of-living crisis"".
In terms of the age limit, the GRA president accepts it is ""part of the inevitable evolution of the workplace"".
He also believes it may be linked to the successful age discrimination challenge.
That long-running battle was fought by Ronald Boyle, who was 48 when he sought to join the gardaÃ­ in 2005, and Brian Fitzpatrick who was 37 when he wanted to apply in 2007.
The pair won their case in 2020, external when the Workplace Relations Commission ruled they had been discriminated against on age grounds.
That ruling was appealed by the Department of Justice and the Garda Commissioner but that was rejected last year, external.
Mr Harris had defended the age limit of 35 as ""essential"", telling the Labour Court gardaÃ­ needed operational resilience to protect the people of Ireland.
He listed several duties requiring a high level of physical agility, pointing out the force is responsible for national security, counter terrorism and major crime investigation.
Garda Commissioner Drew Harris had previously argued against older recruits
The commissioner said officers required the stamina to be as alert at the end of a shift as they are at the start.
But Mr Boyle told the Labour Court he was still physically fit - one of his jobs was as a swimming instructor.
The court ruled in the men's favour, saying the age limit of 35 was ""not appropriate or necessary"".
But fitness is still essential for all front-line officers who may have to chase down suspects or quell a riot like the one that erupted in Dublin last November.
Under the new Garda regime, middle-aged recruits must pass a physical fitness test alongside their teenage competitors.
However, the tests are adjusted based on age and gender.
Last year's riot saw the biggest ever deployment of public order-trained gardaÃ­
As Mr O'Connor points out there are ""lots and lots of gardaÃ­ in their 50s being very effective"" in their roles.
""Fifty-year-olds can do the job - I'd like to think I can do the job,"" he said.
""I mean, it's getting more and more challenging the older you get - shift work and stuff like that.
""But individuals look after themselves, have good health and certainly there's nothing prohibiting a 50-year-old from doing the job.""
He also acknowledged older recruits could bring ""a wealth of experience"" to the GardaÃ­, as they already do in other forces.
""Only time will tell whether this will make any difference, but we don't believe it's the solution to our current recruitment and retention crisis,"" he added."

Wicken Fen has been ""a mecca for local naturalists"" because it is one of Cambridgeshire's last pieces of undrained fen, the charity said.
The first two acres (0.8ha) of land were bought in 1899. The reserve now extends across 2,053 acres (830ha).
The trust's Isabel Sedgwick an ""anniversary programme of events and activities"" will begin in May.
Countryside manager Alan Kell said Wicken Fen was now the most species-rich area of the UK.
""The National Trust was set up to protect natural and historic places and we've got one of the last remaining fragments of undrained fenland here,"" Mr Kell said.
""This is huge historically, but it is also one of the most scarce habitats [in the UK], so it is about protecting and expanding it.""
The area makes up less than 1% of the original fenland that dominated the east of England back in the 17th Century.
From then onwards, the wetland habitat was drained by wealthy merchant and landowning investors, who wanted to unlock the peat soils for cultivation.
Wicken Fen offered 19th Century botanists and entomologists rare access to what little remained of its original, diverse habitat, and it became ""a mecca for local naturalists"", said Mr Kell.
Some sold or gifted their land to the National Trust shortly after it was set up in 1895.
The trust has more than doubled the size of the reserve since 1999, as part of the Wicken Fen Vision, which is marking its 25th anniversary.
Mr Kell said: ""This is a natural process-led management system, which has led us to be one of the front-runners in conservation.""
Former agricultural land has been restored into a variety of wetland habitats, aided by hardy cattle and a herd of Konik ponies.
The reserve was registered as the most species-rich area of the UK in 2019, with more than 9,300 animals recorded.
This included 188 endangered species such as the bittern, marsh harrier, great crested newt and the tiny soprano pipistrelle bat.
Ms Sedgwick, the trust's visitor operations and experience manager, said: ""We're very much looking forward to our anniversary programme of events and activities kicking off in May to celebrate this milestone. There will be plenty for visitors to see, do and take part in.""

8FTYXUGQXJ_VMWWOY0LWTILO2S,Was Sturgeon just following WhatsApp guidelines by hitting delete?,By David Wallace Lockhart,1 day ago,20230121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-68049189,"Questions about Scottish government WhatsApps from the pandemic era have rumbled on for months.
There have been claims that some messages were handed over too slowly, and even accusations of exchanges being deleted.
Right now, the figure in the spotlight is Nicola Sturgeon.
Last week the counsel to the UK Covid Inquiry said the former first minister appeared to ""have retained no messages whatsoever"" from the pandemic.
In a statement issued yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon said messages communicated through ""informal means"" were handed to the inquiry last year.
She conceded that messages had not been ""retained"" on her own device, but said she had obtained copies which she'd passed over.
Ms Sturgeon stressed that she acted in line with Scottish government policy.
This has prompted some to ask how guidance can have been followed if messages were not kept on the former first minister's phone.
Here things get a bit complicated. Government guidelines in this area are complex.
The Scottish government brought in new mobile messaging guidance in November 2021 - in the midst of the pandemic. This spells out how ministers should approach informal messaging systems, such as WhatsApp.
Officials and ministers are allowed to use these apps to conduct business, with the guidance stating ""you must transcribe the salient points of any business discussions and/or decisions in a mobile messaging app into an email or text document"". This should then be saved centrally.
In other words, you can make decisions and have government discussions on WhatsApp, provided you then copy that information and save it.
This will then be stored exactly as official minutes, records etc would be. Crucially, it will be accessible to the public under Freedom of Information laws.
Once this has all been done, the guidance states ""you must delete business conversations in the mobile messaging app"".
So the Scottish government policy therefore actively encourages the deletion of conversations on apps like WhatsApp.
The thinking is that the relevant information has now been saved centrally, and so it's safe to get rid of the original conversation.
What's the logic here? Well, bearing in mind phones can be lost or stolen, you could make the argument that it's sensible to regularly clear them of government conversations.
This potentially explains how Nicola Sturgeon can say she hasn't retained messages on her own device, but was able to submit ""copies"" to the inquiry.
This could also explain her statement - issued on social media yesterday - that she has always ""acted in line with Scottish government policy"".
Though there are still important questions to be asked about all of this.
Why does there appear to be a difference in how ministers have approached retaining messages? Humza Yousaf insists he kept all of his from the pandemic. As does the former Finance Secretary Kate Forbes.
The explanation for this may be that this guidance isâ¦ guidance. It's not hard and fast rules, and therefore some ministers may have taken a different approach.
Many will also question guidance that essentially allows ministers and officials to mark their own homework.
After all, it looks like it's left up to them to determine which messages are relevant and should be saved for posterity, and which should be chucked into a digital wastebasket, never to be seen again.
And some would say that a looming public inquiry should have led to all ministers keeping everything on their phones intact.
As this guidance is put under the spotlight, it's likely that opposition politicians will question how fit for purpose it is.
When it comes to how civil servants and ministers interpreted all of this, and how assiduously they followed it, that's something known only to each individual.
Nicola Sturgeon will get the opportunity to spell all of this out when she appears in front of the UK Covid Inquiry in the coming weeks."
9USGDWQ2DT_KM93WV1YP8QHF0I,Yousaf offers talks with 'next prime minister' Starmer,_,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-68046866,"This video can not be played
Humza Yousaf said he is open to working with Labour should they win the general election - subject to certain conditions.
Scotland's First Minister Humza Yousaf has offered to hold talks with Sir Keir Starmer about working together if Labour win the next general election.
The SNP leader said he was ""absolutely sure"" that his party would win the most seats in Scotland and it was inevitable that Sir Keir would be prime minister.
He said he was ""very willing"" to work with a Labour government and had invited Sir Keir to Edinburgh.
Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar described his election plan as bizarre.
Mr Yousaf told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show: ""I think there's plenty we can work on.
""There'll be disagreements, the constitution perhaps being the obvious one, but I do think there's plenty of areas we could work on.""
When asked about what policy areas they could co-operate on, the SNP leader said Labour should and commit to scrapping the two-child benefit limit.
""In doing so, he would lift 250,000 children out of poverty across the UK, 15,000 children here in Scotland,"" said Mr Yousaf.
""Let's scrap the bedroom tax, which is keeping too many people in poverty.""
The first minister said Sir Keir was ""20 to 25% ahead in the polls"" and that he ""does not need Scotland to win"".
He insisted that the only way to ""wipe the Tories off the map"" in Scotland was for voters to back the SNP.
And he insisted that ""support for independence is absolutely rock solid"".
Ten years on from the Scottish independence referendum, Laura Kuenssberg asked Mr Yousaf if he accepted another vote was not going to happen any time soon.
The first minister denied that and said: ""I want the SNP to win the general election to help to send a really strong message to Westminster that Scotland will not be ignored.""
Mr Yousaf, who succeeded Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader and Scotland's first minister in March 2023, also defended Scotland's ""progressive"" tax system, despite Conservative claims that many Scots are now paying more than people in the rest of the UK
He said the SNP was asking the top 5% of earners ""to pay a little more"" so that policies such as free university education and childcare services could be provided.
Mr Yousaf said he believed people ""will recognise that we've prioritised public services over tax cuts for the wealthy"".
The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, hit back at what he called the SNP's ""completely chaotic messaging"" on voting in the upcoming election.
Speaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, he said: ""They seem to have gone in a matter of weeks from saying you don't need to vote Labour because they can't win in England to now saying you don't need to vote for Labour because they can't lose in England.
""Polls are going to narrow, polls are going to tighten. We could be months away from an election. That's what happens in an election campaign, is that the argument gets more face to face.
""We should always believe we can still lose and we should also always believe that we don't own any voters.
""How bizarre that you have the SNP saying that Scottish votes don't matter. Every Scottish vote matters.""
Scottish Conservative party chairman Craig Hoy said:  ""This was another interview where Humza Yousaf confirmed independence will be page one, line one of the SNP manifesto.
""Instead of pursuing their obsession with breaking up the UK, the SNP should focus on the people's real priorities: growing the economy to help Scotland's ailing public services.
""The first minister once again refused to accept that his high-tax regime is preventing that - despite business groups warning repeatedly that the widening tax gap with the rest of the UK is deeply damaging our competitiveness and risks driving away key workers."""
A1M3O95XB7_Y7KMUNJJ1COXGO1,Birmingham teenager Muhammad Hassam Ali killed in a case of 'mistaken identity',By Riyah Collins,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-68051425,"A teenager was stabbed to death in a case of mistaken identity, detectives believe.
Muhammad Hassam Ali, 17, was attacked in Birmingham city centre at about 15:30 GMT on Saturday and later died from his injuries.
West Midlands Police have launched a manhunt to find Muhammad's killer and have renewed an appeal for information.
The force said the attack, which happened in Victoria Square, is not thought to be gang-related.
Victoria Square is one of the largest pedestrian areas of the city, next to the Council House and the Town Hall and near shops and bars.
Muhammad was rushed to hospital after the attack and was later pronounced dead.
""This is a tragic case of a young man being killed in what appears to be a case of mistaken identity,"" Det Insp Michelle Thurgood said.
She said officers were still trying to establish a motive and wished to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time of the attack and might have taken photos or videos.
""If you were walking through the area at the time, or a visitor who may have been taking pictures by The River statue near the Council House, we would like to hear from you as you may have vital information or evidence,"" she said.

AMAXHAR1CC_1Q8MRI7C59TXHJN,Ugandan internet propaganda network exposed by the BBC,By Marco Silva,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67803493,"A BBC investigation has uncovered a network of fake social media accounts in Uganda. Under false identities, they spread pro-government messaging and target critics with threats. But who are the people behind it?
It is not every day that you get to take a selfie with the long-serving President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni. When the opportunity arose, Dr Jamechia Hoyle went for it.
She is a senior consultant in the United States, focused on global health security. Back in October 2017, she had travelled to the Ugandan capital, Kampala, to attend an international conference.
Mr Museveni was there to welcome his foreign guests.
Making her way through the crowds, Dr Hoyle approached him, smartphone in hand. ""He was really happy to engage with us and take the picture,"" she recalls.
Seeing a broad-smiling Dr Hoyle and the president, surrounded by smiling faces trying to get in the shot, photographers couldn't resist - and they too captured that image.
Four years later, this exact photo would be used to create a fake social media account aimed at spreading state propaganda and targeting government critics.
Dr Hoyle only recently found out about it, after the BBC got in touch with her.
""Seeing my own picture and then understanding the context of some of the things that were shared... I couldn't believe it,"" she says. ""I was truly taken aback.""
Listen to BBC Trending: Crude fakes in Uganda on BBC Sounds.
The fake account using Dr Hoyle's photo was created on X, then called Twitter, in October 2021.
From early on, it appeared to have no interests outside Ugandan politics, regularly posting in praise of the Ugandan government and its policies.
Much harsher words - including occasional threats - were directed at opposition supporters and government critics.
""We know you support terrorist activities"", the account posted without presenting any evidence, in response to a tweet from opposition leader Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi.
""You will die"", read a separate tweet directed at Hillary Innocent Taylor Seguya, a Ugandan climate activist based in the US and a member of Mr Wine's party, the National Unity Platform.
On social media, Mr Seguya has become known for his criticism of one of Uganda's flagship projects: the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP).
When finished, the $3.5bn (Â£2.7bn) pipeline will connect Uganda's oil fields to Tanzania's port of Tanga, along a 1,445km (898 mile) route.
Supporters of the project say it will create thousands of jobs and generate millions in oil revenue.
But critics have argued that EACOP could prove disruptive for local communities, while having a significant impact on the environment.
""Trolls keep coming for me on a daily basis,"" he says. ""They keep labelling me as the enemy of progress in Uganda and Africa. Sometimes they call me a 'US-backed puppet' or a sell-out.""
The account belonging to ""fake Jamechia"" was just one of dozens attacking, harassing, and at times threatening Mr Seguya.
But, on closer inspection, the profiles all bore striking similarities to each other.
They all claimed to be Ugandan citizens - often women - whose accounts appeared to have the sole purpose of posting praise for the president and pushing back against critics.
The Ugandan Media Centre, which handles public communications on behalf of the government, did not respond to our requests for comment.
By analysing those accounts' behaviour, BBC Verify was able to map out a network of nearly 200 fake social media accounts operating on X and on Facebook (even though the latter has been blocked in Uganda since 2021).
The vast majority of these accounts used stolen images as profile pictures - often social media photos of models, influencers, and actresses from across the world. But none of the usernames used by them appeared to be linked to real individuals in Uganda or Tanzania.
These accounts often posted the same content within minutes of each other. By looking at the dates when they were created, we also found that many had been set up on the very same day.
This suggests that, while they may look like separate accounts, they have been working together.
It is unclear how successful this network may have been in actually shifting people's views of the government, as very few of its posts earned large numbers of likes, comments, or shares.
For all its sophistication, could this network be failing to fulfil its mission then? Not quite, experts say.
""[Their] goal can be to push the message out there - whether or not people engage with it is kind of irrelevant, as long as people have seen it,"" says Tessa Knight, a research associate for the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab who investigates disinformation.
Contacted by the BBC, Meta removed most of the Facebook accounts we identified.
Meta believes that individuals linked to the Government Citizen Interaction Centre (GCIC) - a Ugandan government agency - may have been running several of the accounts it removed.
The company did not share the evidence it said it held to back this assertion. And, as a result, the BBC has not been able to independently verify it.
But, in a statement, the GCIC denied this allegation, saying that agency accounts ""are not operating on Facebook"".
And yet, it is not the first time the agency has been accused of running what Meta describes as ""influence operations"": in 2021, Facebook's parent company took action against hundreds of accounts it said were linked to the GCIC.
X did not reply to our requests for comment and the platform took no action against any of the accounts identified by the BBC's investigation.
Asked whether it recognised any of the accounts on X, the GCIC said: ""we recognise the accounts of our staff whose terms of reference include disseminating factual information about government programmes. We are only aware and responsible for accounts of our staff meant for work.""
The GCIC did not respond to follow-up questions attempting to clarify whether the accounts identified were indeed run by state employees.
Mr Seguya says he is ""not surprised"" by the existence of this network, but he urges whoever is behind it to consider the human cost of their campaign against critics.
""They may not know the negative impacts they are creating on someone's mental health by sending out such threats to people like me and different activists.
""Let them not silence dissent. Dissent is democracy.""

C0G8Q6YNQ6_P3PXBAMZDI366UH,"More than 25,000 now killed in Gaza since Israel offensive began, Hamas-run health ministry says",By Mark Lowen,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68050172,"More than 25,000 people have now been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive there, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
It said there had been 178 deaths in the last 24 hours, making it one of the deadliest days in the war so far.
As fighting continued, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rejected creating a Palestinian state.
The White House has said the US and Israel ""clearly see things differently"" when it comes to a two-state solution.
Israel began its offensive following the 7 October attack in which Hamas fighters killed 1,300 people in southern Israel and took more than 240 hostage.
In its first public account of the October assault, published on Sunday, Hamas described it as a ""necessary step"" against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.
Israel's air and ground operation is currently focusing on southern Gaza, where the military are convinced top Hamas commanders are holed up in, or beneath, the city of Khan Younis.
That is where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had discovered another tunnel, some 830m (2,700ft) long and containing booby-traps and blast doors.
The IDF footage showed what appeared to be a tunnel with mattresses and cells inside - it is where Israel believes around 20 hostages, including children, were held at various points. None were found when the tunnel was discovered, though.
Israeli soldiers have also faced renewed attacks in the north of the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is said to have seized an opening around the town of Jabalia as Israel moved troops and tanks south.
More than three months since the conflict erupted, Israel - whose army far outstrips Hamas's capabilities - is still facing significant resistance across Gaza.
US intelligence agencies reportedly estimate that the Israeli military has killed 20-30% of Hamas fighters, which falls far short of Mr Netanyahu's stated aim of ""completely destroying"" the armed group.
The classified report is also said to have found that Hamas still has enough munitions to continue striking Israel and Israeli forces for months, raising the spectre of a prolonged war in which Israel could get bogged down.
The apparent slow progress, the fact no top Hamas commander has yet been captured or killed, and the collective trauma over the 130 or so Israeli hostages still missing, is prompting growing anti-government anger in Israel.
Protests are continuing by relatives of those still held by Hamas, calling for Mr Netanyahu to prioritise their release over the potentially impossible aim of destroying Hamas. And a still relatively small anti-war movement is also demonstrating, horrified by the damage wrought on Gaza - one of the most intense and destructive military campaigns in recent history.
Most Israelis have rallied around their flag - but not around their prime minister, who, according to a recent poll, only 15% of the public believe should stay in office once the war ends.
How it does end is the subject of growing disagreement between Mr Netanyahu and Israel's western allies. After speaking to US President Joe Biden for the first time in almost a month, the Israeli prime minister reiterated his rejection of a future Palestinian state.
In a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said Israel must retain ""security control over the entire area west of [River] Jordan"", which also encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank territory.
Mr Netanyahu has been fiercely opposed to a Palestinian state throughout his political career. But by repeatedly asserting it now, an increasingly unpopular prime minister appears to be doubling down on a view that he feels chimes with the majority opinion in a nation too horrified by the attacks to countenance an independent Palestinian state.
His apparent fight for political survival is clashing with exasperated Israeli allies, who hope that the current bloodshed could force both sides into meaningful diplomacy over a sustainable two-state solution.
UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC earlier that Mr Netanyahu's stance was ""disappointing"". The White House has said the US and Israel ""clearly see things differently"".
Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, went further, calling the refusal to accept a Palestinian state ""completely unacceptable"". He added it ""would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security"".

D7CAL5K519_KYD149ZUOJ9INGK,Speculation over Bronson Battersby death 'unhelpful',By Tim Iredale,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-68035493,"Speculation over the deaths of a toddler and his father in Skegness is ""unhelpful"", Lincolnshire's police and crime commissioner has said.
Bronson Battersby, two, was found in the house in Skegness with 60-year-old Kenneth Battersby on 9 January.
It is believed Bronson starved to death after his dad had a heart attack.
Speaking to BBC Politics North, Marc Jones said the fact that the matter was being investigated did not mean any ""wrongdoing"" had taken place.
A ""rapid review"" into the involvement of social services is being carried out by Lincolnshire County Council and the police watchdog is investigating whether there were ""missed opportunities"" to check on Bronson and his father.
Mr Jones said his heart went out to anyone who had been affected by what happened.
""It is just an incredibly difficult story to hear,"" he said.
However, Mr Jones said: ""It's absolutely right that such tragic incidents are looked into thoroughly, and we are going to see that with the review and the investigation.
""The fact that they have happened does not mean any wrongdoing.
""We need to bear that in mind - so speculation is unhelpful at this point.""
Asked about whether he believed there were missed opportunities, he replied: ""What I do know is all the agencies involved take child protection exceedingly seriously, in this case and in every other case.
""We can't speculate on whether anything went wrong that could have been prevented.""
He said police would follow the law with regard to entering a property and there were certain circumstances where this would be appropriate.
However, he added: ""As we've heard [in this case] entry was gained by a social worker using a key.
""I don't think we should speculate about whether forced entry would have been the right route.""
On the subject of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation, he said: ""You would hope they would treat this with some expediency, but nevertheless they need to do a proper and thorough job.""
Previously, Lincolnshire Police's Deputy Chief Constable Julia Debenham said: ""What I would like to make clear is that we did respond to information supplied to us, but for reasons of transparency we have also referred the case to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.
""This is standard procedure and they will be undertaking their own independent investigation.
""Any speculation around the exact actions of any agencies involved at this stage is premature, though I do understand why our communities want answers as soon as possible.""

A man convicted in France of murdering French television producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier in the Republic of Ireland in 1996 has died.
Former journalist Ian Bailey, 66, who was originally from Manchester, died after he collapsed at home in west Cork on Sunday.
He had a severe heart condition and had been a candidate for surgery.
His solicitor Frank Buttimer, who has known Bailey since March 1997, said he was ""very upset"" to hear of his death.
""I knew Ian was very unwell. We were in communication in the past five days, but I didn't know he was terminally unwell,"" he told the PA news agency.
Sophie Toscan du Plantier was killed while holidaying in west Cork in 1996
Ms Toscan du Plantier's badly beaten body was discovered by neighbours in a laneway near her holiday home in Schull, County Cork, on 23 December 1996.
Nobody has ever been charged in Ireland in connection with the 39-year-old's death.
Bailey, who lived two miles away, was twice arrested for questioning by gardaÃ­ (Irish police) but released without charge.
The murder, and subsequent investigation, has received significant media attention in the years following Ms Toscan du Plantier's death, becoming a notorious and protracted case of unsolved murder.
In May 2019, a court in Paris convicted Bailey in absentia for the murder. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
He denied any involvement in Ms Toscan du Plantier's murder and, as he was not present in court for the French proceedings, he could not appeal the verdict.
Ireland's High Court blocked his extradition to France, where the law allows suspects to be tried for murdering French citizens abroad, on multiple occasions.

FAH408MEPD_KMUFQ7RPG8UDWTB,Storm Isha: Flood alerts across Wales as 90mph winds hit,By James McCarthy & Catherine Evans,12 hours ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-68049810,"There are flood alerts across Wales after Storm Isha arrived on Sunday, leaving hundreds of homes without power.
A gust of 90mph (144km/h) was recorded on Capel Curig, in Eryri, also known as Snowdonia, with 89mph (143km/h) recorded at Aberdaron, Gwynedd.
A yellow wind warning covering the whole of the UK was in place until midday on Monday.
An amber wind warning, which covered all of Wales, has now been lifted.
SP Energy Networks said 19,500 homes in north and mid Wales had lost power since the start of the storm, with supply restored to all but 200 by Monday evening.
About 200 homes in south Wales were also without power on Monday morning, according to the National Grid.
Natural Resources Wales (NRW) issued a number of flood alerts across Wales.
Speaking to Radio Wales Breakfast, NRW's Dylan Williams said: ""What we would urge people to do is keep vigilant and look at our website for updates. ""A lot of this happened through the night, so today we will be assessing the damage.""
Fire services were called to multiple incidents overnight, with isolated flooding in Ystrad Mynach and Blackwood in Caerphilly.
There were also reports of people caught in floodwater at Capel Curig and Betws y Coed in Gwynedd.
The coastguard asked people to take care by the coast.
""Keep away from cliffs, watch out for tidal surges, and steer clear of big waves,"" it said.
There has been widespread travel disruption, with numerous road closures and flight cancellations.
BBC presenter Jennifer Jones described a ""hair-raising"" experience when a plane she was travelling on from Geneva attempted to land at Bristol Airport on Sunday evening.
""It was incredibly turbulent and the plane was lurching from side to side and it was pretty harrowing, I have to say,"" she told Radio Wales Breakfast.
Ms Jones described how she ""burst into tears"" when the plane eventually landed in Edinburgh after the Bristol landing was aborted.
""When we landed, everyone on board just burst into applause and my friends and I just burst into tears. It sounds dramatic but I was thinking of my husband and my children. It was pretty hair-raising.""
The Met office said the disruption would continue throughout Monday morning.
""Some damage to buildings, such as tiles blown from roofs, could happen,"" the forecaster said.
""Injuries and danger to life from flying debris are possible.
""Power cuts may occur, with the potential to affect other services, such as mobile phone coverage.
""Injuries and danger to life could occur from large waves and beach material being thrown onto sea fronts, coastal roads and properties.""

HKW78A5LKH_970SKT7H3HZM5EV,Earthâs earliest creatures dated from Welsh rocks,By Gavin Thomas,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-68005838,"Welsh rocks have revealed details about some of Earth's earliest creatures.
Fossils first discovered in Carmarthenshire in the 1970s revealed traces of organisms that have now been dated to 564 million years ago.
The ancient disc-shaped invertebrates probably lived in shallow waters along the coast of volcanic islands.
Researchers say the organisms - too primitive to be described as animals - are ""completely unlike any other forms of life"".
The research findings, which have taken decades to complete, have been published in the scientific Journal of the Geological Society.
The fossils were first discovered in 1977 at a quarry near the village of Llangynog, Carmarthenshire, by Prof John Cope.
They were quickly identified as being exceptionally old and important, but Prof Cope said he waited decades to find out their exact age, which hampered further research.
The breakthrough came when a method, which measures radioactive decay, dated the fossils to 564 million years ago, plus or minus 700,000 years.
They come from the Ediacaran period, when the first multi-cellular organisms - meaning organisms made up of multiple cells - existed on Earth.
Prof Cope, from Swansea, said of the organisms: ""They are multi-cellular but we just don't know what they were. They are completely unlike any other forms of life.
""We've known for a long time that these fossils were the oldest in Wales and then, in 2000, a scientist who had been working in Newfoundland on similar fossils looked at them and said 'they're exactly the same'.""
During the Ediacaran period, Wales was part of a micro-continent that geologists called Avalonia.
Newfoundland, in Canada, would have been a neighbouring area.
Over hundreds of millions of years, the creation of the Atlantic Ocean split Wales and eastern Newfoundland thousands of miles apart.
The breakthrough in dating the fossils was due to the work of the lead author of the paper, Pembrokeshire-born PhD student Tony Clarke, who has been working on radiometric dating at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia.
Mr Clarke has also dated some of the rocks that became the megaliths of Stonehenge.
As a co-author of the paper, Prof Cope, formerly of Cardiff University and now a research associate at Bristol University, said the work had been a major breakthrough.
""These dating techniques have improved so much over the years and they are now so accurate,"" he said.
The Llangynog fossils are held at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff.

KDYA32520Y_QBMSH3GZHPMU0BH,Israel-Gaza: Netanyahu defies Biden over Palestinian state,"By Mark Lowen, in Jerusalem, and Sean Seddon",1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68045247,"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again rejected the idea of creating a Palestinian state.
His comments came hours after a phone call with US President Joe Biden after which the US leader indicated Mr Netanyahu may still accept the idea.
Mr Netanyahu's remarks appeared to deepen a public divide with the US.
The US believes a Palestinian state alongside Israel - known as a ""two-state solution"" - is vital for long-term stability.
But the White House acknowledged this week the US and Israeli governments ""clearly see things differently"".
Speaking to reporters after the two leaders held a call for the first time in almost a month, Mr Biden insisted a two-state solution was still possible with Mr Netanyahu in office.
""There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that... don't have their own militaries,"" he said.
But on Saturday Mr Netanyahu doubled down on his position, which he has held for much of his political career and repeated earlier this week.
A statement released by his office read: ""In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.""
Also on Saturday, in a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said Israel must retain ""security control over the entire area west of [River] Jordan"", an area which also encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank territory.
UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said on Sunday that Mr Netanyahu's statement was ""disappointing"", even though it was not a surprise.
The comments will dampen hopes in some circles that the Gaza crisis could result in Israeli and Palestinian leaders restarting diplomatic negotiations and kickstarting the dormant peace process.
Mr Netanyahu's increasing isolation abroad comes amid continuing support for the war at home, coupled with protests over the fate of the estimated 130 hostages still being held inside Gaza by Hamas.
Hamas killed about 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took 240 hostages in their surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October.
Thousands of protesters, including relatives of those still missing, gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday, urging Mr Netanyahu to reach a truce to allow the hostages home.
Gil Dickmann, whose cousin was captured on 7 October, said: ""Dear Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we believe that you can bring them back. We believe in you.
""We know that you can sign this deal and bring about this victory to all the citizens of Israel. Just do it, Bibi. Just do it. Bring the hostages back home.""
Israeli forces have continued to push into southern Gaza, saying they are searching for top Hamas officials they believe are hiding in Khan Younis, the Strip's second biggest city.
The Israel Defense Forces said they had raided a tunnel in Khan Younis that had been used to hold hostages, although they were not there when it was discovered.
While the focus of the fighting is now in southern Gaza, there have been renewed clashes around the northern town of Jabalia, as Palestinian fighters reportedly advanced while Israel tried to move its soldiers and tanks south.
Almost three months since Israel launched its ground invasion of Gaza, its army - vastly superior to Hamas in strength and equipment - is still facing significant resistance across the territory.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that 25,105 people had been killed in the territory since 7 October. More than 60,000 had also been injured, it said.

LRDWTWXY5J_YTWMNHUZMDSKMY9,Gut health: Goat milk firm's poo post box tests microbiome,By Dafydd Morgan,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-68047167,"A goat milk company is examining customers' gut health through its poo post-box scheme.
Ceredigion-based Chuckling Goat has gone from selling its goat milk-based Kefir to launching a microbiome test kit with the University of Cambridge.
""We basically examine everything that's going on inside the microbiome,"" said co-founder Shann Jones.
It comes as one industry expert claims Wales has a ""huge"" opportunity to grow into the Â£2.8bn health tech sector.
Ms Jones said that the ability to do a gut health test in ""the privacy and comfort of your own home has changed everything"".
Fermented foods, such as Kefir, contain a variety of ""good"" bacteria which, if they can survive the journey to our gut, can be beneficial for our health.
Ms Jones said the idea of gut health tests started when customers would ask her ask for solutions to medical problems, to which she was ""just having to guess"".
""When we saw that there was a microbiome test available that gave us an evidence based starting point to improve people's gut health, I was excited because I thought this is going to make my job a lot easier,"" she said.
The company, based in Brynhoffnant, Ceredigion, spent two years and Â£250,000 developing the microbiome test kit with the University of Cambridge.
Customers order the kit online and then send off a stool sample to the laboratories at the University of Cambridge.
""We give you answers about how you can improve your gut health from day one,"" Ms Jones added.
At Cambridge, the stool samples are analysed by Dr Anton Enright and his team of scientists, who work to discover what bacteria is living in each gut.
""We have a little poo post box... so the kits come in [and] the team will work through 20 or 30 samples and get to the bacterial DNA,"" he said.
After that is processed in a DNA sequencer, Dr Enright and his team are provided with ""lists of bacteria and how many times they've been seen"".
This data is then used by Chuckling Goat to determine what product they can recommend to help with any health issues their customers might be living with.
According to Dr Rhodri Griffiths from the Life Sciences Hub Wales, it will provide both economic and health benefits.
""Technologies are now coming into health and offer huge potential to be able to keep people more at home, to reduce the need for hospital care,"" he said.
""It's not only beneficial to the public's health. There's an economic benefit also, with the life sciences industry worth Â£2.8bn to the Welsh economy in 2022.
""This market is worth billions around the world and is growing every year. So there's an opportunity to be able to take technologies from elsewhere and adopt them within Wales.""

MTPKV6ZMKX_KG7N0E8FDZF22RW,Norwich: Post-mortems to take place after four bodies found,By Alex Pope & Mariam Issimdar,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-68046202,"Post-mortem examinations are due to take place later on a man and woman found dead along with two girls.
The family was discovered in a house in Costessey, near Norwich, at about 07:15 GMT on Friday.
Norfolk Police has referred itself to the independent watchdog, saying it did not respond to a 999 call from the home at 06:00.
Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said it was ""deeply worrying"" and welcomed the referral.
Officers said post-mortems would be held on Sunday to find the cause of the deaths of the man and woman.
The bodies of two young girls, a 36-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man, named locally as Bartlomiej Kuczynski, were found in the house on Allan Bedford Crescent.
Post-mortems on the two girls will take place on Wednesday.
Both attended local schools and head teachers at Queen's Hill Primary and Taverham High School have encouraged pupils to return to classrooms on Monday.
Dr Bianca Finger-Berry, critical incident specialist lead at Norfolk County Council, said: ""Normal routines with opportunities to access additional services can be really helpful.
""We are encouraging children and young people to be back in school tomorrow, where they will be able to receive emotional support from school staff and educational professionals.""
Police said a man and children lived at the address and the related visiting woman was not a permanent resident. The force said it was not looking for anyone else following the incident.
Patrols will continue in the area and the road by the home, on the Queen's Hills estate, remains closed while investigations continue.
Det Ch Insp Chris Burgess said: ""While I can confirm all four people were found with injuries, we will not be disclosing any further information until these examinations have taken place and the cause of death has been established.
""This is a tragic incident, distressing for all involved and it is clear from the reaction it's caused a lot of shock and upset in the local community.""
On Saturday the force said it had referred itself to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) for the second time.
The first referral was over a callout to the same house on 14 December as part of a missing persons inquiry. The force said that particular investigation would now be re-examined.
A second referral was made due to an emergency call being received from the house at 06:00 on Friday, to which officers were not deployed.
Labour MP, Ms Cooper, said it was right that the police had been referred for investigation on the 999 call that was not responded to.
""I do think there is a wider issue of the 999 response to particularly domestic abuse cases,"" she said.
She said if elected, Labour would ""put domestic abuse specialists into 999 control centres"" so they had the expertise ""to deal with difficult cases"".
Reverend James Pinto from St Helen's and St Edmond's churches in Costessey said it was a close-knit community that had been left in ""shock"".
""People are finding it hard to come to term with the news, they [the family] were known and people are finding it hard to digest and there's a real sense of shock and bewilderment,"" he said.
He said his two churches had opened on Saturday to provide people with an opportunity to come together, light a candle, pray, talk and support one another.
Emma Isaac lives on the estate and said what had happened was ""absolutely horrible"".
""You just wouldn't expect it around here, it's a very quiet estate. There are not words for it, I just can't believe it,"" she added.

NJOQJPAI31_YG8I2TPRE49TNP5,I'm working but homeless and bottom of the housing list,By Chris Clements,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-68033982,"Daniel Thomson is homeless and has been ""sofa surfing"" for four months.
He works 50 hours a week in a chip shop but can't find an affordable place to stay in his home city of Glasgow.
His only option for now, according to local housing groups, is a spell in one of the city's homeless hostels.
The 37-year-old is one of a growing number of people in Scotland described as suffering ""core homelessness"" - living in hostels, rough sleeping or staying with friends.
Homeless charity Crisis said this week that more than 18,400 households were in this position each day of 2022. It warned that number is expected to rise by a third by 2026.
Daniel - a father-of-one - was made homeless after a relationship breakdown last year.
He told BBC Scotland News he spends his days wondering where he will spend the night - either with friends or with his ex-partner.
""There is not a limit when you're desperate but it's embarrassing to ask to stay at someone's house for a night or two,"" he said.
""It's not good for your mental health either.""
Daniel cannot afford to save for a deposit on a privately rented flat, so his only chance of finding a place of his own is through his local authority.
Last year, he received a Schedule 5 referral from his council - where the authority instructs social landlords to find him accommodation.
But after approaching five local housing associations, he still hasn't been offered temporary accommodation.
Despite tests for ""priority need"" being abolished in 2012, he claims he was told his circumstances would have to change before he was likely to find a home.
Daniel said: ""The housing told me that because I don't have any disabilities, because I am working and because I don't have a drug habit, they can't help me.
""They said I'd be at the bottom of a list and that I'd stay there for a long, long time.""
He continued: ""The homeless team told me that they could put me into homeless accommodation for Â£100 a night, which obviously no-one can afford.
""They said I could build up a debt. I was thinking it was maybe going to be for a couple of days but they said, no, it could be for up to a year.
""How is anybody supposed to mentally go forward paying Â£100 a night, racking up a future debt, just to get a home with a housing association?""
It comes less than two months after the city became the third council in Scotland to declare a housing emergency.
Daniel was told there was available space in one of Glasgow city centre's bed-and-breakfasts.
Crisis said the use of homeless B&Bs in Scotland has risen by 124% since the Covid pandemic.
However, Glasgow City Council said last year it was planning on ""decommissioning"" the hotels as part of a Â£4.9m savings to its homelessness budget.
Meanwhile, campaigners raised concerns about the number of drug deaths in the city's hostels.
Daniel told BBC Scotland News that his own brother Gary died in homeless accommodation last July.
""It is not a place I want to go,"" he said.
""Plus the stories I have heard as well - there are a lot of drugs and drug dealing in those types of places and I don't want to be around that.
""I also wouldn't get to see my daughter if I was in a hostel.""
He continued: ""There is no priority for anybody that works. I was even told that I'll be at the bottom of that list and I'll stay there until my circumstances change.
""It upsets me to know that I am paying all that money to the government in taxes and here I am, walking the streets on my day off.
""I could be at home or warm in my bed but here I am, walking the streets and freezing.""
Daniel spoke as Crisis released the latest findings from its Homelessness Monitor this week.
The UK-wide study analyses homelessness trends across the country as well as the impact of housing policy.
In England, it found rough sleeping had increased 132% since 2010.
In Scotland, it suggested ""core homelessness"" happens at a lower rate but has risen 11% since 2020.
It is expected to rise by a further 33% due to a shortage in social housing, increasing private rent costs and cost of living pressures.
Meanwhile, the number of children in temporary accommodation has reached record levels in Scotland., while half of Scottish councils reported ""significant increases"" in footfall to homelessness services.
Dr Beth Watts-Cobbe, of Heriot-Watt University, said the rises were ""concerning"".
She continued: ""But while many of the trends revealed in the Monitor are worrying, the report also shows that projected rises in core homelessness can be prevented through a comprehensive response from policy-makers.
""Homelessness has been a major area of policy focus for the Scottish government since 2017 and with the right commitment Scotland can reverse these trends and reduce homelessness.""
The charity urged the Scottish government to allow people to ""get help up to six months before they are at risk of homelessness, while also introducing new legal duties requiring public services to play a greater role in preventing homelessness"".
The recommendations are expected to be included in the Scottish government's forthcoming Housing Bill, which is supported by Crisis and other charities.
Housing Minister Paul McLennan said the government had ""already committed to many of these measures in our homelessness strategy"".
He added: ""We are committed to reducing the number of households in temporary accommodation and we are acting on the recommendations of the expert temporary accommodation task and finish group.
""This includes investing at least Â£60m in 2023-24 as part of our Â£752m Affordable Housing Supply Programme to support a national acquisition plan.
""However, as the report notes, other changes which would make a significant difference are not within the powers of the Scottish government.
""The UK government should heed the calls from Crisis to increase Housing Benefit and other working age benefits. It is also concerning that another Local Housing Allowance freeze is on the horizon.""
A UK government spokesperson said it was spending Â£2bn on tackling rough sleeping in England.
She added: ""Our Single Homelessness Accommodation Programme is delivering up to 2,400 homes for rough sleepers by March 2025, and through our Rough Sleeping Strategy, we will continue to work to end rough sleeping completely.""

NLWGQ0XAYA_ML1OYR1FMG5BA4P,Australian Open 2024 results: Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka through in Melbourne,By Jonathan Jurejko,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/68041000,"Gauff has moved beyond the fourth round at the Australian Open for the first time
Australian Open 2024
Venue: Melbourne Park Dates: 14-28 January
Coverage: Commentary every day from 07:00 GMT on Tennis Breakfast on Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the BBC Sport website and app
Coco Gauff says she often forgets she is still a teenager after becoming the youngest woman to reach the Australian Open singles quarter-finals since 2008.
The 19-year-old American booked her spot in the last eight by sweeping past Poland's Magdalena Frech 6-1 6-2.
""I've lived so many lives in the last four years that I just feel older than 19,"" US Open champion Gauff said.
Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka continued her own serene progress by beating Amanda Anisimova 6-3 6-2.
Sabalenka will face ninth seed Barbora Krejcikova, who fought back to beat Mirra Andreeva 4-6 6-3 6-2 and end the 16-year-old's impressive run in Melbourne.
Gauff and 25-year-old Sabalenka remain on course to meet in the last four, which would give the Belarusian an opportunity to avenge her defeat in the US Open final.
After bursting on to the scene as a 15-year-old at Wimbledon in 2019, Gauff fulfilled her long-heralded potential by landing a first Grand Slam title in New York.
Now, in her final major tournament as a teenager, she is the second favourite at the Australian Open behind second seed Sabalenka.
""Sometimes I forget my age. I know I'm not going to be a teenager any more,"" said Gauff, who is the youngest player to reach the Melbourne quarter-finals since Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska.
""When I'm looking at the other girls on tour who are 16, 17, and now coming up, they just feel so young and I feel so old.
""I know I'm not that old, but I definitely do forget my age a lot.""
Gauff, who has not faced another seed, will play Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk next.
Djokovic drops just three games in ruthless thrashing
Seeded players have been falling quickly in the women's singles, with only four of the top 16 left after the first week and just seven remaining in total.
Belarusian Victoria Azarenka, seeded 18th, is the only Grand Slam champion left in the top half of the draw after world number one Iga Swiatek's shock third-round defeat on Saturday.
Gauff, 19, ensured she did not face the same fate with a clinical and composed performance against Frech, who was competing in the last 16 of a major for the first time.
The American broke serve in the first game on and allowed Frech to win just 10 more points in a 26-minute set.
Two more breaks of serve followed in the second set as Gauff breezed through without facing a break point.
In her first Melbourne quarter-final, she will face Kostyuk after the world number 37 easily beat Russian qualifier Maria Timofeeva 6-2 6-1.
Gauff said she was ""not too nervous"" to play in front of the great Rod Laver - because she was already well on the way to victory when the 11-time major champion arrived on the court named after him.
""Luckily I was up a lot when I noticed he came in,"" joked Gauff, who thanked the 85-year-old Australian for coming to her match.
Sabalenka beat Elena Rybakina in last year's final
Sabalenka has been in similarly devastating form, dropping just six games in her opening three matches, and produced another dominant display against 22-year-old Anisimova.
She had lost her four past meetings with the American but needed just 70 minutes to seal victory at Melbourne Park.
The 25-year-old has developed a new superstition this week - signing her fitness coach's head with a pen before each match.
""I did it before the first match,"" she said. ""Now it's a routine.
""Every time he's not super happy that I'm going to do that. He's like, 'OK, anything for the win'.""
Earlier in the week, Andreeva had brushed aside sixth seed Ons Jabeur for her first win against a top-10 player.
She followed that with an astonishing third-set comeback to beat France's Diane Parry to reach the fourth round.
However, the teenager met her match in former French Open champion Krejcikova, who broke twice in the deciding set and served out comfortably to reach her second Australian Open quarter-final.
But her impressive run has once again shown why is she is one of the sport's rising stars.
At last year's Australian Open she was playing in the girls' singles as a 15-year-old and reached the final before losing to friend and doubles partner Alina Korneeva.
Since then she has also reached the fourth round at Wimbledon and risen from 405th to 47th in the world rankings.

O0MLOVMYXE_0SQLNCSV3DO068P,"'Drugged, robbed, killed': The city catching US tourists in dating trap",_,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-68022288,"A series of mysterious deaths involving American men in Colombia has been linked to dating apps. Relatives of those killed are now searching for answers, writes Austin Landis in Medellin.
Tou Ger Xiong loved coming back to Colombia.
""He talked about the high spirited peopleâ¦ just enjoying life,"" his brother, Eh Xiong, told BBC News. ""He even picked up Spanish.
""It never, ever even crossed his mind that he would end up in a tragic incident this way.""
Tou Ger, 50, was a Hmong-American community activist and comedian from Minnesota. Prior to his most recent trip to Medellin, he had been speaking to a woman online.
A few weeks into his two-month visit, in mid-December, he called his brother and asked him for $2,000 but didn't say what it was for or that anything was wrong. Eh said he would transfer the money. He never heard from his brother again.
The next day, police found Tou Ger's body in a remote, wooded area of the city. A friend in Medellin explained to Eh that his brother had been kidnapped and held at gunpoint for the $2,000 ransom.
""I did not want to believe it. I didn't know if it was really happening,"" Eh said. ""My heart just sank.""
Eh scrambled to contact the US embassy, who confirmed it was his brother's body. Colombian police this week arrested a woman and two men linked to his death, charging them with kidnapping and murder.
It's not clear whether he first met the woman through a dating app or through friends. But his death is one of eight in Medellin that prompted a warning from the US embassy about the risks of using dating apps. All eight victims were Americans who died in suspicious circumstances in November and December.
The US state department said it was aware of a gang in the city that previously used dating apps to isolate victims before abducting and killing them. But it's unclear if a gang was behind the US deaths.
In the first 10 months of 2023, Medellin's tourism observatory had already recorded 32 violent killings of foreigners in the city - including at least 12 Americans and three from the United Kingdom - a 40% increase from the previous year.
Jeff Hewett was found ""lying dead in a pool of blood"" in his Medellin hotel room, his friends wrote online, describing him as ""an easy-going, wry, kind spirit"" and apparent victim of a ""robbery gone bad"".
Johny Jerome was killed on his 45th birthday. Phillip Mullins was drugged and died of an overdose, according to local media reports.
The embassy says several of these cases began with a dating app used to lure victims, part of a concerning increase in people who end up ""drugged, robbed, and even killed by their Colombian dates"".  Neither Tinder nor Bumble, both popular in the city, would comment.
Carlos Calle, the former director of the city's tourism observatory, said it's common for criminals to drug tourists with scopolamine, an odourless substance known as ""Devil's Breath"". The US embassy also warned about the drug, which sedates victims for up to 24 hours.
""There's a negative profile of the tourist in the city that looks for a certain type of opportunities,"" said Calle in an interview. It's usually related to sex work, he said.
A spokesperson for the tourism observatory confirmed that the ""majority"" of victims last year were men, but added that many cases are still under investigation.
Prostitution is legal in Colombia and widespread in tourism hotspots like the cities of Medellin and Cartagena. But there's nothing to suggest the men killed were using prostitutes.
Alok Shah, 36, thinks scopolamine is what caused his vision to ""go sideways"" when he brought a woman back to his hotel room in late 2022. It was like his short-term memory was disappearing, he said.
The Texas resident had matched with a Colombian woman in her mid-20s on Tinder. They first went out for coffee, but Shah later decided to buy beers and bring her to his hotel.
He says he hadn't felt unsafe during his previous frequent visits to Medellin, or like prostitution was as prevalent when he first came in 2017. But he knew women were a draw to the city. ""If you're a single guy, the women are very lovely here,"" a friend had told him.
Before his watch, jacket and $200 in cash disappeared that night, he remembers his date rubbing a powder on his neck. But he stayed conscious enough to realise something was wrong, threatening to call the police and chasing her away.
""I generally don't interact with the locals there now,"" he said. ""There's just too much danger, there's too much risk.""
The new US embassy notice recommends its citizens avoid taking dates to private places like hotels, plus inform friends, family or building staff about who they're with. And don't resist a robbery because that could be fatal.
Medellin's city police would not comment on the recent increase in violent deaths and referred BBC News to the mayor's office.
""We want more and more foreigners to come to the city,"" said Mayor Federico Gutierrez, but added that tourists coming purely for sex and drugs were not welcome. He said he's directed the police to crack down on what he says is a related underlying issue - the sex trafficking of minors.
Police have been directed to begin ""special interventions"" in the neighbourhoods where tourism is most prominent, a spokesperson for the mayor told BBC News, including the popular nightlife area called El Poblado.
More than 1.4 million foreigners visited the city as tourists in 2022, a new record over previous years, and over a quarter were American, according to statistics released by the mayor's office. The numbers for 2023 are expected to be even higher, partly because Medellin has become a top destination for remote workers.
Last week, Eh Xiong came to Medellin himself for the first time, to carry out a Hmong tradition by calling his brother's spirits back home.
""We're not mad at the people of Colombia,"" he said. ""I truly believe that he would have forgiven the people who did that to him.""
He added: ""[Tou Ger had] this quick wit, fearlessness, that believes in the goodness of all people.""

Denis Pushilin described the strike on a busy market as ""horrendous"", and said the number of casualties could rise.
A Ukrainian army group operating in the region said it did not carry out the attack. Mr Pushilin blamed Ukraine.
BBC News was not able to immediately verify the circumstances around the strike.
Photographs published by Reuters news agency appeared to show destroyed shop fronts, as well as bodies lying in the street.
According to AFP, a local resident named Tatiana told local media she heard an incoming projectile overhead, and hid under her market stall.
""I saw smoke, people screamed, a woman was crying,"" she was quoted as saying.
In a statement posted on Facebook, the Tavria unit - part of the Ukrainian army - said its forces ""did not engage in combat operations in this case"".
It continued: ""Donetsk is Ukraine! Russia will have to be held accountable for the lives of Ukrainians taken.""
The Russian Foreign Ministry called it ""a barbaric terrorist act against the peaceful people of Russia"" by Ukrainian forces who, it said, had ""used weapons supplied by the West"".
Donetsk city and parts of the wider region in eastern Ukraine were first seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014, and the area has been partially controlled by Moscow ever since.
The city is around 20km (12 miles) from the frontline. Areas near Donetsk city - including Mariinka and Avdiivka - have seen some of the fiercest fighting of late.
It has been almost two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it has made little progress in recent months.
On Saturday it claimed to have captured the village of Krokhmalne in north-eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv region. A Ukrainian military spokesman confirmed its forces had withdrawn from the area, but said the territory was of little military importance.
Days earlier Moscow also claimed to have taken control of a settlement named Vesele in Donetsk. Kyiv has not confirmed the claim.

The secretary of state for Wales said that he would ""make the case for more"" if necessary.
This week Tata Steel announced plans to decarbonise which included 2,800 job losses, mainly in Port Talbot.
Mr Davies said that every single one of the workers ""will have access to any training they need or want"".
As part of a deal announced in September, the UK government set up a transition board to manage a Â£100m fund to help workers affected by restructuring at Tata Steel.
Mr Davies said the main focus of the fund was reskilling workers, but some of the money may be used for infrastructure projects to attract investment.
""We're already meeting informally and formally with businesses to find out what their training requirements are going to be, Mr Davies said.
""I understand how difficult it must be for [workers] at this moment. That Â£100m is there to help you get any training, any help at all that you need after this devastating news.""
Vaughan Gething, the Welsh government's economy minister told the programme: ""We will always help people who are facing redundancy.
""So that may mean I need to move around other parts of my budget, which I would absolutely be prepared to do to make sure we can support workers - as we always have done - who are facing redundancy.""

What we know so far about Tata Steel Port Talbot job losses
However, Mr Gething insisted the primary focus is on maintaining the jobs at the steel works.
""I do think, though, there is hope. The final whistle has absolutely not gone because the proposals around blast furnace closures envisaged the last blast furnace closing towards the end of this year.
We need to understand, practically, whether that's possible... whether the company is in a position to do that with all of their own responsibilities for their customers and the future.""
He said that if Labour win the next election a Â£3bn green steel fund is ""on the table to assist in a transition that is a generally just transition"".
Joe Rossiter from the Institute of Welsh Affairs warned workers could be left behind if plans to create green jobs aren't expedited.
""There needs to be a co-ordinated plan that's joint-owned by the UK and Welsh governments and the investment to back that up,"" he said.
""If we don't act now to invest in the green economy then Wales will feel left behind in the global race for these industries of the future.""

QIV13QRL8L_8WLL9QG1U7TH4ZG,New Hampshire primary: Attacks fly as Donald Trump grows lead,By Bernd Debusmann Jr,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68049922,"Nikki Haley has gone on the offensive against Donald Trump, just days before the Republican New Hampshire primary.
She has previously avoided lashing out at the former president, but Mr Trump's attacks have become more personal as his commanding lead in the polls has grown.
Mr Trump is leading with 50% of likely Republican voters in the state, with Nikki Haley trailing far behind.
On Sunday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantisdropped out of the race altogether.
With his campaign faltering, Mr DeSantis admitted he had no path to victory - setting up a two-horse race in New Hampshire. And he endorsed Mr Trump.
In last week's Iowa caucus, Mr Trump dominated Ms Haley and Ron DeSantis.
But even with that decisive win and a clear lead in the upcoming New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, Mr Trump has gone on the attack against Ms Haley.
His criticisms appear to have convinced her to turn up the heat on the former president.
Mr Trump went after his former UN ambassador at a campaign rally over the weekend, but he seemed to confuse her for another political foe - former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - when speaking about the Capitol riot.
On CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, Ms Haley seized on the slip up and struck back at the former president, saying that his ""mental stability will probably continue to decline"".
""No matter what it is, chaos follows,"" she added. ""In some cases he [Mr Trump] causes it. In some cases he doesn't... he's like a magnet to it. What happens is that puts the rest of America in chaos, and people are tired.""
This video can not be played

The former UN ambassador also blasted her onetime boss as soft on undemocratic leaders, alleging he did not hold Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and China's Xi Jinping accountable.
""You can't have someone who's trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us,"" Ms Haley said on CBS. ""Instead, you have to let them know what we expect of them. That's the difference.""
Characterising Mr Trump as a mayhem and temper-fueled candidate appears to be a new counter deployed by Ms Haley. It comes after he has ramped up personal insults on her in recent days.
On Friday, for example, Mr Trump took to social media to refer to Ms Haley as ""Nimbra"", a misspelling of her birth name Nimarata, and to baselessly suggest she was ineligible to serve as president or vice president in the US.
The jab against the US-born Ms Haley - whose parents emigrated to the US from India in the 1960s - was reminiscent of the false birther attacks Mr Trump deployed against former President Barack Obama.
Ms Haley responded to the baseless claim by telling reporters in New Hampshire that Mr Trump is ""clearly insecure if he goes and does these temper tantrums"".
Her decision to fight back against Mr Trump - something she has been loath to do on the campaign trail - may have come too late in this primary, however.
While Ms Haley appeared to have some momentum a few weeks ago, polls released before Mr DeSantis quit showed Mr Trump dominating ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
Mr Trump led with 55% support among likely Republican voters, compared to 36% for Ms Haley and just 6% for Mr DeSantis.
A separate poll, from CNN, had Mr Trump with 50% support, compared to 39% for Ms Haley and 6% for Mr DeSantis.
The former president's lead has prompted Haley campaign officials and political allies to temper and downplay expectations for New Hampshire after previously expressing optimism.
New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, who has campaigned for Ms Haley, told NBC News that she ""doesn't have to win"" in his home state. He claimed that any momentum from this week's race offers an ""amazing opportunity to turn this around"".
Additionally, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney repeatedly declined to offer a prediction during an on-the-record briefing with Bloomberg News, telling reporters only that Ms Haley needs ""incremental progress"".
""I know everyone wants us to put a number on it,"" she said. ""We have never done that. We never will.""
Mr Trump's campaign has also received a boost from the endorsements of two former opponents for the Republican nomination, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.
Ms Haley also received an endorsement from a former rival, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who never earned much support and ended his bid for the Republican nomination last week.
""Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years,"" he said in a post on X. ""Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so.""
Still, Ms Ankney said that ""beating Donald Trump is not easy"" and appeared to push for a longer view of the campaign.
""He is a juggernaut,"" she said of Trump. ""But how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. We have to continue to show incremental growth and progress until we are the last man, or woman, standing against him.""

It was initially thought Hans Donner's mother had died when she landed on a concrete helipad in 1972, prompting people to put a blanket over her.
But amazingly she lived to jump again after spending two years in hospital.
By coincidence, Mr Donner was a trainer at Netheravon, Wiltshire, scene of his mother's accident five decades ago.
Since taking up skydiving at the age of 16, Mr Donner, now 43 and from Nescliffe, Shropshire, has completed 4,000 jumps, and once held the record for the highest number of tandem jumps performed in 24 hours.
As well as the inspiration to do that, he also followed his parents Paul and Jeanette's footsteps to serve in the military, enabling him to parachute and base-jump all over the world.
Mrs Donner was very lucky to survive the fall, at the base in Wiltshire, when both her parachutes failed to open.
She had to spend six months in a full-body cast and two years in hospital after suffering a broken back and neck.
She is a ""tough cookie,"" said Mr Donner. ""She did jump again after that, so that was always an inspiration.""
His parents didn't push him into skydiving, he said, but to see his mother still wanting to jump after her experience, meant ""there must be something behind it.""
He first jumped in 1996, before joining the Army in 2005, where he served in Iraq as an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) specialist.
After leaving the armed forces in 2012, he became an instructor and military contractor working at Netheravon.
Mr Donner has also branched out into base jumping and using wingsuits.
""In Switzerland, I managed to jump the Eiger, that was an amazing jump-off,"" he said.
Things have not always gone to plan though.
He says he has had 10 malfunctions, but luckily the emergency parachute has worked every time.
His worst injury came when he jumped off Pistyll Rhaeadr waterfalls, shattering his left leg.
Mr Donner is planning future jumps in Spain, and the south of France, and has set up his own base jumping company.
With the skydiving season opening in February, he said people could embrace the challenge, and ""push themselves a little bit"", while raising money for charity.

SP2W4BST7R_NDIPLWN5EXKM7G7,US personnel injured in missile attack on Al Asad airbase in Iraq,By Sean Seddon,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68045254,"A number of US military personnel have been injured in a missile attack on an airbase in western Iraq.
The US military's Central Command said an Iran-backed militia targeted the Al Asad airbase, which hosts American troops, with ballistic missiles and rockets on Saturday evening.
An unspecified number of US personnel were ""undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries"".
At least one Iraqi service member was wounded in the attack.
The strike against the base was claimed by a group calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. According to the US-based Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated armed groups operating in Iraq.
It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks. And Al Asad base has been attacked repeatedly in recent years.
The US military said most of the missiles fired on Saturday were intercepted but some evaded air defences and hit the base, adding that an assessment of the damage is ongoing.
It is the latest in a series of attacks on US positions in Iraq and Syria by Iran's proxies in the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza conflict last October.
The US military and allies have also intervened to stop Houthi missile attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea.
US forces carried out another airstrike on Saturday against the Houthis - an Iran-backed rebel group controlling much of western Yemen. The US military said it targeted a launch site, after identifying an anti-ship missile ""that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and prepared to launch"".
The Iranian military has carried out a number of missile strikes in recent days against targets in Syria, Iraq and Pakistan.
Earlier on Saturday, Iran accused Israel of carrying out an airstrike in the Syrian capital Damascus which killed five senior members of Iran's security forces.

T8EMOUJPEC_20B9X8FSVSMY6NC,Irish government will be involved if Stormont does not return - Alliance MP,_,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-68046410,"The Irish government will have an increased say in Northern Ireland's affairs if devolved government is not restored, an Alliance Party MP has said.
Stephen Farry said there'll be ""no choice"" but for Dublin to be part of a plan B for governing Northern Ireland.
A legal deadline to restore devolution in Northern Ireland passed on Friday.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has been blocking devolution since early 2022.
It is facing pressure to back a new deal to end the impasse, but made no decision when its 12 party officers, including leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, met on Friday.
Northern Ireland's government collapsed after the DUP withdrew in protest against post-Brexit trade checks between the region and Great Britain.
Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris is expected to set out the next steps in Parliament in the coming days, after a legal deadline for the restoration of devolution passed.
He is now under legal obligation to call an early assembly election, but he has pushed back this deadline several times before and has indicated he will do so again.
There has been much speculation on how Northern Ireland will be governed if Stormont does not return, with one senior Conservative MP indicating that traditional direct rule is off the table and suggesting there would be an increased role for the Irish government.
Unionists, including the DUP, have said they would be strongly opposed to Dublin's involvement in Northern Ireland.
However, Mr Farry, Alliance's deputy leader, said there would be no other option if Stormont does not return.
""It will be a consultative role [for the Irish government], not an executive role because that takes us into a different space,"" he told BBC News NI's Sunday Politics programme.
""But, absolutely, the principle of an Irish government having a consultative say was established in 1985 under the Anglo-Irish Agreement and I find it utterly bizarre that some people who are rejecting moving forward under a restored assembly are saying: 'Well, we can always have direct rule as a fall back.'""
Mr Farry added that he did not believe ""we're necessarily going to see an Irish dimension straight away but there will be pressure applied in that particular respect"".
""I don't see it at a very granular level, it will be at a high level in terms of those engagements but that is the direction of travel.
""And for those that are seeking direct rule as a fall back they have to be extremely aware of where this is going to go and it's bizarre and illogical in terms of the position they're taking.""
The DUP withdrew from power-sharing in February 2022 over its objection to what was known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - the post-Brexit rules that would oversee how trade operates between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
The UK agreed a new deal with the European Union called the Windsor Framework aimed at addressing issues with the previous deal, but the DUP said this did not go far enough and the party has been in talks with the government.
Before Christmas the government offered a Â£3.3bn package if devolution was restored, but the DUP said more changes were needed.
Pressure is building on the party, however, particularly over pay for public sector workers.
More than 100,000 workers including nurses, teachers and civil servants took part in the biggest strike seen in Northern Ireland in decades on Thursday.
Sixteen trade unions were involved in the industrial action that halted bus and train services, closed schools and disrupted health services.
Of that Â£3.3bn offered by the government, Â£548m is earmarked to address public sector pay issues - but Mr Heaton-Harris has said this will only be released if power-sharing government returns.

TOHKOMRLMG_XDI3EHMC9PF57X4,Southampton: Sculptor's centenary hope for Benny Hill statue,_,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-68049320,"A sculptor has expressed renewed hope for a large-scale memorial to Benny Hill, on the centenary of the comedian's birth.
The Benny Hill Show ran on BBC and ITV from 1955 to 1989, making the Southampton-born star a household name.
Barnsley sculptor Graham Ibbeson was commissioned to make a fibreglass mould of the late comedian in 2004, but it has remained in storage ever since.
He said a public statue would be a fitting tribute to Hill's talent.
Mr Ibbeson said: ""He was a comic genius. His stage was everybody's living room.
""He made people feel joyous and deserves a statue because of the impact he had in the UK and the United States.""
Alfred Hawthorn Hill was born on 21 January 1924 in Bridge Street, Southampton.
He later changed his first name to Benny in homage to his favourite comedian, Jack Benny.
An early job driving milk carts in Eastleigh inspired his 1971 hit Ernie, The Fastest Milkman in the West - a song chosen by future prime minister David Cameron as one of his Desert Island Discs on the BBC Radio 4 programme.
At the height of his popularity in the 1970s, The Benny Hill Show on Thames Television was one of the biggest shows on British TV.
However, by the late 1980s his routines were increasingly branded as smutty, sexist and politically incorrect and ITV dropped him from the schedules.
TV critic Garry Bushell previously championed a campaign for Mr Ibbeson's statue to be cast in bronze and put on display.
He said: ""We raised the first Â£8,000 to get the fibreglass statue made, but the campaign to raise the next part was derailed by Covid.""
Mr Bushell said he abandoned his efforts due to work pressures and resistance from a venue where he had planned to hold a fundraiser.
Mr Ibbeson acknowledged that the comedian's trademark routines, involving ""scantily-clad women"" and occasional racism, might offend people now.
However, he said: ""I liked the play on words, his attitude to television.
""We celebrate liars - there's a lot of politicians on pedestals.
""If people look at the sculpture, it could make them smile.""

TRR8ESZ70E_MZLPXJPBVE16Y0C,Ayodhya: Temple to open at Indiaâs religious fault-line,By Yogita Limaye,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-68030712,"Santosh Dubey says he has no regrets he helped tear down the mosque.
""It was religious work and I was put on this Earth to complete the task,"" he says. ""There is no crime or sin in it.""
Mr Dubey, a ""kar sevak"" (religious worker), was one of tens of thousands of Hindu men who demolished the 16th Century Babri Masjid in the Indian holy city of Ayodhya on 6 December 1992.
It was one of independent India's darkest days. The disputed site sits on one of its biggest religious fault-lines - thousands were killed in the violence that broke out.
More than 30 years later, where the mosque once stood a grand temple to Lord Ram, one of Hinduism's most revered deities, is about to be opened by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. That's controversial in a country with a secular constitution, but especially so because of the divisive history of the site.
Monday's ceremony is being seen as the informal start of his campaign for re-election this year, wooing India's Hindu majority. Across the country, millions of Hindus are gearing up to celebrate the day like a big festival, while employees of Mr Modi's federal government have been given a half day.
Sitting in his crumbling home, in a narrow alley in the city, paint and plaster peeling off its walls, Mr Dubey says he's proud of what he achieved.
""If we had not done what we did then the temple could never have been built,"" he says. ""Religious sentiments are greater than the constitution. I am extremely happy now. I had taken a pledge that I would not repair my home until Lord Ram got his.""
But for Muslims, who make up India's biggest minority, the day will evoke fear and painful memories. Some will send their children out of the city, fearing tensions might be stoked when the streets fill with Hindu devotees from around the country.
""We have been betrayed once, so we feel fear,"" says Mohammad Shahid. ""Many outsiders will come into Ayodhya and it's when outsiders come that there's trouble.""
6 December 1992 was a defining moment in India's history. It was also a pivotal event in the political rise of the Hindu right-wing that's now seeking a third consecutive term in power.
Many Hindus believe Muslim emperor Babur destroyed a temple that stood at the birthplace of Lord Ram and built a mosque over it more than 500 years ago.
Santosh Dubey and dozens of others have faced charges and spent time in jail over the years, but no-one has been convicted for demolishing the mosque.
He doesn't agree that what he did was against the law.
""Those who say that it was not Hindu to destroy the mosque are idiots. They are heretics, leftists, extremists and terrorists.
""We did not go to another country to destroy their places of worship, but if they destroyed ours, then it is right that we get them back.""
Muslims regularly offered prayers in the mosque until 1949, when idols of Lord Ram were placed in it, allegedly by Hindu priests. The gates of the mosque were then closed by a court order. In 1986, they were re-opened, many believe at the behest of the Congress party, then in power, in a rumoured attempt to woo the Hindu majority.
Then in 1990, the Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - then just a small political party with little electoral success - spearheaded a mass campaign for a Hindu temple at the site. The campaign would later be seen as one of the key moments which transformed BJP into the virtually unbeatable political giant it is today, which now has Mr Modi at its head.
That year, tens of thousands of kar sevaks congregated in Ayodhya. When they started moving towards the disputed site, police fired at them, killing dozens. ""Those bullets fuelled our anger,"" Santosh Dubey says. He was injured in the shooting.
Two years later, kar sevaks gathered in Ayodhya again.
""The people who were guarding the disputed structure fled when they saw a huge crowd walking towards them with swords and hammers. We had practised everything earlier. We climbed on the domes and brought it down within a few hours.""
Mr Dubey shows us a black and white photo that appeared in a newspaper of a group of men brandishing their weapons with raised arms, wide smiles on their faces. He says it was taken before the mosque was razed.
""We were happy, because we knew what was going to happen that day,"" he says, pointing to himself in the photo.
For Ayodhya's Muslims it was a day of terror.
""Hundreds of thousands of men were all over Ayodhya. They had sticks, swords and tridents. Our house was surrounded by them,"" says Anwari Begum, now 65.
""We ran from our homes. I ran with my six-month-old baby and small children. My husband was running behind us. When I turned, I saw that he had been caught by some men. We had to keep running for our lives.""
The next day she found out her husband Mohammad Amin had been killed, one of at least 17 Muslims who died in shocking violence in Ayodhya that day.
""An eyewitness told us that he had been caught, his arms and legs were chopped off, he was dumped into a sack and taken away. We never found his body,"" she says breaking down.
When she returned to her home, she found it had been burnt to the ground. It would take time, but over the years the family would manage to rebuild a small, two-room home on the same site.
""My husband used to take care of our family. I was left alone with six small children. We got some money from the government but it was not enough. My life was destroyed by that day,"" she says.
In the violence that swept across India after the mosque was torn down, nearly 2,000 people were killed. More than 900 died in the financial capital, Mumbai, alone, roughly two-thirds of them were Muslims.  There were killings in other cities including Jaipur, Bhopal, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.
In Ayodhya, Mohammad Shahid's father Mohammad Sabir was also killed brutally.
""They beat him and then they poured oil on both him and my uncle and set them on fire. We found their bodies,"" he says. ""The country wants to forget what happened. But Muslims can never forget. It was a black day for us.""
The family had a business supplying wooden carvings to temples in Ayodhya. The workshop was razed to the ground, and Mr Shahid was forced to become a rickshaw driver to earn a living.
Like Mr Shahid, Anwari Begum wants her son Sohrab, who's in his 30s, to leave for his safety around the inauguration.
""I'm not scared, but I am nervous,"" he told the BBC. ""It's being said that 70,000 to 100,000 people are coming. The atmosphere could become charged, that's why Muslims are thinking of leaving. But I won't go. I don't think anything will happen.""
In Ayodhya, the temple site is abuzz with cranes and diggers sending dust into the air ahead of the inauguration. Thousands of workers in hard hats dot the area.
It's costing $217m (Â£170m) to build the temple, funded from private donations, the temple trust says. The makeover of the city is being done by the government, estimated to cost more than $3bn.
Amid the construction, hundreds and hundreds of proud worshippers stream in to get a glimpse of the idols, with rituals for their consecration in the new temple already under way.
Poonam Ohri, 40, had tears of joy rolling down her cheeks. ""Our dream has come true because of Modi and the BJP government. I am overwhelmed.""
Badri Narayan, an elderly farmer who had travelled hundreds of miles, said his happiness knew no bounds.
""When I visited before, Lord Ram's idol was in a makeshift tent. It was getting wet in the rain. Tears started falling from my eyes seeing that,"" he told the BBC. ""And now he has been released because of Modi.""
Prime Minister Modi has asked people not to come to Ayodhya on 22 January and to light a lamp in their homes. But he's also said everyone can visit from the next day.
And it is those days following the official ceremony which worry some in the Muslim community.
""If the government reached out to us and gave assurances that nothing will happen, that would prevent people from leaving, but so far they haven't done that,"" said Azam Qadri, a Muslim community leader.
Sohrab says ""political leaders should have come to us and said what happened to you was wrong - they should have showed compassion, but they have not"".
As for the new temple that's being opened, he says: ""We feel happy they are building their temple, but we are also sad because it was built after destroying a mosque.""
Mohammad Shahid says Hindus have the right to build the temple after the Supreme Court gave them the site. ""We did not accept that decision happily, but what can we do,"" he says.
After years in the courts, the disputed site was handed over to Hindus by a Supreme Court judgment in 2019, despite the judges also finding that the mosque's demolition had been illegal. The ruling relied on archaeological evidence which showed that features of the foundations of the mosque ""are suggestive of a Hindu religious origin"".
It also said that evidence placed on the record proved that there was Hindu faith and belief that the site was the birthplace of Ram.
It was not proved that a temple had been destroyed to build the mosque.
The court also ordered a separate plot be given to Muslims to construct a mosque. It's 15 miles from Ayodhya, overgrown and empty.
It is simply too far away, says Mr Qadri: ""If the government had given it as much attention by building roads and ring roads as it's doing for the temple, then work would have started there too.""
Prime Minister Modi and the BJP are expected to sweep the general election later this year following the inauguration of the temple.
Many accuse him and his party of violating the constitution, of turning a religious event into a state-sponsored one.
But the BJP's local MP, Lallu Singh, saw no reason why Mr Modi shouldn't attend.
""If the prime minister is Hindu, why should he not visit the biggest centre of Hindu faith? What should stop him? Lord Ram is representative of the culture of this country,"" he told the BBC.
""The culture of the majority dominates the country, so it is 100% right that the PM do the opening. This does not mean we are discriminating on the basis of religion.""
There is also controversy around moving the idols into an unfinished temple, with some Hindu religious leaders accusing the government of prioritising electoral gains over the sanctity of Hindu rituals.
""I don't want to comment on what our religious leaders say. But the sanctum sanctorum where the idol will sit is complete. More worshippers will be able to come with ease now, that's why we are opening it,"" the MP says.
Back in 1992, the BJP's senior leaders expressed regret over the demolition of the mosque and said it should never have happened. How does Lallu Singh feel about it now?
""I believe what happened was right,"" he says.
Most Muslims and Hindus the BBC spoke to don't think longer-term there will be more hostilities in Ayodhya.
But some see Ayodhya as just the start - disputes and court cases are already ongoing over mosques in the cities of Mathura and Varanasi, referred to many by its ancient name Kashi.
""We had to wait for 450 years to get the birthplace of Lord Ram. I hope Kashi and Mathura will be ours soon too,"" says Aakash Jadhav, a 21-year-old Hindu devotee.

TZ2WE3MXXX_EBYIXRRYW6OIILH,Meopham mum says paediatric assessment waits neglectful,By Lauren Collins & Marcella Whittingdale,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-68032089,"A mother of twins with cerebral palsy has said delays in NHS assessments for children with additional needs are tantamount to neglect.
Sarah from Meopham, Kent, was told the twins would wait a year to be seen by a specialist after raising development concerns.
Sarah said she ""had to keep arguing"" and ""pushing back"".
Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust (KCHFT) apologised and said demand for assessments had increased.
Sarah first raised concerns about Astrid and Iris' development with her health visitor, ahead of a scheduled 12-month developmental review after noticing one of the girls would ""drag herself along"" when crawling and had ""a really obvious squint"".
She chased the trust when there was no improvement six months later but was told an assessment would not happen before February 2024 - a year after raising initial concerns.
""It wasn't until I'd messaged the MP and my councillor that my daughters were seen by a paediatrician that then gave them the diagnosis of cerebral palsy,"" Sarah said.
""I was made to feel stupid and that I had to keep on arguing and I had to keep on pushing back.""
Sarah paid privately for the girls to receive treatment whilst waiting for an NHS specialist.
Charities say early assessment and intervention can make a huge difference to children with additional needs.
Karen Parsler from Step and Learn, a donation-led charity in Rochester offering free support and physical therapy sessions for families in Kent, said many families were directed to them for help because of current pressure on the NHS.
""In the past NHS physios and therapists that work at the children's centres wouldn't recommend us but now most of our referrals are via those therapists at the NHS saying: 'Look we can't see you regularly try Step and Learn',"" she said.
KCHFT said in a statement: ""Nationally, demand for community paediatrics assessments has increased. At KCHFT we now receive 100 more referrals each month than we did a year ago. This means families are experiencing long waits. We know how challenging and frustrating this is for parents, carers and our staff.
""We're working hard to improve access to our service and apologise for the delays families are experiencing.""

U2QI9Q9DSI_CHR0WNXX8VJ1UCQ,Philippines president Marcos takes helicopter to Coldplay concert,By Vicky Wong,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-68047606,"The president of the Philippines is facing criticism on social media for using a presidential helicopter to attend a Coldplay concert in a province north of the capital, Manila.
Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his wife were spotted arriving at the Philippine Arena via helicopter on Friday.
Critics have called this a misuse of government resources.
Mr Marcos Jr's office defended the move, citing ""unforeseen traffic complications"".
The head of Mr Marcos' Presidential Security Group (PSG), Brig Gen Jesus Nelson Morales, said in a statement published on Saturday that the ""unprecedented influx of 40,000 individuals eagerly attending a concert"" resulted in traffic complications, and that this posed a security threat to the president.
Brig Gen Morales went on to ask for the public's understanding, adding that the ""continued understanding and support for these measures are crucial in maintaining the safety and well-being of our nation's leadership"".
The Philippine Arena, located deep in the suburbs, is usually around 40 minutes by car from the presidential palace - absent the capital's notorious traffic jams. By public transport, the same route can take one to two hours.
Mr Marcos Jr and his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos were among the thousands of fans who attended Coldplay's concert at the Philippine Arena, the world's largest indoor arena.
Videos and photos of the first couple drew ire from social media users, who criticised the use of taxpayer money by Mr Marcos, who is the son and namesake of the late strongman president whose rule ended nearly four decades ago in a historic ""people power"" revolution.
""Using official resources, like the presidential chopper, for personal and non-official activities is generally considered an abuse of power or misuse of government resources,"" Facebook user James Patrick Aristorenas said in a post on Saturday.
""We paid for the use of the chopper, fuel and security, who knows even for the tickets for everyone,"" Facebook user Arvine Concepcion said.
In a survey published on Friday, Metro Manila topped the 2023 TomTom Traffic Index list of metro areas with the slowest travel time, taking an average time of 25 minutes and 30 seconds to travel 10km in the region. This has been blamed on creaking infrastructure and an inadequate public transport system.
Filipino office workers in the Metro Manila area often spend hours stuck in traffic. Many wake up before dawn in order to get to work on time.
According to news site Rappler, Coldplay's front man Chris Martin also remarked on the Philippine traffic, thanking fans for braving it to see the band live.
""We've seen some traffic. But I think you have the number one [traffic] in the world. Thank you for making the effort...to be here,"" he said.

UQMIV4HXUU_147X1VGGNLWK2B5,Ukraine drones hit St Petersburg gas terminal in Russia,"By Sarah Rainsford, Eastern Europe correspondent in Kyiv and Oliver Slow in London",1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68046347,"This video can not be played
Watch: Explosion at Russia gas terminal
An explosion at a major gas export terminal near the city of St Petersburg in Russia was carried out by Ukrainian drones, BBC News has been told.
The blast caused a large fire at the Ust-Luga terminal, but no injuries, Russian officials said.
An official source in Kyiv said the ""special operation"" of the SBU security service masterminded the attack, with drones that worked ""on target"".
Both Russia and Ukraine have used drones in the current conflict.
Russia launched its full-scale of invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago, but has made little progress in recent months.
Regarding the explosion near St Petersburg, regional governor Alexander Drozdenko said a ""high alert regime"" was in place after the incident at the terminal of gas producer Novatek, in Ust-Luga on the Gulf of Finland. He shared a video of what appeared to be a large fire.
Novatek later announced that work at the terminal had been suspended, and said the fire was the result of ""external influence"" - without providing further details.
The Ukrainians say fuel processed at the plant was being used to supply Russian troops in their war against Ukraine and that this strike ""significantly complicates"" logistics for the military.Â
They also describe the attack as an economic blow to Russia, which exports fuel from the terminal. Â
Russia's Fontanka.ru has published video showing tankers moored close to where the fire is raging. It reports two drones were spotted approaching the city of St Petersburg at about 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT) but swerved sharply at the outskirts before heading for the coast and the Ust-Luga port.
An eyewitness is heard saying the ground shook beneath his feet with the explosions.
The Russian Telegram channel Mash quotes a source saying they heard two explosions before the fire. The channel says around 150 staff were evacuated from the terminal.
Another video - posted on Russian social media - appears to show huge balls of orange fire, a man's voice is heard referring to hearing the buzzing of a drone before the explosion.
Fontanka.ru, usually a reliable source, says flights in and out of St Petersburg had been grounded before the explosions, as a plan known as ""Carpet"" was put in place.
Russia's defence ministry also said it shot down three Ukrainian drones in Smolensk Region, close to its border with Ukraine, on Saturday night.
It earlier said it had shot down drones over Tula and Oryol, both in western Russia. There were no reports of casualties.
Also on Sunday, at least 25 people were killed and 20 injured by shelling at a busy market in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Russian-installed officials said. Kyiv has not yet commented on that attack.
Russia and Ukraine have been targeting each other's energy infrastructure, and on Friday a fire broke out at an oil depot in Bryansk, south-west Russia, which Moscow blamed on a Ukrainian drone strike.
That came a day after an attack targeted a major oil loading terminal in St Petersburg.
On Thursday, Russia claimed to have captured a village close to the devastated city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. Kyiv has not confirmed the claim.
Ukraine has warned repeatedly that its army is facing severe ammunition shortages, but has set a target of producing a million drones domestically this year.
Russia launched the invasion of its neighbour nearly two years ago.

USQQAPJHP0_UG4QYCL90D89T0G,Tesco tech hitch leaves deliveries in 'shambles',_,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-68050152,"Tesco customers were left without their grocery deliveries on Sunday morning after a technical fault prevented many orders going out.
Dozens took to social media to express their frustration, branding the experience and lack of communication a ""shambles"".
A spokesperson for the supermarket apologised for the inconvenience.
Tesco said orders were back up and running by mid-afternoon.
But disgruntled Tesco shoppers were put out that there had been so little information from the company while they waited in for orders that did not arrive.
Reports of problems peaked at 09:00 on the Downdetector website, with thousands of users logging problems with Tesco's service.
One shopper, Mark, said on social media that he had got up ""extra early"" at 08:00 for a delivery, only to find it cancelled ""without any real reason being given"".
Another customer wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that they were housebound and had received a confirmation from Tesco that their delivery was on its way, only to receive news of the cancellation 20 minutes later.
Others described the experience as ""appalling"" after struggling to reach customer services to find out what had happened to their orders.
One mother was left ""furious"" as she said she could not leave the house and was left with no nappies.
Many said they were informed of the cancellation only 20 minutes before the delivery was due. Others said they only found out after the allotted slot had been and gone, with some waiting several hours before they found out what the problem was.
Tesco's spokesperson said: ""We're really sorry that due to a technical issue, we had to cancel some online orders today.
""Our technical team have worked around the clock and have now fixed it.""
""Customers who were impacted have been contacted directly. We apologise again for the inconvenience.""
Tesco advised customers to rebook to have orders delivered in the coming days. However, some customers said they were struggling to find suitable slots.

WIL0BTCK7E_1S8CJB53SROC3CU,11 inspiring reasons to visit your library,_,_,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/tiny-happy-people/articles/zfmjh4j,"Home > Tips and advice > Language
Visiting your local library opens up countless opportunities to build your child’s language and communication skills, and there are plenty of benefits for parents too.
“There are many transitions in a child's life. But your library is a constant space and has something magical to offer at every stage,” says Sarah Mears, Programme Manager at Libraries Connected.
Storyteller and Literacy Consultant Liv Corbin-Phillip is a library enthusiast and says you’d be hard-pressed to find a community space that’s more welcoming than a library.
“I think the biggest myth about libraries is that there's some sort of code, some sort of way to behave, or that they’re a space that belongs to a certain type of person. They’re community spaces for everyone.""
“No one's going to judge you or question why you're there or what you're doing.”
Forget the enduring library myth – you’re not going to be shushed. “No one's going to mind if your baby cries or your toddler runs around”, adds Sarah. “It’s worth remembering that many libraries are also fine-free now, particularly for children's books. Libraries are understanding about lost and late books borrowed by children.”
Libraries usually have baby-changing facilities, are breast-feeding friendly and, in cold weather, many are also part of a 'warm space network' – a scheme backed by many local councils to help their residents keep warm during the colder months.
They’re fun, free and happen in libraries all over the UK. Rhyme and storytelling events not only help build your child’s language and communication, they’re great for their social skills too, says Sarah.
“The whole experience of being around other children and adults, learning to interact is so valuable. And if they involve action rhymes or using musical instruments like shakers, your child’s motor skills will be supported too.”
Want to feel more confident chatting and telling stories with your child? Interactive library events like rhyme and story time can have just as many benefits for you as your little one, says Liv.
“One big part of sessions is copying and giving parents the chance to repeat things to their child. Seeing others do it and being in a supportive environment will give you lots of confidence and ideas to take away. At the end of a session, don’t forget you can borrow the book so you recreate the magic at home.”
“Bigger libraries have spaces that are perfect for events and performances for children including live music, dance and theatre”, says Liv.
“And they’re usually quite intimate performances, so are really inspiring for little ones.”
There are lots of simple ways you can support your child’s confidence in their early years – and the safe environment of a library offers plenty, says Liv.
“They get to roam and discover what interests them. I lived opposite a library when I was little. It was my first opportunity to be independent – picking my book, using my card, and walking out with it was a massive thing for me and it triggered a lifelong love of books.”
The BookTrust gives a free Bookstart book pack to every baby born in England and Wales and at other stages before they start school, including packs for children with additional needs. You can normally get a pack from your midwife or health visitor but you can also collect one from your local library.
There’s a similar scheme run by the Scottish Reading Trust called Bookbug Bags.
As well as books, your library has a range of items you can borrow that might include CDs, DVDs, audiobooks, magazines and board games.
“Plus they have lots of e-resources that are available 24/7, including e-audiobooks, e-magazines and comics, and online encyclopaedias,” says Sarah.
Your library can support you if speak more than one language at home, says Sarah. “Reading books together is a fun way to build their vocab and you can find a range of multilingual or dual language books in your library.”
Also look out for library notices about meet-ups and societies for different communities in your local area. These can give you extra opportunities to explore language and culture with your child.
“You might be surprised to discover that your local library has a maker space and runs all sorts of creative activities,” says Sarah.
Find out whether your library runs crafty play sessions for parents and little ones, which are a fantastic way to fire their imagination.
You could also use your library’s maker space to explore your creative side and create games and activities to play with your child at home. “Libraries are also often great places to explore the latest technology and you might even be able to access some innovative resources such as 3D printers, digital cutters or VR headsets.”
Find out what clubs your library runs, recommends Liv. “For example, I know many libraries that run Lego clubs.” This can be a really great way of letting your child play with toys and have experiences you can’t easily provide at home for free.
“Libraries have a year-round calendar of cultural and creative activities for children and families, and they're either free or very low-cost,” adds Sarah. “For example, your child could join a summer or winter reading challenge.”
“Becoming a parent can be lonely and isolating, so libraries can be a lifeline. They’re somewhere you talk and meet new people, or just somewhere you can take time out and be around other people,” says Liv.
Libraries can also help you access any services you may need. “You can find out what’s on offer locally and some libraries also have combined services – so there are opportunities to talk with professionals such as speech and language therapists or family support workers,” adds Sarah.
Check out what’s happening at all the libraries in your area, and what suits you and your child, says Sarah.
“You may like the buzz and excitement of your main library or prefer the quieter vibe of a smaller community library.”
“Remember that once you register for a library card, you can use it to take out books at any library in your local authority’s network.”
“Your area might even have a mobile library or story bus that you can access,” adds Liv.
Sign up your library’s e-newsletter, and use their social platforms to stay updated on events.
“They can help with book recommendations for your little one, tell you more about early years’ activities and give you insider tips about what else is happening,” says Sarah.
“If you are interested in finding more books for your child, library catalogues are a treasure trove,” says Sarah. “They give a lot more information than simply the book name and can give you more suggestions.”
“You can usually reserve items free of charge and pick them up at a library of your choice. You can also request your library gets a book it doesn’t have already,” recommends Sarah. You can usually do this online, over the phone or in person.
Libraries often sell off their old stock at very low prices to make way for new books.
Follow your library on social and use their online services – but don’t forget to check out physical noticeboards too! They are packed full of information about events at the library and in your local area."

XTE2UPHJXL_X1LSF1VDVXCBQ5D,"TikTok campaign needed for MMR jab, says Jess Phillips MP",By Rob Mayor & Eleanor Lawson,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-68037150,"Birmingham MP Jess Phillips has said a TikTok campaign is needed to promote the uptake of the MMR vaccine.
The number of people with measles in the West Midlands is at its highest since at least the mid-1990s, health officials said.
However, parts of Birmingham and the Black Country have among the lowest vaccination rates in the UK.
Ms Phillips said false vaccine messages were spreading quicker than advice from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).
The West Midlands has had 216 confirmed measles cases and a probable 103 further cases since 1 October, UKHSA figures from Friday show.
Most of these cases were in Birmingham.
Ms Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, told BBC Politics Midlands: ""[It's] really really concerning, especially when you consider the evidence about [measles] being in more vulnerable communities, communities that already suffer poorer health outcomes.
""We really have got to understand why this has happened so we can do everything we possibly can to get the messaging right [and] make sure there are the healthcare professionals in the community to go out so that the questions can be answered.""
The Labour MP said that people under the age of 40 in her constituency, particularly those with children, were largely talking to each other on TikTok and that a TikTok campaign was ""needed"" to promote the MMR vaccine.
She also said spreading fake news such as vaccine misinformation should be a criminal offence, but that the police did not have enough resources to actually do this.
""I think it's criminal when people spread that fake news because it's hurting people, it's harming people,"" she said.
""Frankly those people should be held to task and account for essentially causing illness in these areas.""
Dame Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said vaccination rates were ""well below"" what is recommended by the World Health Organization.
Responding to Dame Jenny urging the public to see healthcare professionals to ask questions about the MMR vaccine, Ms Phillips said: ""I'm afraid to say that that's quite hard to do for most people these days.
""I think a huge effort needs to be put in to make sure this is abated at 216 cases.""
The Birmingham MP said both her children were vaccinated, adding: ""It's not just a good parenting decision, it's a good community decision because there are some people who cannot take the vaccine because they are ill, so I personally think it is a good parenting decision.""
Rugby MP Mark Pawsey, also speaking on BBC Politics Midlands, said he was ""not sure"" enough was being done about the measles outbreak.
Addressing MMR vaccine uptake, he said: ""I think part of the issue is because it hasn't been around for so long, I think my generation of people do understand the concerns because our parents knew exactly how severe this was.
""It hasn't been around for a long time and I think that's made people very causal about taking the MMR vaccine.""

ZG7V3V54F2_DRD8ASMUNP01GTU,Bwari kidnapping: Nigeria police secure release of sisters taken from Abuja,By Oliver Slow,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68047140,"Nigerian police say they have successfully rescued five sisters who were held hostage after being kidnapped in the country's capital.
The girls were freed in a joint police-army operation in a forest in northern Nigeria on Saturday night.
They were taken from their home in Abuja earlier this month, along with another sister who was later killed.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom for their release, but the statement made no mention of one being paid.
Nigerian police said the girls had been reunited with their family following the operation, which took place near the Kajuru forest in Kaduna State at around 23:30 local time (22:30 GMT) on Saturday.
The six sisters, aged from the early teens to 23, were taken hostage alongside their father, Mansoor Al-Kadriyar, on 2 January at the family home in Bwari, a suburb of Abuja.
Witnesses said the girls' uncle ran to find help but was ambushed and killed, as were three police officers.
The kidnappers released Mansoor on the condition he raise a large ransom, but his 21-year-old daughter, Nabeeha, a final year university student, was then killed as a warning, according to a family member who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity.
Kidnapping has become rife in Nigeria, with hundreds of people abducted in recent years, largely by criminal gangs who see it as an easy way to make money. It has been particularly bad in the north-west of the country.
The case of the Al-Kadriyar sisters prompted widespread anger in the country, with many arguing that the kidnapping emergency has continued despite government promises to bring it to an end.
First Lady Remi Tinubu urged security agencies to ""intensify their efforts"" to end the kidnapping and security crisis, and demanded a ""swift return of the Al-Kadriyar sisters"".
The ransom for the girls' return was set at 65m naira ($68,000; Â£53,000), leading to many Nigerians donating to a crowdfunding initiative.
However, Defence Minister Mohammed Badaru Abubakar urged people not to contribute towards the ransom, saying it would ""only worse the situation"".
""We believe we have to stop - as painful as it is. We have to stop responding to payment on ransom. If we stop, over time the kidnapping will not be profitable and they will stop,"" he said.
No matter how desperate the circumstances, Nigerian law prohibits the payment of ransom money. However, many victims pay up because they do not trust authorities to secure the release of their loved ones.
There has now been an outcry that the insecurity has reached the capital, prompting Abuja's police force to launch a special squad to tackle the kidnapping gangs.
Mr Abubakar said he believed operations against the gangs elsewhere had forced them to move to areas near the capital.
""The security agencies are working very hard to push them out and block the movements and finish them off once and for all,"" he said.
