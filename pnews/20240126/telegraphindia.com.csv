This time, with reinforced security cover, both from the central armed troops as well as from the state police.
Despite a total reversal of scenario with an uneventful operation this time around, sources confirmed that the ED virtually drew a blank after breaking open into Shahajahan’s residence. Three empty briefcases, virtually empty cupboards having no more than ordinary clothing and a kitchen full of household utensils were all the agency officials could find in the first five hours of search, which was in progress at the time this report was filed.
Unable to lay its hands on anything significant in the premises, the ED put up a summons notice asking the Trinamul leader-in-hiding to appear before the investigating agency at its Salt Lake office on January 29.
The owner of the premises and the prime suspect in the Sandeshkhali assault case, Shahajahan, continues to abscond. The development begged the question of whether the suspect, besides managing to evade police net for 19 days, also succeeded in removing incriminating evidence from the premises.
A team of thirteen ED officials, led by an officer of the joint director rank, reached Shahajahan’s residence at Akunjipara More adjacent to the Dhamakhali Road in the Sarberia area of Sandeshkhali at around 8 AM. Besides being accompanied by around 125 central armed central forces jawans who secured the area the moment the team landed at the said premises while state armed police from the block and RAF provided an additional layer of security cover over a 100-meter radius from the house. Together, the forces converted the region into an impenetrable fortress. Central forces jawans also conducted route marches in the vicinity during the raid.
The agency took help of a locksmith to break open locks put up on one of the entry gates to the house. A videographer accompanied the ED team inside the house to record search proceedings. The Bengal police, on the other hand, had their own videographer to record proceedings outside the house while the raids continued inside. Five witnesses, including two local residents who were deployed as witnesses by the local police, also formed part of the raiding team.
The fact that nothing significant was recovered warranted the ED to focus on footage of the last few days from the CCTV cameras which were installed on the premises on court orders. Sleuths, though, expressed doubts on whether anything worthwhile would be revealed by the tapes since the cameras were installed only on January 17, a good 12 days after the previous raid. The window of virtually no vigilance at Shahajahan’s place for a significant period of time, sources opined, may have allowed the suspect or his accomplices to remove vital evidence from the premises.
The raiding officers were seen on the rooftop of Shahajahan’s house, presumably awaiting further orders from agency headquarters in Delhi, after failing to secure any significant evidence in connection with the case. The leading officer of the team also visited the adjacent houses of the suspect’s relatives looking for a particular key to Shahajahan’s property, but had to return empty handed.
On January 5, widespread violence broke out in the area after local villagers gathered in large numbers and attacked the raiding ED officials, their security personnel and even members of the media who had accompanied the search team for news coverage. Vehicles were vandalised, equipment destroyed and three agency officials and media personnel left severely injured by miscreants who were allegedly summoned by the Trinamul leader at large to prevent the agency from carrying out the raid.
The ED later submitted in court that while Shahajahan’s cell phone location confirmed that he was still present in his house which was locked from inside and had, in fact, picked the first call made to him by the raiding officers, the subsequent 28 phone calls made to him went unanswered. The agency also maintained that Sheikh himself had summoned the Trinamul-sheltered miscreants to carry out the attack which forced the officials to flee the spot before himself vanishing into thin air. It also questioned the “inactive” role of the state police while coming under attack at another part of the district on the same day.
So far seven people have been arrested by the local Nazat Police Station in connection with the Sandeshkhali violence while the police have also lodged an FIR against the ED on the basis of a complaint lodged by the caretaker of the suspect’s house. While the state police have come under scanner of the Calcutta High Court for its inability to nab Shahajahan for so long, the court has directed a joint Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and West Bengal Police to probe an attack on the ED officials at Sandeshkhali. That order, though, has already been challenged before an appeals bench of the court by the Directorate and has appealed for a holistic investigation by the CBI without interference of the state police."

05G53GJ91K_KG2W1SX2EXS9QNT,"INDIA braces, Bihar duo may fall apart: Lalu Prasad-Nitish Kumar play friend-foe again","Dev Raj Patna Published 26.01.24, 05:39 AM","Dev Raj Patna Published 26.01.24, 05:39 AM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/india-braces-bihar-duo-may-fall-apart-lalu-prasad-nitish-kumar-play-friend-foe-again/cid/1996197,"Bihar is agog with a startling but not unlikely buzz — that Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad, the two men who have taken turns to lord over the state for more than three decades, are about to fall apart yet again. The second Mahagatbandhan experiment is on the brink with Nitish likely to pull out.
The BJP central leadership was in hyperactive mode all day; Bihar party chief Samrat Choudhary and other senior members were summoned to Delhi and were closeted at Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence with party president J.P. Nadda till late evening.
Should Nitish switch sides again, as speculation in Patna’s political circles suggests, the key impact will not be so much on the state as on the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. A break-up in Bihar’s ruling alliance will render a debilitating blow to the INDIA formation, already battling dissonance in Bengal and Punjab.
A political source in the know of Thursday’s fast-paced events told The Telegraph that Nitish could also be exploring the possibility of recommending the dissolution of the Assembly in order that a new Assembly can be elected along with the Lok Sabha polls. There can, of course, be no confirmation of this in the current state of Bihar’s political fluidity. Some suggested that Nitish and his trusted intermediaries were in touch with the top BJP leaders in Delhi.
Signs of trouble in the ruling alliance emerged on Thursday following a series of deriding posts by RJD president Lalu Prasad’s daughter Rohini Acharya on X; her posts apparently targeted chief minister Nitish Kumar for his public criticism of dynastic politics on Wednesday.
Though the posts did not name Nitish, the chief minister was clearly upset; he expressed his annoyance to deputy chief minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav at a state cabinet meeting and stomped off.
With the matters coming to a head in an alliance that has been under visible strain in recent weeks, Rohini deleted her posts.
But that may not have mollified the chief minister; neither did it stop people in the thick of power circles from wondering whether Nitish was about to effect another somersault, now a thing of legend in contemporary politics. As one observer remarked sardonically, “For Nitish, going anywhere is like homecoming.”
A few other back-to-back developments added to the sense of political turbulence that may not only rock the alliance but even sink it.
Nitish cancelled all his scheduled appointments and went into a huddle with trusted party leaders Bijendra Prasad Yadav, Vijay Choudhary, Ashok Choudhary, Sanjay Jha (all ministers), state JDU president Umesh Kushwaha and a few others.
The JDU has also asked all its MLAs to return to Patna. Sources in the party indicated that Nitish may not join Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra when it enters Bihar on January 29.
On the other hand, Bihar BJP president Samrat Choudhary suddenly flew to Delhi along with Union minister Ashwini Choubey after asking all party MLAs to return to the state capital. Sources said Nitish’s political consultant and JDU national spokesperson K.C. Tyagi also boarded the same flight after consultations with his boss.
Top RJD leaders in Patna were also in a flurry of meetings at the residence of Lalu and his wife, former chief minister Rabri Devi, to discuss likely steps to tackle any sudden political shift effected by Nitish; top of their mind, sources said, was to explore the possibility of the “Grand Alliance” being able to form a government without the JDU.
Lalu’s daughter Rohini lives in Singapore, but is a keen follower of political developments in the state, and is said to harbour political ambitions. She had donated one of her kidneys to her father in 2022. She posted three statements in Hindi on X on Thursday morning, which triggered the political storm.
“Samajwadi purodha hone ka karta wahi dava hai, hawaon ki tarah badalti jiski vichardhara hai (He, whose ideology changes like winds, claims to be a socialist stalwart or master),” was the first post by Rohini.
“Kheej jataye kya hoga jab hua na koi apna yogya, vidhi ka vidhan kaun tale jab khud ki niyat mein ho khot (Venting frustration will not bear any result because none of his own came up as capable. Who can deflect divine destiny, when one’s own intention has fault),” Rohini added in her next post.
The RJD chief’s daughter followed it up with “Aksar kuchh log nahin dekh paate hain apni kamiyan, lekin kisi doosre pe kichad uchhalne ko karte hain badtamiziyan (Often people do not see their own deficiencies, but indulge in insolence to throw mud on others).”
The chronology of Rohini’s posts could be understood by the initiated in the light of Nitish’s speech at a public rally organised by his party to celebrate the birth centenary of Bharat Ratna socialist leader and former Bihar chief minister Karpoori Thakur on Wednesday.
Speaking at the rally, Nitish had hit out at people promoting their families in politics without taking anybody’s name; many perceived it to be an attack on Lalu. “Karpoori Thakur never promoted his family in politics. I have followed him and have never promoted anybody from my family.... But some people always indulge in advancing their families,” Nitish had said.
By reacting to Rohini’s posts, Nitish may have tangentially accepted that his statement targeted Lalu and his family, observers believe. The RJD chief’s wife Rabri Devi, currently an MLC, has been chief minister in the past, eldest daughter Misa Bharti is an MP, elder son Tej Pratap Yadav is state environment minister, while younger son Tejashwi is deputy chief minister.
Nitish quit the NDA twice — in 2013 and in August 2022 — both times to tie up with the RJD and the Congress. He spearheaded efforts to put together INDIA but became disenchanted because he wasn’t named convener. The JDU and the BJP have not criticised each other for a while. Shah, when recently asked about the possibility of the return of former allies including Nitish to the NDA fold, had said the party would consider such proposals.
The Grand Alliance has 159 seats in the 243-member Assembly. Sans Nitish’s JDU, the Grand Alliance will have 114 seats, which is just eight short of the majority mark. Sources said that in case Nitish switches sides, the RJD may try to muster a majority on the floor; the Speaker, Awadh Bihar Chaudhary, belongs to the RJD."
07N2F9GVZA_URLVBECOJS44V3C,"Israel braces for World Court ruling, focuses attack on south Gaza","Reuters Jerusalem, Doha, The Hague Published 26.01.24, 12:47 PM","Reuters Jerusalem, Doha, The Hague Published 26.01.24, 12:47 PM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/world/israel-braces-for-world-court-ruling-focuses-attack-on-south-gaza/cid/1996315,"UN judges in The Hague will rule on Friday whether to order Israel to suspend its military campaign in Gaza as officials push ahead with efforts to negotiate a new deal for a ceasefire and release of more Israeli hostages.
On the ground in the seaside enclave, Gaza officials said on Thursday that Israeli strikes killed 20 Palestinians queuing for food aid in Gaza City, six people in a house in central Gaza's Al-Nusseirat refugee camp and at least 50 people in the prior 24 hours in Gaza's main southern city Khan Younis, where Israel is currently focusing the brunt of its might.
Reuters could not independently verify the details while Israel said it was either looking into the reports or did not immediately comment on the incidents.
The judges of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also called the World Court, are due to rule on Friday on South Africa's request for emergency measures against Israel in a case accusing it of state-led genocide in the Gaza Strip.
In more than three months of war, Israel's campaign has leveled much of the enclave, displaced some 1.9 million Palestinians and killed at least 25,900 people, according to Gaza officials. Israel launched its offensive in October after militants from Hamas, which rules Gaza, stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages.
The court will issue its ruling at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT) in a hearing expected to last about an hour. While the judges will not rule on the merits of the genocide allegations, which may take years to decide, South Africa asked the court to issue an interim order compelling Israel to suspend its military operations.
Israel has called South Africa's allegations false and ""grossly distorted,"" and said it makes the utmost efforts to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza.
The court's rulings are final and without appeal, but it has no way of enforcing them. Israel on Thursday expressed confidence that the ICJ would ""throw out these spurious and specious charges."" Hamas said it would abide by an ICJ ceasefire order if Israel reciprocates.
Diplomatic efforts seek new truce deal
Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts to negotiate a break in the conflict continued. U.S. and Israeli intelligence chiefs were due to meet Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Europe this weekend, one official told Reuters. A second source said Egypt's intelligence chief would also participate.
The White House has been trying to facilitate the release of the more than 100 remaining Israeli hostages taken during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which ignited the war in Gaza, although there remains a considerable distance between the two sides' demands.
A third source with knowledge of the talks said that Israel has proposed a 60-day pause in the fighting during which hostages would be released in phases, beginning with civilian women and children.
Previously, three sources told Reuters that shuttle diplomacy over the past month involving the U.S., Qatar and Egypt has sought to hammer out a new deal for a ceasefire of about one month. But progress has been held up by differences between Hamas and Israel over how to bring a permanent end to the Gaza war.
In Gaza on Thursday, tanks hit areas around two hospitals in Khan Younis, forcing displaced people into a new desperate scramble for safety, residents said.
Israel's military said early on Friday that its intelligence found that Hamas was operating from inside and around the two hospitals, Nasser and Al-Amal, in Khan Younis. Hamas and medical workers have denied Israeli claims that militants in Gaza use hospitals as cover for bases.
The Israeli military said it was coordinating with hospital staff to ensure they remain ""operational and accessible"" and there is a safe corridor for people to leave the hospitals.
""The facts on the ground disprove the blatant misinformation that has been disseminated over the last 72 hours falsely claiming that the hospitals are under siege or attack,"" it said in a statement.
Fleeing to Rafah
On Thursday, thousands of homeless people sheltering in Khan Younis sought to flee to Rafah, 15 km (nine miles) away, the U.N. relief agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) said.
Video posted on X by Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, showed a crowd of people walking en masse on Thursday on a dirt road. ""A sea of people forced to flee Khan Younis, ending up at the border with Egypt. A never ending search for safety that #Gaza is no longer able to give"", Lazzarini wrote.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said less than 20% of the narrow enclave - around 60 square kilometres (23 square miles) - now harboured over 1.5 million homeless people in the south."

Vanessa Dougnac, who writes for a French publication, is married to an Indian and has been living in India for the past 22 years. She came to India on a journalist visa and later got the OCI card.
The notice was issued to Dougnac on January 19, days before the visit of French President Emmanuel Macron who is the chief guest at the Republic Day parade this year.
“The journalist has been asked to reply by February 2. Action will be taken after going through her response,” said a ministry official.
Home ministry sources said Dougnac had been under the scanner of the government agencies for the past few years. “Through her malicious reporting she has spread negative perceptions about India,” said a ministry official.
Besides, she had violated visa norms, including travelling to Ladakh, in the past. “A foreign journalist is required to take special permits to go to Ladakh,” the official said.
Sources said she had in the past visited Maoist-hit areas in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh and filed negative and biased stories highlighting the atrocities against Christians and tribals."

Ramesh's remark came amid a Congress-TMC impasse over seat-sharing in Bengal for the Lok Sabha polls and a day after Banerjee announced that her party will fight the elections in the state ""alone"".
Congress president Kharge, Rahul Gandhi and everyone in the party would be ""just delighted and privileged to have her as part of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra even if it is for a few minutes"", AICC general secretary in-charge communications Ramesh told PTI.
""Congress president Kharge has spoken with her today and we will find a way forward because her objective is the objective of the INDIA bloc which is to defeat the BJP resoundingly in West Bengal and convincingly in other parts of the country,"" he said.
Ramesh said the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra would be immensely strengthened by her presence.
""Without her, we cannot fight the BJP in Bengal and the rest of the country. She is the integral, essential pillar of the opposition bloc INDIA. She has played a crucial role in making the INDIA bloc a reality,"" the Congress leader said.
Ramesh's remarks came after Gandhi expressed confidence in the unity of the opposition INDIA bloc in combating injustice nationwide.
The 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,' led by Gandhi, entered West Bengal on Thursday from Assam through Bakshirhat in Cooch Behar district. It will take a two-day break on January 26-27 before restarting on January 28.
Banerjee had told reporters on Wednesday, ""I had given them (Congress) a proposal (on seat sharing) but they refused it at the outset. Our party has now decided to go it alone in Bengal."" 	After Banerjee's sudden comments, the Congress has adopted a conciliatory approach with Ramesh asserting that the opposition bloc INDIA ""cannot be imagined without Mamata Banerjee"".
The CPI (M)-led Left Front, Congress, and the TMC are part of the 28-party INDIA bloc.
In the 2019 elections, the TMC secured 22 seats, Congress won two, and the BJP bagged 18 seats in the state.
TMC had previously allied with the Congress in the 2001 assembly polls, the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, and the 2011 assembly polls, leading to the ousting of the CPI (M)-led Left Front government of 34 years.

Addressing a Republic Day function in Ludhiana, Mann said the tableaus which were ""rejected"" by the Centre were on Friday included as part of the parade in the state.
Mann also took on the Centre on some other issues and said Punjab is a very loyal state and a situation should not be created where this loyalty is mistrusted.
Recently, the chief minister had said the Narendra Modi government rejected the tableau of his state because of its ""anti-Punjab syndrome"".
The Centre has rejected as ""baseless"" Mann's criticism of the BJP-led government for not including the state's tableau in the Republic Day parade and his allegations of discrimination.
In a statement following Mann's allegations, the Ministry of Defence earlier said, ""The tableau proposal of Punjab was considered in the first three rounds of a meeting of the expert committee. After the third round... the tableau of Punjab could not be taken forward... for not aligning to the broader themes of this year's tableau."" 	At the Ludhiana Republic Day event, where he unfurled the national flag, Mann said Punjabis have made countless sacrifices for the motherland, fought wars and were at the forefront of the country's freedom struggle.
""But it is sad when Punjab's tableaus were not included in the Republic Day parade. Just now, we have taken out these tableaus here before you. Is there anything in them which is odd? These tableaus show photos of our prominent freedom fighters, our rich culture, sacrifices of our valiant heroes. Then how can you celebrate and imagine a Republic Day without them,"" he told the gathering.
Mann said Punjab meets the food needs of the nation. ""Our water table has gone down. And then they take cudgels, they tell us they won't give MSP,"" he said, attacking the Centre.
The chief minister said Punjab shares a 553-km-long border with Pakistan and ""drones, drugs, weapons keep coming in from there. We have to pay attention on that front too"".
""Punjab is a very loyal state. Kindly don't create such a situation, don't mistrust our loyalty,"" he added.
Mann also said that he was anguished with the Army not giving a guard of honour during the last rites of Agniveer Amritpal Singh, who died in Jammu and Kashmir on October 11 last year.
The chief minister later shared the news on the personal front too, saying, ""I want to make a personal announcement. In my home too, I am expecting the birth of a child in March. My wife Dr Gurpreet is seven-month pregnant... Our only wish is that be it a girl or a boy, the child should be healthy."" 	He further said his government was taking several steps to empower women. ""We believe in 'kaam ki rajneeti' and not 'naam ki rajneeti'. We have adopted the model of the Kejriwal government in Punjab too,"" Mann added.
He said that on Saturday, the Punjab government will launch the Sadak Surakhya Force (Road Safety Force) to provide timely assistance to road accident victims.

“My RELIGION has not taught me to accept and embrace a place of worship, whether it be a MANDIR, MASJID, CHURCH or GURUDWARA, which has been built over HATRED, VIOLENCE and the dead bodies of innocents. Period!” Abhishek posted on X.
A Trinamul MP said chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew attempted to underscore the history of the 16th century Babri Masjid at the site, demolished by saffron camp constituents on December 6, 1992.
“While the BJP and others in the saffron ecosystem are glorifying the event, our leader issued a simple reminder to the nation,” said a senior Trinamul leader.
On Monday, Abhishek’s party will conduct a number of unity and amity exercises across the state. His aunt will visit Kalighat temple and offer puja at the shrine before taking part in a 3.9km march, visiting several places of worship of various religions on her way from the Hazra crossing, before an integration rally at the Park Circus Maidan.
A source said the Trinamul dispensation was putting its best foot forward to bring representatives from all religions to the exercise, to showcase the power of its inclusive politics.
Trinamul will hit the streets with such interfaith rallies in all 341 blocks of the state. Trinamul leaders have been asked to visit major places of worship of various communities before taking out those rallies.
A Trinamul leader said apart from people from different faiths, several outfits of various Hindu castes and sects would take part in the interfaith rally in Calcutta.
“We are trying to bring all social and religious outfits of the state to the interfaith rallies. At least a dozen such organisations have already supported the move and ensured participation in the rallies in Calcutta and districts,” said a leader.
Suman Banerjee, the secretary of Bangiyo Sanatan Brahman Sangathan, an organisation of 70,000 Hindu priests, has decided to join the rallies.
“At least 3,000 people from our outfit will take part in the chief minister’s rally in Calcutta. Our members will also participate in interfaith rallies in various blocks across Bengal,” he said.
Tapasili Federation, a national outfit of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the OBCs, has also sent a letter to Mamata, pledging their participation.
“The representatives of various SC and ST communities, including those from Matua and Rajbanshi communities will take part in the interfaith rallies. A delegation of around 500 people will take part in Mamata Banrjee’s march,” said Mrityunjay Mallik, the national president of the Federation."
0SUMWDVXLB_QWI9BH2GC5YRYIG,PM Narendra Modi to Ram temple critics: Introspect and change your thinking,"Piyush Srivastava Ayodhya Published 23.01.24, 05:41 AM","Piyush Srivastava Ayodhya Published 23.01.24, 05:41 AM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/pm-narendra-modi-to-ram-temple-critics-introspect-and-change-your-thinking/cid/1995557,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked critics of the Ayodhya movement and the Ram temple to “introspect” and change their thinking, addressing a VIP gathering after participating in the consecration of the shrine as the chief guest in Ayodhya on Monday.
“The way we have opened the locks of history suggests that our future is going to be more beautiful than the past. There was a time when some people would say a fire would break out if the Ram temple was built,” Modi, who had performed the first aarti before the 4.24ft-tall idol, said.
“Such people don’t understand the sanctity of Indian society. The construction of the temple of Ram Lalla symbolises peace, patience, harmony and coordination.”
He went on: “It is a temple of national awakening in the form of the Ram temple. Ram is the faith of India, the foundation of India/ Ram is the thought of India, the law of India/ Ram is the consciousness of India, the contemplation of India/ Ram is the prestige of India, the might of India/ Ram is the flow, Ram is the influence/ Ram is the norm, Ram is the policy/ Ram is the permanence, Ram is the continuity/ Ram is vast, Ram is expansive/ Ram is all-encompassing, Ram is the universe, the soul of the universe.”
Modi added: “I can see that the construction (of the temple) is producing energy and not fire. The Ram temple has inspired us to take the path to a bright future. I would call on those people (the critics) to come and feel it, introspect about your thinking. Ram is energy and not fire; Ram is a solution and not a dispute; Ram is not only present but also endless.”
Modi said: “A nation stands after discarding the sense of slavery. People will discuss this date even after 1,000 years. It is by the grace of Ram that we are living this moment, we are watching it happen…. I can feel that godly moment…. The godly powers are present around us.”
Modi also said: “While defining ‘Ram’, the rishis have said, ‘Ramayantiswin iti Ramah’, which means that one who is immersed in the Self is Ram. Ram is in everything, from the mind to the mountains and the traditions.
“People have expressed Ram in their own fashion in different ages. And this Ramras (the pleasure of saying ‘Ram’) flows like a continuous life. People from every corner of India have invoked Ramras since ancient times. Ramkatha (the story of Ram’s life) is Shiva and the Ramayan is endless. The ideas of Ram, the values of Ram, the education of Ram are the same everywhere.”
Modi took his seat at the sanctum sanctorum at 12.10pm and all the rituals were over at 1.17pm, which means the temple was officially open to ordinary devotees.
However, the public will be able to offer prayers there only from Tuesday since the premises were on Monday hosting some 8,000 of India’s rich, famous and influential, invited to the event by the temple trust.
The temple stands at the site where a mob of kar sevaks had demolished the Babri Masjid on December 6, a widely condemned incident that led to riots and changed Indian politics in the long run. Many Opposition leaders had declined the invitation to Monday’s consecration accusing the BJP of turning it into a political event.
Modi thanked the judiciary for the Supreme Court’s November 2019 verdict that handed the site to Hindus to build the temple. The court had, however, denounced the Babri demolition.
The Prime Minister appeared to be arguing that the Ayodhya movement and the construction of the temple were mandated by the Constitution.
“Lord Ram is present in the first copy of India’s Constitution. The legal battle continued for decades even after the Constitution was adopted. I thank the judiciary ofIndia, who saved the honour of justice. The temple of Lord Ram was built in accordance with the law,” he said.
A constitutional expert told this newspaper that the first copy of the Constitution of India carried a painting of Ram, Sita and Lakshman at the beginning of the third chapter, which enshrines the fundamental rights of citizens.
Modi said the whole of India, as well as many other countries, was commemorating the day.
The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which dominates the temple trust, had urged Hindus across the country to celebrate the occasion at temples near their homes. The VHP had distributed puja ingredients at some places.
But in Ayodhya town, all the celebration seemed confined to the main road, Ram Path, where the temple is located. The townspeople have been trying to largely stay indoors since January 14, when the security forces arrived in large numbers and barricaded areas near the temple.
Residents began stepping out of their homes gradually after 6pm on Monday, by when the Prime Minister and most other political heavyweights had left Ayodhya.
“The heat seems to have subsided with the departure of the powerful politicians and the heavy security around them,” Shankar Acharya, a small-time sadhu, said while lounging on a bench outside a closed tea stall on Dant Dhavan Street.
“The dust will settle down after the troops receive their marching orders in the night. The residents of Ayodhya town are heaving a sigh of relief after many days.”
Modi interacted with the workers involved in the temple construction and asked them to speed up the shrine’s completion."
0T386C0V1O_6YIHK0P3E3C4I9T,I cannot go to Sankardeva's birthplace but others can during a law and order crisis: Rahul Gandhi,"PTI Nagaon (Assam) Published 22.01.24, 02:09 PM","PTI Nagaon (Assam) Published 22.01.24, 02:09 PM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/i-cannot-go-to-sankardevas-birthplace-but-others-can-during-a-law-and-order-crisis-rahul-gandhi/cid/1995464,"During a law and order crisis, everyone can go to the birthplace of Vaishnav saint Srimanta Sankardeva, only ''Rahul Gandhi cannot go'', the Congress leader said in Assam's Nagaon on Monday.
Gandhi was stopped at Haibargaon en route to the sattra (Sankardeva's birthplace) where he along with senior Congress leaders and supporters staged a dharna while party MP Gaurav Gogoi and Batadrava MLA Sibamoni Bora proceeded to the birthplace to resolve the issue.
After they returned, Gandhi told reporters that just like Sankardeva, ''we also believe in bringing people together and not spreading hatred''.
''He is like a guru to us and gives us direction. So I had thought when I came to Assam, I should offer my respects to him'', he said.
He said they had received an invitation on January 11 but ''on Sunday we were told that there is a law and order situation'', he added.
''This is strange as there is a law and order situation in the area, but Gaurav Gogoi and all can go but only Rahul Gandhi cannot go'', Gandhi said.
''There may be some reason but I will go to Batadrava when I get an opportunity. It is my belief that both Assam and the entire nation should follow the path shown by Sankardeva'', he said.
The managing committee of the Sri Sankardeva Sattra on Sunday had announced that they will not allow the Congress leader to visit the sattra before 3pm on January 22 after Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier in the day said at a press conference that he requested Gandhi not to visit before the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.
Gogoi, who visited the sattra along with Bora, said that there was no crowd in and around the premises and ''it was absolutely empty''.
''A lie and rumour was spread that a law and order situation could have risen if Gandhi had visited the place. The chief minister has stamped a black spot in the history of Batadrava and the legacy of Sri Sankardeva'', the Congress MP from Kaliabor said.
''We offered prayers of peace and harmony on behalf of Rahulji and all the 'pujaris' who were present on the premises extended their blessings to him'', he said.
The pujaris told ''us that they were told that a law and order situation may arise as many organisations have planned events on the premises on the occasion of the consecration of Ram temple but we found it absolutely empty'', Gogoi added.
''The situation was absolutely peaceful in the area but the administration spread a lie regarding the crowd and the law and order condition'', he said.
Gogoi said as they were coming out of the sattra, a woman member came and presented them with a 'gamosa' (scarf) for Rahul Gandhi ''which we have handed over to him while the 'pujaris' said that they will send the 'prasad' (offerings) after they finish their prayers''.
Gandhi and his entourage had started for the sattra in the morning but were stopped at Haibargaon with Nagaon SP Navaneet Mahanta and additional district commissioner Lakhyajyoti Das explaining why he could not be allowed to visit the sattra.
Gandhi questioned police on why he was being stopped from visiting the sattra.
""Will PM Modi now decide who will visit a temple and when,"" Gandhi said.
""We do not want to create any problems, simply pray at the sattra,"" Gandhi told police.
Tight security arrangements, deployment of a huge police force and blockade of roads was in force around the sattra.
AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh said the authorities had told Gandhi that there could be a law and order problem and when he (Gandhi) offered to go alone, the request was turned down.
''It is clear that it is their deliberate policy to prevent him from going to the holy place which occupies a place of social, cultural and religious importance for all'', Ramesh said.
Following this, a lot of phone calls were made by the authorities and then Gogoi and Bora were allowed to proceed to the sattra to talk with the members of the managing committee to resolve the issue and ensure Gandhi's visit to the sacred place.
Ramesh asserted Modi exerted pressure on the Assam government to prevent Gandhi from visiting the birthplace of Sankardeva to pay his obeisance.
''We were given permission to visit the sattra on January 11 and the managing committee had welcomed the visit but suddenly on January 20, we were told that he could visit only after the consecration of Ram temple was over'', he said.
It is clear that ''the arrogant powers want the entire focus of the camera on them and pressure was exerted on the Assam government to take this step'', he said.
Ramesh said that the yatra will resume on the planned route from 2pm.

The research ship is thought to be mapping underwater formations and also keeping an eye on Indian naval activity in this part of the oceans.
The Xiang Yang Hong 3 is currently crossing through the Sunda Strait that connects the Java Sea and the Indian Ocean and showing its destination as Male, the Maldivian capital and main port.
The research vessel has possibly been forced to bypass Sri Lanka after that country started 2024 by announcing a ban on Chinese research ships for a year through 2024.
China designates vessels like the Xiang Yang Hong 3 as non-military ships but their primary purpose and research is almost certainly linked to military goals. Mapping the underwater formations in this region, for instance, is highly useful for any Chinese  submarines that might operate in these areas.
This particular vessel, the Xiang Yang Hong 3 has made two earlier long trips to the waters around India. In November 2019 it spent almost a month in the Bay of Bengal, surveying two areas called the Ninety East Ridge and the Cocos Basin area. Then in November 2020 it criss-crossed the Arabian Basin Area and the Carlsberg Ridge.
India is already facing a diplomatic contretemps in the Maldives and last week External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar held what was described as a ""frank conversation"" with his Maldivian counterpart Moosa Zameer at an international meeting in Kampala.
Zameer is said to have repeated the Maldivian demand that India should withdraw its 87 military personnel in the Maldives by March 15. It looks very unlikely that India will be willing to conduct such a withdrawal, especially at such short notice.
The new Maldivian President, Mohamed Muizzu, has also angered India by refusing to extend a pact that allows us to conduct hydrographic studies in the country’s waters. India has also installed a network of 10 radar stations in the Maldives.
In October-November last year, another Chinese research vessel the Shi Yan 6 docked in Colombo and conducted two days of research off the Sri Lankan coast. And in August 2022 there were strong protests from India when the Yuan Wang 5 docked at Hambantota, the Sri Lankan port given on a 99-year lease to China.
The naval rivalry between India and its allies and China is also hotting up in other ways. Last November five Chinese naval vessels including one submarine took part in joint exercises off the coast of Pakistan. And in mid-December an Indian naval ship took part in low-key exercises with the Philippines navy. The Philippines has been having regular standoffs with the Chinese in the South China Sea.
China is also flexing its muscles and showing that it intends to have a heightened presence in the Indian Ocean region in other ways. At a recent conference it talked about the China-Indian Ocean region, possibly showing how it has designs on the waters around India."
0W0MHWDLJN_ZJUIK4ODWSXDTXP,Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rebuffs pressure from President Joe Biden,"Adam Rasgon Jerusalem Published 22.01.24, 04:55 AM","Adam Rasgon Jerusalem Published 22.01.24, 04:55 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-again-rebuffs-pressure-from-president-joe-biden/cid/1995332,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has doubled down on his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state, again rebuffing pressure from President Biden to agree to that path after the war in Gaza is over.
“I will not compromise on full Israeli security control of the entire area west of the Jordan River — and that is irreconcilable with a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu posted on Saturday evening in Hebrew on X, formerly Twitter.
Netanyahu’s comments came just a day after Biden spoke to him about a two-state solution and floated the possibility of a disarmed Palestinian nation that would not threaten Israel’s security. Biden has argued that the creation of a Palestinian state is the only viable long-term resolution to a conflict that has dragged on for decades, repeating a position held by most American presidents and European leaders in recent history.
While there was no indication that Netanyahu would ease his strenuous opposition, which is popular with his fragile Right-wing political coalition, Biden expressed optimism that they might yet find consensus.
“There are a number of types of two-state solutions,” the President told reporters at the White House several hours after the call, their first in nearly a month amid tension over the war. “There’s a number of countries that are members of the UN that are still — don’t have their own militaries. Number of states that have limitations.” He added: “And so I think there’s ways in which this could work.”
On Sunday, Grant Shapps, Britain’s defence secretary, called Netanyahu’s latest comments “disappointing.”
“There isn’t another option,” Shapps told Sky News in a televised interview. “The whole world has agreed that the two-state solution is the best way forward.”
António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said that denying statehood for the Palestinian people was “unacceptable”.
“The right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all,” Guterres wrote on X, without referencing Netanyahu.
The Biden administration and the Israeli government have diverged sharply over how Gaza will be governed when the fighting ends. President Biden and his top diplomat, Antony J. Blinken, have urged Israeli officials to move toward the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state.
Biden has suggested that a “revitalised” Palestinian Authority, which is based in the West Bank, could take over Gaza once Hamas has been removed from power there. Netanyahu has rejected the idea of the authority returning to the enclave.
Despite support from the international community, a two-state approach still faces enormous obstacles, including waning support for it among the Israeli and Palestinian populations, the continued building of settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and a divided Palestinian leadership.
Analysts pointed out that Netanyahu’s willingness to undermine his American counterpart was becoming routine.
“Humiliating Biden has become a daily occurrence for Netanyahu,” Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington, wrote on social media.

10ZPKJV37C_U9MYRP5QZAP611Q,Debaloy Bhattacharya: ‘Shri Swapankumarer Badami Hyenar Kobole is the most difficult film I have made’,"Soujannya Das Calcutta Published 22.01.24, 03:46 PM","Soujannya Das Calcutta Published 22.01.24, 03:46 PM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/entertainment/debaloy-bhattacharya-shri-swapankumarer-badami-hyenar-kobole-is-the-most-difficult-film-i-have-made/cid/1995479,"Director Debaloy Bhattacharya has waited a decade to make a film on Swapan Kumar’s works. Now with the accolades pouring in for Shri Swapankumarer Badami Hyenar Kobole — starring Abir Chatterjee as Dipak Chatterjee and Paran Bandopadhyay as Swapan Kumar — Debaloy tells us why he has been fascinated by Swapan Kumar and the challenges he faced in making this film.
What is your personal association with Swapan Kumar’s works?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: I am a fan of pulp literature. When I was a child, I wasn’t allowed to read Swapan Kumar. When I grew up, I explored old Bengali literature. Swapan Kumar seemed quite intriguing to me. I felt that decades back someone had dared to write something magical. The thing that struck me is that this person had managed to create a world of his own. Honestly, the stories aren’t great. I am a fan because while reading the stories, they showed the same world differently. Swapan Kumar’s stories don’t have the values by which we judge good literature. That is why he was never considered a good writer. People considered him a writer of cheap, pulp fiction. But they missed the fact that he was able to create a fantasy world of his own in his city, Kolkata. In today’s time, I feel he is very relevant and important.
Our regular detective literature has become too cliched. The way we see the city through them has been done to death and I felt there was a need for a fresh way of thinking and imagination. I wanted to look at Kolkata differently and so the film is a homage to Swapan Kumar.
Have you been a fan of Dipak Chatterjee? What makes him different from Feluda and Byomkesh Bakshi?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: The entire value system is different from Feluda and Byomkesh Bakshi. Dipak Chatterjee’s imagination is wild and fantastical. Fantasy is never considered a serious form. If you look at our lives, fantasy is a very important thing.
⁠You had been planning Shri Swapankumarer Badami Hyenar Kobole for a decade...
Debaloy Bhattacharya: I wrote it in 2004 and then the story changed multiple times. We had no clue how people would respond. Hoichoi Studios believed in making something different and stood by it. I wanted to make a surreal film with many layers, subtexts and non-linear narratives, and decided to create this world within our limited resources. We did that.
It took nine years to make my film Dracula Sir. The type of narrative that I like to tell is different, for which I have to wait for an opportunity. At a certain point, I convince my producers who think they can take the risk and they make it. There is a lot of money involved and most of the time I don’t know whether the money will come back or not. Hoichoi Studios was happy with the response. I never hoped for such positive reviews and responses. You feel really good when people understand your craft. I always knew that the audience was intelligent.
Filmmaker Debaloy Bhattacharya.
⁠What made you cast Abir Chatterjee as Dipak Chatterjee and Paran Bandyopadhyay as Shri Swapan Kumar?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: Somebody said casting Abir was a master stroke. It is because Abir is carrying the baggage of all the literary detective characters. If you watch the film, it is evident how pissed he is with the baggage he is carrying. That is what Dipak Chatterjee also wanted to say in the novel. That is how Abir connected with it. Abir said that he is bored with all the usual detectives who solve the cases like an intelligent person and the case is either a murder mystery or a treasure hunt.
Everybody is saying this is Abir’s best performance.
Paranda is a legend. He enjoyed working on the film a lot. Having him in the film was a blessing. He was always in my mind as Swapan Kumar. At the beginning of the film, we have a picture of Swapan Kumar getting morphed into Paranda and they look so similar.
⁠Satire and pulp fiction are quite unusual genres in Indian cinema. How challenging was it to make the film in this genre?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: It was quite challenging. The first challenge was to convince the actors and the team that I was making a film in this genre. If you read the script, you will not understand the whole setup. It is not linear; it’s like bits and pieces of everything. On paper, it’s very confusing apparently. It was only on the screen that they realised what it was. A serious action scene with emotion and so much humour is a very difficult thing to handle. I didn’t know whether it would come out well. It is the most difficult film I have made so far.
Shri Swapankumarer ⁠Badami Hyenar Kobole has a graphic novel vibe and a unique style for its use of colours.
Debaloy Bhattacharya: I wanted to create my world just as Swapan Kumar wanted to create his. A Kolkata that people have not seen. A Kolkata that is exciting, interesting, colourful, where in every nook and corner there’s an adventure happening. It turned out that way. I wanted a lot of energy. I like colours. I come from a background of painting. When I used to draw, it used to be a grand narrative. One of my teachers who was very fond of me would say that my films are an extension of my paintings, images and thoughts. All my films are different from each other in their visual treatment.
⁠In your recent Prime Video series PI Meena, you directed Tanya Maniktala. How was the experience?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: Tanya is a fantastic human being. It was like a cakewalk with her. It could have been a very good experience but Covid hit us and made our life quite difficult. We had to shoot in a terrible situation. We had to compromise a lot on the shoot because of the pandemic, but the team and the actors were great.
⁠Having been a painter, what made you choose cinema as your primary medium of expression?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: I realised that painting is a beautiful thing as a personal medium. But I wanted to go out and connect with the masses. I don’t make films for festivals. I make films that are different, but for the masses. It doesn’t always have to be commercial, and it also doesn’t have to appease the festival audience. I don’t want to go abroad and collect awards. I want people to watch my films. That is what pushed me from painting to making films. Films have been my passion right from my school days. To take it up as a profession was a challenge.
⁠What is next for you?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: I am working on a quirky series for Hoichoi. I don’t have any plans in Bombay. I love working in my mother tongue. I have to give a lot of time to a Hindi project, which I don’t like. It took me more than a year to finish Badami Hyenar Kobole but if I go to Bombay and start a project, I will get detached from here."

The accused also assumed that they would be let off even if they were arrested, thinking they were not committing any ""serious crime"", they said.
According to a senior police officer, the mastermind is suspected to be Manoranjan D, who had created a 'Bhagat Singh Fan Club' page on the social networking site Facebook and used it to motivate ""like-minded"" people to do ""something big"" for fame.
""The accused were known to each other for the last four years but the plan to breach parliament was hatched a year ago,"" the officer said.
However, not everyone in the fan club was on board with the idea of doing anything illegal like breaching parliament's security. As a result, several other members had left in the days leading to the December 13 incident, police said.
""Since Manoranjan had access to the BJP MP in Mysore, he decided to barge into parliament and replicate freedom fighter Bhagat Singh's act which was done in the Delhi Assembly during British rule,"" another officer said.
""They did not have enough money to hold in-person meetings, therefore they decided to remain in touch through social media and Signals app,"" the official said.
""Because of the shortage of money, they stayed at Vicky Sharma's residence in Gurugram before committing the crime on December 13, 2023,"" he said.
Vicky Sharma was also a part of the fan club on Facebook. He was released after being questioned by police.
During investigations, Manoranjan and Sagar Sharma -- who jumped into the gallery of parliament -- told investigators that there were fewer security personnel at the new parliament building as compared to the old one.
Manoranjan also told police that he carried out a reconnaissance of the old building during the monsoon session.
In a major security breach on the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament terror attack on December 13, Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan D jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber from the public gallery during the Zero Hour, released yellow gas from canisters and shouted slogans before being overpowered by the MPs.
Around the same time, two other accused -- Shinde and Azad -- also sprayed coloured gas from canisters while shouting ""tanashahi nahi chalegi"" outside the Parliament premises.
The two others Lalit Jha and Mahesh Kumawat had surrendered before the Delhi Police, a day after the incident. They had allegedly destroyed the mobile phones of self and other four accused in Rajasthan.

Rakesh New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 06:58 AM","Basant Kumar Mohanty, K.M. Rakesh New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 06:58 AM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/jai-shri-ram-echoes-on-ftii-campus-students-attacked-during-ram-ke-naam-screening/cid/1995773,"A group of vandals barged into the campus of the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) in Pune on Tuesday, shouted “Jai Shri Ram” and allegedly assaulted students who were protesting the rise of communalism in the country.
On Monday night, a group of FTII students had arranged the screening of Anand Patwardhan’s documentary Ram Ke Naam, which traces the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.
According to a media release issued by the FTII Students Association (FTIISA), around 25 people entered the campus at 1.30pm on Tuesday, started chanting “Jai Shri Ram” and hurled abuses at the students.
FTIISA president Mankap Nokwoham, secretary Sayantan and some female students were allegedly beaten up. Mankap sustained multiple bruises. The security guards allegedly stood silent as the mob continued its rampage on the campus and reached the “wisdom tree”. Once police arrived, the mob started to disengage and the security guards took them back to the main gate. The cops allowed them to go.
“Innocent students were grievously attacked by these goons who barged into our campus while the security and staff were mere spectators. It is a blatant attack on the fundamental right to life of the students and a grave failure of law and order. FTII Students Association strongly stands against such a dire attack on our democratic rights as well as the lives of students,” said the media statement.
Patwardhan told The Telegraph that the Right-wing forces were attacking students on campuses where his documentary was being screened.
“In the last two days, there have been three incidents of attacks on students and organisers for screening the film Ram Ke Naam. It is an award-winning film and its screening cannot be stopped legally. The Right-wing forces have resorted to vandalism,” he said.
“The Right-wing forces do not want history to be told to the people. They want only Modi’s activities to be propagated,” he added.
In Kerala, CPM youth wing Democratic Youth Federation of India on Tuesday decided to screen Ram Ke Naam after Sangh Parivar activists tried to stop its screening by students of a film institute.
Students of K.R. Narayanan National Institute of Visual Science and Arts had originally scheduled the screening of the 1992 documentary at 7pm just outside the main gate of the facility in Kottayam on Monday. Sangh Parivar activists allegedly threatened to harm the students if they went ahead with the screening, prompting police to step in and defuse the tension.
The students eventually moved the screen within the campus and showed the documentary. “The Sangh Parivar activists openly threatened to chop our limbs and used misogynistic comments and actions against our female students,” the institute’s students’ council chairperson, Sreedevan K. Perumal, told The Telegraph on Tuesday.
The DYFI on Tuesday decided to screen the documentary everywhere in the state and even help anyone who wants to screen it.
V.K. Sanoj, the DYFI’s Kerala state secretary, told reporters: “The DYFI will not only withstand any threat from the Sangh Parivar but will also screen Ram Ke Naam across the state and help anyone wanting to screen it.” Sanoj added."

Nadda, accompanied by Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva and other party leaders, was present at the Jhandewalan Temple here while Shah, along with Union Minister Meenakshi Lekhi and other leaders, was present at Lakshmi Narayan Temple, also known as Birla Temple.
They offered prayers at these temples on the occasion.
""It is a historic day which has come after 500 years of waiting. It is a very auspicious day for all of us,"" Nadda told reporters.
Emphasising that the wait and promise of five centuries was fulfilled on Monday, Home Minister Amit Shah said many generations sacrificed so much waiting for this moment, but no ""fear and terror"" could shake the resolve to build the temple again at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi.
In a message on 'X', Shah also said that today, this resolve has been fulfilled under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Defence Minister Singh described the event in Ayodhya as a ""revolutionary work"" and said those who witnessed this moment are fortunate.
""Everyone feels that a new era is beginning. We all are feeling that after a long time, Maryada Purushottam Ram is returning again to Ayodhya,"" Singh told reporters here.
“We all are fortunate that we are getting the opportunity to witness the moment,"" he said, adding, ""Our prime minister has started a new era. And, he has the blessings of Lord Ram."" 	 Several other Union ministers, including Hardeep Singh Puri, Ashwini Vaishnaw, and Jitendra Singh also watched the live streaming of the ceremony and took part in special prayers held at different parts of the city.
Consecration of the Ram Lalla idol was held amid religious fervour in the newly built temple in Ayodhya. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took part in the 'pran pratishtha' rituals in the presence of Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.
A fireworks show was held at the Delhi BJP to rejoice the moment. Party workers and commoners also clicked pictures at a selfie point set up at the Pant Marg office.
BJP MP Gautam Gambhir celebrated the consecration ceremony with the women at GB Road near New Delhi railway station and presented them sarees and shawls.
""Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be remembered forever for the occasion that brought the country together from North to South and from East to West,"" Gambhir said speaking at the function.
The Delhi BJP had decorated 2,486 temples and other public spots for the public to watch the 'pran pratishtha' ceremony live. The party leaders also organised 'bhandaras' (community kitchens) across the city.
In the evening, the party leaders and workers lighted 'diyas' at their residences and public places to celebrate the ""momentous occasion"" as Diwali.
BJP leader and former Union minister Vijay Goel said he will soon visit Ayodhya to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla, accompanying the 'karsevaks' (volunteers) who had visited the place along with him during the Ram temple movement in 1992.

The six metre-long magnetometer boom is deployed in the Halo orbit at the Lagrange point L-1, on January 11, the space agency said, noting that the boom had been in stowed condition for 132 days since the Aditya-L1 launch.
According to ISRO,  the boom carries two state-of-the-art, high-accuracy fluxgate magnetometer sensors that measure the low intensity interplanetary magnetic field in space.
""The sensors are deployed at distances of 3 and 6 metres from the spacecraft body. Mounting them at these distances minimises the impact of the spacecraft generated magnetic field on measurements, and using two of them assists precise estimation of this influence. The dual sensor system facilitates cancelling out the spacecraft's magnetic influence,"" it said.
The boom segments are constructed from carbon fibre reinforced polymer and serve as interfaces for the sensor mounting and mechanism elements, ISRO said.
The articulated boom mechanism comprises five segments interconnected through spring-driven hinge mechanisms, allowing for folding and deploying actions, it was noted.
India’s maiden solar mission Aditya-L1 reached the L1 point, located roughly 1.5 million km from earth enabling the spacecraft to view the sun continuously, on January six, 127 days after it was launched on September 2, 2023.
The solar observatory at L1 is aimed at  “Observing and understanding the chromospheric and coronal dynamics of the Sun” in a continuous manner.

The decision follows the US and Britain, with support from other nations, striking military targets of the Iran-aligned group which has been launching attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea that is says are linked to Israel.
The US government last week also returned the group to a list of terrorist groups as Washington tries to stem attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis have said their attacks are in solidarity with the Palestinians as Israel strikes Gaza.
“The ministry ... would like to stress that you must inform officials and workers with US and British citizenships to prepare to leave the country within 30 days,” said a letter sent by the Houthi foreign ministry to the UN’s acting humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, Peter Hawkins.
The letter also ordered foreign organisations to not hire American and British citizens for Yemen’s operations.
Houthi top negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam confirmed the letter’s authenticity to Reuters. The office of Hawkins, who is himself a UK national, did not respond to a request for comment. The US and British embassies in Yemen did not respond to a request for comment."

Meanwhile, the death toll from a strike the day before on a crowded shelter in Gaza rose to 12, with over 75 wounded, according to Thomas White, a senior official with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.
The agency did not directly blame Israel, which is the only party to the conflict that has tanks.
The Israeli military said it has “currently ruled out” that the strike was carried out by its aircraft or artillery but was still investigating. It says the building might ha
ve been hit by a Hamas rocket.
The fighting in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis has isolated its two main hospitals, stranding hundreds of patients and thousands of displaced people inside.
A third hospital was evacuated overnight, White said. Thousands of people rushed to escape farther south in recent days, crowding into shelters and tent camps near the border with Egypt."

The AAP is part of the 28-party INDIA bloc along with the Congress, TMC and the CPI(M)-led Left Front.

However, the AAP has entered into an alliance with the Congress for the Chandigarh mayoral poll.
Replying to a question on his party's alliance with the Congress, Mann said he has said many times that ""Punjab will become a hero in the country and the AAP will win 13-0 in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls"".

A seven-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, which is hearing arguments on the vexed question regarding the minority status of AMU, observed Parliament is an ""eternal, indestructible body"" under the Indian Union.
""How can you not accept an amendment by Parliament?"" the CJI asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was arguing for the Centre.
""Mr Solicitor, Parliament is an eternal, indestructible body under the Indian Union, and irrespective of which government represents the cause of the Union of India, Parliament's cause is eternal, indivisible and indestructible and we can't hear the Government of India say that amendment which the Parliament made is something I don't stand by. You have to stand by it,"" Justice Chandrachud observed.
The bench, which also comprised Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Surya Kant, J B Pardiwala, Dipankar Datta, Manoj Misra and Satish Chandra Sharma, said the government has the option of taking the amendment route and amend the law again.
""This is an amendment by the Parliament (in 1981). Is the government accepting the amendment?"" Justice Khanna asked.
""I am not,"" Mehta responded.
The law officer said he was not arguing a matter of ""A versus B"" and that he was before a seven-judge constitution bench answering constitutional questions.
""The amendment in question was subjected to challenge before the (Allahabad) high court and there is a judgement declaring that it is unconstitutional for A, B, C, D grounds, and as a law officer, it is my right as well as my entitlement and duty to say that this view appears to be correct,"" he asserted.
The Allahabad High Court had in January 2006 struck down the provision of the AMU (Amendment) Act, 1981 by which the varsity was accorded minority status.
The CJI said this would be ""radical"" because a law officer would be then telling the court that ""I don't abide by what Parliament has done"".
""You have to stand by what Parliament has done. Parliament is supreme. Parliament is undoubtedly supreme in its law making function. Parliament can always amend a statute, in which case a law officer can say I have an amended statute,"" Justice Chandrachud observed.
""Can we hear any organ of the Union government say that notwithstanding a parliamentary amendment, I don't accept this amendment,"" the CJI said, adding  Parliament is an eternal, indivisible and indestructible entity under democracy.
Mehta said he was supporting the 2006 high court verdict. 	 	""How can you say I don't accept the validity of an amendment?"" the bench asked him.
Responding to the query, the solicitor general said, ""Would a law officer be expected to say that whatever amendments were made in the Constitution of India during Emergency were true only because they were made by the Parliament"".
The CJI observed that is why the 44th amendment Act, 1978 came in.
""The 44th amendment came in only for that. The 44th amendment came to redress the evils which were perpetrated in the name of a constitutional amendment,"" he said, adding, ""The power to decide that is in the elected body of the people which is Parliament. Parliament can always say that what we did during  Emergency was wrong and we are rectifying it by the 44th amendment"".
The 44th Amendment Act was brought in by the Janata Party government against the background of Emergency.
It proposed certain changes to the Constitution that would have the effect of undermining its secular or democratic character, abridging or taking away fundamental rights, and prejudicing or impeding free and fair elections on the basis of adult suffrage.
It said the right to property, which has been the subject of several constitutional amendments, would cease to be a fundamental right and become just a legal right. The elimination of property from the list of fundamental rights would, however, ensure that minorities’ freedom to create and govern educational institutions of their choosing would not be harmed, the 44th amendment said.
Mehta referred to the high court verdict and said the 1981 Amendment Act was set aside and therefore, it was not in the statute book now.
""There is an affidavit filed by the government. It's not my stand…,"" he said.
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for one of the parties in favour of AMU's minority status, referred to how the then attorney general had defended the Emergency provision.
""I was sitting in the court when the then Attorney General of India Niren De was standing here and arguing what is being done is right. I (attorney general) defend the Emergency provision. Why? Because he could not say otherwise,"" Sibal said.
Mehta said the distinction is that the then attorney general was not in a situation where one high court has struck it (1981 amendment) down and the provision no longer exists in the statute book.
The arguments in the matter remained inconclusive and would resume on January 30.
The top court had on February 12, 2019 referred to a seven-judge bench the hugely contentious issue for adjudication. A similar reference was made earlier.
A five-judge constitution bench had in the S Azeez Basha versus Union of India case in 1967 held that since AMU was a central university, it cannot be considered a minority institution.
However, it got back its minority status when Parliament passed the AMU (Amendment) Act in 1981.
The Congress-led UPA government at the Centre moved in appeal against the 2006 high court order. The university also filed a separate petition against it.
The NDA government spearheaded by the BJP told the apex court in 2016 that it will withdraw the appeal filed by the erstwhile UPA dispensation."

Harmanpreet Singh, 30, and Kulbir Kaur, 43, were found guilty of conspiracy to commit forced labour and other charges after the pair forced the victim, Singh’s cousin, to work at Singh’s North Chesterfield convenience store for little pay, the Department of Justice said in a statement on Monday.
According to court documents, the victim — who was a minor at the time — came to the US in 2018 after the couple promised to help him enrol in school. After arriving, Singh and Kaur took the boy's immigration documents and immediately put him to work, prosecutors said.
According to court documents, the victim was forced to sleep in an office inside the store for days at a time. He was denied access to food, and the couple also refused his requests to return to India and forced him to overstay his visa.
Prosecutors said Singh also slapped and kicked the victim when he requested his immigration documents and tried to leave. On several occasions, Singh also threatened the victim with a gun when he tried to take a day off and leave the store.
Prosecutors said the abuse and forced labour started in March 2018 and continued through May 2021.
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said the Singh couple exploited the victim’s trust and his desire to attend school in the United States and then inflicted physical and mental abuse against him, all so they could keep him working for their profit.
“These defendants engaged in an egregious bait-and-switch, luring the victim with false promises of an education in the United States and instead subjecting him to gruelling hours, degrading living conditions and a litany of mental and physical abuse,” said US Attorney Jessica D Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia.
“Forced labour and human trafficking are abhorrent crimes that have no place in our society, and I am grateful to our team of prosecutors, agents and support staff for ensuring that justice was done in this case,” Aber said.
A sentencing hearing is scheduled for May 8. They face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, up to five years of supervised release, a fine of up to USD 250,000 and mandatory restitution for the forced labour charge.

Set in a fictional Indian village, where women don’t even get their pictures clicked without a ghoonghat (veil), the film starring Pratibha Ranta, Sparsh Shrivastav and Nitanshi Goel marks the directorial return of Dhobi Ghat helmer Kiran after a 13-year gap.
“Ghunghat uth chuke hai #LaapataaLadies trailer is out,” wrote the makers on Instagram, dropping the two-minute-twenty-five-second-long trailer on Wednesday.
The trailer begins with Sparsh's Deepak Kumar bringing his newlywed bride home after the wedding ceremony. However, the joyous celebrations come to an abrupt halt when the groom and his family realise that the bride Phool (Nitanshi) has been swapped with an unknown woman, Pushpa Rani (Pratibha), at the train station. The following day, when Deepak goes to file an FIR, a sardonic police officer (played by Ravi Kishan) subjects him and Pushpa to interrogation.
The traditional Indian practice of women covering their faces with a ‘ghoonghat’ plays a crucial role in the trailer, with the veil becoming both the root cause and the key to the mystery. Pushpa adamantly refuses to be photographed without her veil, while the only image Deepak has of his missing wife shows her concealing her face behind her ‘ghoonghat’. A humorous and thrilling journey unfolds as the police closely monitor Pushpa, suspecting her of harbouring ulterior motives in coming to Deepak's place. Meanwhile, subsequent sequences depict Phool in significant distress as she struggles to find her way back home.
The upcoming comedy is produced by Kiran’s ex-husband and actor Aamir Khan with Jyoti Deshpande of Jio Studios serving as the co-producer.
The makers recently shared a carousel on Instagram featuring pictures of Aamir, Kiran and the lead actors attending a special preview of the movie’s trailer in Mumbai.

Jaishankar, who arrived in Nigeria after attending the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Uganda, made the remarks while addressing the Indian community members here.
“We are today sending a message to the world, that this is also an India, which is proud of its traditions, of its culture, of its history,” said Jaishankar, who is here on his first visit as External Affairs Minister.
The minister said that in the world there are very few civilizations, who have survived as a modern nation and “we are one of them."" 	He highlighted developmental activities in India, saying there is a sense today that India is being built and there is a flow of investment.
On ties with Nigeria, Jaishankar said that the two sides have business of about USD 12-15 billion and invited Nigerian investors to invest in India.
“There are many more possibilities because actually, Indian capabilities in many areas are growing very, very strongly. I would say, we've had a long record in pharmaceuticals but today India, for example, has become a big producer of medical devices, which was not the case earlier,” he said.
Jaishankar will co-chair the sixth India-Nigeria Joint Commission Meeting (JCM) with his counterpart and meet with other leaders.
He will also inaugurate the third edition of the Nigeria-India Business Council meeting, deliver a speech at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, interact with business delegates and inaugurate a bust of Mahatma Gandhi.
He will also chair the regional conference of Indian heads of missions.
""India and Nigeria have traditionally enjoyed close and friendly relations. This is the external affairs minister's first visit to Nigeria which will further consolidate bilateral relations between the two countries,"" the MEA said.

I remembered standing on the roof of Kanak Bhavan overlooking the 450-year-old Babri Masjid as it was being pulled down on December 6, 1992, and being asked by a fellow journalist how I felt witnessing this monumental tragedy. He was obviously asking me this question as I was one of a handful of Muslims present on that fateful day. I replied that I felt hurt, rejected and unwanted. I was being told that India was no longer a country that Muslims could call their own.
The sadness then was not for the demolition of a mosque made out of bricks and mortar — there are thousands of masjids all over the country — but the destruction of the idea of Muslims being equal citizens of India. The Babri Masjid, which was under the protection of the Supreme Court, had begun to represent the rights of Muslims given to them by the Constitution of India. The frenzy, aggression and sheer scale of violence that was unleashed on the three-domed Babri Masjid was symbolic of the hatred that the kar sevaks bore towards Muslims.
From that watershed moment 31 years ago till today, much water has flown down the Saryu. The political party that brought down the Babri Masjid has reaped its electoral dividends and has established a New India which has no place for secularism or Muslims. The 200 million Indian Muslims have been relegated to the margins of society, alienated and dejected. They have become invisible only to be trotted out as terrorists or criminals; as cattle smugglers or love jihadists. They are now “Babur ki aulad”, sent off to Pakistan if they dare to open their mouths or worse still, publicly lynched. They are used as punching bags during elections in order to frighten and remind the majority community of their ‘victimhood’ and collect their votes.
A few days ago, I was asked by another journalist how I felt as a Muslim about the frenzied celebration of the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and my reply was “emotionless”. Muslims do not hate Lord Ram, in fact he is revered as Imam-e-Hind, but it is the forced swearing of allegiance that they object to. Chant “Jai Shri Ram” or pay with your life!
I was asked if the ruling class was being insensitive to the feelings of Muslims, my reply was if you don’t exist, how can your feelings matter? During the Ramjanmabhoomi movement of the late 1980s and 1990s, VHP leaders chanted the slogans with the Islamophobic slur “Jab katua kata jayega, toh Ram Ram chillayega”. It was considered disgusting then. But now it has become so acceptable that a BJP MP can call a Muslim MP in Parliament by that same slur and he is not even reprimanded, let alone punished.
With the Ram Mandir now built on the debris of the Babri Masjid, this is not the end of the nightmare for Muslims. “Yeh toh siraf jhanki hai, Abhi toh Mathura, Kashi baki hain” was another popular slogan in 1992, and it laid out the portents of the future. Ominously, the same slogan was heard in Ayodhya today after the consecration."
231WGCJU7K_XZJACKCTJEWHG6I,"INDIA shaken, not stirred: Congress underplays concerns over ‘implosion’ within alliance","Sanjay K. Jha New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 05:17 AM","Sanjay K. Jha New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 05:17 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/india-shaken-not-stirred-congress-underplays-concerns-over-implosion-within-alliance/cid/1995979,"Clearly needing to counter adverse speculation that all is not well in the INDIA coalition, top Congress leaders have argued that powerful or entrenched partners in states will naturally dictate terms when it comes to Lok Sabha seats. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s declaration that Trinamul will contest the 2024 parliamentary elections alone should not be seen by INDIA partners or the electorate as a sign of implosion because “strategic compulsions” may at times override the logic of coalitions.
While the Congress was quick to describe Mamata as a pillar of the INDIA alliance, senior Opposition leaders argued that her positioning may be driven more by local political imperatives rather than be a sign of betrayal. There is an assessment that the BJP could gain if the Congress-Left vacated the anti-Mamata space and, therefore, a three-cornered contest is not entirely undesirable in the larger interest of giving the BJP a better fight in Bengal.
While Mamata was not willing to accommodate the Left, it is also true that the Congress is not ready to accept the two seats that Trinamul is offering of a total of 42 in the state. At the same time, Congress and other alliance leaders continue to consider Mamata an intrinsic part of INDIA, notwithstanding her announcement to go it alone. “Every state will have a different model,” NCP leader Supriya Sule said, fondly describing Mamata as “Didi who is loved by all”.
A similar dilemma has cropped up in Punjab where the central leaderships of both AAP and the Congress are alive to the possibly adverse consequences of the ruling and main Opposition parties coming together to contest elections and making it a direct battle with the BJP rather than a multi-cornered one. While the state unit of both the parties are not ready to yield an inch, the overriding factor is the undesirability of leaving the entire Opposition space to the BJP or even the Akali Dal, which could scurry back to the BJP after the elections.
The assessment is that the BJP is not in a position to win a single seat in Punjab and there was no harm in polarising the state between AAP and the Congress. Though AAP and Congress will have an understanding in Delhi, sharing seats through a four-three formula, they are poised to fight a bitter battle in Punjab. Chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Wednesday declared he was unwilling to make any seat concessions to the Congress, claiming APP will win all the 13 of the state’s seats.
Though such a muddled and apparently messy seat-sharing table makes for poor optics ahead of a key national election, INDIA leaders assert there exists “tactical logic” behind some of the decisions which apparently convey a breakdown on seats among INDIA partners.
Bihar worry
The real concern emanates from Bihar where speculation over yet another somersault by chief minister Nitish Kumar is dominating the political discourse. RJD and Congress leaders deny any such possibility in formal interactions but their tone changes in off-the-record conversations. Nobody is in a position to firmly rule out the eruption of a sudden crisis in Bihar as a result of yet another political somersault by Nitish.
One INDIA leader went so far as to tell The Telegraph: “We will be surprised if Nitish Kumar doesn’t go back to the BJP. He obviously came to this side with prime-ministerial ambitions. But there were objections to making him the convenor of the INDIA group. Then Mallikarjun Kharge became the chairperson of the group. Nitish now is cynical about his prospects in the Opposition camp and his ties with the RJD too are always strained no matter what his or the RJD’s public posturing.”
The language of JDU spokesperson and Nitish confidant K.C. Tyagi has suddenly changed; he has not only started finding multiple faults with the Congress, he even threw hints of displeasure about the way Nitish has been treated in INDIA. While many parties in the Opposition alliance nurture reservations about Nitish because he has been a staunch BJP backer in the past and has a history of switching sides without any moral or ideological qualms, the JDU believes Nitish is the pivot around which INDIA was conceived and developed but that was not appreciated enough by other parties, particularly the Congress.
There are problems in Uttar Pradesh too, even as seat-sharing talks are proceeding smoothly in states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. While there is a strong desire in the Congress to rope in Mayawati, Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav is averse to the idea. The Congress believes the BJP, which has over 50 per cent votes, cannot be defeated without the BSP, but serious efforts have not been made so far to woo Mayawati into INDIA.
A Congress leader said: “There is a conspiracy to scuttle Mayawati’s induction into INDIA by some leaders of SP and Congress. Rahul Gandhi is on his Nyay Yatra now and only Sonia Gandhi can resolve this issue. If the BSP fights separately, the BJP can still win 60-70 seats in the state. If the BSP joins the coalition, the BJP’s tally can be whittled down by 20-30 seats. That’s the key battlefield none of the top INDIA leaders are seriously working on.”"

24UK1DBG17_QR7UKDZ5E8412NW,My effort is to take the government’s schemes to every beneficiary: Modi’s ‘true secularism’,"Piyush Srivastava Lucknow Published 26.01.24, 05:21 AM","Piyush Srivastava Lucknow Published 26.01.24, 05:21 AM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/my-effort-is-to-take-the-governments-schemes-to-every-beneficiary-narendra-modis-true-secularism/cid/1996204,"On Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had proclaimed Ram as the “faith, foundation and law” of India. Three days on, he appeared to redefine secularism, as well as social justice, as government welfare reaching all beneficiaries without “partiality”.
“My government does what it says; it completes the projects it starts. My effort is to take the government’s schemes to every beneficiary,” the Prime Minister told a government programme turned election rally in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh.
“Modi is giving you the guarantee of saturation, of covering 100 per cent people under the schemes. There is no room for partiality when the government reaches 100 per cent beneficiaries. There is no room for corruption when the government reaches cent per cent beneficiaries. And this is true secularism, true social justice.”
The Muslim population in Bulandshahr and other western Uttar Pradesh districts is higher (25 to 45 per cent) compared with eastern districts like Ayodhya.
Elaborating on the new definition of secularism, Modi continued: “The needs of any community are the same; the needs and dreams of the farmers of any community are the same; the needs and dreams of the women of every community are also the same. The dreams and challenges of the youths of any community are the same. This is why Modi wants to reach every needy person without any discrimination.”
He went on to attack political opponents while referring to a slogan used successfully by Indira Gandhi over half a century ago.
“After Independence, some coined the slogan ‘Garibi hatao’ (eradicate poverty) and some others lied in the name of social justice,” Modi said.
“But the poor of the country saw that good fortune reached only a few families.... The poor, Dalits and backwards were afraid of criminals and riots. But the situation is changing now because Modi is honestly engaged in their service.”
Modi on Thursday remotely laid the foundation stones for about Rs 19,000 crore worth of projects in Bulandshahr including new railway lines, water supply and sewer lines, a petroleum pipeline and road connectivity with industrial cities.
Although he was travelling to attend a government programme, Modi stood in an open jeep during the last 20km of his 90km road journey from New Delhi to Bulandshahr, flanked by chief minister Yogi Adityanath and state BJP president Bhupendra Chaudhary.
He entered the rally venue — the Chandmari Ground in Chola area of the district — waving to the crowd and began his speech by invoking Ram and Ayodhya.
“I had an auspicious sight of Lord Ram in Ayodhya Dham on January 22,” he said.
He reminded the people of western Uttar Pradesh that “this area belongs to Kalyan Singh, who dedicated his life to the service of Ram and the nation”.
Kalyan was BJP chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when a mob of kar sevaks demolished the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, demanding a Ram temple at the site. Kalyan, an OBC politician, died in 2021.
“He (Kalyan) must be elated to see Ayodhya Dham from wherever he is. It’s our good fortune that we fulfilled his and others’ dream,” Modi said.
“I had said in the proximity of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya that while the Pran Pratistha is complete, now is the time to take the glory of the nation to new heights. We have to build a path from the god (dev) to the country (desh); from Ram to rashtra. Our target is to make India a developed country by 2047.”
On the dais, Adityanath handed Modi a Ram idol and a marble plaque carrying an artist’s sketch of Ayodhya town. He said the Prime Minister had visited Bulandshahr to bless the people after inaugurating the Ram temple."

The Prime Minister encouraged citizens to actively engage with the political process by sharing their ideas and suggestions through the NaMo app.
During his address, PM Modi highlighted the significance of the youth in this process, urging them to exercise their voting power and contribute their opinions on the NaMo app. He emphasized that the youth, through their Jan-Bhagidari (public participation), would not only influence the BJP's election manifesto but also play a pivotal role in shaping the future policy direction of India.
In an official communication, the Prime Minister stated, ""Let us pledge not to leave anyone behind,"" stressing the importance of inclusivity in the democratic process. He called on every citizen to vote and actively participate in the political discourse.
To facilitate this engagement, PM Modi announced that he would personally meet some of the contributors to discuss their inputs. The move reflects a commitment to fostering a sense of collaboration between the government and the people, reinforcing the belief that public participation strengthens the democratic fabric of the nation.
As the BJP gears up for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, citizens are encouraged to share their thoughts, suggestions, and ideas on various aspects of governance through the comments section on the NaMo app. This initiative not only invites public opinion but also provides a unique opportunity for individuals to actively shape the BJP's election manifesto.
Earlier, The Congress also launched a website and an email ID, inviting suggestions from the public for its manifesto for this year's Lok Sabha polls."
2DS075KIRB_ZJJNJWKAFYZYWDF,Temple fever,"Sevanti Ninan Published 22.01.24, 07:12 AM","Sevanti Ninan Published 22.01.24, 07:12 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/opinion/temple-fever-the-medias-blitzkrieg-on-the-ram-mandir-inauguration/cid/1995344,"Even as the prime minister and ruling party orchestrate unprecedented religious fervour around the construction of the Ram mandir, there seems to be a broad media consensus on the huge public receptivity to the temple building project. That this is something most readers and viewers will want to read about and watch endlessly, that it will bring in the advertising, create jobs and markets. Few journalists, if any, are being judgmental about the government declaring half-day’s holiday to enable people to light lamps for a temple, or about a cabinet minister telling journalists that practically every organisation from the Uttar Pradesh government to the highway, telecom and the railway system is prepared for the demands that the temple will bring.
The business press has been abuzz with stories of spiritual merchandise sales on e-commerce platforms and temple fever driving the travel business. Spiritual tourism as a category has grown by 35% in a year, says one travel company, and is poised to become much bigger. EaseMyTrip has introduced EasyDarshan, even as Ayodhya dominates searches on travel platforms. Reliance Jio is putting in mobile towers, an Adani firm plans to distribute bhog and jalebis to thousands, Uber is introducing electric autos to run in the city.
At the trader end of the commerce boom, there are reports of a kirtan, havan and a rath yatra by Khan Market traders in New Delhi, and thousands of metres of running flags being ordered by another traders’ association to cover the entire Connaught Place area, not to mention more than 100,000 diyas to be lit here. Traders all across the country have joined the party — one is told that even Calcutta, which is not into Jai Shri Ram flags and festoons, is selling a large number of them. There is a tireless search for story angles — Amitabh Bachchan has bought a plot in Ayodhya; lamps will be lit on January 22 at the Davos meet and so on.
From the beginning of this year the Dainik Jagran has been running a full page, sometimes two, every day on the mandir countdown. But the pran pratistha is the culmination of a movement that has unfolded over centuries. So the Dainik Bhaskar has run, over three weeks, a 20-part front-page series called “Main Ayodhya Hun” beginning with the first mention of the town in the Atharva Veda. It dates Ayodhya’s origin to 6673 BC and incorporates mythology as early history. By the fourth episode, you are done with Dashratha, Kaikeyi, Rama, Sita, Ravana and Hanuman and are into what is described as a 450-year Ram janmabhoomi andolan.
From then on, it is narrated, without overtly saying so, as a history of the injustice done since Babur’s senapati destroyed the Ram temple and built the Babri masjid on its ruins. There is a quick leap to 1986 and the unlocking of the masjid, by which time, the series notes, the word secularism had become an irritant for Hindus and a symbol of Muslim appeasement. Each episode has a telling headline: “Ek taale ke bheetar Ayodhya ki aag dabi hui thi” (One padlock had suppressed the fire of Ayodhya). The paper says that the government took less than an hour to implement the order of a Faizabad court to open the locks of the masjid to pacify what it describes as “despondent Hindus”.
Thereafter, the mandir andolan got a major fillip with the telecast of Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan on Doordarshan and the launching of the shila poojan, wherein a brick made of local soil from each village was wrapped in saffron and despatched for Ayodha and worshipped by hundreds and thousands on the way. In April 1989, the Vishva Hindu Parishad held its Dharma Sansad to announce the Ram mandir shilanyas, by May, there was a Rs 25-crore plan to construct the temple. Meanwhile, the home minister, Buta Singh, had begun talks with parties in the Ram mandir dispute.
In 1988, the Bofors story had broken, V.P. Singh had left the government, and elections were less than a year away. Rajiv Gandhi was advised to do the shilanyas on what was believed to be the temple site. As the paper puts it, the prime minister was convinced that this would help him in the elections. The headline says, “Devraha Baba se milne Vrindavan daure Rajiv Gandhi” (Rajiv Gandhi ran to Vrindavan to meet Devraha Baba). The Babri Masjid Action Committee stepped up its opposition, describing the temple location as contested. But another location in Faizabad was described as uncontested and a shilanyas took place there in Nov­ember 1989.
According to the Dainik Bhaskar, Rajiv Gandhi began his election campaign from Ayodhya, but when the elections took place it was the Bharatiya Janata Party which took its seat tally from 2 to 85. In 1990, described as the karseva year, the distance between V.P. Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav is described as having been greater than the distance between the VHP and the Babri Masjid committee. “Mulayam Singh went and sat with the Babri Masjid lobby.” If society in Uttar Pradesh and then in the rest of the country began to be divided between the mandir and masjid, and the communal situation deteriorated in the state, it was entirely on account of Mulayam Singh’s pro-masjid stand, according to the Dainik Bhaskar.
In September 1990, L.K. Advani set out from Somnath for the rath yatra. The rath yatra plan for Guja­rat was made by Narendra Modi, who was then in the state BJP, and marked his rise in the national consciousness as a BJP politician. He masterminded the rath yatra’s ‘roop-rekha’, we are told. And, as the first karseva yatra began moving, people worshipped the rath and picked up the earth beneath it to put on their heads. The chronology of the political negotiations continues till the masjid is brought down in December 1992. This newspaper series is potted history, useful for younger readers in the Hindi heartland.
Court cases took over thereafter and the Archaeological Survey of India was asked by the court for whatever evidence it could get of what stood below the masjid. The Dainik Jagran, earlier this month, profiled the Muslim archaeologist who was part of the team which found evidence of a temple’s ruins beneath the masjid — evidence on which the Supreme Court based its 2019 judgment.
The Wire’s newsletter, India Cable, meanwhile offered the nugget that the five Supreme Court judges who had delivered the judgment on the Babri masjid site had posed for a group photograph and celebrated their verdict at the Taj Mansingh hotel, according to the memoirs of the former Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi. The good jud­ges have now been invited as state guests for the consecration ceremony of the mandir today. The Wire tells you, indignantly, that this is unprecedented.

The defence ministry said the plane had been carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were being transferred to the region from a military airport near Moscow to be exchanged for Russian service personnel. It accused Ukrainian forces of launching two missiles from the nearby Kharkiv region of Ukraine that struck the aircraft. The plane was also carrying six crew members and three other individuals, the ministry said.
The Russian claims could not be independently verified.
Officials in Ukraine did not comment directly on Moscow’s accusations that Ukraine shot down the plane but the military’s general staff headquarters issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon asserting a right to target Russian military transport airplanes in the border region.
The statement, posted on the military command’s Facebook page, did not deny shooting down the plane. It said that repeated Russian missile strikes on the city of Kharkiv and the surrounding region had in the past week killed 16 people and wounded another 78 people and that Ukraine had responded by targeting missile launch sites and the logistics for missile deliveries.
“The armed forces of Ukraine will continue to take measures to destroy delivery vehicles and control the airspace to eliminate the terrorist threat,” the statement said.
The Belgorod region of Russia has a long border with Ukraine. Over the past few weeks, it has been the scene of frequent Ukrainian attacks, including a missile bombardment in December. It was also the staging ground for Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022 and for further Russian strikes against Ukrainian territory during the war.
The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said on social media that the plane had crashed in a field near a settlement in the Korochansky district. He said that emergency services were at the site. A video posted to Telegram and verified by The New York Times showed a large plane crashing and exploding in Yablonovo, a town in the Korochansky district. Tass, a Russian state news agency, published a video of the scene of the crash showing debris littering a snowy field.

The couple had knocked on the doors of the HC seeking a direction to the District Child Protection Unit for issuing them with a 'No Objection Certificate' (NOC) and a 'Conformity Certificate'.
The couple had adopted a girl child and the adoption deed between the biological mother and the couple was registered before the sub-registrar in the district headquarters town of Chikkaballapura on March 29, 2023.
The Deputy Commissioner had also verified the deed and recommended that necessary action be taken for the adoption. But still the District Child Protection Unit refused to grant them the NOC and Conformity Certificate.               Their petition was heard by Justice M Nagaprasanna.
The Deputy Solicitor General of India, H Shanti Bhushan, who appeared for the Union, contended that the adoption under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act was not internationally recognised and any inter-country adoption has to be done through the Hague Convention.              Under the Hague Convention to which Germany was also a signatory, the couple were required “to go before the country in which the father resides, communicate a mail to the Indian counterpart under the adoption regulations and within 10 days a certificate and NOC would be issued in this country.”
Agreeing with the argument, the HC in its judgement said: “The aforementioned norms would indicate inter-country adoption of German national. Therefore, the petitioners shall knock at the doors of the authorities in Germany under the Hague convention seeking a communication to India for issuance of NOC and Conformity certificate.                On receipt of the said communication from the aforesaid authority of Germany, the appropriate authority – the CARA (Central Adoption Resource Authority),  without brooking any delay, issue a no objection certificate and a conformity certificate.”
Refusing the petition seeking a direction to the authorities, the HC said: “If what is sought by the petitioners is granted, it would run counter to the established procedure. Therefore, the inter-country adoption should necessarily be in tune with the procedure quoted supra.”
The HC disposed of the petition giving the couple the liberty to approach the German authorities to communicate to the CARA for necessary action. The Authority was also directed to issue the necessary certificate within ten days of receiving the communication from the German authorities.

The laser beam was transmitted and reflected between the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and an Oreo-sized device on Vikram lander, opening the door to a new style of precisely locating targets on the Moon's surface, NASA said.
The lander was 100 kilometers away from LRO, near Manzinus crater in the Moon's south pole region, when LRO transmitted laser pulses toward it on December 12 last year.
After the orbiter registered light that had bounced back from a tiny NASA retroreflector aboard Vikram, NASA scientists knew their technique had finally worked.
Sending laser pulses towards an object and measuring how long it takes the light to bounce back is a commonly used way to track the locations of Earth-orbiting satellites from the ground.
However, using the technique in reverse—to send laser pulses from a moving spacecraft to a stationary one to determine its precise location—has many applications at the Moon, scientists said.
""We've showed that we can locate our retroreflector on the surface from the Moon's orbit,"" said Xiaoli Sun, who led the team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, that developed the retroreflector on Vikram as part of a partnership between NASA and Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).
""The next step is to improve the technique so that it can become routine for missions that want to use these retroreflectors in the future,"" Sun said in a NASA statement.
Only 2 inches, or 5 centimeters, wide, NASA's tiny but mighty retroreflector, called a Laser Retroreflector Array, has eight quartz-corner-cube prisms set into a dome-shaped aluminum frame.
The device is simple and durable, scientists say, requiring neither power nor maintenance, and can last for decades. Its configuration allows the retroreflector to reflect light coming in from any direction back to its source, NASA said.
Retroreflectors can be used for many applications in science and exploration and have been in use at the Moon since the Apollo era.
By reflecting light back to Earth, the suitcase-size retroreflectors revealed that the Moon is moving away from our planet at a rate of 3.8 centimeters per year, the US space agency added.
Reacting to the development, ISRO said the Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA) on the Chandrayaan-3 lander has begun serving as a fiducial point (precisely located markers for reference) on the Moon.
""NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) achieved a laser range measurement using the LRA by successfully detecting signals reflected by it on December 12, 2023. The ranging utilized the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) on the LRO. The observation occurred during lunar night time, with the LRO ascending to the east of Chandrayaan-3,"" the Indian space agency added.

As a consequence, the fifth day of the Yatra in the state did not proceed as per the programme chalked out by the party in the two districts. In the evening, Gandhi and his entourage entered Meghalaya.
AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi exerted pressure on the Assam government to prevent Gandhi from visiting the birthplace of Srimant Sankardeva.
Sankardeva is an Assamese saint-scholar, social-religious reformer, poet, playwright and a towering figure in the cultural and religious history of Assam from the 15th-16th century.
Gandhi had left for the Sattra (Vaisnavite monastery) at Batadrava early in the morning but was stopped at Haibargaon, around 17 km away, prompted him and other party leaders to sit on a dharna.
Tight security arrangements were in force around the sattra.
The Sri Sankardeva Sattra authorities on Sunday announced that they will not allow Gandhi to visit the sattra before 3 pm on January 22, after Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said at a press conference that he requested Gandhi not to visit it before the consecration ceremony at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.
Party MP Gaurav Gogoi and Batadrava MLA Sibamoni Bora went to the sattra to resolve the issue but failed. After returning, Gogoi claimed there was no crowd in and around the premises.
They offered prayers on behalf of Gandhi and the priests extended their blessings to him.
''A rumour was spread that a law and order situation could have risen if Gandhi had visited the place,” Gogoi said.
After the two returned, Gandhi told reporters that he believes in the philosophy of Sankardeva saying: “Like him, we believe in bringing people together and not spreading hatred''.
''He is like a guru to us and gives us direction. So I had thought when I came to Assam, I should offer my respects to him,” he said.
Gandhi said that they had received an invitation on January 11 but ''we were told that there is a law and order situation. This is strange as there is a law and order situation in the area, but Gaurav Gogoi and all can go but only Rahul Gandhi cannot go.''             The former Congress president said he would go to Batadrava after getting an opportunity.
“It is my belief that both Assam and the entire nation should follow the path shown by Sankardeva'', he said.
Gogoi, who visited the sattra along with the Congress MLA, said that there was no crowd in and around the premises.
''A rumour was spread that a law and order situation could have risen if Gandhi had visited the place. The Chief Minister has stamped a black spot in the history of Batadrava and the legacy of Sri Sankardeva'', the Congress MP from Kaliabor said.
Gogoi claimed they offered prayers of peace and harmony on behalf of Gandhi and all priests who were present in the premises extended their blessings to him.
Earlier, when Nagaon SP Navaneet Mahanta and Additional District Commissioner Lakhyajyoti Das explained why he could not be allowed to visit the sattra, Gandhi questioned, ""Will PM Modi now decide who will visit a temple and when?""              Ramesh said when the authorities had said there could be a law and order problem, Gandhi offered to go there alone but this too was refused.
''We were given permission to visit the Sattra on January 11 and the managing committee had welcomed the visit but suddenly on January 20, we were told that he could visit only after the consecration of the Ram temple is over'', Ramesh said.
After Gandhi was not allowed to visit Batadrava, the Morigaon district administration in a letter to the district Congress organisers asked Gandhi to refrain from holding street corner meetings and a foot march as a part of the Yatra saying miscreants may try to disrupt peace in the district.
''In the interest of Rahul Gandhi's safety and security, who is a 'Z plus Advance Security Liasoning (ASL) protectee along with our responsibility to avert any probable law and order disruption in Morigaon district, we request that the party refrain from proposed street corner meeting and padayatra in Morigaon town'', the letter read.
The authorities also requested the party not to stop carcade during his roadshow at Morigaon district till he reached the Golsepa alighting point for lunch and rest.
''This negates all earlier permissions accorded by the district administration for holding any public meeting/Padyatra in Morigaon district in connection with the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on January 22'', the letter stated.
Meanwhile, the state Director General of Police G P Singh had posted on 'X' that unscheduled stoppages should be avoided.
The participants of the road event were advised not to physically counter locals protesting the event and leave the same to the deployed police contingent, he said.
The Yatra later entered Meghalaya and it will return to Assam on Tuesday.
Gandhi will address students at the University if Science and Technology in Meghalaya.
Ramesh said that Gandhi will travel only on the route on which BJP president J P Nadda travelled recently as the party does not want any law and order situation to be created.

""It is Ram's supreme blessings that we are witnessing it,"" Modi told the select gathering comprising top saints, political leaders, industrialists, film stars, poets, litterateurs and sportspersons.

""Our Ram has arrived today after wait, patience, sacrifices of centuries,"" he said.
Modi said Lord Ram resided in the first copy of the country's Constitution.
""Even after the Constitution came into existence, legal battle was fought for decades on Lord Ram's existence. I would like to the thank judiciary that delivered justice and Lord Ram's temple was built in a legal manner,"" the prime minister said.
Even after thousands of years people will remember this date, moment. It's Ram's supreme blessings that we are witnessing it. January 22, 2024 is not merely a date but marks the advent of a new era, PM Modi declared.
We have to now lay foundation of India of next 1,000 years; we take pledge to build a capable, grand, divine India from this moment. Some would say Ram temple's construction will set off firestorm. They should reconsider as Ram is energy not fire, solution not dispute, PM said.
Ram temple's construction reflection of Indian society's maturity; it's an occasion of not merely triumph but humility too, added the prime minister."

It is ironic but illustrative that there are so many boundary disputes among these states; admittedly, the notion of the modern boundary was unknown here before the Treaty of Yandabo of 1826 by which the British annexed Assam and merged it with Bengal.
As Lord Curzon pointed out in his Romanes lecture in 1907 on ‘Frontiers’, it was in not only the Northeast but also the world outside of Europe where the idea of artificially delineated boundaries was alien. There were natural boundaries determined by rivers, mountains, deserts and so on, but even these did not resemble the closely-guarded and precise limits of national domains. Boundaries also waxed and waned, depending on the powers of rulers and chiefs.
The British being unaccustomed to territories with no precise limits ensured boundaries were drawn wherever they took over. While these boundaries served their purposes, they often left problems for those who inherited them. This history of the Northeast’s boundaries is intriguing and the land-people relationship also complicated British boundary-making exercises in many ways.
The British administrative institution introduced in Assam reflected the challenges of dealing with a mix of State-bearing populations under centralised bureaucracies of kingdoms and non-State communities living in the uncharted hills. Assam’s plains were much easier for the British to handle, unlike the hills where the authority of each village, tribe and clan did not run beyond its closed community. The British, therefore, introduced normal land revenue administration in the plains but left the surrounding hills as Excluded or Partially Excluded areas and separated the two regions by an Inner Line drawn by the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873. In 1907, the British also introduced a similar administrative arrangement in their protectorate state of Manipur.
That communities living in different kinds of economy would have different outlooks towards land is a foregone conclusion. For the nomads, anywhere they pitch their tents is their land. But this is not so for settled agriculturists, feudal principalities or the modern State. When communities with different outlooks towards land live in the same geographical region, conflicts are inevitable. One of Manipur’s major problems is this.
What needs to be remembered is that the modern State is premised on a sedentary and enumerable population. Democracy itself would become fragile if its population were to be constantly shifting, with government infrastructure perpetually chasing proliferating villages.
If and when the Manipur crisis reaches an amicable resolution, the stakeholders must realise the need to come to terms with the new reality of sedentary lifestyle. This will transform the endemic land tussles among Manipur’s diverse communities as well as those with the State. While indigenous ways of life must be respected, a common denominator is also indispensable to ensure good administration.
The Manipur government must also reconsider its practice of giving recognition to new villages periodically. Because of a peculiar land-holding tradition amongst — especially — the Kukis, whereby the chief owns the village and the villagers are landless, there is a tendency for villagers to leave and start their own village. This is also one reason why Kukis felt most targeted when the government initiated an eviction drive against encro­achment in reserved and protected forests. Neigh­bouring Mizoram, where Kuki-Zo kindred tribes live, can be a shining example. Following the introduction of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, the autocratic rights of 259 chiefs were abolished on popular demand in 1954, giving stability to its villages.

The Yatra, currently in Assam, is scheduled to enter West Bengal through Bakshirhat in Cooch Behar district on January 25. After a recess of two days –January 26-27, it will be traversing Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Uttar Dinajpur and Darjeeling before reaching Bihar on January 29.
It will re-enter West Bengal on January 31 through Malda and travel via Murshidabad, both strongholds of the Congress, before leaving the state on February 1.
""We haven't received a formal invitation from the Congress. And even if we receive it we are most unlikely to join it"", the senior TMC leader told PTI.
The development came amid the growing animosity between both the parties – TMC and Congress - the INDIA bloc alliance partners over seat sharing in West Bengal.
TMC leaders, including Banerjee, have maintained that it is their party which is taking on the BJP in West Bengal.
On Tuesday, Banerjee at an internal party meeting had criticised the Congress for causing delays in seat-sharing discussions in West Bengal within the INDIA bloc, citing unjustified demands for 10-12 seats when the TMC is willing to share only two.
Senior state Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharya said the party has sent invites to all INDIA bloc partners, ""Now it is up to TMC to decide on whether they will join the yatra or not.
The TMC's offer of two seats based on Congress's 2019 Lok Sabha election performance was deemed insufficient, escalating the tension between the two parties.
In the 2019 elections, TMC secured 22 seats, Congress won two, and the BJP secured 18 seats in the state.
The TMC had allied with the Congress in the 2001 assembly polls, 2009 Lok Sabha elections, and the 2011 assembly polls. The alliance ousted the CPI(M)-led Left Front government of 34 years in the 2011 polls.

Senior officials met to find ways to increase prosecutions for traffic rule violations through electronic surveillance on stretches in the city and its adjoining areas where accidents are frequent.
In Kolkata, more than 90 per cent of the motorcyclists have been found to be wearing helmets since the state government increased the fine for riding a two-wheeler without the head gear two years ago, officers said.
The tendency to speed has reduced, too, during this period.
A large number of the prosecutions were linked to electronic surveillance.
The government wants Kolkata’s adjoining police commissionerates to step up electronic surveillance to enforce road rules. In Kolkata too, the officials decided, more roads need to be brought under electronic surveillance.
“There are large stretches on key thoroughfares across the city that aren’t covered by cameras. In some places, cameras were damaged by cyclone Amphan (May 2020). We want these areas to be covered by electronic surveillance,” a senior officer of Kolkata police said.
“Electronic equipment such as automatic number plate-recognition cameras, speed laser guns, digital speed display boards and speed cameras will be installed in Kolkata and its adjoining areas for intensive surveillance,” said a senior official in the transport department who attended the meeting.
“More funds will be allocated from now for the procurement and installation of electronic surveillance tools.”
A December 2023 report by the ministry of road transport and highways says the number of annual deaths in Kolkata because of road accidents has declined by 50 per cent over the previous five years.
In Bengal, speeding was responsible for 4,080 of the 13,686 crashes in 2022, according to a report prepared by SaveLIFE Foundation, with support from the World Bank Group and the Union ministry of road transport and highways.
Of the 6,002 lives lost in the state because of road accidents in 2022, speeding accounted for 1,937.
The electronic equipment will be installed in areas that will be identified by an agency that has expertise in the field. Seven companies are likely to bid for the job, said an official.
“The company that wins the contract will go around visiting roads in Kolkata and its adjoining areas and draw up a budget for the gadgets. Representatives of some of these companies were present at the meeting,” the official said."

ED sources said the letter had been sent on Monday evening asking Soren to appear for questioning between January 27 and 31.
The letter has also given the chief minister the option of answering the ED questions either at his official residence in Kanke Road or at the ED office on Hinoo Road in Ranchi.
Incidentally, ED officials had interrogated Soren for over seven hours on Saturday at his official residence in a separate closed room.
Soren had earlier been quizzed by the ED in November 2022 in Ranchi in connection with an illegal mining case for nearly nine hours.
“ED officials had prepared a list of 50 questions out of which nearly 30 have been asked and the remaining questions need to be asked to the chief minister based on documentary evidence in the land scam case on change of ownership of an army land in Ranchi,” an ED source said.
Soren had agreed to interrogation after eight summons and asked the ED to record his statement on January 20 afternoon.
There were reports that the ED had written a letter to Soren on Saturday and given him five days (January 16-20) to record his statement and was asked to inform the time and place for recording his statement within two days.
Earlier this year, Soren in reply to the seventh summons of the ED had criticised the federal agency terming its probe as “baseless and biased”.
The letter of the chief minister also accused the ED of engaging in a media trial against him and hinted at taking legal recourse against the summons.
After the Saturday questioning, Soren while meeting party supporters near his residence had alleged the questioning as a conspiracy by the BJP-led Centre to disturb his government.
“Since the formation of our government, they (read the BJP) is hatching a conspiracy. We have never bowed down or been afraid. I want to tell you Hemant Soren will always stand with each of the party workers. I promise you. We will continue to work for the state’s development by shredding their conspiracies to pieces. It is time to put a final nail in their coffin. If need arose I will take bullets but will not bow down,” said Soren.
“Under no circumstances, we will let the state fall into the hands of such conspirators. When these people are unable to deal with us politically they are trying to disturb the government from behind. But the time has come to give a befitting reply to such people,” said Soren."

The procedure will be carried out at the London Clinic private hospital, where Catherine, the Princess of Wales, had surgery last week.
The 75-year-old King visited the Princess of Wales in the hospital this morning, ahead of his own scheduled treatment.
It is not yet known how long King Charles will remain in hospital.
King Charles III had made his health problem public as a way of sending a message to other men to get their prostates checked.
A statement from Buckingham Palace said the King was ""delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness"".
He also thanked those who had ""sent their good wishes,"" the BBC reported.
The plan for King Charles to have a ""corrective procedure"" for his enlarged prostate was revealed by the palace last week.
A benign prostate problem, which is non-cancerous, is common in men over 50 and is not usually a serious condition, according to the UK's National Health Service.
Around one in three men over the age of 50 will have some symptoms of an enlarged prostate, which is a gland that sits just below the bladder.
Charles became King following his mother Queen Elizabeth's death on September 8, 2022. His coronation took place on May 6, 2023.

Sarma, at a press conference on Sunday, had urged people of all faiths to hold special prayers on the occasion of the Ram temple consecration to promote harmony.
A 'dry day' has also been declared on Monday, and shops selling non-vegetarian food items will remain closed till 4 pm, he said.

The swearing in function was held in the Supreme Court premises, a day after the Centre cleared his name for judgeship.
With the swearing in, the top court has attained its full strength of 34 judges, including the Chief Justice of India, and would for the first time have three sitting judges from the Dalit community. The other two sitting judges from the Scheduled Caste community are Justices B R Gavai and C T Ravikumar.
While recommending Justice Varale's name earlier this month, a five-judge SC Collegium headed by CJI Chandrachud said it took into consideration the fact that he is among the senior-most high court judges and is the only high court chief justice from the Scheduled Caste.
A vacancy arose in the apex court following the retirement of Justice S K Kaul on December 25 last year.
Justice Varale's appointment came within a week of the SC Collegium recommending his name.
""In exercise of powers conferred by clause (2) of Article 124 of the Constitution of India, the President is pleased to appoint Shri Justice Prasanna Bhalachandra Varale, Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court, to be a Judge of the Supreme Court of India, with effect from the date he assumes charge of his office,"" a law ministry notification read.
While recommending Justice Varale's name, the collegium had observed that the Supreme Court had operated almost throughout last year with full strength of 34 judges and, therefore, could achieve the distinction of recording an unprecedented rate of disposal by disposing of 52,191 cases in the calendar year 2023.
""Bearing in mind that the workload of judges has increased considerably, it has become necessary to ensure that the court has full working judge-strength at all times. The Collegium has, therefore, decided to fill up the sole existing vacancy by recommending a name,"" it had noted.
Born on June 23, 1962, Justice Varale was appointed as a judge of the High Court of Bombay on July 18, 2008, and elevated as the chief justice of the High Court of Karnataka on October 15, 2022.
Justice Varale’s elevation to the apex court would take the representation of Bombay High Court in the Supreme Court to four. The other three judges having the parent high court of Bombay are CJI Chandrachud, Justices Gavai and Abhay S Oka.

I remembered standing on the roof of Kanak Bhavan overlooking the 450-year-old Babri Masjid as it was being pulled down on December 6, 1992, and being asked by a fellow journalist how I felt witnessing this monumental tragedy. He was obviously asking me this question as I was one of a handful of Muslims present on that fateful day. I replied that I felt hurt, rejected and unwanted. I was being told that India was no longer a country that Muslims could call their own.
The sadness then was not for the demolition of a mosque made out of bricks and mortar — there are thousands of masjids all over the country — but the destruction of the idea of Muslims being equal citizens of India. The Babri Masjid, which was under the protection of the Supreme Court, had begun to represent the rights of Muslims given to them by the Constitution of India. The frenzy, aggression and sheer scale of violence that was unleashed on the three-domed Babri Masjid was symbolic of the hatred that the kar sevaks bore towards Muslims.
From that watershed moment 31 years ago till today, much water has flown down the Saryu. The political party that brought down the Babri Masjid has reaped its electoral dividends and has established a New India which has no place for secularism or Muslims. The 200 million Indian Muslims have been relegated to the margins of society, alienated and dejected. They have become invisible only to be trotted out as terrorists or criminals; as cattle smugglers or love jihadists. They are now “Babur ki aulad”, sent off to Pakistan if they dare to open their mouths or worse still, publicly lynched. They are used as punching bags during elections in order to frighten and remind the majority community of their ‘victimhood’ and collect their votes.
A few days ago, I was asked by another journalist how I felt as a Muslim about the frenzied celebration of the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and my reply was “emotionless”. Muslims do not hate Lord Ram, in fact he is revered as Imam-e-Hind, but it is the forced swearing of allegiance that they object to. Chant “Jai Shri Ram” or pay with your life!
I was asked if the ruling class was being insensitive to the feelings of Muslims, my reply was if you don’t exist, how can your feelings matter? During the Ramjanmabhoomi movement of the late 1980s and 1990s, VHP leaders chanted the slogans with the Islamophobic slur “Jab katua kata jayega, toh Ram Ram chillayega”. It was considered disgusting then. But now it has become so acceptable that a BJP MP can call a Muslim MP in Parliament by that same slur and he is not even reprimanded, let alone punished.
With the Ram Mandir now built on the debris of the Babri Masjid, this is not the end of the nightmare for Muslims. “Yeh toh siraf jhanki hai, Abhi toh Mathura, Kashi baki hain” was another popular slogan in 1992, and it laid out the portents of the future. Ominously, the same slogan was heard in Ayodhya today after the consecration."

“30,000 Indian students in France in 2030. It’s a very ambitious target, but I am determined to make it happen,” he wrote on X on Friday.
According to a media report, Macron, elaborating on how the plan will be chalked out, said that international classes would be set up to allow students who do not speak French to study in universities there.
“We are developing the network of Alliances francaises, with new centers to learn French. We are creating international classes which will allow students, who do not necessarily speak French, to join our universities,” Macron wrote.
“Last but not least, we will facilitate the visa process for any former Indian students who studied in France,” he added.
Macron’s visit to India caps a milestone year for India-France ties — the 25th anniversary of their strategic partnership.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday held wide-ranging talks to further consolidate India-France strategic cooperation, especially in areas of defence, security, trade and clean energy, after the French leader was accorded a red-carpet welcome in Jaipur.
The India-France Strategic Partnership, the first that India signed with any western country, has seen considerable progress in bilateral, regional and international contexts. “The partnership draws strength, trust and consistency from a shared sense of strategic autonomy and sovereignty, a quest for a multi-polar world, and a natural affinity for democratic values and rule of law,” a senior official said.
Defence and security, civil nuclear matters, and space constitute principal pillars of this partnership, which now also includes a strong Indo-Pacific component.
The comprehensive Roadmap between India and France, which was adopted last year in July during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit as Guest of Honour for Bastille Day, was classified under three pillars — Partnership for Security and Sovereignty; Partnership for the Planet; and Partnership for People."

Tamil Nadu has not preferred BJP in the past elections and the same would be the case in this year's Lok sabha polls as well, he said in his address at the 2nd state level conference of the DMK Youth Wing, headed by his son and state minister Udhayanidhi, here.
Referring to the recent cyclone Michaung impact in Chennai and the heavy rainfall that occurred in southern districts of the State, he said TN has sought a relief of Rs 37,000 crore from the Centre, but so far no funds have been received.
""What they (BJP) think is that the people of Tamil Nadu will cast their votes (for them) over mere recital of Tirukkural, celebrating Pongal and constructing (Shri Ram) temple in Ayodhya and mislead them.""  	""They have not understood us. This is the land of Periyar, land of Anna, land of Kalaignar (Karunanidhi),"" he said, alluding to the Dravidian stalwarts.
His comments came on a day when Modi wound up his 3-day spiritual sojourn of the state, during which he visited temples and locations in the state with a Ramayana connect, including Arichalmunai in Rameswaram, which is said to be the place from where the Ram Setu was built.
The consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya is scheduled on Monday.
Narendra Modi has been Prime Minister twice ""but on both occasions the people of Tamil Nadu did not vote for him to become PM,"" Stalin said in an apparent reference to the BJP's poor show in the Lok Sabha polls in 2014 and 2019.
He said Tamil Nadu will stick to the trend this time also and that the rest of the country will follow suit.
Exuding confidence of the opposition INDIA bloc winning the elections, he said it will not be a single-party rule. ""Neither will it be an authoritarian regime; it will be one that respects states, one that would do good to Tamil Nadu and the people of the state,"" he said.
Urging party workers to focus on election work, he asked them to leave to the DMK leadership, issues like alliance and candidates who will face the polls.
Further, he strongly pitched for state autonomy and called for constitutional amendment to ensure the states got ""enough powers.""  	His pitch for state autonomy was not confined to his party DMK but all other states ruled by the Congress, Trinamool Congress, Communists and even the BJP.
""After giving sufficient rights to the States, the Centre can retain the rights that ensure unity and integrity of the country,"" he said.
The DMK Chief also told his party cadres that the top priority in front of them was to ensure that BJP-AIADMK strategies did not work out in the State.
Udhayanidhi attacked the BJP over a number of issues, including fund allocation to the state and the National Entrance-cum-Eligibility Test (NEET), which the DMK strongly opposes on the grounds of equality.
The party was ready to stage protests in New Delhi against NEET, he said  	Earlier, a number of resolutions were adopted in the conferenece. These included abolition of the Governor post and appointing Tamils in central government offices located in the state.

Jaishankar, who arrived in Nigeria after attending the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Uganda, made the remarks while addressing the Indian community members here.
“We are today sending a message to the world, that this is also an India, which is proud of its traditions, of its culture, of its history,” said Jaishankar, who is here on his first visit as External Affairs Minister.
The minister said that in the world there are very few civilizations, who have survived as a modern nation and “we are one of them."" 	He highlighted developmental activities in India, saying there is a sense today that India is being built and there is a flow of investment.
On ties with Nigeria, Jaishankar said that the two sides have business of about USD 12-15 billion and invited Nigerian investors to invest in India.
“There are many more possibilities because actually, Indian capabilities in many areas are growing very, very strongly. I would say, we've had a long record in pharmaceuticals but today India, for example, has become a big producer of medical devices, which was not the case earlier,” he said.
Jaishankar will co-chair the sixth India-Nigeria Joint Commission Meeting (JCM) with his counterpart and meet with other leaders.
He will also inaugurate the third edition of the Nigeria-India Business Council meeting, deliver a speech at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, interact with business delegates and inaugurate a bust of Mahatma Gandhi.
He will also chair the regional conference of Indian heads of missions.
""India and Nigeria have traditionally enjoyed close and friendly relations. This is the external affairs minister's first visit to Nigeria which will further consolidate bilateral relations between the two countries,"" the MEA said.

Set in a fictional Indian village, where women don’t even get their pictures clicked without a ghoonghat (veil), the film starring Pratibha Ranta, Sparsh Shrivastav and Nitanshi Goel marks the directorial return of Dhobi Ghat helmer Kiran after a 13-year gap.
“Ghunghat uth chuke hai #LaapataaLadies trailer is out,” wrote the makers on Instagram, dropping the two-minute-twenty-five-second-long trailer on Wednesday.
The trailer begins with Sparsh's Deepak Kumar bringing his newlywed bride home after the wedding ceremony. However, the joyous celebrations come to an abrupt halt when the groom and his family realise that the bride Phool (Nitanshi) has been swapped with an unknown woman, Pushpa Rani (Pratibha), at the train station. The following day, when Deepak goes to file an FIR, a sardonic police officer (played by Ravi Kishan) subjects him and Pushpa to interrogation.
The traditional Indian practice of women covering their faces with a ‘ghoonghat’ plays a crucial role in the trailer, with the veil becoming both the root cause and the key to the mystery. Pushpa adamantly refuses to be photographed without her veil, while the only image Deepak has of his missing wife shows her concealing her face behind her ‘ghoonghat’. A humorous and thrilling journey unfolds as the police closely monitor Pushpa, suspecting her of harbouring ulterior motives in coming to Deepak's place. Meanwhile, subsequent sequences depict Phool in significant distress as she struggles to find her way back home.
The upcoming comedy is produced by Kiran’s ex-husband and actor Aamir Khan with Jyoti Deshpande of Jio Studios serving as the co-producer.

402CYT2083_1IPXRNT9BNSLNR6,For whom the temple tolls: PM Modi spurs Ram fervour ahead of Lok Sabha polls at opulent Ayodhya consecration,"Sankarshan Thakur Published 23.01.24, 09:33 AM","Sankarshan Thakur Published 23.01.24, 09:33 AM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/for-whom-the-temple-tolls-pm-modi-spurs-ram-fervour-ahead-of-lok-sabha-polls-at-opulent-ayodhya-consecration/cid/1995620,"On August 5, 2020 — amidst the deathly rampage of Covid-19 — Prime Minister Narendra Modi audaciously revealed to the nation from Ayodhya the chronicle of a future foretold.
Shortly past noon at the same stage on Monday, Modi concluded — to a populace awash in celebration —  his telling. And doing so, he unveiled the absolute amalgamation of Church and State, a devotee nation whose decreed chief deity should henceforth be Ram.
It may not be entirely moot what this stimulation of religious giddiness means for the 2024 general election; the BJP’s numerical fortunes have clearly profited from its spearheading of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement over past decades. Under Modi the shoring up of sentiment, and its electoral translation, have become as robust a project as it is unabashed.
As he walked to the consecration rituals at a spanking Ramjanmabhoomi Temple this afternoon — in off-white silks and solitary, as his cameras often direct him to be — Modi wore the aura of raja and rishi combined.
When he spoke much later, having presided, mahant-like, over the Pran Pratistha rituals of the Ram Lalla idol under the central dome, it was often not clearly manifest that he was also elected head of a secular and vastly pluralist country, and that he not only swore allegiance to a secular Constitution but, on occasion, also respectfully placed his forehead to it.
“This is not just a divine temple, it is a temple of India’s vision, philosophy and direction,” Modi said, during a well-deliberated discourse that lasted a little more than half an hour. “It is a temple of national consciousness in the form of Ram.”
Gathering at the consecration ceremony of Ram Temple, in Ayodhya, Monday.                                                             PTI picture
He proceeded, thereon, to pronounce upon his countrywide audience, what sounded like a new ethic and ethos he’d have the nation adopt. “Ram is the faith of India, the foundation of India. Ram is the thought of India, the law of India. Ram is the consciousness of India, the contemplation of India. Ram is the prestige of India, the might of India. Ram is the flow, Ram is the influence. Ram is the norm and Ram is the policy.”
It would seem an understatement to call the invited league of celebrities and sadhus gathered before him merely “Ram-maya”, or suffused with Ram. So too of some of the scenes of heady festivity that popped in from far and near quarters of the country, Calcutta included.
The Prime Minister did refer to the Constitution in the Ayodhya context, but only as attestation of faith. “In India’s Constitution, in its first copy, Lord Ram is present. Even after the advent of the Constitution, legal battles over the existence of Lord Shri Ram continued for decades,” Modi said. “I express my gratitude to the judiciary of India, which upheld the dignity of justice. The temple of Lord Ram, synonymous with justice, was also built in a judicial manner.”
It perhaps deserves mention that in unanimously granting the once-disputed site at Ayodhya for the purposes of the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple, the Supreme Court also called the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, an “egregious violation of the rule of law”.
But in truth, the political stewing around Ayodhya began far before the BJP, or Narendra Modi, came anywhere close to power. It was in 1986, when Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister on the heftiest Lok Sabha majority ever awarded by the electorate, that the locks on the then Babri Masjid were undone and a local court allowed Hindu worshippers into the three-domed mosque where congregational namaz had ceased to take place.
In 1989, even while the title suit to the disputed 2.77 acres of land was in the Uttar Pradesh courts, the VHP performed the shilanyas rites of the would-be temple at an adjacent site. It was a widely contested and widely reported event, seen by many as a portent to what lay in the future.
Rajiv Gandhi was learnt to have been keen to participate in the shilanyas, but was persuaded to amend his intention. V.P. Singh had revolted by then, the government’s move to placate the Muslim clergy on the Shah Bano case had stirred up anger against alleged appeasement, Rajiv’s seat was shaken. He did, eventually, arrive in Faizabad, Ayodhya’s twin town, to launch his 1989 Lok Sabha campaign and promised “Ram rajya”. Much in vain, of course.
Ayodhya was a card, often waved or pushed, for political profit. It has travelled a long way since and become an emblazoned billboard that is unembarrassed about proclaiming Narendra Modi, an elected Prime Minister of constitutionally secular India, as Hindu hriday samrat.

But Modi wouldn’t have arrived here without the political astuteness and labours of Lal Krishna Advani, or even the skilled and relatively unabrasive sentiment-building by Murli Manohar Joshi. Both witnessed, first-hand, the demolition of the Babri Masjid; neither was encouraged to be in Ayodhya today, or at the ground-breaking ceremonies in August 2020.
The central star of both stages was Narendra Modi, the man who played dutiful major domo to the crusades Advani triggered following the Palampur Resolution of 1989, which made the construction of a Ram temple at the site of the Babri Masjid the arrowhead of the BJP’s objectives.
The Advani-led “Ram-Rath” campaigns swelled the BJP’s popularity but left the nation riven and incensed along barbed communal fences as never after the Partition. Thousands were killed along flashpoints that opened in the wake of Advani’s yatras, or were sparked by its flaming temper. Hinduism acquired the menace-edge and militancy of Hindutva; the kindly greeting of “Jai Siya Ram” morphed into the “Jai Shri Ram” war cry, although Modi himself has been signalling a return to “Jai Siya Ram” and “Jai Siyapati Ram”.

The Ramjanmabhoomi movement ignited a seminal moment in a secular nation’s lives and times. It shook the belief systems of society and politics, it echoed belligerently from the legislatures to the courthouses, it rent India’s streets bloodied, its populace rekindled with medieval bitterness and loathing. The day the cynically gathered mob at Ayodhya razed the Babri Masjid, in brazen violation of political pledge and underwritten guarantees to the Supreme Court, many deemed it the nation’s second Partition.
The Ramjanmabhoomi movement, Modi has in the past also likened to the Independence movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. He has omitted to mention that Gandhi’s was a painstakingly inclusive mission that brought all manner of Indians together to the common purpose of sending off an imperial regime. Today, Monday, January 22, 2024, sounded like the foundation rite of a nativist one."

The list will be published on the website of the KMC on Monday, said a senior official of the civic body. Kolkatans will have a month to send objections or suggestions.
Hawkers will not be allowed on the pavements along the roads that will be declared as no-vending zones.
The notification issued by the commissioner of the KMC on Sunday asked Kolkatans to send their suggestions or objections to addl_secy@kmcgov.in.
Those unable to send an email can write to the KMC. The letter should be addressed to the commissioner or the municipal secretary of the KMC, said a senior official.
The notification mentions that 1,892 streets in the city have been declared as no-vending zones. The list has been finalised by Kolkata’s town vending committee.
The committee, formed under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, a central law, is the sole authority to regulate street vending. It has among its members KMC officials, hawker leaders and police officers.
“The Town Vending Committee (TVC), Kolkata has recommended for inviting suggestions, recommendation or objection if any from the citizens of Kolkata or others whose interests may affect or will likely to be affected regarding finalisation of vending and no vending zones,” the notification issued on Sunday read.
“1892 streets under the jurisdiction of Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) are proposed as No-Vending Zones”.
“The feedback should be sent...within one month from the date of notification,” it read.
Calcutta High Court had asked the KMC to identify the vending and no-vending zones in the city.
The Telegraph reported on December 6 that the KMC had identified over 1,800 roads as no-vending zones. The affidavit submitted in the court did not contain the names of the roads.
“We will only publish a list of no-vending zones. All other roads that have pavements that are at least 5ft wide will come under the category of vending zones,” said a senior official.
The 2014 act defines a “vending zone” as an area or a place or a location “for the specific use by street vendors for street vending”.
KMC officials said that without a definitive list of no-vending zones, no action can be taken against hawkers who have set up stalls on pavements that had no hawkers previously.
The town vending committee has the power to suspend or  cancel the certificate of vending issued to a hawker for violation of rules or impose penalties on errant hawkers."

On Sunday, the Congress launched a campaign in the districts of Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and North Dinajpur, inviting people to join the yatra. The party, however, bypassed questions about Trinamul, which, like the Congress, is a constituent of the INDIA bloc.
“AICC is looking into the issue. We want people from all walks of life, who believe in the Congress’s ideology and activities, to join the yatra. They can be from any political party,” said Pinaki Sengupta, the Jalpaiguri district Congress president.
On January 28, Rahul will attend a road show in Dhupguri. He will also walk in Jalpaiguri town and in the afternoon, will leave for Siliguri.
Ever since the Congress has announced the yatra, there is no clarity as to whether it will invite Trinamul. In the Trinamul camp, leaders have maintained that they have not received any invitation. Also, a section of leaders in Mamata Banerjee’s party have said that they will not join the yatra unless a decision is reached among the parties over the sharing of seats in Bengal.
In Bengal, Trinamul has offered two Lok Sabha seats — Malda South and Berhampore — to the Congress which the party had won in 2019. The  Congress, however, wants more seats like Darjeeling, Raiganj and Purulia.
A senior Congress functionary in Siliguri asserted that considering the strict stand taken by Trinamul against them in Bengal, most Congress leaders and workers don't want Trinamul to be a part of the yatra.
“Even a couple of days back, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has instructed her party leaders in Murshidabad to intensify political activities ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. This clearly shows that they are not ready to relent or leave any space for us. This is why many leaders and workers of our party don’t want Trinamul in the yatra. We also want to assess our organisational strength and support base through the event, especially in north Bengal,” said the leader.
On Sunday, the Congress also released the detailed itinerary of Rahul Gandhi in north Bengal. There will be a break in the yatra on January 26 and 27, they confirmed, while adding that it would resume from Falakata in Alipurduar district on January 28.
“On January 29, the yatra will enter Bihar via Kishanganj. It will again enter Bengal (in Malda district) from Bihar on January 31,” said a Congress leader."

The application for divorce is pending at the counselling stage and efforts are on for an amicable solution between the woman and her husband, Family Court marriage counsellor Shail Awasthi told PTI on Thursday.
“They got married on May 3 last year. The woman insisted on going on a honeymoon abroad as they are earning well. The husband is an IT professional, while the woman works in a private company,” Awasthi said.
“The husband was reluctant to go abroad for honeymoon and later settled for Goa or somewhere in south India as possible destinations claiming he also had to look after his parents,” the official added.
The man booked flight tickets to Ayodhya and Varanasi without informing his wife and told her about the trip just a day before departure, Awasthi said.
“He told his wife his mother wanted to visit Ayodhya before the idol consecration of the Ram Temple. The woman did not object at the time but had an argument over it once the family returned and later filed for divorce. The woman in her statement has claimed the man took greater care of his parents than her,” the official said, quoting the divorce application.
The couple is being counselled but it may take time for the matter to be resolved, Awasthi added.

The Trinamul Congress chief, at a state government event to commemorate the birth anniversary of Netaji by his statue on Red Road here, hailed him as a “true leader” on account of his uncompromisingly inclusive, pluralist philosophy, apparently underscoring the difference between him and the majoritarian, divisive agenda of leaders in the saffron regime.
“A true leader of this country is one who is flanked by Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Parsis, and Buddhists, all around him. Where can such a leader be seen now? Where… where? Today, such a leader cannot be seen. Nobody like him was born after him,” said Mamata.
“If we had followed Netaji’s words and teachings, we would have been far more developed and successful as a nation,” she added.
The chief minister said it was a shame that Netaji’s birth anniversary was yet to be declared a national holiday.
“A man whom Mahatma Gandhi hailed as Deshneta (leader of the nation)… even after trying for 20 years, I have not been able to get Netaji’s birthday declared a national holiday. I am ashamed and I apologise,” said the chief minister, who has often taken the BJP to task over the delay on this.
“There can be a holiday for political publicity in this country, but not for an icon who sacrificed his life for the nation. The legacy of the freedom fighters weep,” she added, in an apparent reference to the Ram temple consecration event on Monday.
Mamata raised issues such as the abolition of the Planning Commission, envisaged by Netaji, and its replacement by Niti Aayog by the Modi government, besides the inordinate delays in the total declassification of files on the icon who went missing on August 18, 1945.
“It is our grave misfortune, as a nation. Someone who fought for our country, our freedom and gave us direction, we still don’t know the date of his demise. This lack of clarity, this darkness is utterly shameful,” she said.
“After our government came, we declassified 64 files (in 2015), comprising correspondence in the British Raj about our great leader, all facts at our disposal were brought to the public domain,” she added. “The BJP, when it was not in power, had made tall claims about unveiling the mystery. Everything happened thereafter, but they forgot Netaji.”
Mamata called the Niti Aayog a directionless, powerless body that serves no real purpose for the states, unlike the Planning Commission.
“The Planning Commission was also scrapped by them. When it existed, I remember, every year I along with important principal secretaries and the chief secretary used to conduct meetings and discuss planning and money allocation to departments,” said Mamata.
“Niti Aayog has been created which has neither Niti (policy or principle) nor Aayog (commission). It is a wax statue, once in a while it wakes up for Mann Ki Baat (Modi address-the-nation programme)… and waves its head. Seldom in a year, it conducts a meeting. It is a powerless organisation… and doesn’t reflect the people’s concerns,” she added."
4F3JC2D0T4_ZJ93ZIVZVDYWVSZ,Fighter soars on superb aerial action and Hrithik Roshan-Deepika Padukone’s combined swag,"Chandreyee Chatterjee Calcutta Published 25.01.24, 04:33 PM","Chandreyee Chatterjee Calcutta Published 25.01.24, 04:33 PM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/entertainment/fighter-soars-on-superb-aerial-action-and-hrithik-roshan-deepika-padukones-combined-swag/cid/1996150,"When Tom ‘Maverick’ Cruise first did his fly-by in his jet in 1986’s Top Gun, he knocked us off our feet and took our collective breath away. No one came close to matching that aerial thrill till 2022, when Cruise strapped into the cockpit once more for Top Gun: Maverick. Hrithik Roshan’s Shamsher ‘Patty’ Pathania might not have taken our breath away when he pulled a similar stunt on his entry in Siddharth Anand’s Fighter, but he certainly made us sit up and go wide-eyed.
The Fighter trailer would have clued most people into what to expect from the film, and they would be right. Built around the Pulwama and Balakot attacks, it follows the usual template of Pakistani terrorists vowing to bring the Indian defence forces to their knees, spouting anti-Indian vitriol, and Indians hitting back and defeating the enemy while spouting dialogues on what it means to be Indian. The plot is pretty predictable when it comes to patriotic actioners.
What elevates Fighter beyond the predictable is the swag of its two leading actors. Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone make the runway look like the ramp every time they walk slo-mo to and from their planes, helmet at hip. While individually they are commanding, together they are great at playing off each other, whether on ground or in air. Only their budding romance seems a bit forced. Deepika’s awestruck look at Hrithik’s OTT entry rankles even more, given that she herself got a stellar aerial intro sequence.
Hrithik’s Patty is an ace fighter pilot with a maverick streak who is grappling with personal tragedy hidden behind a cocky facade. Deepika’s Minal ‘Minni’ Rathore is breaking the glass ceiling as a female squadron leader flying choppers. Both of them embody a certain seriousness that their posts demand amid all the camaraderie with the others in their newly-formed unit Air Dragons. And both are superb in the aerial combat sequences.
The two leads are ably buoyed by a stellar supporting cast — Karan Singh Grover as Sartaj ‘Taj’ Gill and Akshay Oberoi as Basheer ‘Bash’ Khan, both Air Dragons team members led by Anil Kapoor’s Rakesh ‘Rocky’ Jai Singh, the Group Captain. Kapoor delivers once again, every inch the commanding officer. Some of the most emotionally charged scenes are between Patty and Rocky, who are connected by a past tragedy.
Fighter’s star attraction are its aerial sequences; everything else is really just a distraction. Whether it is the fun training scenes with pilots showing off their skills or tense aerial battles with the enemy, when the birds are in air everything else pales in comparison. It is not a copy of the aerial moves in Top Gun, so there is enough originality to keep you on the edge of your seat. The pulsating music and the echoing melody of Vande Mataram accompanying the visuals just enhance the experience.
No wonder there is a distinct drop in pace when the birds are on the ground, especially when that time is filled with jingoism and a little bit of forced patriarchy bashing.
The film’s lowest point is its villain — terrorist Azhar Akhtar, played by Rishabh Sawhney, who, with his ironed hair and puckered lips, seems to run Pakistan’s military operations instead of just a terrorist outfit. He feels more like a caricature of the Terminator than a flesh-and-blood bad guy. So does the climactic on-ground (in air, it is once again full-thrust thrill) hero-on-villain one-twos.
But the action and the star power far outweigh these drawbacks, and Fighter is also a smartly shot and tightly edited film. If the jingoism is cut out, Fighter: Patty is a film we wouldn’t mind waiting to see sometime in the future."

Mudur New Delhi Published 22.01.24, 06:46 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/insurance-reimbursements-fail-to-protect-breast-cancer-patients-from-financial-hardship/cid/1995337,"The reimbursements that government-funded and private health insurance schemes now provide do not protect breast cancer patients in India from financial hardship associated with the treatment and related costs, health researchers have said.
This is particularly so because non-medical expenses on accommodation, food or travel directly related to treatment — but not covered under insurance schemes — made up 44 per cent of the overall costs, the researchers found. Medical costs account for the remaining 56 per cent.
The researchers have found that reimbursement levels ranged from 92 per cent of medical costs from private insurance schemes to 63 per cent of medical costs from government-funded schemes.
Their study — which scrutinised the expenses incurred by a sample of 429 patients under treatment at the Tata Memorial Centre (TMC) — is the first in the country to measure costs through the duration of treatment, which lasted over a year for some patients.
“Our results underline the need for higher caps in the insurance packages for breast cancer,” said Tabassum Wadasadawala, professor of radiation oncology at the TMC’s Advanced Centre for Treatment Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai.
For the full sample of patients, the average out-of-pocket expenditure incurred — that is, the non-medical costs plus the un-reimbursed medical costs — was Rs 186,000. It was lower for patients covered by government-funded schemes and higher for patients covered by private insurance.
Only eight per cent of the patients received full reimbursement. The study has been published in The Lancet Regional Health Southeast Asia.
The large proportion of non-medical costs appears to reflect the need for patients to travel for treatment.
About 55 per cent of the patients who had sought treatment at the TMC came from other states, mainly Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
The researchers found that the average medical treatment costs ranged from Rs 94,000 for patients covered by government-funded insurance to Rs 258,000 for patients covered by employee insurance schemes and Rs 336,000 for patients under private insurance.
The average reimbursement levels were Rs 59,000 (63 per cent of the medical costs) for patients covered by government-funded insurance, Rs 196,000 (76 per cent) for patients covered by employee insurance schemes, and Rs 308,000 (92 per cent) for patients with private insurance.
“The reason for such large differences in the reimbursement levels across different schemes is unclear,” said Suraj Maiti, a project scientist at the International Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, and a member of the study team. “This could be a subject of future research.”
The sample of patients included 11 covered by the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PMJAY), a flagship scheme launched by the Narendra Modi government that offers poor households up to Rs 500,000 annually to cover hospitalisation costs.
Doctors say the treatment costs for breast cancer in other large private hospitals could be higher than those documented by the TMC study. One indicator comes from the relatively higher medical treatment costs for the richest households in the TMC sample.
“The findings suggest that the higher the patients’ ability to pay, the larger the costs they’ll incur,” Maiti said.
The other team members were Sudeep Gupta, Tejaswi Kanala, Namita Puchali, Rajiv Sarin and Vani Parmar from the TMC and Sanjay Mohanty and Soumendu Sen from the IIPS."

While spearheading the TMC’s ‘Sanhati Rally’, which coincided with the Ram temple consecration in Ayodhya, the party supremo underscored Bengal's pivotal role in preserving the principles of secularism and inclusiveness in the country.
“I don't believe in politicising religion ahead of elections. I am against such practice. I have no objection against those worshipping Lord Ram, but object to interference with the food habits of people,"" she said in her concluding remarks at the rally.
The feisty TMC boss, accompanied by religious leaders of various faiths and party leaders, began the 'all-faith harmony' march from Hazra More and it concluded at Park Circus crossing here.
""They (BJP) talk about Lord Ram, but what about Goddess Sita? She was all along with Lord Ram during his exile. They don't speak about her as they are anti-women. We are worshippers of Goddess Durga, so they should not try to lecture us about religion,"" the CM asserted.

On a day RJD president Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya took a swipe at Kumar for ""changing his ideology as the wind changes its direction"" in posts on 'X' following the JD(U) president's swipe at parties promoting family members in politics, a BJP leader well-versed with the state's politics said the party will be guided by its future political imperatives, and not past bitterness.
He, however, noted that any call has to be taken by the party's top brass.
The BJP has been showing signs of warming up to Kumar, who has swapped his alliance preference between the saffron party and the RJD-Congress-Left camp frequently while remaining in power, with its leaders toning down their criticism of him of late and even praising him at times.
Union Home Minister Amit Shah himself sounded more open to such a possibility in a recent interview. Asked about the likelihood of the Janata Dal (U) president's return to the BJP-led alliance, Shah said the party will consider if such a proposal is ever made.
Earlier, Shah had often asserted that the doors had been closed for Kumar's return to the country's ruling alliance.
Bihar's longest-serving chief minister has been cut up with the INDIA bloc for not getting a position in the alliance commensurate with his stature and also favours an early assembly poll to go with the Lok Sabha elections, a suggestion which has not drawn a positive response from the RJD, the biggest party in the state's ruling alliance, sources said.
JD(U) and RJD leaders have also been sniping at each other amid apprehensions among Kumar's supporters that their ally has been trying to undermine him in matters of governance as well as politics.
Kumar's decision to take over as the party president by cutting short the tenure of Lalan Singh was seen as a determined effort by him to take firm control of its organisation amid suggestions by a section of JD(U) leaders that the chief minister's confidant may have grown too close to the RJD or was pursuing an independent agenda.
The RJD has, however, taken some placatory moves by first agreeing to the relegation of Education Minister Chandra Shekhar to the relatively insignificant portfolio of sugarcane industries.
Acharya also deleted her posts targeting the chief minister without naming him, hours after putting them out. The Bihar BJP accused Acharya, who does not hold any position in the RJD, of insulting Kumar and demanded an apology from her.
The INDIA bloc has been marred by incoherence and distrust, with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Singh Mann dealing twin blows on Wednesday that their parties, the TMC and AAP respectively, will go solo in the Lok Sabha elections expected in April-May.
Signs of disconnect among the INDIA parties in Bihar will suit the BJP in the run-up to the elections as the same alliance had handed it a big defeat in the 2015 assembly polls before Kumar joined hands again with the BJP-led NDA, which then swept the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
He vaulted into the opposition's alliance in 2022 as the BJP grew increasingly assertive following his party's sub-par performance in the 2020 assembly polls.
With Kumar's critics both within the opposition and the BJP being of the view that he has diminished as a political force, experts say it will be interesting to see how the shrewd leader manages to close out yet another round of political gamesmanship as the elections approach.

4X6VN656YZ_DY92YQKTJHCTGIO,INDIA bloc trouble: Bengal Congress in disarray over high command's diktat for alliance with Trinamul,"Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 23.01.24, 07:53 PM","Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 23.01.24, 07:53 PM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/india-bloc-trouble-bengal-congress-in-disarray-over-high-commands-diktat-for-alliance-with-trinamul/cid/1995736,"Some torn posters and damaged  banners of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in north Bengal’s Cooch Behar town on Monday and the subsequent reaction of state Congress leaders the next day indicated serious confusion within the party's rank and file in the state over how far to defy the high command's insistence on a poll alliance with the Trinamul.
Local leaders in Cooch Behar and those in Calcutta spoke in different voices on who to blame for the vandalism.
Bengal Congress spokesperson Soumya Aich Roy blamed the Trinamul Congress. “This is how Trinamul is trying to stop the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Bengal. A violent party like Trinamul which is in cohorts with the BJP will not succeed,” he said in a statement, making it clear the state unit of the party was not willing to concede any ground to the ruling Trinamul in Bengal.
But the Cooch Behar district Congress president Robin Roy did not rule out the possibility of the local BJP’s hand behind the incident.
Rahul Gandhi, who was some 318 km away in Guwahati on Tuesday, was possibly unaware of a students’ wing leader in the north Bengal district lodging a police complaint or that other functionaries were openly blaming the ruling Trinamul over the vandalism.
Hours before the vandalism in Calcutta on Monday, Bengal chief minister and Trinamul supremo Mamata Banerjee had complained of not getting the respect she deserved in the multi-party alliance that has been cobbled together in last July to fight the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
The Wayanad MP’s unity march from Manipur to Mumbai will enter Bengal from Boxirhat in Cooch Behar from Assam on January 25.
The yatra has faced administrative obstacles in BJP-ruled states in the north-east, especially Manipur and Assam, where a belligerent chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma ordered the state DGP to lodge an FIR against him for provoking the crowd after after supporters broke barricades erected to prevent them from moving ahead.
North Bengal’s Cooch Behar could have been expected to offer friendlier ground to Rahul, given that both the parties are important constituents of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance. But the complaint followed by the accusations speak otherwise.
After Bengal, Rahul is expected to proceed towards Bihar’s Kishangunj by January 29. His yatra will take a two-day break on January 26 and 27. After the yatra is through Bihar Rahul will enter Murshidabad on February 1. On the same day, Mamata will leave for North Bengal.
“We have good ties with Mamata and her party, talks for seat-sharing are on,” Rahul said during an interaction with mediapersons in Assam on Tuesday. “Sometimes our leaders say something, sometimes their leaders say things. None of it will have any impact on the alliance,"" he added, indicating he was still optimistic of a seat sharing deal.
In Tuesday's meeting with Birbhum leaders, Mamata reportedly expressed her anger with the Congress.
""Didi said we are a part of INDIA and offered two seats. Sometimes they ask for eight to 12 seats. Sometimes even 14. This is absurd. We have to retain both the seats in Birbhum,"" said a Trinamul functionary.
On the ground, however, there has been little progress to show that the Congress and Trinamul are inching closer to an electoral understanding in Bengal.
Though Mamata has told various district units of the Trinamul to go it alone, especially the one in Murshidabad, the last proverbial bastion of the Congress in Bengal, she did betray her impatience with the Congress high command following her harmony rally on Monday.
“I suggested the name INDIA, but when I attend its meetings I see the CPM trying to call the shots. I am not given the respect I deserve. I will not take orders from those against whom I fought all my life,” Mamata had said on Monday at Calcutta’s Park Circus maidan.
While the Congress and the Trinamul have fought poll battles together in the past, Rahul and Mamata have never shared the dais. Not even in 2011 when the Trinamul and the Congress defeated the Left Front contesting together with Mamata leading from the front. Five years later, Rahul did share the dais with Mamata’s then bete noire and former Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the same Park Circus grounds when the Left and the Congress contested the 2016 Assembly polls together, unsuccessfully.
The electoral returns for both the Congress and the CPM have dwindled in subsequent elections.
Within Trinamul circles Mamata’s dislike for the Wayanad MP is well-known, though she still maintains close ties with Sonia Gandhi. Mamata’s digs at the Congress have usually been aimed at the younger Gandhi and not his mother.
“She is saying these things as excuses to make the contest in Bengal a bipolar one between the BJP and the Trinamul, like she did in 2019 and 2021. The CPM has been attending  INDIA meetings from Day One. Why didn’t she walk out then?” asked Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, state Congress president and Berhampore MP.
To those close to him, Chowdhury has made it clear that he would contest the polls as an Independent from Berhampore if he has to but will not go for any understanding with Mamata's Trinamul.
All the three political parties in Bengal, the Trinamul, the Congress and the CPM are partners in INDIA against the BJP. Neither the Congress nor the CPM has any representative in the state Assembly, while in Lok Sabha the Congress won two seats in 2019.
While the Bengal leaders have made it clear that they don’t want any alliance with the Trinamul, the Congress high command expects an  improved tally by joining forces with the Trinamul.
“We have been trying to convince the high command that any alliance with Trinamul will go against our interests. We will lose whatever little votes we still have to the BJP. But the high command feels there is a better chance of winning holding the hands of the Trinamul,” said a Congress leader.
Trinamul is ready to leave the two existing seats for the Congress out of the 42. Trinamul insiders said Mamata could agree to four seats though chances are dim.
The Bengal Congress on the other hand is ready for an alliance with either the Left or go it alone. However, in the case of any alliance with the Left how many seats they would ask for is not clear yet. The Congress is keen on seats in south Bengal as well and not just Murshidabad, Maldah and North Dinajpur.
“We are not waiting for any one. Our stand is very clear. Whoever is against the BJP and the Trinamul in Bengal can join us. Now it is for them to decide,” said Mohammad Salim, CPM state secretary."
4ZR6RKF7BQ_QRJV0OHNKR0X11V,Angry Mamata says Trinamul will go it alone in Bengal in the coming Lok Sabha polls,"Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 12:59 PM","Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 12:59 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/west-bengal/angry-mamata-banerjee-says-trinamul-will-go-it-alone-in-bengal-in-the-coming-lok-sabha-polls/cid/1995872,"Accusing the Congress of keeping her and her party in the dark about the schedule of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Bengal on Wednesday, an irate Mamata Banerjee said she would go it alone in Bengal in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
“I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we will alone defeat BJP,” Mamata said before leaving for Burdwan.
Mamata’s comments come a day before Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is scheduled to reach Bengal’s Cooch Behar.
On Tuesday, while in Assam Rahul had said that talks were on with the Trinamul (on seat-sharing) and he shared a good rapport with Mamata. “We have good ties with Mamata and her party, talks for seat-sharing are on,” Rahul said during an interaction with mediapersons Tuesday. “Sometimes our leaders say something, sometimes their leaders say things. None of it will have any impact on the alliance,”he added.
But on Wednesday morning, Mamata issued a firm denial.
“Nobody has spoken with me. My proposal was rejected on the very first day,” Mamata said while replying to a query. “Nobody has discussed anything with me. This is an absolute lie. Ei je amader rajye aaschhe amake ek baar o boleni (That he is coming to our state, I was not informed).”
“I had told them they can contest in 300 seats across the country and leave the remaining to regional parties. But they would not listen. Congress has no stake in Bengal. We will decide what to do after the elections are over,” Mamata said.
The chief minister’s comments appear to have sealed the fate of the possibility of an electoral adjustment in Bengal between the two parties. It is not clear whether the Congress high command will make any further attempts to cajole the Trinamul chief or go with the party's Bengal unit proposal to go to polls alone or in alliance with the Left.
Rahul will be entering Bengal through Boxirhat in Cooch Behar on Thursday as a part of his yatra on Thursday. After a two-day break on January 26 and 27, he will pass through the North Bengal districts on Sunday and Monday and then proceed to Bihar.
On February 1, in the second leg of the Yatra in Bengal, Rahul will be in Murshidabad, the only Congress bastion in Bengal, from where state Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury is an MP.
There is indeed some truth in Mamata’s claim that she was kept in the dark about the yatra. From Delhi, Congress leaders had issued an open invite to all constituents of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) to join the yatra as it passes through  different states.
On Tuesday, the Trinamul’s Assam state unit members were seen in Rahul’s yatra bearing the party flags. Trinamul leaders in Calcutta claimed it was not a party decision, though the Assam unit stuck to it.
According to insiders in both the Trinamul and the Congress, no call was actually made to Mamata about the yatra, though individual leaders in Delhi may have been informed.“Some of our MPs in Delhi were told but no one said a word to Mamata di. She is the undisputed leader in Bengal,” said a Trinamul leader.
On the other hand, the CPM state secretary Mohammad Salim was invited to join the yatra.
After her peace march on Monday, Mamata had aired grievances on not being given due respect in the alliance.  “I suggested the name INDIA, but when I attend its meetings I see the CPM trying to call the shots. I am not given the respect I deserve. I will not take orders from those against whom I fought all my life,” Mamata had said at Calcutta’s Park Circus maidan.
Mamata’s comments raised a loud cheer in the saffron camp. BJP Bengal co-minder and the party’s IT cell head Amit Malviya said Mamata’s decision to go alone was a sign of desperation. “Unable to hold her political ground, she wants to fight all seats in the hope that she can still be relevant, after the polls. Much against her desire, to emerge as the face of the Opposition alliance, no one ever proposed her name. Her several trips to Delhi, to build a national profile, didn’t work,” Malviya wrote on X.
Malviya said, “She just couldn’t hide the blood of post poll violence and rid herself of the nauseating stink of appeasement politics. An embarrassed Mamata, to save face, pitched for Mallikarjun Kharge, ruling herself out in the process. She realised, despite her bluster, she had no currency in the Opposition camp and had been building ground to snap out for long.”
Following Mamata’s decision the CPM is most likely to join the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Bengal. Earlier, it had expressed reservations on being seen together with the Trinamul, though both Mamata and CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury have attended several meetings of the alliance, including a public meeting in Patna last year."

Justice Subramonium Prasad said the former Jharkhand chief minister’s petition challenging the Lokpal proceedings as well as the complaint was “premature”.
It is premature at this juncture, the judge stated while delivering the verdict on Soren’s petition.
A copy of the judgment is awaited.
In the complaint made in August 2020, Dubey, the BJP Lok Sabha MP from Jharkhand’s Godda seat, claimed: “Shibu Soren and his family members acquired huge wealth and properties by misusing the public exchequer and have been grossly indulged in corruption.”
On September 12, 2022, the high court had stayed the Lokpal proceedings and said the matter required consideration.
Assailing the complaint and the Lokpal proceedings, Soren argued before the high court that the case against him was “purely malafide” and “politically motivated”.
He argued the anti-corruption ombudsman could not have entertained the complaint as the allegations pertained to a time which was seven years before the date of submission of the complaint.

Some 40,000 people from the hills to the plains of Bengal made it a colourful congregation in their traditional attire.
Mamata and her party colleagues tried to weave into the one-and-a-half-hour rally representatives from all possible religions, faiths, castes and creeds to showcase Bengal’s diversity in faiths and cultures.
Calcutta apart, Trinamul organised interfaith rallies in each of the 341 blocks.
Mamata, who led the march themed on “religion is personal, the festival is universal”, was accompanied by various religious heads, followed by thousands of women, men, youths and children dressed up to represent various faiths.
The Telegraph spoke to some of those who walked to celebrate India’s unity in diversity.
Indubhushan Utthasini, Hindu priest
The 38-year-old Hindu priest travelled around 80km from his village in East Midnapore’s Mecheda to join the rally as a member of an organisation of priests.
Calling himself a devotee of Lord Ram, he said he worshipped the deity every day. Before leaving home early on Monday for Calcutta, he offered flowers to Lord Ram, Utthasini said.
An arts graduate and a professional priest, Utthasini explained why he took part in the interfaith rally. He said it wasn’t for political reasons but to send a message that the people of Bengal stood for inclusiveness.
“I am a devotee of Shri Ram and I worship him every day. I am happy with the temple that has been built in Ayodhya for our God. But I don’t want any political party to showcase its power by setting up a temple in our country. Ram is for all, not just for one particular community or religion. That’s why the rally of people from all faiths is the right way to celebrate the occasion. We all brothers here,” Utthasini said, adding that he would join such rallies in the future too.
Churmit Lepcha, president of the Indigenous Lepcha Tribal Association
Churmit, 40, travelled around 660km from Kalimpong with her friend Khusboo Chhetri, 26.
The woman dressed in traditional Lepcha attire said she travelled the distance to Calcutta to support the inclusive character of the country.
“Our chief minister Mamata Banerjee has done a lot for our community and has tried to preserve the spirit of brotherhood in Bengal. When I heard that she was organising an interfaith rally on January 22, I decided to travel from Kalimpong to Calcutta,” Churmit said.
Nagma Khatun, Muslim resident of Metiabruz
Nagma, 28, is one of the 400 Muslim women from Metiabruz who woke up early to finish her daily chores to participate in the rally.
One of the five women who held a banner of the Sanhati Yatra, Nagma was at the head of a team of around 4,000 women marchers who shouted slogans for amity.
A high-school dropout, Nagma said: “I don’t have any problem with any temple. We welcome the temple but can’t stand political leaders flexing muscles to celebrate the temple as a victory over others. Our chief minister always speaks for inclusiveness. Since my childhood, I have seen people of diverse faiths and communities living peacefully in my city. I walked in the rally for peace and harmony.”
Raju Shaw, Vaishnav saint with ISKCON
Shaw, 50, said his family migrated to Bengal from Bihar’s Gaya 35 years ago.
“I took part in the rally as I understand the need for inclusiveness, which is an integral part of Bengal,” said the saint who showed a small bag with “Hare Krishna, Hare Rama” inscribed several times on it.
He always carries the bag that contains his japamala (a loop of prayer beads), he said, adding it meant he always carries the name of Lord Ram in his hands and heart. But he did not support the way the consecration of the Ram temple had become a “political weapon” for a party.
“Ram is in our hearts but why will his august temple be used as a political platform? Here (at this interfaith rally), I am walking with people from all communities and I don’t have to think if someone beside me is from any other religion,” Shaw said.
Shantanu Sarkar, high school student
Santanu, 18, from Bowbazar, dressed up as a Muslim cleric to take part in the rally.
His friends Deb and Saikat, who walked with him, were dressed up like a Hindu priest and a Christian bishop, respectively.
“Can you identify our religion before we tell you our names?” grinned the teenager as he marched on with his friends amid thousands.
He said that recently, local Trinamul leaders asked him and his friends if they were interested in taking part in Monday’s interfaith rally dressed up as leaders of different faiths.
“We immediately agreed. It was a great opportunity to showcase the secular fabric of our country,” Santanu said."

Nadda, accompanied by Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva and other party leaders, was present at the Jhandewalan Temple here while Shah, along with Union Minister Meenakshi Lekhi and other leaders, was present at Lakshmi Narayan Temple, also known as Birla Temple.
They offered prayers at these temples on the occasion.
""It is a historic day which has come after 500 years of waiting. It is a very auspicious day for all of us,"" Nadda told reporters.
Emphasising that the wait and promise of five centuries was fulfilled on Monday, Home Minister Amit Shah said many generations sacrificed so much waiting for this moment, but no ""fear and terror"" could shake the resolve to build the temple again at Shri Ram Janmabhoomi.
In a message on 'X', Shah also said that today, this resolve has been fulfilled under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Defence Minister Singh described the event in Ayodhya as a ""revolutionary work"" and said those who witnessed this moment are fortunate.
""Everyone feels that a new era is beginning. We all are feeling that after a long time, Maryada Purushottam Ram is returning again to Ayodhya,"" Singh told reporters here.
“We all are fortunate that we are getting the opportunity to witness the moment,"" he said, adding, ""Our prime minister has started a new era. And, he has the blessings of Lord Ram."" 	 Several other Union ministers, including Hardeep Singh Puri, Ashwini Vaishnaw, and Jitendra Singh also watched the live streaming of the ceremony and took part in special prayers held at different parts of the city.
Consecration of the Ram Lalla idol was held amid religious fervour in the newly built temple in Ayodhya. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took part in the 'pran pratishtha' rituals in the presence of Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.
A fireworks show was held at the Delhi BJP to rejoice the moment. Party workers and commoners also clicked pictures at a selfie point set up at the Pant Marg office.
BJP MP Gautam Gambhir celebrated the consecration ceremony with the women at GB Road near New Delhi railway station and presented them sarees and shawls.
""Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be remembered forever for the occasion that brought the country together from North to South and from East to West,"" Gambhir said speaking at the function.
The Delhi BJP had decorated 2,486 temples and other public spots for the public to watch the 'pran pratishtha' ceremony live. The party leaders also organised 'bhandaras' (community kitchens) across the city.
In the evening, the party leaders and workers lighted 'diyas' at their residences and public places to celebrate the ""momentous occasion"" as Diwali.
BJP leader and former Union minister Vijay Goel said he will soon visit Ayodhya to pay obeisance to Ram Lalla, accompanying the 'karsevaks' (volunteers) who had visited the place along with him during the Ram temple movement in 1992.

A large number of devotees, both locals and visitors from other states, gathered outside the main gates for hours since late on Monday night, waiting to enter the premises.
Carrying flags bearing visages of Lord Ram and chanting ""Jai Shri Ram"", the devotees waited for hours in the biting cold before the doors of the grand temple opened.
""Felt so delighted, my life's aim has been fulfilled. Our ancestors struggled for this and it has been brought to fruition. The arrangement should continue like this and the name of Lord Ram should reign for ages,"" said Manish Verma, a devotee from Punjab.
An idol of the new Ram Lalla was consecrated at the Ayodhya temple on Monday, a landmark event led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who also gave a clarion call to go beyond the grand mandir's construction to build the foundation of a ""strong, capable and divine"" India of the next 1,000 years.
""January 22, 2024, is not merely a date in the calendar but heralds the advent of a new era,"" Modi said after he performed a series of rituals in the 'garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum)' with the consecration taking place during an 84-second 'Abhijeet muhurta' starting at 12.29 pm.
The prime minister also prostrated himself before the 51-inch idol that depicts the child Ram.
""Today, our Ram has arrived. After a long wait for ages, our Ram has arrived. Our Ram Lalla will no longer live in a tent. Our Ram Lalla will stay in a magnificent temple,"" Modi said in his address to the invitees, which included seers, leading figures from different fields and those part of the decades-long Ram Janmabhoomi movement for building the temple.
A large number of the invitees, including seers, later had a 'darshan' of the deity soon after the consecration ceremony ended.
For the general public, the doors of the temple opened on Tuesday morning.
Waiting in the serpentine queues outside the temple were people who have been camping in Ayodhya since before the consecration ceremony, having made long and difficult journeys to reach the temple town.
Nitish Kumar, a resident of Bihar's Madhepura district, cycled more than 600 kilometres to reach Ayodhya.
""There is a massive rush but I am hopeful I will get a chance to have 'darshan' today. I will start my journey back once my wish is fulfilled. Though I couldn't go to the temple on Monday, what a day it was to be in Ayodhya,"" he told PTI.
Anurag Sharma from Rajasthan's Sikar was seen walking around with a model of the temple on the day of the consecration ceremony.
""I brought this model with me from my hometown. I arrived on the inaugural flight to Ayodhya and I have been here since then. I will go back only after having a 'darshan' of Ram Lalla,"" he told PTI.
Groups of people could also be seen marching towards the temple, passing through the decked up Ram Path.
""Ram Lalla gave us the strength to walk all the way from Chhattisgarh and now He only will get us through this crowd so we can take His blessings,"" said Sunil Madho, part of an eight-member group that undertook a 'padyatra' to Ayodhya.
Maharashtra native Gopal Krishna, who arrived in Ayodhya a few days ago, also jostled in the thick crowd as it moved towards the security check.
""We came here a few days ago as Lord Ram called us. People were telling us to not travel as police would impose restrictions on travel and rooms would not be available in hotels. We are staying at an ashram and this is the day we waited for,"" he told PTI.
He was accompanied by a few friends with whom he travelled in a four-wheeler to Ayodhya from Akola district.
The gates of the temple, decorated with flowers and lights, turned into selfie spots for the devotees as they gathered to join the queues.
The devotees chanted ""Jai Shri Ram"" as they walked in and out of the temple complex. Inside the main temple, ""Jai Shri Ram"" chants reverberated in its grand halls.
The temple complex, built in the traditional Nagara style, is 380 feet long from the east to the west, 250 feet wide and will eventually rise to 161 feet at the 'shikhar'. It is supported by 392 pillars and has 44 doors.
Lakhs of people watched the 'pran pratishtha (consecration)' ceremony on television in their homes and neighbourhood temples, savouring the historic moment on Monday.
A bevy of artistes performed folk dances, a 'palki yatra' was conducted by a religious troupe from Bhopal and scores of devotees from Ayodhya and other cities chanted ""Jai Shri Ram"" in the streets of the temple town as the ceremony unfolded.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a function organised to celebrate birth centenary of Thakur, Yadav also demanded that BSP founder Kanshi Ram and socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia should also be awarded Bharat Ratna.
""The caste-based survey conducted by the Bihar government forced the Center to confer Bharat Ratna on Karpoori Thakur. There is an atmosphere of fear in the BJP... It's a big victory for us. Our party supremo Lalu Prasad has been demanding Bharat Ratna for Karpoori-ji for several years,"" he said, addressing RJD workers.
""Bharat Ratna for Karpoori Thakur has been a very old demand of ours. We had also made this demand when PM Narendra Modi came to Bihar to attend centenary celebrations of the state assembly. It is a matter of great happiness that finally Karpoori Thakur has been awarded Bharat Ratna, but its impact will also be seen politically,"" he added.
Yadav also shared on X a video of the Bihar assembly centenary function in which he can be seen making the demand in the presence of PM Modi.
""Our government is working for the overall development of the state. We have fulfilled what we promised. Lakhs of vacancies will be filled in many departments in the coming months,"" he claimed.
Targeting the BJP, Yadav said that ""some people"" were doing politics of religion and caste.
""We will not allow divisive forces to create rift in the society,"" he added.
The RJD leader also hit out at the BJP-led government at the Centre, alleging that it was using the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to target opposition leaders.
""If Lalu Yadav did not bow before the BJP, then Tejashwi Yadav will also not bow. We will have to fight the Lok Sabha elections with full strength. They will keep using CBI and ED against me and other opposition leaders,"" he said.
In his address, Prasad said that his demand for a Bharat Ratna for Thakur was old.
""Tejashwi has rightly said that now Bharat Ratna should be awarded to Kanshi Ram and Ram Manohar Lohia,"" he noted.
Speaking to reporters at a different event, Tejashwi had said, ""We have also been demanding Bharat Ratna for Kanshi Ram and Lohia-ji. The Center should award Bharat Ratna to them also.""

5AUEVJFDN1_ZCB7KCT0W9GED3V,Nirmala Sitharaman second finance minister to present budget six times in a row,"PTI New Delhi Published 26.01.24, 12:28 PM","PTI New Delhi Published 26.01.24, 12:28 PM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/business/nirmala-sitharaman-second-finance-minister-to-present-budget-six-times-in-a-row/cid/1996307,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will set a record by presenting the sixth Budget in a row -- 5 annual Budgets and one interim -- a feat achieved so far only by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai.
With the presentation of interim Budget on February 1, Sitharaman will surpass the records of her predecessors like Manmohan Singh, Arun Jaitley, P Chidambaram, and Yashwant Sinha,  who had presented five budgets in a row.  Desai, as Finance Minister, had presented five annual Budgets and one interim Budget between 1959-1964.
The interim Budget 2024-25 to be presented by Sitharaman on February 1, will be a vote-on-account that will give the government authority to spend certain sums of money till a new government comes to office after the April-May general elections.
As the Parliamentary elections are due, Sitharaman's interim Budget may not contain any major policy changes.
Speaking at an industry event last month, Sitharaman had ruled out any ""spectacular announcement"" in the interim Budget, saying it would just be a vote-on-account before the general elections.
A vote-on-account, once approved by Parliament, will authorise the government to withdraw money from the Consolidated Fund of India on pro-rata basis to meet expenditure for the April-July period.
The new government, which is likely to be formed around June, will come up with a final Budget for 2024-25 sometime in July.
Usually, interim Budgets do not contain major policy announcements, but nothing stops the government from taking steps which are necessary to deal with the urgent issues facing the economy.
After the Modi government came to power in 2014, Arun Jaitley took charge of the finance ministry and presented five Budgets in a row from 2014-15 to 2018-19.  It was in 2017, that Jaitley departed from the colonial-era tradition of presenting Budget on the last working day of February to 1st of the month.
Piyush Goyal, who was holding the additional charge of the ministry due to ill health of Jaitley, presented the interim Budget for 2019-20 on February 1, 2019.  Goyal had hiked standard deduction for salaried taxpayers by Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000. Also, the tax rebate for taxpayers whose annual taxable income did not exceed Rs 5 lakh was increased from Rs 2,500 to Rs 12,500.
After the 2019 general elections, in the Modi 2.0 Government, Sitharaman was given the charge of the finance portfolio. She became the second woman to have presented Budget after Indira Gandhi, who had presented the Budget for financial year 1970-71.
That year, Sitharaman did away with the traditional budget briefcase and instead went for a 'bahi-khata' with the National Emblem to carry the speech and other documents.
Under Sitharaman, India has weathered the Covid pandemic with an array of policy measures announced for the poor and continued its tag of the fastest growing major economy and a 'bright spot' in the world economy.
India is racing to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2027-28 and a USD 30 trillion by 2047.
Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai who holds the tag of presenting 10 Budgets -- the maximum by any finance minister -- had presented six of them, including one interim, in a row.
The first Budget of Independent India was presented by the first finance minister R K Shanmukham Chetty.
Sitharaman, who will be presenting her sixth Budget in a row, is expected to come up with some measures, especially to boost the rural sector as the agriculture sector growth in 2023-24 is estimated to decelerate to 1.8 per cent, from 4 per cent, in the preceding year.
Rakesh Nangia, Chairman, Nangia Andersen India said given the proximity to the elections, the Budget is expected to focus on immediate fiscal needs rather than introducing broad long-term economic reforms.
In the last interim budget for FY 2019-20, while the overall tax structure remained unchanged, there were certain specific tax rebate and standard deduction concessions.
""While major announcements may be deferred until after the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, the Budget is expected to address ongoing concerns and lay the foundation for future economic growth. This strategic approach aims to balance immediate fiscal responsibilities with long-term economic objectives in a pre-election context,"" Nangia said.

5C80OBCPRP_85HY7T0HE6V0J7C,"INDIA braces, Bihar duo may fall apart: Lalu Prasad-Nitish Kumar play friend-foe again","Dev Raj Patna Published 26.01.24, 05:39 AM","Dev Raj Patna Published 26.01.24, 05:39 AM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/india-braces-bihar-duo-may-fall-apart-lalu-prasad-nitish-kumar-play-friend-foe-again/cid/1996197,"Bihar is agog with a startling but not unlikely buzz — that Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad, the two men who have taken turns to lord over the state for more than three decades, are about to fall apart yet again. The second Mahagatbandhan experiment is on the brink with Nitish likely to pull out.
The BJP central leadership was in hyperactive mode all day; Bihar party chief Samrat Choudhary and other senior members were summoned to Delhi and were closeted at Union home minister Amit Shah’s residence with party president J.P. Nadda till late evening.
Should Nitish switch sides again, as speculation in Patna’s political circles suggests, the key impact will not be so much on the state as on the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. A break-up in Bihar’s ruling alliance will render a debilitating blow to the INDIA formation, already battling dissonance in Bengal and Punjab.
A political source in the know of Thursday’s fast-paced events told The Telegraph that Nitish could also be exploring the possibility of recommending the dissolution of the Assembly in order that a new Assembly can be elected along with the Lok Sabha polls. There can, of course, be no confirmation of this in the current state of Bihar’s political fluidity. Some suggested that Nitish and his trusted intermediaries were in touch with the top BJP leaders in Delhi.
Signs of trouble in the ruling alliance emerged on Thursday following a series of deriding posts by RJD president Lalu Prasad’s daughter Rohini Acharya on X; her posts apparently targeted chief minister Nitish Kumar for his public criticism of dynastic politics on Wednesday.
Though the posts did not name Nitish, the chief minister was clearly upset; he expressed his annoyance to deputy chief minister and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav at a state cabinet meeting and stomped off.
With the matters coming to a head in an alliance that has been under visible strain in recent weeks, Rohini deleted her posts.
But that may not have mollified the chief minister; neither did it stop people in the thick of power circles from wondering whether Nitish was about to effect another somersault, now a thing of legend in contemporary politics. As one observer remarked sardonically, “For Nitish, going anywhere is like homecoming.”
A few other back-to-back developments added to the sense of political turbulence that may not only rock the alliance but even sink it.
Nitish cancelled all his scheduled appointments and went into a huddle with trusted party leaders Bijendra Prasad Yadav, Vijay Choudhary, Ashok Choudhary, Sanjay Jha (all ministers), state JDU president Umesh Kushwaha and a few others.
The JDU has also asked all its MLAs to return to Patna. Sources in the party indicated that Nitish may not join Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra when it enters Bihar on January 29.
On the other hand, Bihar BJP president Samrat Choudhary suddenly flew to Delhi along with Union minister Ashwini Choubey after asking all party MLAs to return to the state capital. Sources said Nitish’s political consultant and JDU national spokesperson K.C. Tyagi also boarded the same flight after consultations with his boss.
Top RJD leaders in Patna were also in a flurry of meetings at the residence of Lalu and his wife, former chief minister Rabri Devi, to discuss likely steps to tackle any sudden political shift effected by Nitish; top of their mind, sources said, was to explore the possibility of the “Grand Alliance” being able to form a government without the JDU.
Lalu’s daughter Rohini lives in Singapore, but is a keen follower of political developments in the state, and is said to harbour political ambitions. She had donated one of her kidneys to her father in 2022. She posted three statements in Hindi on X on Thursday morning, which triggered the political storm.
“Samajwadi purodha hone ka karta wahi dava hai, hawaon ki tarah badalti jiski vichardhara hai (He, whose ideology changes like winds, claims to be a socialist stalwart or master),” was the first post by Rohini.
“Kheej jataye kya hoga jab hua na koi apna yogya, vidhi ka vidhan kaun tale jab khud ki niyat mein ho khot (Venting frustration will not bear any result because none of his own came up as capable. Who can deflect divine destiny, when one’s own intention has fault),” Rohini added in her next post.
The RJD chief’s daughter followed it up with “Aksar kuchh log nahin dekh paate hain apni kamiyan, lekin kisi doosre pe kichad uchhalne ko karte hain badtamiziyan (Often people do not see their own deficiencies, but indulge in insolence to throw mud on others).”
The chronology of Rohini’s posts could be understood by the initiated in the light of Nitish’s speech at a public rally organised by his party to celebrate the birth centenary of Bharat Ratna socialist leader and former Bihar chief minister Karpoori Thakur on Wednesday.
Speaking at the rally, Nitish had hit out at people promoting their families in politics without taking anybody’s name; many perceived it to be an attack on Lalu. “Karpoori Thakur never promoted his family in politics. I have followed him and have never promoted anybody from my family.... But some people always indulge in advancing their families,” Nitish had said.
By reacting to Rohini’s posts, Nitish may have tangentially accepted that his statement targeted Lalu and his family, observers believe. The RJD chief’s wife Rabri Devi, currently an MLC, has been chief minister in the past, eldest daughter Misa Bharti is an MP, elder son Tej Pratap Yadav is state environment minister, while younger son Tejashwi is deputy chief minister.
Nitish quit the NDA twice — in 2013 and in August 2022 — both times to tie up with the RJD and the Congress. He spearheaded efforts to put together INDIA but became disenchanted because he wasn’t named convener. The JDU and the BJP have not criticised each other for a while. Shah, when recently asked about the possibility of the return of former allies including Nitish to the NDA fold, had said the party would consider such proposals.
The Grand Alliance has 159 seats in the 243-member Assembly. Sans Nitish’s JDU, the Grand Alliance will have 114 seats, which is just eight short of the majority mark. Sources said that in case Nitish switches sides, the RJD may try to muster a majority on the floor; the Speaker, Awadh Bihar Chaudhary, belongs to the RJD."

Borah, who was attacked by a youth in Jamugurihat while trying to ease tension between the BJP and the Congress members on January 22, has responded by saying he was ready to go to jail.
He was served a notice under 41(A) of the CrPC on Thursday by the investigating officer of the case, Hirok Jyoti Changmai. Failure to appear or comply with the terms of the notice can render Borah “liable for arrest under Section 41 A (3) and (4) of the CrPC”.
The notice under Section 41A of the CrPC is a notice for appearance, requiring a person to appear before the investigating officer at the specified place and time if there is credible information against him.
The Jorhat police slapped the suo motu case against the organisers of the Rahul Gandhi-led Yatra after it did not take the approved route and the sudden change of route led to traffic disruption and clash with security personnel as Congress members and supporters broke through barricades put up on the Gar Ali Road in Jorhat town on January 18 afternoon. The case has been filed, among others,  against K.B. Byju, who is part of Rahul Gandhi’s personal security team.
Like the case FIR lodged by Guwahati police against Rahul and other senior Congress leaders on Tuesday, this case too has been registered under IPC sections dealing with criminal conspiracy, abetment of an offence, unlawful assembly, rioting, violating order promulgated by public servant criminal force to deter public servant from discharging duty, and relevant sections of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP) Act, among others.
The Assam Police had on Wednesday transferred the case filed against Rahul and other senior Congress leaders for “violation of laws” in Guwahati to the state Crime Investigation Department (CID).
Borah returned to Guwahati on Thursday after the Yatra entered West Bengal In the morning.  Both the send-off from Assam Dhubri district and the welcome accorded to the Yatra in Bengal were grand, according to a Congress member.
“All is well that ends well. There were a lot of controversies and conflict and confusion during the Assam leg. But we survived and made an impact,” the member said.
Borah told media persons that he was ready to go to jail for “breaking barricades” but it was in protest to dent the “arrogance” of the chief minister. He said they will not seek bail in the case.
Borah also mentioned the incident in which he was head-butted by a burly youth leaving him with a bleeding nose but “ if I have to go to jail, I will go.” Congress and Opposition parties have demanded the arrest of the burly man who attacked Borah.
Borah also said the Congress was planning a yatra with Priyanka Gandhi in 2024 from Sadiya with as much enthusiasm as the ongoing Yatra.
He also said that the chief minister’s threat to act against Rahul after the Lok Sabha elections means the BJP-led reign is coming to an end.
In a post on X earlier, Borah had said, “TIGER ZINDA HAI Nobody in Indian politics has been more attacked, villified or trolled than @RahulGandhi ji. The attacks on me are minor compared to him. But let me tell @himantabiswa one thing: Tiger Zinda Hai. Watch out!” He was alluding to Rahul Gandhi as tiger for the “manner he led the Yatra for justice”.
Rahul, while meeting individuals and civil society organisations to understand their problems and find solutions, had targetted chief minister through the Assam leg, describing him as the “most corrupt CM in India”. Sarma too hit back by accusing the Gandhi family of being the “most corrupt in India”.
Assam Congress Legislature party leader Debabrata Saikia expressed concern over the alleged attempts by the BJP-led state government to derail the Yatra, flagging the attacks on Yatra vehicles and leaders and not granting permissions for fields to hold Yatra activities."

Kuki-Zo organisations have long accused the Arambai Tenggol of carrying out attacks on their community during the ethnic strife that began in the state on May 3 and is still continuing.
The Kuki Inpi Manipur, the apex body of Kuki tribes, referred to the oath-taking ceremony, held inside the Kangla Fort in Imphal, to condemn the ""demise and subsequent burial of democracy in the heart of Imphal city"".
The organisation found it ""alarming"" that the state government had “openly” accorded “state patronage to non-state actors, namely the Arambai Tenggol”. It alleged that “all Meitei-elected representatives (had) succumbed” to the diktat of the outfit.
The Kuki Inpi reiterated that having separate administrations for the largely valley-based Meiteis and mostly hill-based Kuki-Zo was the only means “for our survival, as we can no longer coexist with a community that... (is) hell-bent on wiping out the Kuki-Zo people”.
Police said the Arambai Tenggol had “summoned” the MLAs and MPs to the meeting, held at 10am on Wednesday. It was called to discuss the worsening of law and order over the past month, during which 26 Meiteis were allegedly “killed by Kuki-Zo militants”, and to take steps to protect the state’s integrity.
Other Kuki-Zo groups expressed sentiments similar to the Kuki Inpi’s.
On Wednesday, the Churachandpur-based Kuki-Zo organisation, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF), had castigated the Kangla meeting. It posted on X that “never before we have seen” MLAs and ministers “cower before a radicalised insurgent group in the heart of Imphal”.
An ITLF statement said the oath-taking took place “right under the watchful eyes” of the Union home ministry officials who had arrived a few days earlier and met the “insurgent group”.
The Committee on Tribal Unity, another leading Kuki-Zo organisation, on Wednesday questioned the “rationality” of the three-member home ministry team meeting “the majoritarian Meitei community”, including the Arambai Tenggol, on Tuesday.
It said the “restoration of normalcy” could be achieved only if the Centre “first ban(s) the Arambai Tenggols” and other “illegal” armed outfits, imposes the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act on the 19 valley police stations currently exempted from its ambit, and ultimately “recognise the physical and geographical separation between the Kuki-Zo and the Meiteis”.
The Kangla meeting is being seen as a response to the demand from Kuki-Zo organisations and the state’s 10 Kuki-Zo MLAs for a separate administration for the community, or a separation from Manipur.
The Kuki-Zo contend there is already an unofficial separation of populations: the Kuki-Zo cannot travel to the valley, nor can Meiteis to the hill districts.
The valley is home to 40 MLAs while the hill districts, where the Kuki-Zo and the Nagas are the leading tribes, have 20 MLAs.
Reports suggested that 36 Meitei MLAs and two MPs took a collective oath “administered” by the Arambai Tenggol to safeguard the integrity of the state.
Later, the Arambai Tenggol chief told a public meeting that the Meitei MLAs and MPs had endorsed the organisation’s six demands.
These include the scrapping of the Suspension of Operations pact between Kuki-Zo militants and the Centre, implementation of the National Register of Citizens with 1951 as the cut-off year, removing the Assam Rifles from Manipur, fencing the Myanmar border to check influx, and delisting illegal Kuki immigrants from the Scheduled Tribe list.
The Arambai Tenggol said the lawmakers had promised they would take steps on these demands within 15 days or else would join the people’s movement in support of these demands.
While Kuki-Zo organisations have spoken against the Kangla development, the non-government Meitei Alliance said in a statement on Thursday that it “endorsed” the Kangla resolutions signed by the MLAs and MPs who attended the meeting.
It lauded the choice of the Kangla Fort as venue, saying it was the centre of power of indigenous governance, which had ceased since the British invasion of 1891. The princely Manipur state merged with the Indian Union on September 21, 1949.
“Second, the joint congregation of the elected representatives across parties and Arambai Tenggol leaders, and the support shown by various other organisations is an unprecedented event marked by placing patriotism, nationalism, and collective will above all other loyalties,” it said.
“Third, the contents of the resolutions exemplify a higher level of political maturity and commitment to address the common grievances of the indigenous people of Manipur. Meitei Alliance strongly feels that the above demands are timely, lawful, and democratic.”
The ongoing strife has left at least 204 people dead and displaced over 67,000."

“If you think that only you people (an allusion to Hindutva adherents) will live (in the country), that will not happen.... We will remain united and stay together, it’s my promise,” the Bengal chief minister said, appearing to project herself as the biggest protector of India’s secular ethos.
As she spoke these words, Mamata stole a glance at the group of religious heads from the Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist communities who were on the dais from where she was addressing a gathering of around 40,000 people.
The meeting was held after a 5km unity march through parts of south Calcutta, during which the Trinamul leader offered prayers at seven religious shrines popular among Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Muslims.
At the gathering, representatives of various religions explained why Mamata’s leadership was crucial if the country were to retain its pluralistic fabric.
Their short speeches made three main points — that India’s history is one of inclusion, that the minorities fear persecution, and that Mamata alone can protect the country’s secular character and the minorities’ rights.
Mamata, who listened to them with rapt attention and occasionally complimented the speakers after their speeches, tried her best to rise to the occasion.
“The battle has begun; it’s a battle for life…. The battle may be difficult, but victory will not elude us,” she said.
As her speech triggered discussions within Trinamul about whether it was one of her best, this newspaper asked her how she rated her performance at the Park Circus Maidan.
“I did not give any speech,” Mamata replied, implying what she said was not a political statement but rather a response to the minorities’ concerns and an effort to offer them a sense of security.

In her 40-odd minute address, Mamata did not mention the consecration ceremony in Ayodhya or Prime Minister Narendra Modi even once, but her speech was peppered with oblique references to the pomp surrounding the inauguration of the Ram temple.
“I don’t have any problems if people pray to Ram, Shyam or Rahim.... You can always perform puja at home. I do it, too,” she said, making it clear that she respected all religions.
Since announcing the all-faith unity march, Mamata has been trying to get the message across that the initiative was not aimed at countering or opposing the Ram temple inauguration.
“My problem is with this (display) in a country where there are so many unemployed and poor people,” she said.
Mamata accused the BJP of organising the event ahead of the Lok Sabha elections to try and reap political dividends. “Please don’t do such politics before an election.... Don’t sacrifice the poor in the name of religion.”
It was clear she wasn’t only criticising the Prime Minister’s participation in the consecration but also flagging the elaborate arrangements — such as the installation of giant LED screens across the country to beam the inauguration live — to create a frenzy around the event.
She questioned the media coverage of the developments in Ayodhya.
“Have you seen what they are doing? It’s as if the freedom struggle is going on,” Mamata said, disapproving of the round-the-clock beaming of footage from Ayodhya.
She flagged the Ayodhya show’s downplaying of Sita. “I am not against Ram, but I also respect Sita. There was no mention of Sita…. Are you anti-women? Without Kaushalya, who would have given birth to Ram?” the chief minister said.

Fighting BJP
Mamata said she had the ability to take the BJP on and complained she was not being allowed to put up a fight.
“I have the ability to fight (the BJP)… but they don’t let me fight,” she said, signalling her disappointment with the INDIA bloc of Opposition parties, formed last year to put up a united fight against the BJP.
Mamata has been upset with the workings of the fledgling alliance for several reasons, such as the delay in sealing a seat-sharing arrangement and the regular attacks on her by the CPM leadership and a section of the Bengal Congress.
“I suggested the name INDIA, but when I attend its meetings I see the CPM trying to dictate to others. I don’t get the respect I deserve. I will not take any advice from those against whom I have fought all my life,” she said, implying she was uninterested in any truck with the communists.
She said the delay in reaching a seat-sharing formula — something she has been pitching for right from the alliance’s first meeting in Patna — was ending up helping the BJP.
“I had told them (the Congress) to fight in 300 seats and leave the regional players to fight the BJP in their respective states…. But they say they will do whatever they want. I warn them not to do anything that will end up strengthening the BJP,” Mamata said.
Mamata accused the Congress also of failing to organise any major nationwide programme coinciding with the consecration.
“I organised this unity rally.... I am the only one who visited a temple, a gurdwara, a church, a mazar and a mosque today,” she said.
“How many political parties took the BJP head-on today? Somebody went to one temple and thought it was sufficient, but it doesn’t work like that,” she said in what seemed an allusion to Rahul Gandhi’s unsuccessful effort to visit the Batadrava Than in Assam.
Battle cry
Although Mamata deliberately had politicians playing second fiddle to the religious leaders at the unity march and the meeting that followed, her speech was a deeply political one. She explained why the BJP was a threat to India’s inclusive culture.
She spoke at length about the divergent food habits and sartorial preferences among Indians, depending on culture and geography.
“They will not allow fish and meat.... They will not allow even a pregnant woman to have eggs. They will dictate what to eat and what to wear. I won’t let that happen,” the chief minister said.
She aired one of her biggest complaints against the BJP-led Centre — that it was denying Bengal its financial dues, thus depriving scores of the poor who had worked under the 100 days’ job scheme.
Mamata said work under the rural housing and rural road schemes had stopped because the Centre had frozen the funds.
“They want us to paint government buildings in saffron…. There are so many colours in the rainbow and we can select any of them, but they want us to opt for their party colour. Why should I allow this?” she said.
Mamata referred to the BJP’s efforts to use a section of Muslims to drive a wedge in the community.
“There are some touts who split Muslim votes…. This should not be allowed. I vow, in the name of God, that if anyone helps the BJP I will not spare them,” she said."

A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, while hearing a plea seeking quashing of an ""oral order"" dated January 20 banning live telecast of the consecration ceremony at Ayodhya in temples across Tamil Nadu, said no one is bound to abide with the oral orders.
The bench took on record the statement of senior advocate Amit Anand Tiwari for Tamil Nadu that there are no restrictions on 'puja archana’ in temples or live telecast of consecration ceremony at Ayodhya.
He said the plea is “politically motivated”.
The bench asked the authorities to put on record the reasons and maintain the data of applications which has been allowed for ‘Puja archana’ and live telecast of consecration ceremony in temples and those which have been disallowed.
The bench also sought response of the Tamil Nadu government on the plea by January 29. The plea has been filed by one Vinoj in which it has been submitted that the Tamil Nadu government run by the DMK has banned live telecast of the ""pran prathishta"" of Lord Ram at Ayodhya in all temples across Tamil Nadu.
It is being alleged that the government has also banned all kinds of prayers, and 'annadanam' (poor feeding) 'bhajans' on the occasion.
However, Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister, P K Sekar Babu had said on Sunday that the HR and CE Department has not imposed any kind of ban for conduct of puja for Shri Ram. Also, there is no bar to distribute 'Annadhanam' and 'Prasadam.' He dismissed the claim as false news with ulterior motives.

6384F64FKC_IR2OIRYCFRASKCZ,PM Narendra Modi to Ram temple critics: Introspect and change your thinking,"Piyush Srivastava Ayodhya Published 23.01.24, 05:41 AM","Piyush Srivastava Ayodhya Published 23.01.24, 05:41 AM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/pm-narendra-modi-to-ram-temple-critics-introspect-and-change-your-thinking/cid/1995557,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked critics of the Ayodhya movement and the Ram temple to “introspect” and change their thinking, addressing a VIP gathering after participating in the consecration of the shrine as the chief guest in Ayodhya on Monday.
“The way we have opened the locks of history suggests that our future is going to be more beautiful than the past. There was a time when some people would say a fire would break out if the Ram temple was built,” Modi, who had performed the first aarti before the 4.24ft-tall idol, said.
“Such people don’t understand the sanctity of Indian society. The construction of the temple of Ram Lalla symbolises peace, patience, harmony and coordination.”
He went on: “It is a temple of national awakening in the form of the Ram temple. Ram is the faith of India, the foundation of India/ Ram is the thought of India, the law of India/ Ram is the consciousness of India, the contemplation of India/ Ram is the prestige of India, the might of India/ Ram is the flow, Ram is the influence/ Ram is the norm, Ram is the policy/ Ram is the permanence, Ram is the continuity/ Ram is vast, Ram is expansive/ Ram is all-encompassing, Ram is the universe, the soul of the universe.”
Modi added: “I can see that the construction (of the temple) is producing energy and not fire. The Ram temple has inspired us to take the path to a bright future. I would call on those people (the critics) to come and feel it, introspect about your thinking. Ram is energy and not fire; Ram is a solution and not a dispute; Ram is not only present but also endless.”
Modi said: “A nation stands after discarding the sense of slavery. People will discuss this date even after 1,000 years. It is by the grace of Ram that we are living this moment, we are watching it happen…. I can feel that godly moment…. The godly powers are present around us.”
Modi also said: “While defining ‘Ram’, the rishis have said, ‘Ramayantiswin iti Ramah’, which means that one who is immersed in the Self is Ram. Ram is in everything, from the mind to the mountains and the traditions.
“People have expressed Ram in their own fashion in different ages. And this Ramras (the pleasure of saying ‘Ram’) flows like a continuous life. People from every corner of India have invoked Ramras since ancient times. Ramkatha (the story of Ram’s life) is Shiva and the Ramayan is endless. The ideas of Ram, the values of Ram, the education of Ram are the same everywhere.”
Modi took his seat at the sanctum sanctorum at 12.10pm and all the rituals were over at 1.17pm, which means the temple was officially open to ordinary devotees.
However, the public will be able to offer prayers there only from Tuesday since the premises were on Monday hosting some 8,000 of India’s rich, famous and influential, invited to the event by the temple trust.
The temple stands at the site where a mob of kar sevaks had demolished the Babri Masjid on December 6, a widely condemned incident that led to riots and changed Indian politics in the long run. Many Opposition leaders had declined the invitation to Monday’s consecration accusing the BJP of turning it into a political event.
Modi thanked the judiciary for the Supreme Court’s November 2019 verdict that handed the site to Hindus to build the temple. The court had, however, denounced the Babri demolition.
The Prime Minister appeared to be arguing that the Ayodhya movement and the construction of the temple were mandated by the Constitution.
“Lord Ram is present in the first copy of India’s Constitution. The legal battle continued for decades even after the Constitution was adopted. I thank the judiciary ofIndia, who saved the honour of justice. The temple of Lord Ram was built in accordance with the law,” he said.
A constitutional expert told this newspaper that the first copy of the Constitution of India carried a painting of Ram, Sita and Lakshman at the beginning of the third chapter, which enshrines the fundamental rights of citizens.
Modi said the whole of India, as well as many other countries, was commemorating the day.
The Vishwa Hindu Parishad, which dominates the temple trust, had urged Hindus across the country to celebrate the occasion at temples near their homes. The VHP had distributed puja ingredients at some places.
But in Ayodhya town, all the celebration seemed confined to the main road, Ram Path, where the temple is located. The townspeople have been trying to largely stay indoors since January 14, when the security forces arrived in large numbers and barricaded areas near the temple.
Residents began stepping out of their homes gradually after 6pm on Monday, by when the Prime Minister and most other political heavyweights had left Ayodhya.
“The heat seems to have subsided with the departure of the powerful politicians and the heavy security around them,” Shankar Acharya, a small-time sadhu, said while lounging on a bench outside a closed tea stall on Dant Dhavan Street.
“The dust will settle down after the troops receive their marching orders in the night. The residents of Ayodhya town are heaving a sigh of relief after many days.”
Modi interacted with the workers involved in the temple construction and asked them to speed up the shrine’s completion."
64PNTUYYZV_52P5J2GU8V96KQQ,Alabama executes convicted murderer Kenneth Smith with new nitrogen asphyxiation method,"Reuters Alabama Published 26.01.24, 01:38 PM","Reuters Alabama Published 26.01.24, 01:38 PM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/world/alabama-executes-convicted-murderer-kenneth-smith-with-new-nitrogen-asphyxiation-method/cid/1996322,"Alabama executed convicted murderer Kenneth Smith by asphyxiating him with nitrogen gas on Thursday, the first use of a new method of capital punishment that the state is advancing as a simpler alternative to lethal injections.
The state has called its new protocol ""the most painless and humane method of execution known to man.""
United Nations human rights experts and lawyers for Smith had sought to prevent it, saying the method was risky, experimental and could lead to a torturous death or non-fatal injury.
Smith, convicted of a 1988 murder-for-hire, was a rare prisoner who had already survived one execution attempt. In November 2022, Alabama officials aborted his execution by lethal injection after struggling for hours to insert an intravenous line's needle in his body.
In Smith's second and final trip to the execution chamber on Thursday, executioners restrained him in a gurney and strapped a commercial industrial-safety respirator mask to his face. A canister of pure nitrogen was attached to the mask that once flowing, deprived him of oxygen.
The execution began at 7:53 p.m. (0153 GMT Friday) and Smith was declared dead at 8:25 p.m. (0225 GMT), prison officials said.
Smith appeared to remain conscious for several minutes after the nitrogen was activated, according to five journalists were allowed to watch the execution through glass as media witnesses. He then began shaking and writhing on the gurney for about two minutes, and then could be seen breathing deeply for several minutes before his breathing slowed and became imperceptible, the witnesses said.
Alabama officials had said in court filings they expected Smith would be rendered unconscious in under a minute and die shortly after.
""It appeared that Smith was holding his breath as long as he could,"" Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said when asked at a press conference if the writhing had been expected. ""He struggled against the restraints a little bit but it's an involuntary movement and some agonal breathing. So that was all expected.""
Before the nitrogen was switched on, Smith made a lengthy final statement that began: ""Tonight, Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward.""
His wife and other relatives attended and he gestured towards them. ""I'm leaving with love, peace and light,"" he said, according to media witnesses. ""Love all of you.""
Failed challenges
Smith mounted legal challenges in federal courts arguing that Alabama's method amounted to unconstitutional ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" but he failed to cross the high bar needed to have a judge order a delay of his execution.
Smith's lawyers had told courts they feared the mask would not properly seal against Smith's face, allowing oxygen to seep in, delaying or even averting the moment of unconsciousness but risking serious brain injury. They proposed Alabama instead use a hood pre-filled with pure nitrogen, to be plunged over his head, or else to use a firing squad.
Smith's lawyers also told courts Smith had been repeatedly vomiting as his return to the execution chamber drew near. They raised fears he could be sick after the mask was strapped on and choke on his own vomit.
In response, prison officials said they would serve him his final meal on Thursday morning and forbid any solid foods after 10 a.m..
His final meal was steak, hash browns and eggs, prison officials said.
The U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority rejected Smith's final attempt to have his execution delayed to allow his legal challenge to continue on Thursday evening, and the execution began soon after.
The court did not explain its reasoning in denying Smith's appeal, but the three liberal justices offered written dissents.
""Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its 'guinea pig' to test a method of execution never attempted before,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, saying she would have granted the injunction. ""The world is watching.""
Approved but unused in other states
U.S. states that use capital punishment have found it increasingly difficult to get drugs for lethal injections, partly because pharmaceutical companies forbid supplying them to prisons to comply with a European trade ban on goods to be used in torture or executions.
Lawmakers in Oklahoma and Mississippi have also approved similar nitrogen-asphyxiation execution protocols in recent years, but have yet to put them into practice.
Smith was convicted of murdering Elizabeth Sennett, a preacher's wife, after he and an accomplice each accepted a $1,000 fee from her husband to kill her, according to trial testimony.
Eleven of 12 jurors voted to sentence Smith to life in prison, but an Alabama judge overruled their recommendation under a law that has since been abolished as unconstitutional.
Several of Sennett's relatives attended the execution and they addressed the media after, saying they had forgiven Sennett's killers.
""Nothing that happened here today is going to bring mom back,"" Mike Sennett said. ""It's a bittersweet day, we're not going to be jumping around, hooping and hollering, hooraying and all that, that's not us. We're glad this day is over."""
6DR8Y3W6C3_54TIJ0L8O7FETX8,"Norman Jewison, director of ‘Fiddler on the Roof’ and ‘Moonstruck,’ dies at 97","Dennis Lim Published 23.01.24, 08:18 PM","Dennis Lim Published 23.01.24, 08:18 PM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/world/norman-jewison-director-of-fiddler-on-the-roof-and-moonstruck-dies-at-97/cid/1995738,"Norman Jewison, whose broad range as a filmmaker was reflected in the three movies that earned him Academy Award nominations for best director — the socially conscious drama “In the Heat of the Night,” the big-budget musical “Fiddler on the Roof” and the romantic comedy “Moonstruck” — died on Saturday at his home. He was 97.
His death was confirmed by a spokesman for the family, Jeff Sanderson. He declined to specify where Mr. Jewison lived, saying that the family requested privacy.
Mr. Jewison, whose career began in Canadian television and spanned more than 50 years, was, like his close friend Sidney Lumet and a select few other directors, best known for making films that addressed social issues. The most celebrated of those was “In the Heat of the Night” (1967), one of his earliest features and his first Oscar-winning film.
A story of racial tensions in the American South filtered through a murder mystery that brings together a Black Philadelphia detective (Sidney Poitier) and a white Mississippi police chief (Rod Steiger), “In the Heat of the Night” could not have been more timely: It opened weeks after racial violence had erupted in Detroit and Newark. It went on to win five Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor, for Mr. Steiger.
Mr. Poitier was among the many actors who had fond memories of working with Mr. Jewison. “He gives his actors room and keeps them as calm as he can, because it’s easier to speak with them when they’re calm,” he told The New York Times in 2011. “A director has to keep the actors on their toes while the camera’s running, but when the scene is done, they should be relaxing, nothing on their minds. There can’t be a constant level of seriousness. And with Norman, there’s always a lot of laughter.”
Mr. Jewison lost the best director award for “In the Heat of the Night” to Mike Nichols, who won for “The Graduate,” and he never did win an Oscar for directing. But his films, and the actors in them, garnered many Oscars and 46 nominations.
Mr. Jewison once said, “The movies that address civil rights and social justice are the ones that are dearest to me.” He attributed his predilection for such movies to his lifelong sense of being an outsider.
Norman Frederick Jewison was born on July 21, 1926, in Toronto, where his parents, Dorothy (Weaver) and Percy Jewison, ran a dry-goods store below their apartment. From a childhood love of movies, radio shows and vaudeville, he developed an interest in writing and performing.
The family was Methodist, but because of his surname, young Norman was teased and bullied by schoolmates who assumed he was Jewish. A later formative brush with bigotry came while he was on a hitchhiking trip through the segregated American South in the 1940s. On the outskirts of Memphis, he was chastised by a driver for sitting in the back of a bus with the Black passengers.
“Traveling in the South,” Mr. Jewison wrote in an autobiography, “This Terrible Business Has Been Good to Me” (2004), “I understood the meaning of being victimized even more than I had as a boy.”
After World War II, during which he served in the Canadian Navy, he attended Victoria College at the University of Toronto, where he directed and acted in student theater productions. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts in 1949.
Like many filmmakers of his generation, Mr. Jewison came up through the ranks of television. He worked as a writer and actor for the BBC in London and as a director for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Toronto before landing at CBS in New York, where he directed specials starring Judy Garland, Harry Belafonte and Danny Kaye.
He directed his first feature film in 1962, for Universal Studios: “40 Pounds of Trouble,” a comedy based on a Damon Runyon story that starred Tony Curtis. Under contract to Universal, he was paired with the studio’s biggest star at the time, Doris Day, for two more comedies, “The Thrill of It All” (1963) and “Send Me No Flowers” (1964).
Eager to prove his range, Mr. Jewison jumped at the chance to direct “The Cincinnati Kid” (1965), a drama with Steve McQueen as a Depression-era gambler, when the original director, Sam Peckinpah, was fired a few days into the shoot.
Mr. Jewison’s other ’60s films include “The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming” (1966), a satire of Cold War paranoia that was his first film to receive an Oscar nomination for best picture (although he himself was not nominated for best director), and “The Thomas Crown Affair” (1968), a romantic crime caper starring Mr. McQueen and Faye Dunaway. But the movie that sealed his reputation was “In the Heat of the Night,” which beat two other era-defining films, “Bonnie and Clyde” and “The Graduate,” for best picture honors.
Mr. Jewison took pride in the movie’s success, which suggested to him a widespread receptiveness to its liberal message. But with the United States mired in Vietnam and the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, he was also growing disillusioned with the political mood in America. (The Oscar ceremony at which “In the Heat of the Night” was named best picture was delayed two days because of Dr. King’s funeral.)
After finishing the 1969 comedy “Gaily, Gaily,” Mr. Jewison moved his family to London and worked abroad for several years. Shot largely in Eastern Europe, “Fiddler on the Roof” (1971) — which Mr. Jewison claimed he had been asked to direct in part because executives at United Artists, like the bullies at school, thought he was Jewish — received Oscar nominations for best picture and best director. He followed it with another screen version of a popular Broadway musical, “Jesus Christ Superstar” (1973), based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber rock opera and filmed in Israel.
Returning to North America, Mr. Jewison bought a cattle farm outside Toronto and divided his time between Canada and California from the late ’70s onward. He scored one of his biggest hits in 1987 with “Moonstruck,” a commercial and critical success that earned Cher an Oscar and put Nicolas Cage on the map as a leading man.
But throughout his career Mr. Jewison was repeatedly drawn to more serious fare, in movies like “F.I.S.T.” (1978), a labor-union drama that starred Sylvester Stallone; “In Country” (1989), about the daughter of a Vietnam War casualty; and his last film, “The Statement” (2003), the story of a former Nazi collaborator, played by Michael Caine.
Well into the post-civil-rights era, Mr. Jewison remained interested in race, specifically racial injustice. In 1984, he directed “A Soldier’s Story,” an adaptation of Charles Fuller’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “A Soldier’s Play,” which, like “In the Heat of the Night,” told the story of a Deep South murder investigation, this time on an Army base in World War II-era Louisiana. The movie was critically praised and earned Mr. Jewison yet another best picture nomination.
But when it was announced a few years later that Mr. Jewison would be directing a film about the life of Malcolm X, he encountered resistance. The filmmaker Spike Lee, who had long wanted to make such a film himself, was the most outspoken critic of the choice, maintaining that a white director could not do justice to the story of a major Black political activist.
Mr. Jewison eventually left the project, although he denied that his departure was in response to the protest. Mr. Lee himself went on to direct “Malcolm X,” which was released in 1992, and later said that Mr. Jewison “was happy I got to do the film.”
In 1999, Mr. Jewison directed “The Hurricane,” about Rubin Carter, the African American boxer whose career was cut short by a murder conviction, and who was imprisoned for nearly 20 years before the charges against him were dismissed. Denzel Washington (who had one of his first film roles in “A Soldier’s Story,” and who had also starred in “Malcolm X”) received rave reviews and an Oscar nomination for his performance in the title role (Stephen Holden of The Times called it “astonishing”). But the film was criticized by many for taking liberties in its depiction of Mr. Carter’s life and legal battles.
Beginning in the late 1960s, Mr. Jewison served as producer on his own movies. He also produced the work of other directors, including “The Landlord” (1970), the directing debut of his regular editor, Hal Ashby (who won an Oscar for his work on “In the Heat of the Night”).
Mr. Jewison married Margaret Ann Dixon, a model, in 1953. She died in 2004. He married Lynne St. David in 2010. He is survived by two sons from his first marriage, Kevin and Michael; a daughter, Jenny Snyder; and five grandchildren.
In 1988, Mr. Jewison founded the Canadian Film Center, a film school and institution in Toronto. He received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his body of work at the 1999 Academy Awards and a lifetime achievement award from the Directors Guild of America in 2010. In 2011, the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York presented a 15-film retrospective of his work.
“For me, films are about ideas,” Mr. Jewison told The Times on the occasion of the retrospective. “Every director should ask himself, ‘Why am I making this picture?’ And if you can’t answer that, you shouldn’t make it.”

6FT06ZULFT_OM7WQ40W11BVC18,Accused cannot seek default bail on ground that investigation is pending against others: Supreme Court,"PTI New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 01:28 PM","PTI New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 01:28 PM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/accused-cannot-seek-default-bail-on-ground-that-investigation-is-pending-against-others-supreme-court/cid/1996107,"An accused cannot seek default bail on the grounds that the probe is pending against other accused or the charge sheet filed by the probe agency is incomplete, the Supreme Court has said while cancelling the bail granted to former DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj in the multi-crore bank loan scam case.
The top court said the benefit of proviso appended to sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the CrPC would be available to the offender only when a charge sheet is not filed and the investigation is kept pending against him.
However, once a charge sheet is filed, the said right ceases, it said.
A bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and Pankaj Mithal said once from the material produced along with the charge sheet, the court is satisfied about the commission of an offence and takes cognizance of the offence allegedly committed by the accused, it is immaterial whether further investigation is pending or not.
""The pendency of further investigation qua the other accused or for production of some documents not available at the time of filing of charge sheet would neither vitiate the charge sheet, nor would it entitle the accused to claim right to get default bail on the grounds that the charge sheet was an incomplete charge sheet or that the charge sheet was not filed in terms of Section 173(2) of CrPC,"" the bench said.
The apex court said both, the Special Court as well as the Delhi High Court  committed serious error of law in disregarding the legal position and granting bail to Wadhawans.
""In view of the afore-stated legal position, we have no hesitation in holding that the charge sheet having been filed against the respondents-accused within the prescribed time limit and the cognisance having been taken by the Special Court of the offences allegedly committed by them, the respondents could not have claimed the statutory right of default bail under Section 167(2) on the grounds that the investigation qua other accused was pending,"" the bench said in its judgement uploaded Thursday.
The top court said there cannot be any disagreement with the well settled legal position that the right of default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC is not only a statutory right but is a right that flows from Article 21 of the Constitution.
""It is an indefeasible right, nonetheless it is enforceable only prior to the filing of the challan or the charge sheet, and does not survive or remain enforceable on the challan being filed, if already not availed of. Once the challan has been filed, the question of grant of bail has to be considered and decided only with reference to the merits of the case under the provisions relating to grant of bail to the accused after the filing of the challan,"" the bench said.
Under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), an accused becomes entitled for grant of statutory bail if the probe agency fails to file the charge sheet on conclusion of the investigation in a criminal case within 60 or 90 days period.
In this case, the CBI filed the charge sheet on the 88th day after registration of the FIR and the trial court granted default bail to the accused and the Delhi High Court upheld the order.
The Wadhawan brothers were arrested in this case on July 19 last year. The high court, however, had clarified it did not go into the merits of the case.
The charge sheet was filed on October 15, 2022 and cognisance was taken.
The FIR in the case was based on a complaint made by the Union Bank of India.
It had alleged that DHFL, its then CMD Kapil Wadhawan, the then director Dheeraj Wadhawan and other accused persons entered into a criminal conspiracy to cheat the consortium of 17 banks led by the Union Bank of India, and in pursuance of the criminal conspiracy, the accused and others induced the consortium to sanction huge loans aggregating Rs 42,871.42 crore.
Much of that amount was allegedly siphoned off and misappropriated by alleged falsification of the books of the DHFL and dishonest default in repayment of the legitimate dues of the consortium banks, the CBI has claimed.
The complainant has alleged that a wrongful loss of Rs 34,615 crore was caused to the consortium of banks in as much as such was the quantification of the outstanding dues as on July 31, 2020.

A bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and S C Sharma said the high court and the trial court committed error in granting bail to them.
""We have no hesitation that the charge sheet having been filed and cognisance being taken in due time, respondents could not have claimed statutory bail as a right,"" the bench said.
Under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), an accused becomes entitled for grant of statutory bail if the probe agency fails to file the charge sheet on conclusion of the investigation in a criminal case within 60 or 90 days period.
In this case, the CBI filed the charge sheet on the 88th day after registration of the FIR and the trial court granted default bail to the accused and the Delhi High Court upheld the order.
The Wadhawan brothers were arrested in this case on July 19 last year. The high court, however, had clarified it did not go into the merits of the case.
The charge sheet was filed on October 15, 2022 and cognisance was taken.
The FIR in the case was based on a complaint made by the Union Bank of India.

The Bengal chief minister, on her way to a state government event in East Burdwan, told journalists in the afternoon that she had not had any seat-sharing talks with the Congress.
“No, I have not had any talks (with the Congress). I have not had any talks with anybody. The proposal I had given, they had rejected at the very start. Since then, our party has decided to go it alone in Bengal,” the Trinamul chief said. She, however, reaffirmed her pledge as a secular force willing to do anything to defeat the BJP.
“But right now, there is no discussion… absolutely wrong. It is wrong,” Mamata said, a day after Rahul issued a statement on the sidelines of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra saying that seat-sharing negotiations were underway with her party.
Rahul said during an interaction with journalists on Tuesday: “Mamataji and I are on very good terms personally, and so is the party.”
“Yes, some little things keep happening. Sometimes, somebody says something from their side, sometimes, somebody says something from our side. These are natural things, these are not things that are going to disrupt anything,” Rahul said.
The Congress appears in an uncomfortable spot with the party sharing space with Trinamul and the CPM within the INDIA combine while being at daggers drawn with Trinamul in Bengal and in an on-again, off-again relationship with the consistently friendly CPM.
Mamata did not seem impressed with the olive branch from Rahul. Bringing up the Yatra, she said the Congress had not even bothered to let her know about its passage through Bengal.
“Their rally, have they told us about it? As a matter of courtesy? I am an INDIA ally. Did they let me know, ‘Didi, we are going to your state’? No, they did not,” Mamata said on Wednesday.
“Therefore, there are no terms whatsoever with me, as far as Bengal is concerned,” she added, in an apparent response to what Rahul had said on Tuesday.
“About the all-India scenario, what we will do, what we won’t, we will think about that after the election.”
However, she was quick to add: “We are a secular party, we will do anything necessary to defeat the BJP.”
Asked whether she would stay on in INDIA, Mamata said it was not the monopoly of any one entity. “It does not belong exclusively to someone. Us regional parties, we will remain together,” Mamata said.
“We have said that they are free to contest 300 seats on their own, while the regional parties will fight in the remaining seats,” she added, referring to her December 19 proposal to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge for his party to directly take on the BJP in 300 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats, leaving the rest for INDIA allies. She had mooted a 1:1 formula, which implies fielding a single INDIA candidate from each seat, the one with the highest winnability against the BJP nominee.
“Do not interfere there (in the 243 seats for regional parties). If they do interfere there, we will figure it out differently then,” Mamata warned.
The Trinamul chief’s expression of displeasure prompted a placatory statement from Jairam Ramesh, Congress general secretary (communications), who urged focus on her unwavering commitment to fighting the BJP.
“Mamataji is a big leader of Trinamul, of Bengal, of India. Trinamul is a very important pillar of INDIA. Without Mamataji, we cannot even imagine the alliance,” he said.
Sources in Trinamul said nothing was set in stone yet and Mamata could still consider setting aside up to four seats for the Congress in Bengal if approached amicably.
“One proper phone call from Sonia Gandhi, with whom she still has a great relationship, or a duly pliant message from Rahul could still save this alliance, with regard to Bengal,” said a Trinamul MP.
“She was willing to set aside two seats for them, they went about issuing statements demanding 7, 8, 9, 12, without trying to talk to her properly first…. She might still be willing to yield up to four,” he added.
The Congress state unit wants to contest in at least seven seats out of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha constituencies. Besides Behrampore and Malda South (which they won in 2019), the Congress is said to be keen on Murshidabad, Jangipur, Malda North, Raiganj, Darjeeling, Purulia and Basirhat.
At the December 19 INDIA meeting, Mamata had clearly said she was willing to discuss the tie-up with the Congress for the state and was not averse to being a considerate ally in the negotiations.
But the likes of Behrampore MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Mamata’s bete noire who is not only the state unit chief of the Congress but also its leader in the Lok Sabha, has since thrown a spanner in the works, telling Rahul that even in his “worst nightmare” he could not imagine taking her help for elections in Bengal.
Even on Wednesday, the Congress’s chief spokesperson for Bengal, Soumya Aich Roy, responded with derision.
“This is inevitable, given her political compulsions. The BJP and Trinamul are shaking in fear on account of the success of Rahul Gandhi’s Yatra…. We have been saying for so long that she cannot ever be genuine in her opposition to the BJP because they are two sides of the same coin,” Aich Roy said.
Virtually echoing him, CPM state secretary Md. Salim added that INDIA is not about seat-sharing alone.
“She has been insisting on nothing but seat-sharing. We want to talk about the neeti (policy) not the neta (leader), but how will Trinamul talk about any neeti, being fueled solely by (Mamata’s) prime ministerial ambition?” asked Salim.
“It seems that they have now been reassured by the Prime Minister that the central agencies are no longer going to chase (Mamata’s nephew) Abhishek Banerjee,” he added.
The BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad said this was always going to be the case in the INDIA space.
“Selfish, opportunist people have come together for an alliance, so this was always most likely. They neither have a neta nor any neeti…. The people will surely elect Narendra Modi for a third consecutive term,” he said."

Gandhi was prevented from visiting the venue this morning and stopped at Haiborgaon where he along with senior Congress leaders, party workers and supporters have sat on a dharna.
The managing committee of Sri Sankardeva Sattra on Sunday had announced that they will not allow the Congress leader to visit the sattra before 3pm on January 22 after Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier in the day said at a press conference that he requested Gandhi not to visit before the consecration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya.
''We were given permission to visit the Sattra on January 11. But suddenly on January 20, we were told that Gandhi can visit only after the consecration of Ram temple'', he said.
It is clear that ''the arrogant powers want the entire focus of the camera on them and pressure was exerted on the Assam government to take this step'', he said.
''After the authorities had told Rahulji that there could be a law and order problem, he (Gandhi) offered to go alone but this, too, was refused. It is clear that it is their deliberate policy to prevent him from going to the holy place which occupies a place of social, cultural and religious importance for all'', Ramesh said.
The authorities said there are many Ram Bhakts in the Bardrava sattra premises and there could be a law and order situation but ''we assured them that no one except Rahulji will go'', he said.
Following this a lot of phone calls were made by the authorities and Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi and local Congress MLA Sibamoni Bora were allowed to proceed to the sattra to talk with the members of the managing committee to resolve the issue and ensure Gandhi's visit to the sacred place.
''Gandhi will continue to stage the dharna till Gogoi and Bora return from the sattra'', he said.
The managing committee has said they can visit after 3pm but ''what guarantee is there that Himanta Biswa Sarma will say at 2:30 pm that due to law and order situation, he will not be allowed to visit at all'', the Congress general secretary said.
The yatra will continue on its usual route after the issue is resolved, Ramesh added.

The discom in BJP-ruled Rajasthan is represented by a virulent critic of the Narendra Modi-dispensation, Dushyant Dave.
A bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sanjay Kumar who heard the duo for over three hours, reserved its verdict on the maintainability of the miscellaneous application moved by Adani Power.
The Adani firm’s plea before the bench was in the news after the apex court on Tuesday pulled up its registry for not listing the case for unspecified reasons despite a judicial order to post it.
Dave was engaged by the previous Ashok Gehlot-government of the Congress in January last year.
Despite the BJP storming to power in the state, JVVNL chose to retain Dave reflecting his perceived expertise in corporate dispute and indispensability in handling the case. Dave is also a trenchant critique of the Adanis.
On the other side of the spectrum, Singhvi, one of the most formidable corporate lawyers and Congress MP, a party which has no love lost for the Adanis because of the latter’s “proximity” to the BJP government, appeared for the Gujarat-based entity.
However, it is an admitted fact in the legal fraternity that despite political or ideological differences, lawyers often appear for the other side.
Former attorney-general Mukul Rohatgi had appeared for political leaders such as Karnataka Congress strongman D.K. Sivakumar. Even as AG, Rohatgi had appeared for a liquor lobby in Kerala."

The chief ministers from two different parties, Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamul Congress and Bhagwant Mann of the Aam Aadmi Party, made loud noises of going it alone in their respective states while remaining in the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) block.
However, the last may not have been heard yet from either of them.
The varied response to both the instances that happened in quick succession appeared to be the Congress’ strategy to push a different model for seat-sharing in each state.
“I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we will alone defeat BJP,” Mamata said on Wednesday.
Mamata was also unhappy at not being informed about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. Later in the evening Congress claimed party president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul wrote separate letters to Mamata on January 13, informing her about the yatra. Whether the letters reached her Kalighat residence or the state secretariat Nabanna is not known.
Within hours of Mamata’s going alone diatribe, Mann used the A-word in a news briefing in Chandigarh.
“There are 13 seats in Punjab and we have shortlisted 40 probable candidates for these seats,” Mann said. “Woh unka aapas mein chal raha hoga (in Bengal), lekin Punjab mein hum alliance nahin karenge (They may have been holding talks but in Punjab we will not go for an alliance).”
Congress left Mann alone, but made attempts to placate Mamata.
“Trinamul is a pillar of the alliance, we cannot imagine the alliance without Mamata ji. Tomorrow our yatra is entering West Bengal. Discussions regarding seat sharing are being done and a result will come soon that will keep everyone satisfied,” said Jairam Ramesh, Congress general secretary in charge of communications.
While a decision on Bengal cannot happen without the nod of the Trinamul chief, Mann has been kept out of the negotiating table, though he is being kept informed of every move.
Both Mamata and Mann have been talking about going it alone over the past few weeks. In  internal meetings with the leaders from West Midnapore, Murshidabad and Birbhum (the last one was held on Tuesday evening) Mamata has asked local leaders to prepare to fight the polls on their own strength (not that the Bengal Congress has much muscle). In the past weeks, Mann too has said the same thing on two separate occasions.
Mann’s assertion comes at a time when leaders of both the AAP and the Congress are in the midst of negotiating a seat-sharing deal for Delhi. In two meetings held in Delhi, the AAP had raised the issue of Gujarat, Goa and Haryana where it wants to contest with the alliance. Punjab remains the thorn.
A section of the Punjab Congress leaders like state unit president Amarinder Singh Raja Warring or Partap Singh Bajwa are against any alliance with the AAP, with their eyes on the 2027 Assembly polls.
“In the two years since AAP came to power, the party’s credibility has taken a hit. Mahaul woh nahin raha (The situation is not the same). The Shiromani Akali Dal is in a disarray and the BJP is restricted to some urban pockets. The Congress does stand a chance to return to power in 2027. The Punjab leaders here feel any alliance with AAP for the Lok Sabha will come to bite them in the Assembly polls,” said a Chandigarh-based political observer.
Both the parties do agree in private that in Delhi the BJP cannot be stopped from making a seven-nil score line for the third time in a row unless both of them hold hands.
AAP leaders contend the Congress is wary of losing the political space in Punjab to the much younger outfit, which was born out of a movement against alleged corruption in the Congress-led UPA.
“In Delhi since 2013 they are nowhere. Neither in the Assembly nor Lok Sabha,” said an AAP leader. “They are afraid the same will happen in Punjab.”
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, in Punjab the Congress had won eight of the 13 Lok Sabha seats, while the AAP finished third with just one seat. In the intervening five years, AAP has formed the government in Punjab and emerged as the third largest party in Gujarat with 12.92 per cent vote share. The AAP presence made a difference in at least 50 Assembly seats in Gujarat, as the Congress bled profusely. Last May, the Congress lost the Lok Sabha seat of Jalandhar which was a party stronghold for 24 years to AAP.
Though no formal announcement has been made yet, there is a buzz that AAP has offered three of the seven seats in Delhi to the grand old party.
In Bengal, the local leaders are against any alliance with Mamata as the Trinamul has aggressively poached its elected representatives at all levels. The last being Bayron Biswas, who won a bypoll to the Sagardighi seat on a Congress ticket with Left support and then moved to the Trinamul."
6UCSQCZQQ9_KC8IGGVY12JG7WH,Court again: Editorial on Supreme Court’s stay in the Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Idgah dispute,"The Editorial Board Published 23.01.24, 07:39 AM","The Editorial Board Published 23.01.24, 07:39 AM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/opinion/court-again-editorial-on-supreme-courts-stay-in-the-krishna-janmabhoomi-shahi-idgah-dispute/cid/1995589,"Can the law decide how history should have been? That seems to be the implicit demand in the claim presented in court in the name of the deity Krishna and worshippers asking that the Shahi Idgah mosque area in Mathura be transferred to the Katra Keshav Dev temple with which it shares the premises. The mosque is supposed to have been built over the presumed ‘prison cell’ in which Krishna was born — according to legend, nowadays indistinguishable from fact — and the Allahabad High Court passed an order last December for a commissioner to inspect the mosque’s premises. Earlier, it had ordered the Archaeological Survey of India to conduct a ‘scientific’ survey around the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi which members of the majority community claimed to be part of the Kashi Vishwanath temple. The Supreme Court, however, stayed the Mathura order in response to a petition from the mosque’s management, reportedly saying that the order was based on a vague application without specified reasons. The high court was adjudicating on all the suits regarding the Krishna birthplace dispute, and the Supreme Court allowed other matters regarding the issue to be heard as usual.
The Supreme Court’s decision seems to have paused a growing trend: using the law to claim places of worship of minority faiths supposed to have ‘originally’ belonged to the majority religion. Yet altering the religious character of a place of worship as it stood on August 15, 1947 is barred by the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991. The Allahabad High Court order was passed in the face of the earlier Supreme Court ruling that no interim relief could be afforded by civil courts when the maintainability of suits was in question, as in this case. Are ‘inspections’ and ‘surveys’ to obtain motifs and objects of apparently Hindu origin meant to open a back-door to the issue, thus strengthening the claims? In any case, artisans used practised forms in their structures as they travelled from patron to patron; motifs and designs overlap. Besides, the temple trust in Mathura had given the land to the mosque by legal agreement in 1973. But all this is being treated as inconsequential in the Hindutva push to use the legal route for religious domination. This back-door needs to be closed firmly for the sake of equality, secularism and harmony."

France is a key member of the 27-nation bloc European Union (EU).
In June 2022, India and the EU restarted the negotiations for the long-pending trade and investment agreement, after a gap of over eight years.
The negotiations for the ambitious free-trade agreement (FTA) were suspended in 2013 after several rounds of talks spanning six years.
Macron will be the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations on January 26 that would make him the sixth leader from France to grace the prestigious annual event. He will also visit Jaipur on Thursday.
The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said that this visit is expected to provide an impetus to various domains of mutual interest, ranging from defence cooperation to economic ties, and from energy collaboration to space and nuclear partnerships.
The discussions will likely pave the way for new agreements and deepen existing cooperation, reflecting the dynamic and evolving nature of the India-France strategic partnership, it said.
""France, as India's eighth largest trading partner, aims to strengthen trade and investment ties. Both countries are negotiating an FTA (India-EU FTA) to further expand the relationship. They may discuss market access, intellectual property rights, and investment facilitation,"" GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said.
The seventh round of talks for the proposed agreement will be held from February 19-23 here.
Srivastava added that the discussions may include counterterrorism, intelligence sharing, and defence technology transfer.
""Potential collaboration is also expected in renewable energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable infrastructure development, underscoring their commitment to combating climate change,"" it said, adding that discussions between the two countries may also focus on enhancing multilateral cooperation on global health, food security, and climate change.
The growing space partnership between India's ISRO and France's CNES, including joint missions and technology transfer, will likely be a topic of discussion besides increasing cooperation in the civil nuclear segment, it said.
The economic relationship between India and France is marked by significant business presence, trade, and investment.
Over 1,000 French companies operate in India across various sectors like manufacturing, services, and technology, while more than 200 Indian companies are established in France.
In 2022-23, the bilateral trade reached USD 19.2 billion (export USD 7.6 billion and imports USD 6.2 billion).
India's exports to France included diesel (USD 707.9 million), ATF (USD 405 million), turbojets (USD 496 million), apparels(USD 850 million), footwear (USD 157 million), smartphones (USD 248 million), gold jewellery (USD 160.5 million), airplane parts (USD 158 million), medicines (USD 447.8 million), and chemicals (USD 364.5 million).
On the other hand, main imports included planes, helicopters, and/or spacecraft (USD 2.1 billion), LNG (USD 400 million), navigation equipment (USD 102 million), turbojets, and gas turbines (USD 442.2 million).
In the domain of services, India exported financial, IT, maintenance and repair, travel, transport, and other business services worth USD 3.2 billion to France, while importing services such as other business services, transportation, and insurance, amounting to USD 2.2 billion.
Investment-wise, France ranks as the 11th largest investor in India, with a cumulative Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflow of USD 10.5 billion from April 2000 to March 2023.

A bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and Ujjal Bhuyan deferred the matter as the bench was available only till lunch.
""List on January 31. High on board,"" the bench said.
Senior advocate C U Singh, appearing for Khalid, submitted that he was ready to argue but unfortunately this bench is rising after lunch.
The matter was listed along with a batch of petitions challenging various provisions of the UAPA.
Supreme Court judge Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra had on August 9 recused himself from hearing Khalid's plea.
Khalid's petition challenging the October 18, 2022 order of the Delhi High Court, which had rejected his bail plea in the matter, had come up for hearing before a bench of Justices A S Bopanna and Mishra.
The high court had rejected Khalid's bail plea, saying he was in constant touch with other co-accused and the allegations against him were prima facie true.
The high court had also said the actions of the accused prima facie qualified as ""terrorist act"" under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.
Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, and several others have been booked under the anti-terror law UAPA and several provisions of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly being the ""masterminds"" of the February 2020 riots, which left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.
The violence had erupted during the protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).
Khalid, arrested by the Delhi Police in September 2020, had sought bail on grounds that he neither had any criminal role in the violence nor any ""conspiratorial connect"" with any other accused in the case.
The Delhi Police had opposed Khalid's bail plea in the high court, saying the speech delivered by him was ""very calculated"" and he brought up contentious issues like Babri Masjid, triple talaq, Kashmir, the alleged suppression of Muslims and the CAA and NRC.

Referring to the recent cyclone Michaung impact in Chennai and the heavy rainfall that occurred in southern districts of the State, he said TN has sought a relief of Rs 37,000 crore from the Centre, but so far no funds have been received.
""What they (BJP) think is that the people of Tamil Nadu will cast their votes (for them) over mere recital of Tirukkural, celebrating Pongal and constructing (Shri Ram) temple in Ayodhya and mislead them.""  	""They have not understood us. This is the land of Periyar, land of Anna, land of Kalaignar (Karunanidhi),"" he said, alluding to the Dravidian stalwarts.
His comments came on a day when Modi wound up his 3-day spiritual sojourn of the state, during which he visited temples and locations in the state with a Ramayana connect, including Arichalmunai in Rameswaram, which is said to be the place from where the Ram Setu was built.
The consecration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya is scheduled on Monday.
Narendra Modi has been Prime Minister twice ""but on both occasions the people of Tamil Nadu did not vote for him to become PM,"" Stalin said in an apparent reference to the BJP's poor show in the Lok Sabha polls in 2014 and 2019.
He said Tamil Nadu will stick to the trend this time also and that the rest of the country will follow suit.
Exuding confidence of the opposition INDIA bloc winning the elections, he said it will not be a single-party rule. ""Neither will it be an authoritarian regime; it will be one that respects states, one that would do good to Tamil Nadu and the people of the state,"" he said.
Urging party workers to focus on election work, he asked them to leave to the DMK leadership, issues like alliance and candidates who will face the polls.
Further, he strongly pitched for state autonomy and called for constitutional amendment to ensure the states got ""enough powers.""  	His pitch for state autonomy was not confined to his party DMK but all other states ruled by the Congress, Trinamool Congress, Communists and even the BJP.
""After giving sufficient rights to the States, the Centre can retain the rights that ensure unity and integrity of the country,"" he said.
The DMK Chief also told his party cadres that the top priority in front of them was to ensure that BJP-AIADMK strategies did not work out in the State.
Udhayanidhi attacked the BJP over a number of issues, including fund allocation to the state and the National Entrance-cum-Eligibility Test (NEET), which the DMK strongly opposes on the grounds of equality.
The party was ready to stage protests in New Delhi against NEET, he said  	Earlier, a number of resolutions were adopted in the conferenece. These included abolition of the Governor post and appointing Tamils in central government offices located in the state.

7AXALA1F3S_ISDS6PZ09AEUB7G,Supreme Court rap on four Gujarat policemen for publicly flogging five Muslim men,"R. Balaji New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 06:01 AM","R. Balaji New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 06:01 AM",20230124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/supreme-court-rap-on-four-gujarat-policemen-for-publicly-flogging-five-muslim-men/cid/1995771,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday pulled up four Gujarat police personnel for publicly flogging five Muslim men on the charge of obstructing a garba event in Kheda district last year, but stayed the 14-day imprisonment handed down by Gujarat High Court to the cops.
“What kind of atrocities? Tying the people to poles and beating them in full public view and then you expect this court to save you?” said the bench of Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Sandeep Mehta, addressing senior advocate Sidharth Dave representing the cops.
The accused officers — A.V. Paramar, D.B. Kumavat, Laxmanisnh Kanaksinh Dabhi and Rajubhai Dabhi — had received a 14-day sentence on October 19 last year under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, following a petition from the victims. The victims had earlier moved the high court citing the apex court’s judgment in the D.K. Basu vs State of West Bengal case (1996) case in which directions had been passed to the police against any custodial violence or excesses against suspects or accused persons.
The accused officers appealed to the apex court, arguing that they were already facing criminal and departmental proceedings, making the contempt punishment unwarranted.
The bench rejected the argument, with Justice Gavai questioning the police’s authority: “So you (police) have an authority under law? To tie people to polls and beat them?”
The other judge, Justice Mehta, interjected to add: “… And take videos?”
The court alluded to reports suggesting the accused officers not only tied and beat the victims but also recorded videos of the incident.
Dave contended that the officers were unaware of the D.K. Basu judgment and argued against willful disobedience, to which Justice Gavai responded: “So ignorance of law is a valid defence.”
The apex court acknowledged the high court’s findings that the five Muslim men were illegally detained for over 24 hours before being publicly flogged.
Dave disputed the illegal detention claim, stating it was subject to trial and shouldn’t be considered under contempt jurisdiction.
Justice Gavai emphasised the duty of every police officer to be aware of the law laid down in D.K. Basu and admitted the statutory appeal by the accused officers.
“It is the duty of every police officer to know what is the law laid down in D.K. Basu. As students of law, we have been hearing about D.K. Basu,” Justice Gavai observed.
Senior advocate I.H. Syed, representing the victims, defended the high court’s punishment, asserting that contempt proceedings were independent of criminal and departmental actions.
The bench issued formal notices to the Gujarat government and the victims on the officers’ plea. Despite Dave urging the court to stay the high court’s imprisonment order, Justice Gavai remarked: “Enjoy the custody. You will be a guest of your own officers. They will provide you special treatment.”
Dave mentioned the high court’s three-month stay on the imprisonment order, enabling the appeal to the Apex court."
7BK1N033A7_7DWLD0VUQETJJEL,Jharkhand High Court quotes religious texts in judgment on husband-wife relationship,"PTI Ranchi Published 25.01.24, 11:49 AM","PTI Ranchi Published 25.01.24, 11:49 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/jharkhand-high-court-quotes-religious-texts-in-judgment-on-husband-wife-relationship/cid/1996081,"The Jharkhand High Court has cited religious texts while delivering a recent order involving a distraught wife seeking maintenance from her husband.
The judgment not only addresses interpersonal relationship between a husband and wife, but also discusses the rights and responsibilities of married couples.
In a 25-page order, Justice Subhash Chand quotes the Supreme Court to illustrate how women in India are received into the husband's family after marriage. Chand also uses excerpts from the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Manusmriti, and a book by Teresa Chacko titled 'Introduction of Family Life Education' in the order.
Unlike the Western world, where a son separates from his family upon marriage, this is not the case in India, according to Justice Chand.
Quoting from a judgment of the apex court, Justice Chand states that a wife is expected to be with her husband's family after marriage, unless there is a strong justifiable reason for separation.
The wife becomes an integral part of the husband's family, and it is uncommon for her to insist on living separately.
To further explain this concept, Justice Chand references excerpts from the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Manusmriti, and a book by Teresa Chacko titled 'Introduction of Family Life Education.' 	Quoting from Chacko's book, the judge mentions that there are cultural and social expectations regarding appropriate behaviour for both males and females in marriage. The goals and functions of marriage can only be achieved when each family member fulfills their specific role.
The order also enumerates the role of a husband, stating that he should be a sex partner, companion, confidant, decision maker, and accountant. The husband should also be observant and provide emotional support to his wife, the order.
On the other hand, the wife is expected to be an affectionate companion, a good sex partner, confidant, and social secretary for her husband.
She should take charge of the couple's social life, show interest in her husband's work, understand his activities, and provide intellectual companionship.
The matter had come up in a recent case filed by one Rudra Narayan Ray challenging the order of maintenance granted to his wife and minor son by a family court in Dumka.
Justice Chand passed the judgment on January 22 and modified the order to the extent that the maintenance awarded to Ray’s wife was set aside while his minor son’s maintenance amount was enhanced from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000.

The procedure will be carried out at the London Clinic private hospital, where Catherine, the Princess of Wales, had surgery last week.
The 75-year-old King visited the Princess of Wales in the hospital this morning, ahead of his own scheduled treatment.
It is not yet known how long King Charles will remain in hospital.
King Charles III had made his health problem public as a way of sending a message to other men to get their prostates checked.
A statement from Buckingham Palace said the King was ""delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness"".
He also thanked those who had ""sent their good wishes,"" the BBC reported.
The plan for King Charles to have a ""corrective procedure"" for his enlarged prostate was revealed by the palace last week.
A benign prostate problem, which is non-cancerous, is common in men over 50 and is not usually a serious condition, according to the UK's National Health Service.
Around one in three men over the age of 50 will have some symptoms of an enlarged prostate, which is a gland that sits just below the bladder.
Charles became King following his mother Queen Elizabeth's death on September 8, 2022. His coronation took place on May 6, 2023.

The disaster struck the Liangshui village of Zhaotong city at 5:51 am Beijing time, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Over 500 residents were evacuated from the landslide-hit areas as the provincial commission for disaster reduction activated a Level-III emergency response for disaster relief, state-run CCTV reported.
Efforts were ongoing to rescue the people trapped under the landslide, official media reported, adding that two of the missing people found dead.
The 47 buried people were from 18 different households, rescue officials said.
More than 200 rescuers, along with 33 firefighting vehicles and 10 loading machines, were mobilised to search for the missing.
Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered an all-out search and rescue of the people missing in a landslide.
[We should] promptly organise rescue teams, make all-out efforts to search for missing individuals, and minimise casualties to the greatest extent possible,” Xi said, according to the report.
Xi, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, called on party cadres to watch out for other natural disaster risks and hidden dangers “to effectively ensure the safety of people’s lives and property” as a result of the wave of cold weather that swept across southern China just three weeks before the Lunar New Year.
Chinese Premier Li Qiang, too, ordered an all-out rescue effort in Liangshui and emphasised the need to maintain social stability, in light of the area’s high altitude and ethnic diversity.
“It is necessary to promptly evacuate the threatened population, handle resettlement properly, effectively ensure the safety of people’s lives and property, and maintain overall social stability,” he said, official media reported.
The cause of the landslide was not immediately known.
The local weather forecast said there will be light snow in the town on Tuesday, with the lowest temperature expected to reach -3 degrees Celsius, the report said.

Rakesh Bangalore Published 26.01.24, 05:31 AM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/kerala-governor-skips-delhi-criticism-arif-mohammed-khan-edits-tax-denial-from-kerala-budget-speech/cid/1996207,"Kerala governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Thursday skipped almost the entire policy address of the state government, which he was to read out in the Assembly and which was critical of the Centre, continuing his feud with the Left Democratic Front government.
Among others, the prepared text accused the Union government of denying the state’s legitimate share of tax revenues, exacerbating its fiscal situation.
While the state government reacted cautiously, the Opposition accused the governor of insulting the Assembly.
Khan, who entered the Assembly at 9am, began his address two minutes later and completed it in 1 minute and 17 seconds. He read out only the first and last of the 136 paragraphs in the 61-page text.
After reading the first paragraph, the governor said: “And now I am reading the last para.”
The last sentence of the last paragraph read: “Together as part of this varied and beautiful nation we will weave the tapestry of inclusive growth and responsible resilience, overcoming all the challenges that are thrown our way.”
He swiftly left the House following the national anthem, as dazed government and Opposition benches watched the drama.
Sources said the governor’s act had no precedent in Kerala history.
Governors are meant to deliver the policy address at the start of the budget session of the Assembly every year. Khan had in his policy address of 2020 read out remarks against the central government’s CAA despite being already engaged in a running battle with the Left government.
Kerala law minister P. Rajeev was circumspect, underlining that the governor had, technically, “accepted” the policy address. “It’s as good as reading out the whole policy address. And the last para contains the essence of the statement,” he told reporters.
But leader of the Opposition and Congress member V.D. Satheesan told a news conference: “It is a gross humiliation of the Assembly procedures and principles of the Constitution…. We register our strong protest against the governor insulting the Assembly.”
Deputy leader of the Opposition P.K. Kunhalikutty, an Indian Union Muslim League member, too attacked the governor.
“He walked in and left like a rocket. There is a tradition of greeting us (Opposition benches). We were waiting to greet him. But he just walked away. So, today, he converted the Assembly session into a mere mockery. This is an insult to the Assembly.”
The skipped portions of Thursday’s policy address included references to the “liquidity stress stemming from the vertical imbalance between the Union and the states in fiscal matters”.
“Kerala witnessed a decline in its share of taxes devolved by the Union government from 3.88 per cent during the 10th Finance Commission period (1995-2000) to a mere 1.92 per cent during the 15th Finance Commission period (2021-2026),” the text said.
“In 2023-24, the discontinuation of GST compensation, a reduction in revenue deficit grant, and restrictions imposed on off-budget borrowings of the state by the Union exacerbated the fiscal condition of the state.”"

The Bengal leg of the Yatra will begin a day after Trinamul Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee's announcement that her party will contest the upcoming Lok Sabha polls independently in West Bengal.
Both Congress and the TMC are constituents of the INDIA bloc formed to take on the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in the 2024 Parliamentary elections.
The Yatra is scheduled to enter West Bengal through Bakshirhat in Cooch Behar district in the northern part of the state.
Following a two-day hiatus on January 26-27, it will navigate through Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Uttar Dinajpur, and Darjeeling districts before entering Bihar on January 29.
Re-entering West Bengal on January 31 via Malda, it will pass through Murshidabad, both Congress stronghold districts, before departing the state on February 1.
The Bengal leg of the yatra spans 523 km across six districts and six Lok Sabha constituencies—Darjeeling, Raigunj, North and South Malda, and two in Murshidabad—over five days.
This marks Rahul Gandhi's first visit to the state since the April-May 2021 assembly polls.
Former state Congress president Pradip Bhattacharya expressed optimism, stating, ""We are hopeful that the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra of Rahul Ji will give a new lease of life to Bengal's Congress unit. This Yatra will not only help us organisationally but also electorally ahead of the Lok Sabha polls."" 	On entering the state on Thursday afternoon, Gandhi will lead a padayatra from Maa Bhawani Chowk in Cooch Behar town.
The Yatra will continue by bus at Gokshadanga before reaching Falakata in the Alipurduar district for an overnight halt.
A recess has been planned on January 26 and 27, with the yatra resuming from Falakata on January 28, passing through Jalpaiguri, Siliguri, Naxalbari in Darjeeling district, and Uttar Dinajpur district.
The CPI (M) and Left parties, allies of the Congress within the state and the INDIA bloc at the national level, are expected to join the march.
However, TMC has decided to abstain, citing a lack of information about the Yatra.
Banerjee said, ""As a gesture of courtesy, did they (Congress) let me know that they are coming to Bengal for the Yatra? I am not aware of it."" 	""It seems the TMC is trying to help the BJP in the state,"" senior Congress leader Deepa Dasmunsi said.
In a setback to the opposition INDIA bloc, TMC boss Banerjee announced on Wednesday that her party would contest the upcoming Lok Sabha polls independently.
The surprise move left the grand old party stunned. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said in Assam, ""No one can imagine the existence of the opposition INDIA bloc without West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee."" 	The CPI (M)-led Left Front, Congress, and the TMC are part of the 28-party INDIA bloc.
However, in West Bengal, the CPI(M) and Congress have aligned against the TMC and BJP.
The Yatra, which started in Manipur on January 14, is scheduled to cover 6,713 km in 67 days while passing through 110 districts in 15 states, before culminating in Mumbai on March 20.

The daily wage worker lives below the poverty line and stays in one room at Kapileswarpur village with his three children, wife and mother. He said his name was on the waiting list of beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) till last year but has been dropped now.
“My father Sagar Behera was a toddy tapper and could barely feed us. Throughout his life, he tried for housing support. He died last month in this ramshackle house,” Behera said.
Now Behera can get a house only if the Modi government asks the states to identify new families for the PMAY scheme.
Lalatendu Mohanty, a former sarpanch of the village, said a three-member team of officials comprising the panchayat executive officer, the gram rozgar sevak and a nodal official from the block decide who will be included on the beneficiary list.
“I do not know why Behera has not got PMAY support. There are many undeserving people getting the benefit while several genuine families are waiting,” Mohanty said.
Behera’s condition has raised the possibility of the Modi government failing to ensure housing for all by March this year.
In 2016, the Union government had announced its target to provide ""housing for all"" by March 2022. Based on the data of the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC), the government set the target to provide housing support to 2.95-crore households under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G). Under the scheme, Rs 1.2 lakh each is offered to beneficiary households in plain areas and Rs 1.3 lakh in hilly areas.
The state governments run their own housing schemes and have constructed nearly one crore houses out of the 2.95-crore target. The Centre hopes to complete the rest by March this year.
In 2018, the state governments conducted an Awaas Plus survey and identified 3.57 crore additional households that needed housing support. However, the ministry of rural development (MoRD) felt the figure was exaggerated and asked the states to verify it. After scrutiny, the Awaas Plus list was revised to 2.8 crore. Of these, the MoRD sanctioned 91 lakh houses. However, there is no clarity on the 1.9 crore houses identified under Awaas Plus and accepted by the Centre as waitlisted beneficiaries.
Anees Thillenkery, secretary of the Ekta Parishad, a civil society organisation spearheading a movement for a legally entitled right to homestead land for the landless, said ""housing for all"" could not be a deadline-driven programme as new beneficiaries would always be there.
“It is not correct if the government sticks to the 2.95-crore target. With this target, housing for all cannot be achieved. Those families selected under Awaas Plus should be provided support. Also, many more homeless families would have emerged in the last five years. A fresh survey should be done to identify new families too,” he said.
A source said that the MoRD had apprised the Prime Minister’s Office of the waitlisted families under Awaas Plus and the other homeless families that have emerged in the last five years.
“Apart from the Awaas Plus list, there could be another three crore homeless families in the last five years. The PMO is yet to take a decision,” the source said.
An email has been sent to MoRD secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh to understand his perspectives on the fate of Awaas Plus and the unidentified households for support. His response is awaited."

The Ust-Luga complex, located on the Gulf of Finland about 170km west of St. Petersburg, processes stable gas condensate into light and heavy naphtha, jet fuel, fuel oil and gasoil, according to Novatek’s website. The port is used to ship processed products to international markets.
The Interfax-Ukraine news agency, citing unnamed sources, said the fire was the result of a special operation carried out by Ukraine’s security services.
“The Ust-Luga Oil terminal in the Leningrad region is an important facility for the enemy. Fuel is refined there, which, among other things, is also supplied to Russian troops,” it cited one source as saying.
“A successful attack on such a terminal not only causes economic damage to the enemy, depriving the occupiers of the opportunity to earn money to wage war in Ukraine, but also significantly complicates the logistics of fuel for the Russian military.”

Speaking to PTI, he also said that now everyone should listen to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's advice to shun habit of fighting on small disputes.
Ansari said he attended the consecration ceremony of Ram Lalla on Monday and his experience was good.
""When my father (Hashim Ansari) was alive, he kept telling everyone that the Congress got the statue placed inside the Babri Masjid, the party got the mosque demolished, and it laid the foundation stone of the temple,"" he alleged.
""In the BJP rule, only the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya took place...nothing else has happened. The BJP has ended the Ram Mandir issue,"" he said.
On the issue of Kashi and Mathura being taken up now, Ansari said, ""All this will keep happening due to politics in the country. What did the Congress do? Whatever is happening today, the Congress also kept doing the same (during its rule)."" 	 Praising the speech of RSS chief Bhagwat at the consecration ceremony, he said, ""Bhagwat ji was saying the right things. Whatever he was saying should happen.
In his speech, Bhagwat had urged people to end 'kalah' (dispute) and shun habit of fighting on small disputes.
The RSS chief said Ram Lalla has returned home after 500 years because of the penance of a lot of people and he salutes their hardwork and sacrifices.
""But why did he (Ram) leave? He left because there were disputes (kalah) in Ayodhya. Ram Rajya is coming and we have to shun all disputes and stop fighting among ourselves over petty issues. We will have to shun ego and stay united,"" he had said.
Ansari said the Muslims of the country want peace.
""This community is not very educated. It does not want a government job. It does its own small business. When there is no riot, they will live peacefully,"" he added        ""Ram has not come to Ayodhya yesterday, he has been there since December 1949,"" he said, referring to the appearance of a Ram Lalla idol in the Babri Masjid on December 22, 1949.

Police and paramilitary forces had to use force to control the massive crowds that thronged the temple after over 8,000 VIPs left the town with memories of being the privileged first to offer prayer there and receive prasad.
Security personnel seen behaving politely with the visitors till Monday turned into baton-wielding troops on Tuesday, forcing many devotees to run away without paying obeisance at the temple. Some devotees were lifted by their arms and legs and removed from the spot.
Rahul Barman from East Burdwan in Bengal, who had to leave Ayodhya without offering prayers at the Ram temple, said: “On Monday, the policemen were extremely polite and smiled when advising us to avoid coming on Ram Path (in front of the temple), but on Tuesday their cordiality had vanished and their baton was speaking.”
“I am going to Varanasi today (Tuesday) to offer prayer at Kashi Vishwanath temple and will be back to Ayodhya in February to see the Ram temple,” said Barman, whose relative lives in Varanasi, said.
“In Ayodhya, I slept on the floor of an under-construction shopping complex along Ram Path, waiting for the temple to open for us. The security personnel used to check the place but didn’t misbehave with me or any other devotee who had got shelter there,” Barman said.
Barman added: “Today (Tuesday) morning, they came and asked us not to sleep there in the night because we were security threats to the leftover VIPs who would visit Ayodhya.”
Shorty after resorting to lathi-charge to dispel the crowd, some policemen were seen standing on two elevated platforms at the main gate of the temple and announcing on hand-held loudspeakers that the devotees shouldn’t be desperate to enter the temple and stand in queues with patience.
“They were allowed to enter the temple from 6.30am to 11.30am, but we used mild force thereafter to control the crowd. The temple was also closed at that time and reopened at 2.30pm,” said a police officer who didn’t want to be named.
“We have no option because the VIPs are more desperate than the common pilgrims to visit the temple. Every time, we are forced to block the road on both sides of Ram Path along the temple and make arrangements for the entry of the VIPs. Many senior officers from Lucknow arrived here today with their families and offered prayers at the temple. How should we manage the crowd?” the officer said.
Piyush Mordia, the additional director-general of police who is in charge of security in Ayodhya, said: “There is no problem here. People are going to the temple smoothly. Those who were standing in lines since morning have already come out after offering prayers there. There is a big crowd here and we want them not to lose patience.”
Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited Ayodhya and held a meeting with the officers on the temple premises. He later said: “We appeal to the devotees to visit Ayodhya after a week.”
Satyendra Das, the head priest of the temple, said: “About 50,000 devotees offered prayers at the temple by Tuesday afternoon. This number may go up to three lakh per day.”"

The Ust-Luga complex, located on the Gulf of Finland about 170km west of St. Petersburg, processes stable gas condensate into light and heavy naphtha, jet fuel, fuel oil and gasoil, according to Novatek’s website. The port is used to ship processed products to international markets.
The Interfax-Ukraine news agency, citing unnamed sources, said the fire was the result of a special operation carried out by Ukraine’s security services.
“The Ust-Luga Oil terminal in the Leningrad region is an important facility for the enemy. Fuel is refined there, which, among other things, is also supplied to Russian troops,” it cited one source as saying.
“A successful attack on such a terminal not only causes economic damage to the enemy, depriving the occupiers of the opportunity to earn money to wage war in Ukraine, but also significantly complicates the logistics of fuel for the Russian military.”
Reuters could not confirm that the fire resulted from a Ukrainian drone attack."

The attack, which the UN said hit a vocational training compound housing 30,000 displaced people in Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s main city, prompted rare outright condemnation from the US of an apparent Israeli military action.
“Mass casualties have taken place, some buildings are ablaze and there are reports of deaths. Many people are trying to flee the scene, but unable to do so,” UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territory, James McGoldrick, said.
Thomas White, director of Gaza affairs for the UN agency, UNRWA, said at least 12 people were killed and 75 wounded in a building housing 800. The agency’s head Philippe Lazzarini, reposting that statement, said the death toll was probably higher.
“The compound is a clearly marked UN facility and its coordinates were shared with Israeli Authorities as we do for all our facilities. Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,” Lazzarini said.
In Washington, the US state department spokesperson Vedant Patel said: “We deplore today’s attack on the UN’s Khan Younis training centre.” “Civilians must be protected, and the protected nature of UN facilities must be respected, and humanitarian workers must be protected so that they can continue providing civilians with the life-saving humanitarian assistance that they need,” Patel said.
Washington has raised concerns and asked Israel for information over incidents during the conflict, but has rarely been openly critical of a specific Israeli action.
Hours after the attack as night fell, UN staff were still unable to reach the area and all communications were shut down.
Israeli forces have launched their biggest ground offensive in at least a month, encircling the city which is housing hundreds of thousands of people who fled fighting elsewhere in Gaza. Residents say that unlike in previous Israeli assaults, announcements warning them to leave came only after the operation was underway and the main road out already shut.
The bulk of the 2.3 million-strong population of Gaza is now penned into Khan Younis and the towns just north and south of it. Palestinian officials say the Israelis have cut off and besieged the city’s main hospitals, making it impossible for rescuers to reach many of the wounded."
8DDAW5FGP2_70ZGESUANFLID0L,Saudi Arabia's top diplomat says it won't recognise Israel without a path to a Palestinian state,"AP/PTI Jerusalem Published 23.01.24, 04:49 AM","AP/PTI Jerusalem Published 23.01.24, 04:49 AM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/world/saudi-arabias-top-diplomat-says-it-wont-recognise-israel-without-a-path-to-a-palestinian-state/cid/1995553,"Saudi Arabia’s top diplomat said the kingdom will not normalise relations with Israel or contribute to Gaza’s reconstruction without a credible path to a Palestinian state — a non-starter for Israel’s government.
Prince Faisal bin Farhan’s remarks in an interview with CNN broadcast late Sunday were some of the most direct yet from Saudi officials.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who faces mounting domestic pressure over the plight of Israeli hostages, including an angry protest inside a parliamentary committee meeting on Monday — has rejected Palestinian statehood and described plans for open-ended military control over Gaza.
The dispute over Gaza’s future — as the war rages with no end in sight — pits Israel against its top ally, the US, as well as much of the international community, and poses a major obstacle to any plans for post-war governance or reconstruction of the impoverished coastal enclave that is home to 2.3 million Palestinians.
Before the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the war, the US had been trying to broker a landmark agreement in which Saudi Arabia would normalise relations with Israel in exchange for US security guarantees, aid in establishing a civilian nuclear programme and progress towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In September, Netanyahu had said Israel was on “the cusp” of such a deal.
In the interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS, the host asked: “Are you saying unequivocally that if there is not a credible and irreversible path to a Palestinian state, there will not be normalisation of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel?”
“That’s the only way we’re going to get a benefit,” Prince Faisal replied. “So, yes.”
Earlier in the interview, when asked if oil-rich Saudi Arabia would finance reconstruction in Gaza — where Israel’s offensive has caused unprecedented destruction — Prince Faisal gave a similar answer.
“As long as we’re able to find a pathway to a solution ... then we can talk about anything,” he said. “But if we are just resetting to the status quo before October 7, in a way that sets us up for another round of this, as we have seen in the past, we’re not interested in that conversation.”
The Palestinians seek a state that would include Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
Israel views all of Jerusalem as its capital and the West Bank as the historical and biblical heartland of the Jewish people. It has built scores of settlements across both territories that are home to hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers. The last of several rounds of peace talks broke down nearly 15 years ago.
At a meeting about the war on Monday, EU foreign ministers said the creation of a Palestinian state was the only way to achieve peace and expressed concern about Netanyahu’s rejection of the idea.
The current war between Israel and Hamas — the fifth and by far deadliest — began when Palestinian militants broke through Israel’s defences and rampaged through several nearby communities.
Israel’s offensive has killed at least 25,295 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 60,000, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.
Anger over hostages
Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive until “complete victory” over Hamas and to return all of the remaining hostages after nearly half were released in a ceasefire deal in November. But Israelis are increasingly divided on the question of whether it’s possible to do both.
Hamas is believed to be holding the hostages in tunnels deep underground and using them as shields for its top leaders. Israel has only successfully rescued one hostage, while Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations. Those claims could not be independently confirmed.
On Monday, dozens of family members of the hostages stormed a committee meeting in Israel’s parliament, yelling: “You won’t sit here while they are dying there!” Some had to be physically restrained as they shouted at the lawmakers, and at least one person was escorted out."

""It is Pakistan's latest attempt at peddling false and malicious anti-India propaganda,"" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.
He said Pakistan will ""reap what it sows"", adding ""to blame others for its own misdeeds can neither be a justification nor a solution.""  	The comments came hours after Pakistan claimed that it had ""credible evidence"" of links between what it called as ""Indian agents"" to the assassination of two Pakistani terrorists associated with the Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Lashkar-e-Taiba.
India was carrying out ""extra-territorial and extra-judicial killings"" inside Pakistan, Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi alleged at a press conference in Islamabad.
""As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicentre of terrorism, organised crime, and illegal transnational activities,"" Jaiswal said.
""India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence,"" he said.
""Pakistan will reap what it sows. To blame others for its own misdeeds can neither be a justification nor a solution,"" Jaiswal added.
Shahid Latif, a key aide of Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and the mastermind of the 2016 attack on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot, was gunned down in a mosque in Sialkot in Punjab province on October 11 last year.
Riyaz Ahmad alias Abu Qasim, a Lashkar-e-Taiba operative and one of the main conspirators behind the Dhangri terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir in January last year, was shot dead in Rawalakot in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir on September 8, 2023.
""Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan. They recruited, financed, and supported criminals, terrorists, and unsuspecting civilians to play defined roles in these assassinations,"" Qazi alleged.

This is the second time in a week that the regulator has penalised Air India.
The regulator had received a complaint from a former Air India pilot alleging that the airline operated Boeing 777 planes to the US without having the required system of emergency oxygen supply.
A comprehensive investigation into the matter was carried out by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which also issued a show cause notice to the airline.
""Since the said operations of the leased aircraft were not in line with regulatory/ OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) performance limits, DGCA has initiated enforcement action and imposed a penalty of Rs 1.10 crore on Air India,"" DGCA said in a release on Wednesday.
There was no immediate comment from Air India on the penalty.
According to the release, the regulator carried out a detailed probe after receiving a voluntary safety report from an airline employee alleging safety violations of flights operated by Air India on certain long range terrain critical routes.
Since the investigation prima facie revealed non-compliance by the airline, DGCA said a show cause notice was issued to Air India, it added.
Specific details were not disclosed in the release.
DGCA analysed the airline's response to the show cause notice with respect to the laid down stipulations under the relevant statutory provisions and the performance limits stipulated in critical documentations laid down by the OEM before taking the enforcement action, the release said.
On October 29, 2023, the pilot, who had served as a B777 commander, complained about the airline's practice of not carrying the required system of emergency oxygen supply.
At that time, sources had said the complaint was that Air India has been operating flights with leased B777 aircraft that carry a chemically-generated oxygen system which lasts around 12 minutes, and hence should not be used for the airline's direct flights to and from San Francisco.
The airline has to factor in that in case of an emergency situation of depressurisation, there should be sufficient oxygen supply to all the crew and the passengers for any period that is more than 12 minutes.
As per the complaint, in the case of depressurisation, it is mandatory for the aircraft to descend to a flight altitude of 10,000 feet or lower.
When flying over high mountainous terrain that could be more than 9,000 to 10,000 feet, it might not be possible to descend to 10,000 feet within 12 minutes.
This is because of the requirement of maintaining the minimum flight altitude of more than 10,000 feet for more than 12 minutes to be clear of vast stretches of high mountainous terrain below extending for hundreds of miles, the complaint had said.
""The matter in question is multi-dimensional and has already been examined by Air India and external experts. We will restrain from offering any comment on this specific case but we wish to reiterate that the safety of our passengers and crew is our foremost priority and there is no compromise on the same,"" an Air India spokesperson said on November 3 last year about the complaint.
Meanwhile, on January 17, DGCA had imposed a fine of Rs 30 lakh on Air India for lapses in rostering of pilots for operating flights in low visibility conditions.

Domestic equities took a heavy beating as valuation concerns and tensions in the Red Sea saw the benchmark Sensex bleeding 1053.10 points and investor wealth eroding Rs 8.50 lakh crore.
This came after a Bloomberg report said India’s stock market overtook Hong Kong as the world’s fourth largest by market cap as of Monday close.
According to the news agency, the combined value of shares listed on Indian exchanges touched $4.33 trillion on Monday against $4.29 trillion for Hong Kong.
By the end of the day on Tuesday, Hong Kong may have pushed India back to the fifth spot in the market capitalisation pecking order.
It was on December 5 last year that the market cap of India had crossed the $4 trillion mark.
In trading on Tuesday, even as the Sensex tanked 1.47 per cent, the Hang Seng shot up 2.63 per cent or by 392.80 points.
Due to the nearly across-the-board fall, the market capitalisation of all BSE-listed companies tanked Rs 8.50 lakh crore to Rs 365.9 lakh crore.
While the domestic markets were closed on Monday due to the consecration ceremony at Ayodhya’s Ram temple which is forecast to see huge religious tourism, equities on Monday began on a good note amid positive tidings from the event and not too adverse global conditions.
The 30-share Sensex soon advanced 615.55 points to cross the 72000 mark and touch a day’s high of 72039.20 in early morning trade. However, things started going south after 10am as selling set in and it only intensified towards noon.
Analysts said that factors such as expensive valuations, mixed set of results and hostilities in the Red Sea due to the Houthi attacks sparked the selling.
Investors were also spooked by a BMI report which said that South Asian economies could be the most affected due to the tensions in the Red Sea.
The Fitch arm said that India’s economic forecast faces a significant risk in the event of a prolonged spell of disruptions.
China race
Analysts said Indian markets are in a stronger position than China as Chinese and Hong Kong stocks have been pummelled heavily with their market capitalisation crashing more than $6 trillion since their peaks in 2021.
Chinese authorities are now considering measures to stabilise a slumping market, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Policymakers are seeking to mobilise about 2 trillion yuan ($278.53 billion), mainly from offshore accounts of state-owned enterprises, as part of a stabilisation fund to buy shares onshore through the Hong Kong exchange.
China’s stock markets have had a wretched start to the year, with patchy economic growth and a renewed slump in home sales last week.

The CBI had issued summons to the two TMC leaders – Bappaditya Dasgupta and Debraj Chakraborty, who is also mayor in the council of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation – on Wednesday, asking them to appear before its officers for questioning.
""We are trying to find out how both of them were benefited by the irregularities in school jobs,"" the official told PTI.
Chakraborty, who is also the husband of Trinamul Congress MLA Aditi Munsi from the Rajarhat-Gopalpur constituency, and Dasgupta are being questioned together, he said.
The central probe agency had conducted search operations at the residences and offices of the two TMC councillors in November last year.
In October 2022, the CBI had questioned Chakraborty in connection with its investigation into incidents of post-poll violence in the state.
Several leaders of the ruling TMC, including former minister Partha Chatterjee, have been arrested in connection with the school jobs scam.

Harmanpreet Singh, 30, and Kulbir Kaur, 43, were found guilty of conspiracy to commit forced labour and other charges after the pair forced the victim, Singh’s cousin, to work at Singh’s North Chesterfield convenience store for little pay, the Department of Justice said in a statement on Monday.
According to court documents, the victim — who was a minor at the time — came to the US in 2018 after the couple promised to help him enrol in school. After arriving, Singh and Kaur took the boy's immigration documents and immediately put him to work, prosecutors said.
According to court documents, the victim was forced to sleep in an office inside the store for days at a time. He was denied access to food, and the couple also refused his requests to return to India and forced him to overstay his visa.
Prosecutors said Singh also slapped and kicked the victim when he requested his immigration documents and tried to leave. On several occasions, Singh also threatened the victim with a gun when he tried to take a day off and leave the store.
Prosecutors said the abuse and forced labour started in March 2018 and continued through May 2021.
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said the Singh couple exploited the victim’s trust and his desire to attend school in the United States and then inflicted physical and mental abuse against him, all so they could keep him working for their profit.
“These defendants engaged in an egregious bait-and-switch, luring the victim with false promises of an education in the United States and instead subjecting him to gruelling hours, degrading living conditions and a litany of mental and physical abuse,” said US Attorney Jessica D Aber for the Eastern District of Virginia.
“Forced labour and human trafficking are abhorrent crimes that have no place in our society, and I am grateful to our team of prosecutors, agents and support staff for ensuring that justice was done in this case,” Aber said.
A sentencing hearing is scheduled for May 8. They face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, up to five years of supervised release, a fine of up to USD 250,000 and mandatory restitution for the forced labour charge.

The Trinamul Congress chief, at a state government event to commemorate the birth anniversary of Netaji by his statue on Red Road here, hailed him as a “true leader” on account of his uncompromisingly inclusive, pluralist philosophy, apparently underscoring the difference between him and the majoritarian, divisive agenda of leaders in the saffron regime.
“A true leader of this country is one who is flanked by Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Parsis, and Buddhists, all around him. Where can such a leader be seen now? Where… where? Today, such a leader cannot be seen. Nobody like him was born after him,” said Mamata.
“If we had followed Netaji’s words and teachings, we would have been far more developed and successful as a nation,” she added.
The chief minister said it was a shame that Netaji’s birth anniversary was yet to be declared a national holiday.
“A man whom Mahatma Gandhi hailed as Deshneta (leader of the nation)… even after trying for 20 years, I have not been able to get Netaji’s birthday declared a national holiday. I am ashamed and I apologise,” said the chief minister, who has often taken the BJP to task over the delay on this.
“There can be a holiday for political publicity in this country, but not for an icon who sacrificed his life for the nation. The legacy of the freedom fighters weep,” she added, in an apparent reference to the Ram temple consecration event on Monday.
Mamata raised issues such as the abolition of the Planning Commission, envisaged by Netaji, and its replacement by Niti Aayog by the Modi government, besides the inordinate delays in the total declassification of files on the icon who went missing on August 18, 1945.
“It is our grave misfortune, as a nation. Someone who fought for our country, our freedom and gave us direction, we still don’t know the date of his demise. This lack of clarity, this darkness is utterly shameful,” she said.
“After our government came, we declassified 64 files (in 2015), comprising correspondence in the British Raj about our great leader, all facts at our disposal were brought to the public domain,” she added. “The BJP, when it was not in power, had made tall claims about unveiling the mystery. Everything happened thereafter, but they forgot Netaji.”
Mamata called the Niti Aayog a directionless, powerless body that serves no real purpose for the states, unlike the Planning Commission.
“The Planning Commission was also scrapped by them. When it existed, I remember, every year I along with important principal secretaries and the chief secretary used to conduct meetings and discuss planning and money allocation to departments,” said Mamata.
“Niti Aayog has been created which has neither Niti (policy or principle) nor Aayog (commission). It is a wax statue, once in a while it wakes up for Mann Ki Baat (Modi address-the-nation programme)… and waves its head. Seldom in a year, it conducts a meeting. It is a powerless organisation… and doesn’t reflect the people’s concerns,” she added."

Leading the pack is Oppenheimer, securing an impressive 13 nominations, including recognition for Best Picture, Best Actor (Cillian Murphy), Best Supporting Actor (Robert Downey Jr.), and Best Supporting Actress (Emily Blunt). Trailing closely behind are Poor Things and Killers of the Flower Moon, with 11 and 10 nominations respectively.
Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie ignored
However, amidst the celebration, there were some notable snubs that caught the attention of industry observers. Despite Greta Gerwig's remarkable feat of being the first woman to direct three consecutive Best Picture nominees, including Barbie, she was surprisingly overlooked for a Best Director nomination. Margot Robbie, the lead in Barbie, also missed out on a Best Actress nomination but did secure a Best Picture nod as a producer.
Leonardo DiCaprio misses out
Despite Killers of the Flower Moon earning 10 nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, Leonardo DiCaprio was notably absent from the Best Actor category for his role as World War I veteran Ernest Burkhart. Nevertheless, the film stands as a testament to Martin Scorsese, who now holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for a director. Despite its widespread acclaim and numerous nominations, Killers of the Flower Moon faced a notable snub in the Best Adapted Screenplay category too.
Greta Lee snubbed
Past Lives actress Greta Lee, who received widespread acclaim for her performance was considered a strong contender for the Oscars, faced disappointment as she was left out of the Best Actress category. Despite early optimism, industry awards and the Academy ultimately overlooked her exceptional performance.
May December overlooked
Todd Haynes’ May December, which received acclaim for Charles Melton's portrayal of Joe Yoo, was surprisingly absent from major categories. Lead actresses Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman, as well as director Todd Haynes, were not recognised, leaving fans and critics puzzled. The drama received only one nod for Best Original Screenplay.
America Ferrera lands Best Supporting Actress nom
In an unexpected turn of events, America Ferrera, who portrayed Barbie's human counterpart in the film, received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Ferrera — who is one of three people of colour nominated in the supporting actress category, alongside Da’Vine Joy Randolph for The Holdovers and Danielle Brooks for The Color Purple — had only landed a nomination in the Critics Choice Awards 2024 before Oscars.
Marking a first
Lily Gladstone also made history by becoming the first Native American to be nominated for Best Actress for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon. Celine Song added another milestone by becoming the first Asian woman nominated for Best Original Screenplay.
Anatomy of a Fall makes a splash
Anatomy of a Fall, which clinched the Palme d'Or at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, is vying for recognition in five different categories at the 96th Oscars. The French courtroom drama has secured a spot in the Best Picture category at the Academy Awards. Furthermore, Sandra Hüller, the leading actress in the film (who also appears in another Best Picture nominee, The Zone of Interest), has earned a nomination for Best Actress. In addition to these accolades, director and co-writer Justine Triet has received nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, while the film itself is in contention for the Best Editing award."
8REBB0T6QE_7DTAGZND85FB7ME,"Norman Jewison, director of ‘Fiddler on the Roof’ and ‘Moonstruck,’ dies at 97","Dennis Lim Published 23.01.24, 08:18 PM","Dennis Lim Published 23.01.24, 08:18 PM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/norman-jewison-director-of-fiddler-on-the-roof-and-moonstruck-dies-at-97/cid/1995738,"Norman Jewison, whose broad range as a filmmaker was reflected in the three movies that earned him Academy Award nominations for best director — the socially conscious drama “In the Heat of the Night,” the big-budget musical “Fiddler on the Roof” and the romantic comedy “Moonstruck” — died on Saturday at his home. He was 97.
His death was confirmed by a spokesman for the family, Jeff Sanderson. He declined to specify where Mr. Jewison lived, saying that the family requested privacy.
Mr. Jewison, whose career began in Canadian television and spanned more than 50 years, was, like his close friend Sidney Lumet and a select few other directors, best known for making films that addressed social issues. The most celebrated of those was “In the Heat of the Night” (1967), one of his earliest features and his first Oscar-winning film.
A story of racial tensions in the American South filtered through a murder mystery that brings together a Black Philadelphia detective (Sidney Poitier) and a white Mississippi police chief (Rod Steiger), “In the Heat of the Night” could not have been more timely: It opened weeks after racial violence had erupted in Detroit and Newark. It went on to win five Academy Awards, including best picture and best actor, for Mr. Steiger.
Mr. Poitier was among the many actors who had fond memories of working with Mr. Jewison. “He gives his actors room and keeps them as calm as he can, because it’s easier to speak with them when they’re calm,” he told The New York Times in 2011. “A director has to keep the actors on their toes while the camera’s running, but when the scene is done, they should be relaxing, nothing on their minds. There can’t be a constant level of seriousness. And with Norman, there’s always a lot of laughter.”
Mr. Jewison lost the best director award for “In the Heat of the Night” to Mike Nichols, who won for “The Graduate,” and he never did win an Oscar for directing. But his films, and the actors in them, garnered many Oscars and 46 nominations.
Mr. Jewison once said, “The movies that address civil rights and social justice are the ones that are dearest to me.” He attributed his predilection for such movies to his lifelong sense of being an outsider.
Norman Frederick Jewison was born on July 21, 1926, in Toronto, where his parents, Dorothy (Weaver) and Percy Jewison, ran a dry-goods store below their apartment. From a childhood love of movies, radio shows and vaudeville, he developed an interest in writing and performing.
The family was Methodist, but because of his surname, young Norman was teased and bullied by schoolmates who assumed he was Jewish. A later formative brush with bigotry came while he was on a hitchhiking trip through the segregated American South in the 1940s. On the outskirts of Memphis, he was chastised by a driver for sitting in the back of a bus with the Black passengers.
“Traveling in the South,” Mr. Jewison wrote in an autobiography, “This Terrible Business Has Been Good to Me” (2004), “I understood the meaning of being victimized even more than I had as a boy.”
After World War II, during which he served in the Canadian Navy, he attended Victoria College at the University of Toronto, where he directed and acted in student theater productions. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts in 1949.
Like many filmmakers of his generation, Mr. Jewison came up through the ranks of television. He worked as a writer and actor for the BBC in London and as a director for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in Toronto before landing at CBS in New York, where he directed specials starring Judy Garland, Harry Belafonte and Danny Kaye.
He directed his first feature film in 1962, for Universal Studios: “40 Pounds of Trouble,” a comedy based on a Damon Runyon story that starred Tony Curtis. Under contract to Universal, he was paired with the studio’s biggest star at the time, Doris Day, for two more comedies, “The Thrill of It All” (1963) and “Send Me No Flowers” (1964).
Eager to prove his range, Mr. Jewison jumped at the chance to direct “The Cincinnati Kid” (1965), a drama with Steve McQueen as a Depression-era gambler, when the original director, Sam Peckinpah, was fired a few days into the shoot.
Mr. Jewison’s other ’60s films include “The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming” (1966), a satire of Cold War paranoia that was his first film to receive an Oscar nomination for best picture (although he himself was not nominated for best director), and “The Thomas Crown Affair” (1968), a romantic crime caper starring Mr. McQueen and Faye Dunaway. But the movie that sealed his reputation was “In the Heat of the Night,” which beat two other era-defining films, “Bonnie and Clyde” and “The Graduate,” for best picture honors.
Mr. Jewison took pride in the movie’s success, which suggested to him a widespread receptiveness to its liberal message. But with the United States mired in Vietnam and the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, he was also growing disillusioned with the political mood in America. (The Oscar ceremony at which “In the Heat of the Night” was named best picture was delayed two days because of Dr. King’s funeral.)
After finishing the 1969 comedy “Gaily, Gaily,” Mr. Jewison moved his family to London and worked abroad for several years. Shot largely in Eastern Europe, “Fiddler on the Roof” (1971) — which Mr. Jewison claimed he had been asked to direct in part because executives at United Artists, like the bullies at school, thought he was Jewish — received Oscar nominations for best picture and best director. He followed it with another screen version of a popular Broadway musical, “Jesus Christ Superstar” (1973), based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber rock opera and filmed in Israel.
Returning to North America, Mr. Jewison bought a cattle farm outside Toronto and divided his time between Canada and California from the late ’70s onward. He scored one of his biggest hits in 1987 with “Moonstruck,” a commercial and critical success that earned Cher an Oscar and put Nicolas Cage on the map as a leading man.
But throughout his career Mr. Jewison was repeatedly drawn to more serious fare, in movies like “F.I.S.T.” (1978), a labor-union drama that starred Sylvester Stallone; “In Country” (1989), about the daughter of a Vietnam War casualty; and his last film, “The Statement” (2003), the story of a former Nazi collaborator, played by Michael Caine.
Well into the post-civil-rights era, Mr. Jewison remained interested in race, specifically racial injustice. In 1984, he directed “A Soldier’s Story,” an adaptation of Charles Fuller’s Pulitzer Prize-winning “A Soldier’s Play,” which, like “In the Heat of the Night,” told the story of a Deep South murder investigation, this time on an Army base in World War II-era Louisiana. The movie was critically praised and earned Mr. Jewison yet another best picture nomination.
But when it was announced a few years later that Mr. Jewison would be directing a film about the life of Malcolm X, he encountered resistance. The filmmaker Spike Lee, who had long wanted to make such a film himself, was the most outspoken critic of the choice, maintaining that a white director could not do justice to the story of a major Black political activist.
Mr. Jewison eventually left the project, although he denied that his departure was in response to the protest. Mr. Lee himself went on to direct “Malcolm X,” which was released in 1992, and later said that Mr. Jewison “was happy I got to do the film.”
In 1999, Mr. Jewison directed “The Hurricane,” about Rubin Carter, the African American boxer whose career was cut short by a murder conviction, and who was imprisoned for nearly 20 years before the charges against him were dismissed. Denzel Washington (who had one of his first film roles in “A Soldier’s Story,” and who had also starred in “Malcolm X”) received rave reviews and an Oscar nomination for his performance in the title role (Stephen Holden of The Times called it “astonishing”). But the film was criticized by many for taking liberties in its depiction of Mr. Carter’s life and legal battles.
Beginning in the late 1960s, Mr. Jewison served as producer on his own movies. He also produced the work of other directors, including “The Landlord” (1970), the directing debut of his regular editor, Hal Ashby (who won an Oscar for his work on “In the Heat of the Night”).
Mr. Jewison married Margaret Ann Dixon, a model, in 1953. She died in 2004. He married Lynne St. David in 2010. He is survived by two sons from his first marriage, Kevin and Michael; a daughter, Jenny Snyder; and five grandchildren.
In 1988, Mr. Jewison founded the Canadian Film Center, a film school and institution in Toronto. He received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his body of work at the 1999 Academy Awards and a lifetime achievement award from the Directors Guild of America in 2010. In 2011, the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York presented a 15-film retrospective of his work.
“For me, films are about ideas,” Mr. Jewison told The Times on the occasion of the retrospective. “Every director should ask himself, ‘Why am I making this picture?’ And if you can’t answer that, you shouldn’t make it.”

Banerjee, who was seated in front beside the driver, was injured after her head hit the dashboard, he said.
The accident took place when the CM was returning to Kolkata from an administrative review meeting in Purba Bardhaman.
Later in the evening, she went to the Raj Bhavan to meet Governor C V Ananda Bose.
""All of a sudden, a car came in front of us at high speed. By God's grace, I was saved as my driver was alert. I am not feeling well as I am having pain and swelling. I have taken some medicines,"" Banerjee said.    	""At times, people misuse vehicles; as was the case when a person pretending to be a BSF jawan was caught outside my residence. The police is looking into today’s incident. I won't comment on it further,"" she added.
Banerjee had in June last year suffered a knee injury, while alighting from a helicopter in Sevoke in north Bengal. The chief minister had suffered another ligament injury on her left knee in September, and had to undergo a microsurgery.
In the run-up to the 2021 assembly polls, she had fractured a leg and moved on a wheelchair to campaign for the election.
Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, who is presently in Assam for Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, wished her a speedy recovery.
“We have just heard of the injury suffered by Mamata Banerjee ji in a car accident. We wish her a full and speedy recovery. The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is looking forward to entering West Bengal tomorrow late morning. January 26 and 27th being break days, the Yatra will resume on the 28th,” he posted on X.
Ramesh’s message for Banerjee came amid a surprise announcement by the CM earlier in the day to go alone in the state in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
Banerjee’s remarks caught the grand old party off guard, prompting it to state that “no one can imagine the existence of the opposition INDIA bloc without the TMC supremo"".

The Jharkhand BJP has been requesting the Jharkhand government to declare January 22 as a state holiday.
In a letter to the chief minister on Thursday, the leader of the Opposition in Jharkhand Assembly and senior BJP leader Amar Kumar Bauri requested Soren to honour Lord Ram by declaring January 22 as a state holiday.
Bauri had told the media: “January 22 will be a golden moment in the history of India when the entire country and the world will witness the consecration of Ram temple. Lord Ram is revered not only in India but throughout the world.”
Earlier, on January 12, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash had requested the Jharkhand government to declare January 22 as a “dry day”.
In a letter to the chief minister, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash had called for a ban on the sale of liquor and meat on that day."

In a three-paragraph statement, the Maldives government said China had requested, “the necessary clearances to make a port call” but added that: “The vessel would not be conducting any research while in Maldivian waters.”
The Maldivian foreign ministry statement came after international reports that the Xiang Yang Hong 3 was coming to carry out extensive research in the Indian Ocean region. The Maldives statement clarified that the ship would make the port call for, “rotation of personnel and replenishment.”
However, it’s still not clear how long the ship would stay in the Indian Ocean/Arabian Sea area and what  research it carries out. Sri Lanka announced on January 1 that it would not allow Chinese research vessels like the Xiang Yang Hong 3 to dock at its port through 2024. Earlier indications were that the ship planned to stay in the Indian Ocean region for around four months.
The new Maldives government which was elected late last year has tilted strongly towards China and away from India. A Chinese foreign ministry vice minister, Sun Haiyan, was in the Maldives for a two-day visit that ended yesterday. Her visit came hard on the heels of Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu’s five-day visit to China during which he received red carpet treatment and held a meeting with China’s powerful leader Xi Jinping.
Muizzu made his first foreign visit to Turkey and then went to China. Traditionally, Maldivian leaders have always made their first visit to India but Muizzu has pointedly not done that. He has also not received an invitation from India.
The Maldivian foreign ministry stressed in its message that the country had always welcomed both civilian and military vessels “for peaceful purposes”.
India has been very concerned about the increasing number of Chinese research ships that have been making prolonged stays in the Indian Ocean area. Last October, another ship, the Shi Yan 6 had docked in Colombo and carried out research for two days on Sri Lanka’s west coast. The Sri Lankans are thought to have shortened its stay after pressure from the Indian government.
Another Chinese research ship, the Yuan Wang 5, docked in Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port in August 2022. These ships are thought to be mapping the seabed and also keeping an eye on Indian naval activity.
Such activities are part of what international analysts term China’s two-ocean strategy."

The remarks were made by the Ajit Pawar faction of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) during the hearing on disqualification petitions before assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar on Wednesday.
Patil maintained he was the state NCP president because he was elected to the post and senior leader Praful Patel, now a member of the Ajit Pawar group, had given him a letter to that effect.
Lawyers representing the Ajit Pawar faction said Patil's term as state NCP president ended in 2022.
Patil countered the argument, saying he was elected for three years and his term continued till a new appointment was made.
During the hearing, Patil was asked 90 questions.
Shirur Lok Sabha member Amol Kolhe was also cross-examined.
The 1999-founded party suffered a split when Ajit Pawar and eight other NCP MLAs loyal to him took oath as ministers in the Shiv Sena-led government on July 2, 2023.
Subsequently, both factions filed cross-petitions before the speaker seeking disqualification of each other's members from the assembly.
The Supreme Court has set January 31 deadline for the speaker's verdict in the NCP disqualification case.

Now with the accolades pouring in for Shri Swapankumarer Badami Hyenar Kobole — starring Abir Chatterjee as Dipak Chatterjee and Paran Bandopadhyay as Swapan Kumar — Debaloy tells us why he has been fascinated by Swapan Kumar and the challenges he faced in making this film.
What is your personal association with Swapan Kumar’s works?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: I am a fan of pulp literature. When I was a child, I wasn’t allowed to read Swapan Kumar. When I grew up, I explored old Bengali literature. Swapan Kumar seemed quite intriguing to me. I felt that decades back someone had dared to write something magical. The thing that struck me is that this person had managed to create a world of his own. Honestly, the stories aren’t great. I am a fan because while reading the stories, they showed the same world differently. Swapan Kumar’s stories don’t have the values by which we judge good literature. That is why he was never considered a good writer. People considered him a writer of cheap, pulp fiction. But they missed the fact that he was able to create a fantasy world of his own in his city, Kolkata. In today’s time, I feel he is very relevant and important.
Our regular detective literature has become too cliched. The way we see the city through them has been done to death and I felt there was a need for a fresh way of thinking and imagination. I wanted to look at Kolkata differently and so the film is a homage to Swapan Kumar.
Have you been a fan of Dipak Chatterjee? What makes him different from Feluda and Byomkesh Bakshi?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: The entire value system is different from Feluda and Byomkesh Bakshi. Dipak Chatterjee’s imagination is wild and fantastical. Fantasy is never considered a serious form. If you look at our lives, fantasy is a very important thing.
⁠You had been planning Shri Swapankumarer Badami Hyenar Kobole for a decade...
Debaloy Bhattacharya: I wrote it in 2004 and then the story changed multiple times. We had no clue how people would respond. Hoichoi Studios believed in making something different and stood by it. I wanted to make a surreal film with many layers, subtexts and non-linear narratives, and decided to create this world within our limited resources. We did that.
It took nine years to make my film Dracula Sir. The type of narrative that I like to tell is different, for which I have to wait for an opportunity. At a certain point, I convince my producers who think they can take the risk and they make it. There is a lot of money involved and most of the time I don’t know whether the money will come back or not. Hoichoi Studios was happy with the response. I never hoped for such positive reviews and responses. You feel really good when people understand your craft. I always knew that the audience was intelligent.
Filmmaker Debaloy Bhattacharya.
⁠What made you cast Abir Chatterjee as Dipak Chatterjee and Paran Bandyopadhyay as Shri Swapan Kumar?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: Somebody said casting Abir was a master stroke. It is because Abir is carrying the baggage of all the literary detective characters. If you watch the film, it is evident how pissed he is with the baggage he is carrying. That is what Dipak Chatterjee also wanted to say in the novel. That is how Abir connected with it. Abir said that he is bored with all the usual detectives who solve the cases like an intelligent person and the case is either a murder mystery or a treasure hunt.
Everybody is saying this is Abir’s best performance.
Paranda is a legend. He enjoyed working on the film a lot. Having him in the film was a blessing. He was always in my mind as Swapan Kumar. At the beginning of the film, we have a picture of Swapan Kumar getting morphed into Paranda and they look so similar.
⁠Satire and pulp fiction are quite unusual genres in Indian cinema. How challenging was it to make the film in this genre?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: It was quite challenging. The first challenge was to convince the actors and the team that I was making a film in this genre. If you read the script, you will not understand the whole setup. It is not linear; it’s like bits and pieces of everything. On paper, it’s very confusing apparently. It was only on the screen that they realised what it was. A serious action scene with emotion and so much humour is a very difficult thing to handle. I didn’t know whether it would come out well. It is the most difficult film I have made so far.
Shri Swapankumarer ⁠Badami Hyenar Kobole has a graphic novel vibe and a unique style for its use of colours.
Debaloy Bhattacharya: I wanted to create my world just as Swapan Kumar wanted to create his. A Kolkata that people have not seen. A Kolkata that is exciting, interesting, colourful, where in every nook and corner there’s an adventure happening. It turned out that way. I wanted a lot of energy. I like colours. I come from a background of painting. When I used to draw, it used to be a grand narrative. One of my teachers who was very fond of me would say that my films are an extension of my paintings, images and thoughts. All my films are different from each other in their visual treatment.
⁠In your recent Prime Video series PI Meena, you directed Tanya Maniktala. How was the experience?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: Tanya is a fantastic human being. It was like a cakewalk with her. It could have been a very good experience but Covid hit us and made our life quite difficult. We had to shoot in a terrible situation. We had to compromise a lot on the shoot because of the pandemic, but the team and the actors were great.
⁠Having been a painter, what made you choose cinema as your primary medium of expression?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: I realised that painting is a beautiful thing as a personal medium. But I wanted to go out and connect with the masses. I don’t make films for festivals. I make films that are different, but for the masses. It doesn’t always have to be commercial, and it also doesn’t have to appease the festival audience. I don’t want to go abroad and collect awards. I want people to watch my films. That is what pushed me from painting to making films. Films have been my passion right from my school days. To take it up as a profession was a challenge.
⁠What is next for you?
Debaloy Bhattacharya: I am working on a quirky series for Hoichoi. I don’t have any plans in Bombay. I love working in my mother tongue. I have to give a lot of time to a Hindi project, which I don’t like. It took me more than a year to finish Badami Hyenar Kobole but if I go to Bombay and start a project, I will get detached from here."

The small plane had arrived here to take back the Myanmarese soldiers who crossed over to India last week, following gunfights with an ethnic insurgent group, they said.
There were 14 people on the plane and eight of them were injured in the accident, which happened around 10.20 am, officials said.
While landing, it overshot the tabletop runway of the Mizoram government-run airport and crashed. The impact of the accident was such that the plane split into two, they said.
The injured persons were taken to the Lengpui primary health centre for treatment, they added.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered an investigation into the crash, a state government official said.
""All incoming flights have been diverted. When flight services, incoming and outgoing, will resume is yet to be known. Hoping all passengers would be able to either fly in or fly out as soon as possible, especially people with medical emergency,"" she said.
A total of 276 Myanmarese soldiers had entered Mizoram last week, and of them, 184 were sent back on Monday, officials said.
The remaining 92 soldiers were to be repatriated on Tuesday, they said.
The plane was supposed to take them to Sittwe in Myanmar's Rakhine state.

The 276 Myanmarese soldiers entered Bandukbanga village, located at the India-Myanmar-Bangladesh trijunction, in southernmost Mizoram's Lawngtlai district with arms and ammunition on 17 January and approached the Assam Rifles.
They fled to Mizoram after their camp was overrun and captured by 'Arakan Army' fighters.
The Myanmarese soldiers were taken to the nearby Assam Rifles camp at Parva, and later the majority of them were shifted to Lunglei, the official said.
They have been under the supervision of the Assam Rifles since then, the official said.
These 276 soldiers were brought to Aizawl over Saturday and Sunday, for their transport to Myanmar from the Lengpui airport.
The group, headed by a colonel, has 36 officers and 240 lower-rank personnel, officials said.
With the 276 soldiers who entered last week, as many as 635 Myanmar soldiers have fled to Mizoram after their camps were overrun and captured by ethnic armed organisations and pro-democratic forces over the last few months, officials said.
In November, 104 Myanmar army personnel were sent to the border town of Moreh in Manipur from different places in Mizoram by Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters, and then repatriated. Earlier this month, 255 soldiers were sent back via the Lengpui airport by Myanmar air force planes.
Mizoram shares a 510-km-long border with Myanmar."
9972P4JDP8_F8CTN3B08JLNPKL,Manipur’s terra infirma,"Pradip Phanjoubam Published 24.01.24, 06:53 AM","Pradip Phanjoubam Published 24.01.24, 06:53 AM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/manipurs-terra-infirma-state-govt-must-reconsider-its-practice-of-giving-recognition-to-new-villages-periodically/cid/1995775,"One insight into the ongoing ethnic conflict in Manipur and, indeed, the periodic explosion of similar violence in most other northeastern states is the problem posed by widely different notions of land and its ownership amongst different communities. It is ironic but illustrative that there are so many boundary disputes among these states; admittedly, the notion of the modern boundary was unknown here before the Treaty of Yandabo of 1826 by which the British annexed Assam and merged it with Bengal.
As Lord Curzon pointed out in his Romanes lecture in 1907 on ‘Frontiers’, it was in not only the Northeast but also the world outside of Europe where the idea of artificially delineated boundaries was alien. There were natural boundaries determined by rivers, mountains, deserts and so on, but even these did not resemble the closely-guarded and precise limits of national domains. Boundaries also waxed and waned, depending on the powers of rulers and chiefs.
The British being unaccustomed to territories with no precise limits ensured boundaries were drawn wherever they took over. While these boundaries served their purposes, they often left problems for those who inherited them. This history of the Northeast’s boundaries is intriguing and the land-people relationship also complicated British boundary-making exercises in many ways.
The British administrative institution introduced in Assam reflected the challenges of dealing with a mix of State-bearing populations under centralised bureaucracies of kingdoms and non-State communities living in the uncharted hills. Assam’s plains were much easier for the British to handle, unlike the hills where the authority of each village, tribe and clan did not run beyond its closed community. The British, therefore, introduced normal land revenue administration in the plains but left the surrounding hills as Excluded or Partially Excluded areas and separated the two regions by an Inner Line drawn by the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation of 1873. In 1907, the British also introduced a similar administrative arrangement in their protectorate state of Manipur.
That communities living in different kinds of economy would have different outlooks towards land is a foregone conclusion. For the nomads, anywhere they pitch their tents is their land. But this is not so for settled agriculturists, feudal principalities or the modern State. When communities with different outlooks towards land live in the same geographical region, conflicts are inevitable. One of Manipur’s major problems is this.
What needs to be remembered is that the modern State is premised on a sedentary and enumerable population. Democracy itself would become fragile if its population were to be constantly shifting, with government infrastructure perpetually chasing proliferating villages.
If and when the Manipur crisis reaches an amicable resolution, the stakeholders must realise the need to come to terms with the new reality of sedentary lifestyle. This will transform the endemic land tussles among Manipur’s diverse communities as well as those with the State. While indigenous ways of life must be respected, a common denominator is also indispensable to ensure good administration.
The Manipur government must also reconsider its practice of giving recognition to new villages periodically. Because of a peculiar land-holding tradition amongst — especially — the Kukis, whereby the chief owns the village and the villagers are landless, there is a tendency for villagers to leave and start their own village. This is also one reason why Kukis felt most targeted when the government initiated an eviction drive against encro­achment in reserved and protected forests. Neigh­bouring Mizoram, where Kuki-Zo kindred tribes live, can be a shining example. Following the introduction of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, the autocratic rights of 259 chiefs were abolished on popular demand in 1954, giving stability to its villages.

A special messenger from the chief minister’s office handed over a sealed letter at the ED zonal office in Ranchi on Thursday afternoon.
Sources in the ED office who are connected with the probe in the alleged money laundering charges over a land scam in Ranchi informed that the chief minister has only written that “he would communicate about his availability for their summon in due course of time” indicating that he would not be available for their summons between January 27 and 31.
The same source also confided that during the questioning on Saturday at the chief minister’s residence when ED officials said that they might require his cooperation again when needed and Soren had said that he would be tied up till March 31.
Sources in the chief minister’s secretariat confirmed that apart from the budget session which will begin in mid-February there will be a series of launching of welfare schemes in view of the code of conduct which can be imposed any moment after the announcement of the Lok Sabha polls expected any moment in the next month.
Barely 48 hours after quizzing Soren, the ED had on Monday summoned him (ninth time) for questioning.
The ED letter had asked Soren to appear for questioning between January 27 and 31. The letter has also given the chief minister the option of answering the ED questions either at his official residence in Kanke Road or at the ED office on Hinoo Road in Ranchi.
Incidentally, ED officials had interrogated Soren for over seven hours on Saturday at his official residence.
Soren had earlier been quizzed by the ED in November 2022 in Ranchi in connection with an illegal mining case for nearly nine hours.
“ED officials had prepared a list of 50 questions out of which nearly 30 have been asked and the remaining questions need to be asked based on documentary evidence in the land scam case about change of ownership of an army land in Ranchi,” an ED source had earlier revealed."

The monk, who narrates the story of Ram’s life to congregations of devotees every evening, cannot see what she is painting since he’s visually impaired.
But his trust, Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas, has hired Sarkar and 19 other painters from across the country to capture Ram’s life, and that of Rambhadracharya himself, on canvas.
“I learnt painting in Calcutta, my hometown, but I recently shifted to Delhi. A relative is associated with Rambhadracharya’s trust; he suggested I attend the workshop from January 14 to 22,” Sarkar told The Telegraph, paintbrush working furiously.
She said the trust was taking care of the painters’ travel, stay and meals, but was evasive when asked how much she was being paid. “It’s mostly out of my religiosity that I am here,” she said.
Somnath Bothe, 40, a painter from Pune hired for the same job, hinted at a smooth co-existence between business and temple-fuelled religiosity.
“Most of us have been assigned to make paintings based on the Valmiki Ramayana. These paintings will be the property of Rambhadracharya’s trust, which may hold an exhibition somewhere and put them on sale,” he said.
He added: “We shall leave Ayodhya after the Prime Minister inaugurates the temple on January 22.”
Not just Sarkar and Bothe, all the bustle, glitter and pomp that is now Ayodhya will be gone within hours of Narendra Modi leaving the town at 3pm on Monday after the Ram temple consecration.
For now, the town is decked out in its finery and wrapped in ecstasy as it waits to welcome the Prime Minister, expected to arrive at 10.25am on Monday.
“The state’s department of culture has hired 100 troupes — 2,500 folk artistes in all — to sing and dance while the Prime Minister is here,” a state government source said.
“Modi may take a chopper from the Maharshi Valmiki Airport and land at the helipad at Saker College, close to the temple, at 10.45am. Or he may decide to travel by road. Whether he travels by car or helicopter, he can see the cultural presentations.”
The itinerary released by the local administration has Modi taking a chopper. From the helipad he will be driven to the Ram temple, arriving at 10.55am. His schedule has been kept free between 11am and noon, and there’s a possibility he might take a dip in the Saryu.
Modi will participate in the Pran Pratistha rituals from 12.05pm to 12.55pm and then address the gathering of over 8,000 VIP guests between 1pm and 2pm. He is scheduled to leave Ayodhya at 3pm.
“We will start preparing to return home soon after Modi leaves,” said Sugam Singh, 30, a Vantangiya tribal dancer from Gorakhpur.
Geet Sharma, 25, a peacock dancer from Mathura, said: “The department of culture has hired our troupe to perform, on a roadside platform, till 5pm on Monday.”
Huge decorative pillars of fibreglass have been installed on both sides of a stretch of the national highway as it approaches Ayodhya, and on the banks of the Saryu.
The administration has decorated all the houses near the temple with fairy lights. Labourers were hired to decorate the façades of the houses with flowers. They will all be gone after Monday.
“We have rented these fibre pillars and lights; they will be removed after the Prime Minister’s programme. The flowers will dry up on their own,” an official of the state information department said.
“This razzmatazz we have been seeing in Ayodhya for the past few days cannot be expected to be there every day. Our goal is to make this event remembered for centuries.”
Asked whether the ambience did not reflect a momentary carnival spirit more than religious devotion, Rambhadracharya said: “Modi is a historic personality and he deserves to be welcomed for giving the Ram temple to Ayodhya.”
Reminded that it was the Supreme Court that in 2019 handed the site over to Hindus to build the temple, he said: “We all contributed to convincing the Supreme Court to give us the disputed land in Ayodhya.”
He claimed: “I had furnished 441 pieces of evidence that there was a temple at the site before Babar raised the Babri Masjid at the birthplace of Ram.... I am now planning to bring back the Gyanvapi Mosque in Kashi and the Shahi Idgah Masjid in Mathura for the Hindus. Modi will obviously play a decisive role in that too. His welcome here should be historic so that he speeds up Kashi and Mathura.”
Some Sangh Parivar supporters have moved court saying the Gyanvapi and the Shahi Idgah were built after destroying portions of the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi and Krishna Janmasthan Mandir in Mathura, and the sites should be given back to Hindus.
Lamp fiasco
A diya (lamp) projected as the world’s biggest ever caught fire around 2pm, about four hours after it had been lit on an open ground near the Tapasvi Ki Chawani Ashram.
Paramhans Das, a self-styled sadhu known to be happy to seek the limelight, said he had got the lamp, 300 feet in diameter, made with 1,008 tonnes of loam. “About 21,000 litres of oil was poured into it just for tonight. About 1.25 quintals of cotton were used for the wick. I spent over Rs 7 crore in all,” Das had told reporters on Saturday night.
“Some 108 teams of workers took one year to make this diya. We used oil brought from Mithila, Sita’s birthplace. We are trying to recreate the celebratory scenes Ayodhya witnessed when Ram returned victorious.”
Eyewitnesses said a canopy erected above the lamp to protect it from rain and dew had caught fire as the flames rose. The fire then spread to nearby trees.
With open ground all around, they said, the flames died down by themselves. But parts of the diya have got burnt or developed cracks.
Das said he had asked labourers to repair the lamp so it could be lit again in the night.
Mahant Rajkumar Das, another sadhu who lives at Tapasvi Ki Chawani, said: “Paramhans has grabbed a portion of the ashram and is using the lamp as a gimmick to grab it entirely in the name of celebrating the temple inauguration.”"

Accompanied by over 120 personnel of the central armed police force, the ED officers broke open the collapsible gate at the residence of Sheikh in the Sandeshkhali area in the presence of local police and two locals as witnesses, the officer said.
""We are searching Sheikh's house today. We will also try to talk to the residents there"", the ED officer told PTI.
After entering the house, the ED officers locked the gates from inside and started searches, he added.
ED officers searched rooms, kitchen, and cupboards, and broke open almirahs in Sheikh's residence, a senior officer said.
""As of now, our officer could not find anything significant inside the house. It seems the documents have been shifted from this house. However, our search operation is still on. Our officers are looking for things on the second floor of the building,"" the officer said.
It was learnt that they were in touch with their senior officers about their next course of action in the search operation.

Meanwhile, a huge number of central forces as well as policemen from Basirhat Police District and the local Nazat police station were found standing guard outside the premises and along the stretch leading to the main gate of the building.
Earlier, the ED officers were stopped from entering the TMC leader's residence by local police before they were shown the ""order to conduct a search operation"" there.
""We need to see the order to conduct a search operation at any place within our jurisdiction. This is the norm. They (ED officers) showed the order and after that we allowed them to break open the gate and start searching inside.

On January 5, a team of ED officers were assaulted by a mob when they tried to enter the residence of the TMC leader.
Three officers were injured in the attack. The district police and Sheikh's family members had lodged a complaint against the ED officers.

9H7KGIGXJQ_MACRM38X7ORYRSQ,Israel-Hamas war: US official heads to Middle East for talks on hostages,"Peter Baker Published 22.01.24, 07:02 AM","Peter Baker Published 22.01.24, 07:02 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/israel-hamas-war-us-official-heads-to-middle-east-for-talks-on-hostages/cid/1995381,"A senior Biden administration is heading back to the Middle East on Sunday in hopes of making progress toward an agreement that would result in the release of more hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a pause in Israel’s military campaign in the Gaza Strip, two U.S. officials said.
President Joe Biden’s Middle East coordinator at the White House, Brett McGurk, will travel to Cairo to meet with Gen. Abbas Kamel, chief of Egypt’s General Intelligence Service and widely considered the nation’s second most powerful official, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of diplomatic talks. McGurk will later head to Doha, Qatar, to meet with Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.
Egyptian and Qatari leaders have been important players in hostage talks and helped broker a cease-fire in November during which Hamas released more than 100 people from captivity.
McGurk’s trip comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said once again that he would not meet Hamas’ demands of a withdrawal of Israeli forces in return for the release of hostages. “Let it be clear: I utterly reject the Hamas monsters’ capitulation terms,” Netanyahu said in a statement Sunday.
Israeli officials say about 240 people were taken hostage during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel led by Hamas, which also killed about 1,200 people. But divisions have emerged in Israel over the path forward, with some citizens protesting the government’s failure to secure the hostages’ release, including a group that gathered near Netanyahu’s Jerusalem home on Sunday, according to Israeli media. Doubts have also emerged among military leaders that fighting alone could achieve their safe return. Gadi Eisenkot, a former army chief who is serving in the war Cabinet, said in a television interview last week that it was an “illusion” to believe the hostages could be safely secured through military operations.
McGurk’s trip, which was previously reported by Axios, comes just days after Israel and Hamas agreed through Qatari intermediaries to allow medicine to be delivered to hostages in exchange for additional medicine and aid for civilians in Gaza.
But U.S. officials have said a new hostage release has been complicated by Hamas’ evident desire for a permanent cease-fire, rather than the kind of temporary pause that accompanied the releases in November.
Administration officials said the hostages were just one of several topics arising from the Israel-Hamas war that McGurk will address on his travels to the region. Netanyahu has also grown increasingly vocal in pushing back against Biden’s insistence that Israel ultimately negotiate the creation of a Palestinian state in exchange for guarantees of its own security.
Netanyahu publicly rejected the idea again this weekend, after speaking with Biden on Friday about the issue of a two-state solution, saying Sunday that all territory west of the Jordan River must be under “full Israeli security control.”

Local leaders in Cooch Behar and those in Calcutta spoke in different voices on who to blame for the vandalism.
Bengal Congress spokesperson Soumya Aich Roy blamed the Trinamul Congress. “This is how Trinamul is trying to stop the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Bengal. A violent party like Trinamul which is in cohorts with the BJP will not succeed,” he said in a statement, making it clear the state unit of the party was not willing to concede any ground to the ruling Trinamul in Bengal.
But the Cooch Behar district Congress president Robin Roy did not rule out the possibility of the local BJP’s hand behind the incident.
Rahul Gandhi, who was some 318 km away in Guwahati on Tuesday, was possibly unaware of a students’ wing leader in the north Bengal district lodging a police complaint or that other functionaries were openly blaming the ruling Trinamul over the vandalism.
Hours before the vandalism in Calcutta on Monday, Bengal chief minister and Trinamul supremo Mamata Banerjee had complained of not getting the respect she deserved in the multi-party alliance that has been cobbled together in last July to fight the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
The Wayanad MP’s unity march from Manipur to Mumbai will enter Bengal from Boxirhat in Cooch Behar from Assam on January 25.
The yatra has faced administrative obstacles in BJP-ruled states in the north-east, especially Manipur and Assam, where a belligerent chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma ordered the state DGP to lodge an FIR against him for provoking the crowd after after supporters broke barricades erected to prevent them from moving ahead.
North Bengal’s Cooch Behar could have been expected to offer friendlier ground to Rahul, given that both the parties are important constituents of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance. But the complaint followed by the accusations speak otherwise.
After Bengal, Rahul is expected to proceed towards Bihar’s Kishangunj by January 29. His yatra will take a two-day break on January 26 and 27. After the yatra is through Bihar Rahul will enter Murshidabad on February 1. On the same day, Mamata will leave for North Bengal.
“We have good ties with Mamata and her party, talks for seat-sharing are on,” Rahul said during an interaction with mediapersons in Assam on Tuesday. “Sometimes our leaders say something, sometimes their leaders say things. None of it will have any impact on the alliance,"" he added, indicating he was still optimistic of a seat sharing deal.
In Tuesday's meeting with Birbhum leaders, Mamata reportedly expressed her anger with the Congress.
""Didi said we are a part of INDIA and offered two seats. Sometimes they ask for eight to 12 seats. Sometimes even 14. This is absurd. We have to retain both the seats in Birbhum,"" said a Trinamul functionary.
On the ground, however, there has been little progress to show that the Congress and Trinamul are inching closer to an electoral understanding in Bengal.
Though Mamata has told various district units of the Trinamul to go it alone, especially the one in Murshidabad, the last proverbial bastion of the Congress in Bengal, she did betray her impatience with the Congress high command following her harmony rally on Monday.
“I suggested the name INDIA, but when I attend its meetings I see the CPM trying to call the shots. I am not given the respect I deserve. I will not take orders from those against whom I fought all my life,” Mamata had said on Monday at Calcutta’s Park Circus maidan.
While the Congress and the Trinamul have fought poll battles together in the past, Rahul and Mamata have never shared the dais. Not even in 2011 when the Trinamul and the Congress defeated the Left Front contesting together with Mamata leading from the front. Five years later, Rahul did share the dais with Mamata’s then bete noire and former Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the same Park Circus grounds when the Left and the Congress contested the 2016 Assembly polls together, unsuccessfully.
The electoral returns for both the Congress and the CPM have dwindled in subsequent elections.
Within Trinamul circles Mamata’s dislike for the Wayanad MP is well-known, though she still maintains close ties with Sonia Gandhi. Mamata’s digs at the Congress have usually been aimed at the younger Gandhi and not his mother.
“She is saying these things as excuses to make the contest in Bengal a bipolar one between the BJP and the Trinamul, like she did in 2019 and 2021. The CPM has been attending  INDIA meetings from Day One. Why didn’t she walk out then?” asked Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, state Congress president and Berhampore MP.
To those close to him, Chowdhury has made it clear that he would contest the polls as an Independent from Berhampore if he has to but will not go for any understanding with Mamata's Trinamul.
All the three political parties in Bengal, the Trinamul, the Congress and the CPM are partners in INDIA against the BJP. Neither the Congress nor the CPM has any representative in the state Assembly, while in Lok Sabha the Congress won two seats in 2019.
While the Bengal leaders have made it clear that they don’t want any alliance with the Trinamul, the Congress high command expects an  improved tally by joining forces with the Trinamul.
“We have been trying to convince the high command that any alliance with Trinamul will go against our interests. We will lose whatever little votes we still have to the BJP. But the high command feels there is a better chance of winning holding the hands of the Trinamul,” said a Congress leader.
Trinamul is ready to leave the two existing seats for the Congress out of the 42. Trinamul insiders said Mamata could agree to four seats though chances are dim.
The Bengal Congress on the other hand is ready for an alliance with either the Left or go it alone. However, in the case of any alliance with the Left how many seats they would ask for is not clear yet. The Congress is keen on seats in south Bengal as well and not just Murshidabad, Maldah and North Dinajpur.
“We are not waiting for any one. Our stand is very clear. Whoever is against the BJP and the Trinamul in Bengal can join us. Now it is for them to decide,” said Mohammad Salim, CPM state secretary."

It sells products made by prison inmates in the state instead of those manufactured by big industrial houses.
The first two of its outlets were inaugurated at the Beur Central Jail in Patna and Bhagalpur Central Jail. They boast of guaranteed pure, completely unadulterated — without the use of preservatives — as far as edible goods sold at the outlets.
Mustard oil, spices, snacks, jute and cotton handicraft items, household metal products and agriculture implements, wooden furniture, clothes, candles, leather goods and Madhubani paintings are some of the products available right now.
“A few things were always being made in the prisons in the state, but this is an effort by the Bihar government to ensure uniformity and better quality products under a brand name ‘Mukti’, which means freedom, and provide them a market. Many more stores will come up in the coming months,” Bihar home department additional chief secretary S. Siddharth told The Telegraph.
“The inmates are being trained on the entire production chain and state-of-the-art machines and equipment are being procured for manufacturing, processing and packaging. Some of the prisons had decrepit foreign-made machines and we are going to replace them,” Siddharth added.
The move’s ultimate aim is to provide skills to the inmates and make them capable to adjust with gainful employment in the society after being released from the prisons. The emphasis is to engage convicts who have been sentenced to rigorous imprisonment.
As far as the revenue generated is concerned, it would be spent on the welfare of the families of the inmates, while a part of it would go to the prisoner welfare fund.
“We are going to open three more Mukti Bazar stores at Purnia, Motihari and Muzaffarpur soon. The idea is to have one store in place in every commissionerate or prison circle in the state. Products manufactured in various prisons would be brought and sold at them. These are good quality, completely unadulterated products made in impeccable hygienic conditions and could give any commercial brand a run for its money,” IG prisons and correctional services Shirsat Kapil Ashok said.
At present, something or other is being manufactured in 39 out of the 59 prisons in the state. Around 500 to 1,000 inmates are engaged in each of them — directly or indirectly — in the production process.
Sharing the plans of the initiative, Ashok said that the manufacturing activities would be expanded to smaller jails and there could be a tie-up with Sudha, the dairy brand of Bihar’s cooperative milk federation, if the scale of production goes up.
A printing press is going to start at Bhagalpur central jail where all files, folders and stationery needed by the Bihar police could be printed. Similarly, bakeries could also be started at some of the prisons."

“Modi is expected to revisit much of what he said in Ayodhya on Monday. He had said Ram is India’s thought, law, norm and policy. He declared in his own fashion that Ram is the chief deity of India and Indians and indicated that he has given a magnificent Ram temple to the country. In fact, he has successfully merged religion and State and this is bound to reflect in the election campaign over the next two-three months,” a senior BJP leader said in Ayodhya on the condition of anonymity.
Chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited Bulandshahr on Wednesday and reviewed the arrangements at the Chandmari Ground, where Modi will address the rally. Adityanath also reviewed the security measures.
Government sources said the Special Protection Group had visited the spot and taken control of it while the local administration has declared the area a no-flying zone. Commandoes of the National Security Guard and over 80 administrative officers also reached Bulandshahr on Wednesday.
Shlok Kumar, senior superintendent of police of Bulandshahr, said: “We are deploying 5,000 policemen and 11 companies of paramilitary forces to maintain law and order. Over 80 administrative officers will be here to manage the security during the Prime Minister’s presence in the district.”
The 5,000 policemen will include 800 head constables, 500 woman police personnel, 100 inspectors and 1,000 sub-inspectors, he added.
Modi will also lay the foundation stone of Major Dhyan Chand University in Meerut and Kalyan Singh Government Medical College in Aligarh from Bulandshahr.
Munshi Lal, the assistant regional transport officer, said 2,000 private buses had been arranged to ferry those who would attend the Prime Minister’s meetings. “We have acquired 900 buses of schools and colleges in Bulandshahr and brought about 1,100 more from adjoining districts,” he said.
Vikas Chauhan, the district president of the BJP, said: “We are always in election mode but this time it is more important because Modi is coming here three days after opening the Ram temple in Ayodhya. It is obviously going to help the BJP win many seats from the east to the west.”
Dharm Pal, general secretary of the Uttar Pradesh unit of the BJP, said: “The people trust the BJP even more after the Ayodhya event. Our ancestors had sacrificed their lives for the Ram temple. Besides constructing the temple, the BJP government is also doing development work.”
Ayodhya woes
Devotees continued to have a tough time in Ayodhya on the second day of the opening of the shrine. The police blocked all the roads to Ram Path, where the temple is located, and prevented the devotees from reaching there.
“We have deployed 8,000 policemen near the temple today (Wednesday) to manage the situation. The crowd is less than yesterday and the arrangements are better. We have made four queues of pilgrims and are requesting them to have patience,” said Prashant Kumar, director-general of police (law and order).
President of the International Hindu Parishad, Praveen Togadia, visited the temple on Wednesday and claimed that Modi and home minister Amit Shah would pave the way for bigger temples in Mathura and Kashi (Varanasi).
“The PM and the home minister have the potential to scrap the Places of Worship Act, 1991, and build bigger temples in Mathura and Kashi,” said Togadia, a former Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader.
The Act ensures the maintenance of status quo at religious structures as they existed on August 15, 1947."

Hum aur kar bhi kya sakhte hain, sivaye dekhne ke. (Let things happen the way they are happening. What else can we do besides watching silently).""
The helplessness in the voice of Najafzafar Jilani, son of now-deceased senior advocate Zafaryab Jilani who argued the Ram Janmabhoomi case, overrode his efforts to sound indifferent when asked about his thoughts on the hoopla surrounding the scheduled Ram Mandir consecration on January 22.
“What can we do or say when there is a Supreme Court judgment that gives legitimacy to all that is happening,” Jilani murmured.
Jilani was referring to the landmark November 2019 Supreme Court verdict which ordered the disputed 2.77-acre plot in Ayodhya to be handed over a Central government trust on which the Ram Temple is being currently built and allot an alternative plot to build a mosque to replace the demolished Babri Masjid.
“Right now all we can do is wait and watch,” Jilani said. “We will keep a keen eye on the government’s moves after January 22 and then decide whether or not we have a course of action to follow,” he continued.
Careful about his utterances on what he considered a “sensitive issue”, Jilani avoided speaking his mind for fear of persecution. “We don’t want to say anything that might stoke a fresh controversy. The government would most certainly be filing cases and causing us harassment if it found our opinions not to their liking. We have had enough of those and want to steer clear of them now,” he said.
Asked whether he felt included in the so-called frenzy sweeping across significant parts of the country over the Pran Pratishtha ceremony of Ram Lalla, Jilani answered: “Of course, we feel left out, but we have kept our mouths shut for fear of government backlashes.”
His brief response to how he hoped to get roped back into the nation’s mainstream: “We don’t have a solution in sight.”
Syed Ilyas Qasim Rasool, former convenor of the now-defunct Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) was more forthcoming, though. Especially, when it came to questioning the Uttar Pradesh government’s role in the Pran Pratishtha ceremony.
“Why should the government get so deeply involved in a religious programme like this?” Rasool asked. “Shouldn’t it have been left entirely to the religious group concerned? It almost feels like the government has donned a particular religious colour with its full machinery deployed for the work. It defies the tenets of secularism enshrined in our Constitution and goes against the basic fabric of federalism,” he argued.
“The whole Ram Mandir movement has been done with political ambitions right from the start,” Rasool maintained. “Today that has become apparent even before the Shankaracharyas. Several priests from Ayodhya too have opposed the function. Only five people would be allowed inside the Ram Lalla Garbha Griha, four of whom are political Sangh Parivar political persons. The indications are there for all to see and interpret. This would be a one-party ceremony.”
Rasool believes that Apex Court judgment was laden with inherent contradictions which paved the way for Hindu groups to flock to courts of the land with similar petitions based on faith rather than facts. “The fundamental basis of the 2019 Supreme Court judgment was the rejection of the contention that the Babri Masjid was built after destroying a Ram Temple in that location. Despite the court not finding any scientific evidence to back that claim, it ruled in favour of the Ram Mandir petitioners,” the BMAC member said.
“It was a court decision which we have to adhere to. But justice wasn’t meted out,” he stated.
But unlike Jilani who feels “left out” and marginalized, advocate Iqbal Ansari, former Babri Masjid litigant, thinks the hatchet is already buried. Ansari has received an invitation for the consecration and confirmed to The Telegraph Online that he would be attending the ceremony. Setting an example of the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb, Ansari has already gifted a miniature replica of the Ram Temple to one of his aides.
“The Muslim community of this entire nation welcomed the judgment of the top court. Not one untoward incident was reported following the order. Not even a demonstration took place against it. There are no differences between the Hindus and Muslims anymore. The construction of the temple is almost complete and Lord Ram would be taking his position in it. I am happy the way things have turned out and the community too feels in the same way,” Ansari told reporters earlier this month following the receipt of invitation.
Ansari has, since, slammed the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board for failing to build a mosque at the alternate site despite the five-acre plot awarded to it by the Supreme Court four years ago while, instead, only managing to come up with a proposed layout.
Syed Ahmed Bukhari, Shahi Imam of the Jama Masjid in Delhi and currently traveling abroad, preferred to remain guarded about voicing his opinion. “This is their own religious affair. Everyone in this country has the freedom to follow the path dictated by their own religion,” Bukhari said in the form of a statement when approached for his views."

A bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and Ujjal Bhuyan deferred the matter as the bench was available only till lunch.
""List on January 31. High on board,"" the bench said.
Senior advocate C U Singh, appearing for Khalid, submitted that he was ready to argue but unfortunately this bench is rising after lunch.
The matter was listed along with a batch of petitions challenging various provisions of the UAPA.
Supreme Court judge Justice Prashant Kumar Mishra had on August 9 recused himself from hearing Khalid's plea.
Khalid's petition challenging the October 18, 2022 order of the Delhi High Court, which had rejected his bail plea in the matter, had come up for hearing before a bench of Justices A S Bopanna and Mishra.
The high court had rejected Khalid's bail plea, saying he was in constant touch with other co-accused and the allegations against him were prima facie true.
The high court had also said the actions of the accused prima facie qualified as ""terrorist act"" under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.
Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, and several others have been booked under the anti-terror law UAPA and several provisions of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly being the ""masterminds"" of the February 2020 riots, which left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.
The violence had erupted during the protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).
Khalid, arrested by the Delhi Police in September 2020, had sought bail on grounds that he neither had any criminal role in the violence nor any ""conspiratorial connect"" with any other accused in the case.
The Delhi Police had opposed Khalid's bail plea in the high court, saying the speech delivered by him was ""very calculated"" and he brought up contentious issues like Babri Masjid, triple talaq, Kashmir, the alleged suppression of Muslims and the CAA and NRC.

The 11 convicts surrendered before jail authorities late Sunday night, local Crime Branch inspector NL Desai said.
""They reached the jail before midnight of January 21, which was the deadline set for them to surrender,"" he said.
The top court on January 8 annulled the remission granted by the Gujarat government to the 11 convicts in the high-profile case while slamming the state for being ""complicit"" with an accused and abusing its discretion.
It ordered the convicts, who were released prematurely on Independence Day in 2022, to go back to jail within two weeks.
The apex court on Friday rejected pleas of the convicts for grant of more time to surrender and asked them to do so by Sunday.
The 11 convicts are Bakabhai Vohania, Bipin Chandra Joshi, Kesarbhai Vohania, Govind Nai, Jaswant Nai, Mitesh Bhatt, Pradeep Mordhiya, Radheshyam Shah, Rajubhai Soni, Ramesh Chandana and Shailesh Bhatt.
Bilkis Bano was 21 years old and five months pregnant when she was gang-raped while trying to escape the horror of the communal riots that broke out after the Godhra train burning incident in February 2002. Her three-year-old daughter was among the seven family members killed.
On August 15, 2022, the 11 convicts, who spent 14 years in jail as part of the life sentence, were granted premature release after the Gujarat government accepted their remission applications in accordance with its 1992 policy, citing their 'good conduct' during imprisonment.
The 11 convicts are residents of Singvad and Randhikpur villages in Singvad taluka of Dahod district near Panchmahal.
Quashing the remission order, the Supreme Court had ruled that the Gujarat government lacked jurisdiction to grant premature release to the convicts as the case trial was held in Maharashtra.
Days after the SC order, the convicts moved the top court seeking more time to surrender on various grounds such as failing health, impending surgery, son's marriage and harvesting ripe crops.
These applications were dismissed by the apex court on Friday with the observation that the reasons cited had no merit.

A kiosk each has come up at the departure and arrival levels and can be accessed through gate 3C of the terminal.
The kiosks, which became functional from Tuesday, have been installed by the Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate, in association with the NGO Caring Minds and the Indian Chamber of Commerce.
“These are passenger-friendly kiosks. Often, passengers don’t have the time to go to the police station to file a complaint. The kiosks will be of help in such cases,” said Minu Budhia, psychotherapist and founder of Caring Minds.
“There are often problems like bad behaviour by airport staff or co-passengers. If a person is catching a flight, he or she does not have the time to visit the police station and file a complaint.”
The police said the kiosks had been set up to help passengers report their complaints faster.
However, fliers can only lodge complaints related to policing with the kiosks.
“People can only register complaints that are related to policing, like missing luggage or any issue where the police can intervene. Issues that are handled by the airport, such as trolleys or cleanliness of washrooms, will not be addressed through the kiosks,” said Aishwarya Sagar, deputy commissioner (airport), Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate.
A senior officer attached to the project said once a complaint is lodged with a kiosk, the complainant will be mailed an acknowledgement letter.
“If the complaint is serious enough to deserve police intervention, the complainant will receive a call from the police. Then he or she will have to visit the NSCBI Airport police station to lodge a formal FIR,” the senior officer said.
The two kiosks are positioned near the two police assistance booths that are located in the section of the terminal that can be accessed through gate 3C.
The Telegraph recently ran a campaign on various problems faced by passengers at the Kolkata airport — such as dirty washrooms, car chaos in front of the terminal on the arrival level, harassment by taxi touts, unauthorised parking by VIP cars in front of the terminal on the arrival level and restricted access to Wi-Fi.
The police may have nothing to do with dirty washrooms or restricted Wi-Fi access, but complaints about taxi touts operating with impunity and unauthorised parking may warrant police intervention."

With the arrest of the man, who runs an import-export business in Nashik city, around 200km from Mumbai, the Maharashtra ATS has unravelled ""international links to ISIS support and funding"", he said.
According to the official, investigations so far have revealed he had transferred funds to the dreaded global terrorist group, also called Islamic State, three times in Syria, where the outfit has a presence.
Some associates of the accused, whose identity was not revealed by the ATS, are being probed across multiple states, he said.
Based on specific information, the ATS had registered an offence under relevant sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against the accused person and a team of the state police's anti-terror wing was monitoring his activities for the last several days, said the official.
During investigations, the ATS found the accused had been continuously communicating with a foreign entity associated with ISIS, an organization banned by the Government of India, the anti-terror agency said in a statement.
The engineer-cum-businessman, who showed signs of radicalization in recent years, actively supported ISIS by transferring funds to the foreign entity, the statement added.
The ATS conducted a search and seized electronic devices, including mobile phones, SIM cards, laptop and pen drive along with incriminating documents, it said.
The terror accused was placed under arrest after interrogation and produced before a court, which sent him to ATS custody till January 31, said the official.

Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said 21 soldiers were killed when two buildings they had mined for demolition exploded after militants fired at a nearby tank. Earlier, three soldiers were reported killed in a separate attack in southern Gaza.
“Yesterday we experienced one of our most difficult days since the war erupted,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. “In the name of our heroes, for the sake of our lives, we will not stop fighting until absolute victory.”
The deaths came amid the heaviest fight of 2024 so far, as the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) stormed the remaining parts of Khan Younis, the main city in the south of the enclave sheltering hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians.
“Over the past day, IDF troops carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Younis and deepened the operation in the area. The area is a significant stronghold of Hamas’ Khan Younis Brigade,” the military said. “Ground troops engaged in close-quarters combat, directed (air) strikes, and used intelligence to coordinate fire, resulting in the elimination of dozens of terrorists.”
Gazans say the Israeli forces, advancing west across the crowded city towards the Mediterranean coast since Monday, have blockaded and stormed hospitals, leaving the wounded and dead beyond the reach of rescuers.
At least 195 Palestinians were killed in the previous 24 hours, raising the documented toll to 25,490, according to Palestinian health officials, who say thousands more dead are feared lost in the rubble.
Bodies were being buried in the grounds of Khan Younis’s main Nasser hospital because it was unsafe to go to the cemetery. Another Khan Younis hospital, Al-Khair, was stormed by Israeli troops who arrested staff there, and a third, Al-Amal, run by the Palestinian Red Crescent, was unreachable, according to Palestinian officials. The Red Crescent said a tank shell had hit its headquarters on Amal’s fourth floor, a civilian had been killed at the entrance, and Israeli forces were firing from drones on anyone who moved nearby, making it impossible to dispatch ambulances for the entire Khan Younis area.
Israel says Hamas fighters operate in and around hospitals, making them targets.
Palestinians celebrated the Israeli losses as a victory, while Israelis spoke of them as a necessary sacrifice in a war against Hamas fighters who attacked Israeli towns on October 7, killing 1,200 people and capturing some 250 hostages, around half of whom remain in Gaza."

The research ship is thought to be mapping underwater formations and also keeping an eye on Indian naval activity in this part of the oceans.
The Xiang Yang Hong 3 is currently crossing through the Sunda Strait that connects the Java Sea and the Indian Ocean and showing its destination as Male, the Maldivian capital and main port.
The research vessel has possibly been forced to bypass Sri Lanka after that country started 2024 by announcing a ban on Chinese research ships for a year through 2024.
China designates vessels like the Xiang Yang Hong 3 as non-military ships but their primary purpose and research is almost certainly linked to military goals. Mapping the underwater formations in this region, for instance, is highly useful for any Chinese  submarines that might operate in these areas.
This particular vessel, the Xiang Yang Hong 3 has made two earlier long trips to the waters around India. In November 2019 it spent almost a month in the Bay of Bengal, surveying two areas called the Ninety East Ridge and the Cocos Basin area. Then in November 2020 it criss-crossed the Arabian Basin Area and the Carlsberg Ridge.
India is already facing a diplomatic contretemps in the Maldives and last week External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar held what was described as a ""frank conversation"" with his Maldivian counterpart Moosa Zameer at an international meeting in Kampala.
Zameer is said to have repeated the Maldivian demand that India should withdraw its 87 military personnel in the Maldives by March 15. It looks very unlikely that India will be willing to conduct such a withdrawal, especially at such short notice.
The new Maldivian President, Mohamed Muizzu, has also angered India by refusing to extend a pact that allows us to conduct hydrographic studies in the country’s waters. India has also installed a network of 10 radar stations in the Maldives.
In October-November last year, another Chinese research vessel the Shi Yan 6 docked in Colombo and conducted two days of research off the Sri Lankan coast. And in August 2022 there were strong protests from India when the Yuan Wang 5 docked at Hambantota, the Sri Lankan port given on a 99-year lease to China.
The naval rivalry between India and its allies and China is also hotting up in other ways. Last November five Chinese naval vessels including one submarine took part in joint exercises off the coast of Pakistan. And in mid-December an Indian naval ship took part in low-key exercises with the Philippines navy. The Philippines has been having regular standoffs with the Chinese in the South China Sea.
China is also flexing its muscles and showing that it intends to have a heightened presence in the Indian Ocean region in other ways. At a recent conference it talked about the China-Indian Ocean region, possibly showing how it has designs on the waters around India."

At a rally organised by the JD(U) here on the 100th birth anniversary of late Karpoori Thakur, Kumar made it clear that the highest civilian honour was ""fulfilment of only one of our many demands"".
""It has been long since I have been organising functions in the honour of Karpoori Thakur and writing letters to the Centre, be it the previous Congress regime or the current one, requesting Bharat Ratna for the Jan Nayak. The move is proof of the realisation that you cannot go far without respecting his contributions"", said Kumar, in an oblique reference to the BJP's attempt to make a dent in the JD(U)'s support base of extremely backward classes.
Kumar disclosed that before attending the rally, he had visited Karpoori Thakur's ancestral village in Samastipur as he ""has been doing for so many years on his birth anniversary"", where met the late leader's family members, including son Ramnath Thakur, the JD(U)'s national general secretary and leader in the Rajya Sabha, who was present on the dais.
""I was told by my brother Ramnath Thakur that the PM called him up (after announcement of Bharat Ratna). However, he did not bother to call me. I would like to extend my thanks to him, nonetheless, through the media persons present here. I would like to say to him, you may say that you took the step just like that, without taking into account what we did,"", said Kumar, the longest-serving CM of Bihar in his trademark style.
The JD(U) leader, who snapped ties with the BJP less than two years ago and has emerged as a key figure in the opposition INDIA bloc, also dropped hints that contrary to speculations in a section of the media, he did not consider the development as an ice-breaker which could pave the way for his return to the NDA in the foreseeable future.
""You all know that we have raised many demands before the Centre. Only one of them has been fulfilled with Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur. I wish that the needful is done with regard to other demands as well"", he said while addressing the rally.
Kumar's litany of grievances includes special status for Bihar, a country-wide caste census and central status to Patna University.
He also pointed out that it was ""Karpoori Thakur, who as Bihar chief minister ""recognised the Extremely Backward Classes as a separate category for the first time anywhere in the country and introduced quotas for them"".
""The EBCs are very poor and have a large population. We took that forward. I hope that the most backward classes would be identified across the country and targeted measures for their uplift will be taken,"" Kumar said.
The JD(U) supremo, who counts on the imposition of ban on liquor as a major step his government took nearly eight years ago, following demand from the state's women, also pointed out, ""It was Karpoori Thakur who first introduced prohibition in Bihar. But his government was toppled before completion of its term and sharaab-bandi was, subsequently, done away with"".

During the time the dispute surged and ebbed, Independent India had 14 Prime Ministers and Uttar Pradesh, 21 chief ministers.
The runup to the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, was politically volatile; it often plunged parts of the nation into violence, dozens of flashpoints of rioting and clashes. Alongside raged a monumental courtroom battle.
Witness statements comprised some 14,000 pages; 1,000 reference books and related documents filled out 21 steel cupboards. Through the course of the discord, the BJP, the political arrowhead of the Ayodhya temple movement, flourished. From 2 seats in the Lok Sabha in 1984 to 88 in 1989, 120 in 1991, 161 in 1996, 182 in 1998, 181 in 1999, 138 in 2004, 116 in 2009, 282 in 2014 and 303 in 2019.
A TIMELINE OF HOW WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THIS DAY
1858
Over two dozen Nihang Sikhs storm into Babri Mosque in Ayodhya and perform ‘havan’ (ritual), according to a police record. This is the first recorded attempt to stake a claim to the birthplace of Ram. Before this Hindus used to worship a spot outside the mosque as the birthplace of Ram. Post Nihang storming, Hindus began entering the mosque to worship.
1885
Mahant Raghubar Das, a monk of the Nirmohi Akhara sect, files a plea in Faizabad district court seeking permission to build a temple on the platform in the outer courtyard of the Babri Mosque. Court rejects the plea.

VHP performs shilanyas of the temple on land adjacent to the disputed site. Rajiv Gandhi opens poll campaign from Faizabad.
1989
The BJP for the first time joins the Ram temple movement. Party passes a political resolution at its Palampur session saying the dispute should be resolved through mutual dialogue between the two communities or, if this was not possible, through an enabling legislation. Asserts it is a matter of faith for Hindus and so litigation is in no way a solution for this matter.
1990 September
BJP stalwart L.K. Advani launches yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya, demanding construction of Ram temple.
L.K. Advani

Top BJP leaders, Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Nritya Gopal Das and Sadhvi Ritambara gave fiery speeches, vowing to build a Ram temple at the site where the mosque stood.
The kar sevaks later stormed the Babri Mosque and demolished the entire structure within a few hours, despite an assurance by the Kalyan Singh government to the Supreme Court that the mosque would not be harmed. The police did not fire on the kar sevaks.
1992 December
Two FIRs are filed in the case. One against unknown kar sevaks for the demolition and the other against BJP leaders Advani, Joshi, Uma Bharati and others for giving communal speeches before the demolition. All are later acquitted of charges.

The SC also ordered allocating 5 acres to Muslims in Ayodhya for building a mosque.
2020 February

Basu, a senior leader of the ruling Trinamool Congress, was talking about 'Hubba', a Bengali film on Shyamal Das known as ‘Hubba Shyamal’ who was killed in a gang fight in June 2011 in Hooghly district, his base. The movie was released last week.
""My political orientation did not influence the references made in the film. My intention has not been to target the then-ruling party in the state. I just touched on the issue,"" the education minister told PTI.
The acclaimed theatre personality said many Bollywood gangster films follow a pattern showing the politician-underworld nexus.
""I don’t believe in such a formula. If you watch international gangster films like Brazilian work 'City of God' or a South African film the name of which I cannot remember at this moment, there is no reference to any such nexus. Hubba followed that tradition,"" he said.
Basu said the idea to make a film on 'Hubba Shyamal' struck him when he read a book by IPS officer Supratim Sarkar, in which he had narrated the incidents of real-life criminals whom he had come across during his career.
""I read that book in between the shoots of my earlier film 'Dictionary' and decided to make a film on the life of Hubba - his rise, his family life. Though violence has been figured to a great extent in this film, that is not all,"" he said.
Hubba Shyamal was involved in the real estate business and he was not directly associated with any political party, said Basu who had met many people for his research on the project with the help of police sources.
Basu said he thought about casting Bangladeshi superstar Mosharraf Karim in the role of the gangster immediately after he decided to do the film.
""Mosharaf Karim is a versatile actor who delivered a power-packed performance in 'Dictionary'. I thought he would fit for the role,"" Basu said.
'Hubba' was also released in Bangladesh and is getting a good response there, as well as in West Bengal, he said.
It is an encouraging sign for film producers in both countries in the wake of the rising popularity of Bangladeshi actors like Karim after OTT came in a big way during Covid time, Basu said.

“No holiday will be declared,” Siddaramaiah said while talking to reporters in Tumkur on Sunday after participating in the fifth death anniversary commemoration of Lingayat seer Sree Sivakumara Swami.
When his attention was drawn to the fact that the central government had declared a half-day break for its employees across the country to watch the event live on television, Siddaramaiah said his government had already announced a special puja at state-managed temples in Karnataka.
The confirmation came a day after Siddaramaiah said “Let’s see”, even as state BJP president Vijayendra Yediyurappa on Saturday urged the state government to declare a holiday on Monday.
Siddaramaiah further said that he would be inaugurating a Ram temple in Mahadevapura in Bangalore on Monday, while the state-managed temples would conduct special pujas.
State minister for Muzrai (temple affairs), Rambling Reddy, had on January 7 announced that more than 34,000 temples managed by his department had been instructed to offer special puja to coincide with the consecration.
Reddy’s announcement followed Siddaramaiah extending support to the temple in Ayodhya by saying: “We are very happy that it (Ram temple) is being inaugurated (consecrated)… We are not against Ayodhya, nor against the construction of the temple...”
Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, R. Ashoka, reminded Siddaramaiah that it was not just the BJP that wanted a holiday. “It’s not we, but seven crore Kannadigas are seeking a holiday. So please allow the people to celebrate this happy occasion at every home in Karnataka,” he told reporters on Sunday.
BJP leader D.V. Sadananda Gowda commented: “I don’t know why Siddaramaiah is behaving like this. This is a huge event that will give a new strength to the Indian people.”"

The interlude in Heer Aasmani that begins at one-minute-21-seconds has similarities with the background score of Swat Kats: The Radical Squadron which aired on Cartoon Network in India back in the mid-’90s.
Swat Kats: The Radical Squadron follows two anthropomorphic cats, both trained fighter pilots, who turn into masked vigilantes to defend Megakat City from criminal masterminds and monsters.
Created by Christian Tremblay and Yvon Tremblay, the animated aerial action show was directed by Robert Alvarez.
The two-minute-33-second-long Heer Aasmani, presented as a rhythmic anthem celebrating air force officers and the power of friendship, introduces us to the members of the team, led by Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone, as they hang out around a bonfire.
Sung by Vishal Dadlani, Sheykhar Ravjiani and B Praak, Heer Aasmani is penned by Kumaar, known for songs like Rula Ke Gaya Ishq (2022), Dil Ki Aadat (2022) and the recent Dunki song Banda.
Fighter, directed by Pathaan helmer Siddharth Anand, is also an aerial action movie revolving around the heroics of Indian Air Force officers. Also starring Anil Kapoor and Karan Singh Grover,  the film is set to release theatrically on January 25."

In his letter to Shah on Tuesday night, Kharge said there have been several instances where the Assam Police has been found wanting in providing adequate security to Gandhi, who is entitled to Z+ security. Z+ is the highest level of security in India with a team of 55 armed personnel.
The letter comes after Congress leaders were booked for ""wanton acts of violence"" by the Assam Police.  On Tuesday, Assam Police registered a case against Gandhi and other Congress leaders for instigating a crowd to launch an attack on Guwahati police.
Police on Tuesday didn't allow the Gandhi-led Yatra to enter the city, triggering protests from irate Congress workers  who removed security barricades on the outskirts of the city.
Listing out the incidents during which security issues were faced by Gandhi, Kharge said on the first day of the Yatra in the state, Assam Police was found protecting the posters of the BJP in Amguri, Sibsagar district instead of ensuring safe passage for the Yatra.
The next day, “miscreants associated with the BJP” were caught defacing and taking down posters and hoardings of the Yatra in Lakhimpur district, he said.
Later, when the Yatra returned from Arunachal Pradesh, there was “another outrageous attack” on the Yatra in Sonitpur district, where the local Superintendent of Police happens to be the brother of Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Kharge said.
""He watched to see that BJP workers attacked and manhandled the Indian National Congress Social Media team, along with our General Secretary Shri. Jairam Ramesh. Shri Ramesh's car was attacked, while miscreants shouting anti-BJNY (Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra) slogans, tearing off the BJNY sticker on the vehicle, and attempting to throw water on the passengers inside,” the Congress chief said.
""On the same day in Sonitpur district, the BJP's district party workers approached and blocked Shri. Rahul Gandhi's convoy. The BJP's workers then physically assaulted the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee President Shri.Bhupen Borah, resulting in him bleeding profusely,"" he said.
On January 22, in Nagaon district, BJP workers blocked Gandhi's convoy, coming extremely close to him, and creating an extremely unsafe situation, Kharge alleged.
""In all of the troubling events mentioned above, the Assam Police has systematically stood by and/or allowed BJP workers to come closer and closer to the convoy of Shri. Rahul Gandhi, breaching his security cordon, and endangering his physical security and that of his team,"" Kharge said.
The Congress chief said none of the miscreants have been arrested even when there was ample evidence for all listed incidents, and added that in many instances investigation has not been initiated.
""As the risk increases, and as the Yatra proceeds as planned, we request your intervention to ensure that the Chief Minister of Assam and the Director General of Police, Assam ensure that no such untoward incident takes place which may lead to grave personal injury to Shri. Rahul Gandhi or any members of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,"" he said in his letter to Shah.
Sharing Kharge's letter, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X, ""Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge ji wrote to the Union Home Minister last night on the serious security issues faced by @RahulGandhi and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam over the past few days"".
The police case against Gandhi came after Sarma instructed Director General of Police G P Singh to register a case against the Congress leader for ""provoking the crowd"".
The bitter political duel between Sarma, once a staunch Congressman, and Gandhi, was out in the open with both leaders firing salvos at each other and the Congress blaming the state government for deliberately hindering its ex-chief’s yatra.
Sarma had quit the Congress in 2015, blaming Rahul Gandhi for his exit. The two have since clashed on many issues.
The Yatra would be in Assam till Thursday.

The missile dubbed ""Pulhwasal-3-31"" is currently under development and the test-firing had no impact on the security of neighbouring countries, the state media said, adding it had ""nothing"" to do with the regional situation.
The test was also part of the process of updating the country's weapon system, the report said, citing The Missile Administration.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it believed the firing was to test upgrades of existing missiles' capabilities.
On Wednesday, the South Korean military said the North had fired multiple cruise missiles towards the sea off its west coast at around 7 a.m. (2200 GMT on Tuesday) while Seoul's defence minister, Shin Won-sik, condemned the launches as a serious threat to his country.
""Strategic"" typically refers to nuclear-capable weapons.
North Korea carried out its first test of a cruise missile with possible nuclear strike capabilities in September 2021.
On Thursday, South Korea said it was starting mass production of medium-altitude reconnaissance drones with the goal of deploying them in 2027 to improve surveillance capabilities and contribute to defence exports.
North Korea's cruise missiles usually generate less interest than ballistic missiles because they are not explicitly banned by any U.N. Nations Security Council resolutions.
But analysts have said intermediate-range, land-attack cruise missiles were no less a threat than ballistic missiles and are a serious capability for North Korea.
Cruise missiles and short-range ballistic missiles that can be armed with either conventional or nuclear bombs are seen as particularly destabilising in the event of conflict as it can be unclear which kind of warhead they are carrying."

Calcutta chains, is in an advanced stage of discussion to acquire a restaurant chain focused on oriental cuisine.
The company, promoted by Anjan Chatterjee, has earmarked Rs 125 crore for the acquisitions. If the deals are struck, this would be the first inorganic move by the company in its journey over the last quarter of a century.
Speciality, which has 125 units under eight brands as of December 31, has signed a term sheet with at least one of the potential targets which operates about eight restaurants. “We are looking at a couple of targets. There is a Rs 200 crore cash sitting on the balance sheet. The plan is to deploy it judiciously rather than just earn interest income (from it),” Chatterjee said.
While the company added four new outlets under the Mainland China and Asia Kitchen by Mainland China brands in the last quarter, Chatterjee emphasised that expanding fine dine chains rapidly without compromising quality was not possible and hence the need for acquisitions.
Chatterjee, however, added his group would not look at growing unprofitably. The restaurants under the buy-out wish list are said to be profitable operationally and can be turned profitable at net level following integration after acquisitions. Speciality plans to retain the acquired brand and grow.
Even as Speciality is operating under multiple brands, formats and cuisines, it has chosen to focus mostly on the oriental space with Mainland China and Asian Kitchen brands which cumulatively contributed 41 per cent to the Rs 109.49 crore turnover in Q3FY24. The other significant brand under it is Oh! Calcutta. The company posted a PAT of Rs 14.15 crore.
Banquets
Chatterjee, who was in Calcutta at the inauguration of a banquet at Primarc Square, said Speciality is planning to expand in this space in the East. It has identified locations in Salt Lake, Rajarhat and Central Calcutta for three possible banquet locations.
“We have a lot of brand equity in the city, which can be capitalised on,” Chatterjee said. In a banquet, clients will have the option to choose from multiple cuisines (oriental, Indian and continental) and brands such as Mainland China, Sigree & Global Grill, Oh! Calcutta and Café Mezzuna.
Speciality intends to develop this as a separate business vertical, building on the catering business it had entered before the pandemic. Banquets are big revenue earners and profit centres for hotels in Calcutta, thriving on marriages and conferences.
The banquet at Primarc Square, named Nishtara, has been developed by Primarc Projects, where Speciality and Munna Maharaj will offer their catering services. Chatterjee said he plans to set up at least two restaurants in the property, including a Café Mezzuna on the 10th floor rooftop."

Jarange said two official delegations met him earlier in the day, but they had nothing new to offer. They were deliberating on the “same old points”, he said.
The activist, who set out on a march towards Mumbai from Jalna district on January 20 with thousands of supporters, is demanding that the state government grant quota to Marathas under the OBC grouping in jobs and education.
Jarange said he has been informed that a larger delegation would be coming to meet him. If that happens, the activist said, they will meet the delegation midway.
“We have not come here for fun. On behalf of the Maratha community, I appeal to CM Ekanth Shinde and deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar to come together for discussion and find a solution to the issue,” he said.
Asked if they have been granted permission by the Mumbai police to agitate at Azad Maidan in the city, Jarange said a stage is being erected there.
Earlier, addressing his supporters at Lonavala, Jarange asked them to keep calm and not get provoked, insisting that theirs is a peaceful protest.
He said two teams of officials, including one led by Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Divisional Commissioner Madhukar Ardad, met him earlier, but they had no new proposal.
Jarange has announced the launch of an indefinite hunger strike in Mumbai from January 26 if the state government fails to grant the reservation to Marathas in government jobs and education.
He claimed on Wednesday that 54 lakh records have been found in Maharashtra so far identifying members of the Maratha community as Kunbi (OBC sub-caste) and demanded immediate issuance of caste certificates.
Kunbis enjoy reservation in government jobs and admissions to educational institutes under the OBC category.
CM Shinde on Wednesday had appealed to members of the Maratha community not to stage protests saying the government was thinking positively about their quota demand.
Speaking about an ongoing survey by the state Commission for Backward Classes to assess the social, economic and educational backwardness of the Maratha community, Shinde said 1.5 lakh people were working in three shifts.
The CM had last month said that a special session of the state legislature would be held in February 2024, if necessary, to provide reservation to the Maratha community.

Addressing his first public meeting on the 7th day of 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' in Barpeta district, the Congress leader slammed Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and termed him the ""most corrupt CM"" of the country with a series of allegations related to land and areca nut.
""I don't know how Himanta Biswa Sarma got the idea that he can intimidate me by filing cases. File as many cases as you can. File 25 more cases, I am not going to be intimidated. BJP-RSS can't intimidate me"", he added.
The Guwahati Police on Tuesday suo motu registered an FIR against Gandhi and other leaders for wanton acts of violence in the state capital.
""I gave a speech against (Narendra) Modi's special friend (Gautam) Adani and case was filed against me. Then threw me out of parliament and took away my government residence. I gave the keys myself, I don't want it.
""My home is in the heart of every Indian citizen, I live there. I have lakhs of houses in Assam, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and all other states,"" Gandhi said amidst a huge round of applause from the public.
Alleging that a series of corruption is taking place in Assam, the Congress leader termed Sarma as the ""most corrupt CM"" in the country.
""While he (Sarma) speaks to you, he steals your land. While you chew betel nut, he corners the supari business. He steals money from your pocket. He has taken land in Kaziranga National Park also"", the Congress leader added.
Referring to the media conglomerate owned by the wife of Assam Chief Minister, Gandhi alleged that TV media shows what Sarma wants in the state.
""Sarma is controlled by Amit Shah. If anyone says anything against Amit Shah, he is thrown out by Sarma within two minutes. Tarun Gogoi was also a CM, but he did what Assam wanted. Tarun Gogoi was my guru, but I never told him what to do,"" he claimed.
Showing the 'Gamocha' (Assamese scarf), a symbol of the culture and identity of Assam, wrapped around his neck, Gandhi said the ruling dispensation is insulting the pride of the state.
""The BJP-RSS wants to wipe out the language, culture and history of Assam. They want to end the education given by your ancestors. They want to run Assam from Nagpur, but we will not allow it. Assam will be run from Assam only"", he added.
The Congress MP also alleged that the hearts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Sarma are ""filled with hatred"".
""HBS (acronym for Himanta Biswa Sarma) wakes up with hatred in his heart. He hates all the people in the world. He speaks hatred and fear for 24 hours. The fight is not against him, but the hatred in his heart,"" he added.
Stating that hatred can't defeat hatred, Gandhi appealed to everyone to use love to eradicate hatred.
""Fear hides behind hatred. These people spread hatred and fear, and we spread love. BJP-RSS fight one religion with another religion, one language with another language.
""We spoke to millions of people in 'Bharat Jodo Yatra'. Everyone told us that hatred won't work in India, love works here. This is the country of love"", he added.
Gandhi alleged that the BJP-RSS ideology has burned Manipur for several months now with people still being killed and houses set ablaze, but the Prime Minister of the country has not visited the state till date.
The Yatra, led by the Congress MP, commenced from Manipur on January 14 and will culminate on March 20 in Mumbai.
The Assam leg of the march, which started on January 18, will continue till January 25. It will travel 833 km in 17 districts.
The Yatra plans to cover 6,713 km in 67 days while passing through 110 districts in 15 states.

Kolkatans are travelling almost in every possible direction this week, thanks to the long weekend owing to Republic Day, which is a Friday, and a couple of other factors.
Reports of a fresh surge in Covid cases from several countries and also from within India had left the travel industry apprehensive, but hotel and flight bookings have shown that the virus has failed to curb the wanderlust of residents of the city, said tour operators.
The spate of travels have pushed up air fares in some sectors.
According to travel agents, round-trip air fares for Bangkok on some flights in the next couple of days was more than Rs 30,000 on Tuesday afternoon. The usual round-trip fare on the Kolkata-Bangkok route is Rs 20,000.
A one-way ticket from Kolkata to Delhi in the next two days cost more than Rs 8,000 on Tuesday afternoon. The usual fare varies between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000.
Ishwar Ahuja, a businessman from Kolkata, will fly to Thailand on a week-long tour on Thursday with his wife and two sons.
“The first five days will be leisure travel. Then I will travel to Phuket for two days to plan my nephew’s destination wedding, which we want to organise there in March,” said Ahuja.
“I planned this travel because of the long weekend.”
Travel agents said waiver of visa fees for Indians by Thailand and Malaysia has also boosted travel from the city.
Apart from the long weekend, travel has received a boost from the ongoing wedding season.
City-based businessman Amardeep Singh Chandok has gone to Rajasthan to attend a destination marriage of a family friend.
“Around 100 people from Kolkata are attending the ceremony. Around 35 people of them have come by train and the rest by flight,” Chandok told The Telegraph from Jaipur over the phone on Tuesday.
The groom is from Kolkata and the bride from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 flew to Jaipur from the city to attend the wedding, which was taking place at a palace near Jaipur.
The consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya is another factor that is driving Kolkatans’ urge to travel. After the Pran Pratishtha ceremony of Ram Lalla on Monday, thousands of devotees thronged the Ayodhya temple on Tuesday.
“I have booked rooms in several hotels in Ayodhya for people who traveled there from Kolkata over the past few days. From Ayodhya, many will travel to Delhi and other places,” said a travel agent in Kolkata.
Air India Express is operating a daily flight between Kolkata and Ayodhya.
A spokesperson for the airline said the response was “very good” for the flight.
“We had apprehensions that if there is a fresh surge in Covid cases, travel would take a hit. But the huge number of people from Kolkata leaving for various destinations have made us feel hopeful,” said Anil Punjabi, a member of the national committee of the Travel Agents Federation of India (TAFI) representing the eastern region.
An official of a private airline said their flights this weekend were full for several destinations, including Bangkok, Delhi and Bagdogra.
Raktim Roy of Dolphin Travels said those who wanted to travel to nearby places opted for Purulia and Santiniketan.
“We have a high demand for booking hotels in these places,” he said."

“Tonight’s results confirm Donald Trump has all but locked up the Republican nomination, and the election denying, anti-freedom MAGA movement has completed its takeover of the Republican Party,” Biden-Harris 2024 Campaign Manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement.
Rodriguez said Trump is offering Americans the same extreme agenda that has cost Republicans election after election: promising to undermine American democracy, reward the wealthy on the backs of the middle class, and ban abortion nationwide.
“Joe Biden sees things differently. He’s fighting to grow our economy for the middle-class, strengthen our democracy, and protect the rights of every single American. While we work toward November 2024, one thing is increasingly clear today: Donald Trump is headed straight into a general election matchup where he’ll face the only person to have ever beaten him at the ballot box: Joe Biden,” she said.
“We acknowledge the outcome of the New Hampshire primary, where Donald Trump has seemingly secured the Republican nomination. It reflects the prevailing influence of the MAGA movement within the Republican Party,"" said Democratic community leader Ajay Bhutoria in a separate statement.
""In contrast to Trump's agenda, which has faced criticism for undermining democracy and prioritising the wealthy over the middle class, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have demonstrated a commitment to economic growth, job creation, and restoring American leadership on the world stage,"" he said.
""It is increasingly evident today that Donald Trump is poised for a general election showdown. He will face the only individual who has previously triumphed over him at the ballot box: Joe Biden. And Indian Americans and South Asians remain steadfast in our support for the Biden-Harris campaign and their vision for a stronger, more inclusive America,"" he said.

Chinese Ministry of National Defence spokesperson Senior Colonel Wu Qian made the remarks at a media briefing here in response to a question on External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's reported statement that China violated the bilateral consensus in 2020 and assembled a large number of military forces along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), resulting in the conflict in the Galwan Valley.
The India-China relations remained frozen since May 2020 when the People's Liberation Army (PLA) amassed troops in eastern Ladakh that led to a deadly clash between the two militaries at the Galwan Valley in June 2020, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese military personnel.
Wu repeated Beijing's claim that the Galwan Valley lies on the Chinese side of the western sector along the LAC and the relevant incident happened when the Indian side violated the consensus and made unilateral provocations. ""Therefore, the responsibility entirely lies with the Indian side,"" he said.
India is pressing the PLA to disengage from the Depsand and Demchok areas. While India has maintained that there cannot be restoration of normalcy in its relations with China as long as the state of the borders remains abnormal, China continues to press India to delink the border issue and bilateral relations and work for normalcy.
Wu said in the past three years, China and India have maintained communication and coordination through military and diplomatic channels.
The two militaries held 20 rounds of Corps Commanders level meetings and agreed to disengage from four points mainly the Galwan Valley, the Pangong lake, Hot Springs and Jianan Daban (Gogra) contributing to the de-escalating tension along the border, he said.
""The border dispute,"" Wu said, ""is a legacy with India but that does not represent the whole picture of the bilateral relations."" 	 ""Therefore, it is unwise and inappropriate for the Indian side to link the border issue with the overall relations. It goes against the shared interests of the two countries.
""We hope the Indian side can work with the Chinese side to enhance strategic mutual trust, properly handle differences and safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas,"" he said.
When asked about the next Corps Commander Level Meeting, Wu said the ministry will release the information in due course.

ASLWA7UXSO_P1P3UQ7TOPMP34B,"Colonialism persists: Nobel laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah cites conflicts in West Asia, Africa","Debraj Mitra Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 06:20 AM","Debraj Mitra Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 06:20 AM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/my-kolkata/news/colonialism-persists-nobel-laureate-abdulrazak-gurnah-cites-conflicts-in-west-asia-africa/cid/1995743,"Colonialism is not merely a thing of the past but continues to shape the world, 2021 literature Nobel laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah said on Tuesday.
“To say it (colonialism) is over is not to understand the causes or so much of the conflict that is going on in the world now — in Africa, in the Middle East (West Asia). Many of these conflicts arose out of decisions made for the administrative convenience of the colonising powers,” said Gurnah, a Tanzanian-born British novelist and academic, who was the guest of honour at the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet, in association with the Victoria Memorial Hall and The Telegraph.
The first session — A Life in Writing — of the festival saw Gurnah in conversation with writer-editor Nilanjana S. Roy.
Roy said her generation and those that followed grew with the idea that colonialism was a thing of the past until they were “corrected” by Gurnah’s writings. “What is it that we miss out on when we think of colonialism as an empire or a thing of the past?” she asked.
Gurnah, whose novels include Paradise (1994), By the Sea (2001) and Desertion (2005), spoke of multiple forms of colonialism.
“There are forms of colonialism that we see being replayed right now in Europe itself. The Russian form of colonialism is just colonising the adjacent cultures and societies. That particular form of European colonialism, the one that crossed the seas and went to strange areas, it transformed the world. We can’t say what is done can be undone.... Borders cannot be changed. Nobody wants to give up a tiny inch of land. But, these borders do not make sense in many cases and are often the cause of conflict.
“Look what is happening now in formerly French territories of West Africa. The French did not actually leave. They kept their bases, they kept their currency and they made sure that dependency continued. How can we say that colonialism is over with these events taking place in our time?” he said.
Gurnah was born in the Sultanate of Zanzibar and moved to the UK in 1967 as a refugee during the Zanzibar Revolution.
He was awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize for Literature for his “uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism and the fates of the refugee in the gulf between cultures and continents”. He is also the Emeritus Professor of English and postcolonial literatures at the University of Kent.
His session saw a full house at the Son Et Lumiere of the Victoria Memorial. After it was over and he agreed to sign copies of his books, a long and snaking queue took shape at the bookstall.
When the house was opened for questions, a member of the audience asked Gurnah about the change in England’s immigration policy from the time Gurnah went there.
The British government stands accused of being markedly hostile towards migrants, especially those arriving on small boats.
“How do you look at this? From a country that colonised the world, benefitted disproportionately from it, to be able to stop people from coming into their country for their benefit,” the man asked.
Gurnah spoke of a “design” to keep out migrants in today’s England.
“I think it is different. I went to England in 1967. Pretty soon after that, there was the infamous Rivers of Blood (an inflammatory and divisive speech made by a parliamentarian, Enoch Powell, on April 20, 1968). We think of the speech not because it was the worst thing. But he was echoing something that was going on in the country. You would be amazed to know how many people actually embraced that, from all sorts of different political positions,” said Gurnah.
“On the other hand, there was a kind of gentleness about the way the authorities dealt with strangers or migrants. Now, there is a profound hostility. Not only because of the changes in the law but there is a design now to keep people out even when there is a good reason to allow them. It is a really different atmosphere about the welcome that strangers might receive,” he said."
AU2XOXHOBA_TZSQKZDXTBDFALP,Israel fends off charge of genocide: Jerusalem declassifies cabinet decisions,"Patrick Kingsley Jerusalem Published 26.01.24, 07:20 AM","Patrick Kingsley Jerusalem Published 26.01.24, 07:20 AM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/israel-fends-off-charge-of-genocide-jerusalem-declassifies-cabinet-decisions/cid/1996249,"Israel has declassified more than 30 secret orders made by government and military leaders, which it says rebut the charge that it committed genocide in the Gaza Strip, and instead show Israeli efforts to diminish deaths among Palestinian civilians.
The release of the documents, copies of which were reviewed by The New York Times, follows a petition to the International Court of Justice by South Africa, which has accused Israel of genocide. Much of South Africa’s case hinges on inflammatory public statements made by Israeli leaders that it says are proof of intent to commit genocide.
Part of Israel’s defence is to prove that whatever politicians may have said in public was overruled by executive decisions and official orders from Israel’s war cabinet and its military’s high command.
The court, the UN’s highest judicial body, began hearing arguments in the case this month and is expected to provide an initial response to South Africa’s petition — in which it could call for a provisional ceasefire — as soon as Friday.
Since October, Israel has pounded Gaza in a campaign that has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, or roughly 1 in 100 residents of the territory, according to health officials in Gaza; displaced nearly 2 million people; and damaged the majority of the buildings, according to the UN. The campaign is a response to a Hamas-led assault that led to the deaths and abductions of roughly 1,400 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.
The Genocide Convention of 1948, which South Africa has accused Israel of violating, does not define genocide solely as killing members of a particular ethnic or national group. Crucially, it says the killings must be committed “with intent to destroy” that group.
“Everything hinges on intent,” said Janina Dill, a professor at Oxford University and co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict.
To that end, both South Africa and Israel are focused not only on what leaders and soldiers have done but also on what they have said. The roughly 400-page defence includes what Israel says is evidence that it sought a legal war with Hamas and not a campaign of genocide against the Palestinians.
Among the declassified Israeli documents are summaries of Cabinet discussions from late October, in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered supplies of aid, fuel and water to be sent to Gaza. He also instructed the government to examine how “external actors” might set up field hospitals to treat Palestinians, as well as consider mooring a hospital ship off the coast of the territory.

State JD(U) president Umesh Singh Kushwaha made the statement, refuting rumours that his party, headed by the chief minister, was thinking of a return to the BJP-led NDA.
""All is well in Bihar's ruling Mahagathbandhan and the media speculations are driven by some agenda,"" Kushwaha told reporters.
He also said, ""I met the CM yesterday as well as today. It is a routine affair. There is no truth in the rumours doing the rounds. We also reject the rumours that party MLAs have been asked to rush to Patna"".
He also made light of Kumar and his deputy Tejashwi Yadav, who is in RJD, sitting far from each other at the Republic Day parade, asserting that ""we are firmly with INDIA coalition"".
Kushwaha, however, said, ""We want the Congress, which is our alliance partner, to do some introspection with regard to its stance towards other constituents and sharing of seats. Our leader Nitish Kumar has for long been stressing on the need for early finalisation of seat-sharing deal so that we could concentrate on Lok Sabha polls"".
The statement of the JD(U) leader came in the backdrop of two opposition bloc INDIA partners, TMC and AAP, ruling out the possibility of a truck with the Congress in West Bengal and Punjab respectively.
To a pointed query about his party's return to the NDA, which it had junked less than two years ago, the JD(U) leader said, ""these are rumours spread by those with some agenda"".
Kushwaha was also asked about social media posts of Rohini Acharya, daughter of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, in which she appeared to have taken a swipe at Kumar.
The JD(U) leader replied, ""We take no notice of that because Rohini Acharya is not an RJD office-bearer"".
Meanwhile, when asked about the delay in seat-sharing in the opposition bloc INDIA, state Congress president Akhilesh Prasad Singh asked, ""why nobody asks about the BJP-led NDA? They, too are yet to sort out sharing of seats with allies"".
Replying to another query, he said, ""Nitish Kumar is our leader in Bihar. I have no idea from where rumours of his going back to NDA have emanated."""

The AAP is organising shobha yatras and bhandaras in different parts of the national capital to celebrate the 'Pran Pratistha (consecration)' ceremony.
In a post in Hindi on X, Kejriwal said he participated in bhandaras organised in different areas of Delhi.
""Hearty congratulations and best wishes to all of you on this sacred occasion of the installation of Maryada Purushottam Lord Shri Ram in the grand temple. Hail Siya Ram,"" he said in another post.
The new Ram Lalla idol was consecrated at the Ayodhya temple on Monday, an event led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and watched by lakhs of people on television at their homes and in temples across the country.
""Our Ram has come,"" Modi said in his address that followed the consecration, which also marked the temple's inauguration.
In Delhi, Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj participated in a 'Sundar Kand' recital at Sheikh Sarai.
""On the auspicious occasion of the 'Pran Prathistha' at the Ram temple, I had the privilege of attending the 'Sundar Kand' recital organised at Sheikh Sarai 2. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has organised shobha yatras and 'Sundar Kand' recitals in every ward of Delhi. Jai Siya Ram,"" he said in a post in Hindi on X.
His Cabinet colleague Atishi participated in a puja and havan on the occasion.
In a post in Hindi on X, she said, ""On the auspicious occasion of the 'Pran Pratishtha', I performed a puja and havan of Lord Shri Ram. Shri Ram is present in every particle of this world and in the mind of every human being. If we adopt the ideals of Maryada Purushottam (Lord Ram) in our personality, then life will be blessed. Jai Shri Ram."" 	Other party leaders will also hold events during the day.
The Delhi government's three-day Ramlila at ITO's Pearey Lal Bhawan will culminate in the evening.
Modi on Monday said Lord Ram will no longer live in a tent but reside in a magnificent temple.
Addressing a gathering after the consecration ceremony, Modi said, ""Today, our Ram has arrived. After a long wait for ages, our Ram has arrived."" 	The prime minister said he could still feel the divine vibrations he experienced during the ceremony inside the temple's sanctum sanctorum.
""Our Ram Lalla will no longer live in a tent. Our Ram Lalla will stay in a magnificent temple,"" Modi said.
The AAP has planned a series of events -- from shobha yatras to bhandaras, 'Sundar Kand' recitals to aartis -- across Delhi's 70 assembly constituencies to mark the consecration ceremony.

Later at night, Sarma tweeted that an FIR had been registered against Rahul and Congress leaders K.C. Venugopal and Kanhaiya Kumar for ""wanton acts of violence, provocation, damage to public property and assault on police personnel"".
The Congress leaders prevented the situation from getting out of hand by reverting to the officially assigned Yatra route. The police, too, exercised restraint to avert an escalation of the situation.
Going by the videos shared by the Congress, the fracas reflected the growing bitterness between the ruling BJP and the Opposition since the Yatra started its Assam leg on January 18. A few Congressmen and cops were hurt in the fracas and traffic on the busy NH37 was disrupted for close to an hour.
Several Congress leaders told The Telegraph that they forcefully removed the barricades not to enter the city but to register their protest against the hurdles the BJP-led government had put up to derail the peaceful Yatra.
The roadblocks included the denial of permission for grounds, padyatras and a visit to Batadrava Than, attacks on Congress leaders and supporters and intentionally organising government events linked to welfare schemes in districts through which the Yatra was scheduled to pass, the Congress said.
Responding to the allegations, a BJP leader said the chief minister had already said he would not allow the Yatra through the city as it would lead to traffic disruptions.
“Today, the Congressmen broke the barricades and created a law and order situation. Policemen had to retaliate in which a few Congressmen and policemen were injured. Moreover, Rahul Gandhi was not allowed to visit Batadrava Than because the management committee wanted him to visit after 3pm, expecting a rush of devotees on the occasion of the Ram temple inauguration in Ayodhya on Monday. The attacks, we have heard, have been carried out by former Congressmen.”
The BJP leader added: “Permission to use college and school fields during the Yatra was denied because the institutions are open. Government events are pre-decided, not fixed overnight. They are doing all this to garner political mileage.”
Both camps have engaged in personal attacks, with Rahul repeatedly accusing Sarma of being the most corrupt chief minister of the country and the BJP leader responding by accusing the Gandhi family of being the most corrupt in India.
Congressmen maintain that Sarma had been at his “provocative best” even before the Yatra entered the state. “Yes, the bitterness is growing but we are not to be blamed. Our people are also hurt by the treatment dished out to us. There were no problems in other states before entering Assam. Why?” a Congress leader said.
After the forceful removal of the barricades on Tuesday, Sarma posted on X: “These are not part of Assamese culture. We are a peaceful state. Such ‘Naxalite tactics’ are completely alien to our culture. I have instructed @DGPAssamPolice to register a case against your leader @RahulGandhi for provoking the crowd & use the footage you have posted on your handles as the evidence. Your unruly behaviour and violation of agreed guidelines have resulted in a massive traffic jam in Guwahati now.”
‘Intimidation’
Addressing the gathering from his bus top at the site of the fracas, Rahul said they had broken the barricades “but will not break the law”, reiterating that rallies of BJP president J.P. Nadda and the Bajrang Dal had been allowed to take the same route.
He said the Congress did not fear anybody and would defeat the BJP-RSS in Assam.
Praising the policemen on duty for doing their job, he said the Congress was not against them but against the “most corrupt chief minister” of the country.
At a media interaction held later at Hajo, about 40km from the city, before the Yatra proceeded to Barpeta in Lower Assam, Rahul said Sarma’s actions against the Yatra were eventually benefitting it.
“The publicity we are getting we would not have got otherwise. By doing this (putting up hurdles), the Assam chief minister and Union home minister Amit Shah are helping us. The Yatra has now become the main issue in Assam... by stopping me from going to the mandir (Batadrava Than), by stopping me from going to a college (USTM), stopping the padyatra. This is their style. Intimidation tactics. We don’t get intimidated. We are not scared of them. Our message of Nyay is reaching the people...”
He said there was “massive unemployment, massive corruption, massive price rise, farmers are struggling and no youth can get a job in this state. These are the issues we are raising and we are being very successful at it”."

The decision follows the US and Britain, with support from other nations, striking military targets of the Iran-aligned group which has been launching attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea that is says are linked to Israel.
The US government last week also returned the group to a list of terrorist groups as Washington tries to stem attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea. The Houthis have said their attacks are in solidarity with the Palestinians as Israel strikes Gaza.
“The ministry ... would like to stress that you must inform officials and workers with US and British citizenships to prepare to leave the country within 30 days,” said a letter sent by the Houthi foreign ministry to the UN’s acting humanitarian coordinator in Yemen, Peter Hawkins.
The letter also ordered foreign organisations to not hire American and British citizens for Yemen’s operations.
Houthi top negotiator Mohammed Abdulsalam confirmed the letter’s authenticity to Reuters. The office of Hawkins, who is himself a UK national, did not respond to a request for comment. The US and British embassies in Yemen did not respond to a request for comment."

It sells products made by prison inmates in the state instead of those manufactured by big industrial houses.
The first two of its outlets were inaugurated at the Beur Central Jail in Patna and Bhagalpur Central Jail. They boast of guaranteed pure, completely unadulterated — without the use of preservatives — as far as edible goods sold at the outlets.
Mustard oil, spices, snacks, jute and cotton handicraft items, household metal products and agriculture implements, wooden furniture, clothes, candles, leather goods and Madhubani paintings are some of the products available right now.
“A few things were always being made in the prisons in the state, but this is an effort by the Bihar government to ensure uniformity and better quality products under a brand name ‘Mukti’, which means freedom, and provide them a market. Many more stores will come up in the coming months,” Bihar home department additional chief secretary S. Siddharth told The Telegraph.
“The inmates are being trained on the entire production chain and state-of-the-art machines and equipment are being procured for manufacturing, processing and packaging. Some of the prisons had decrepit foreign-made machines and we are going to replace them,” Siddharth added.
The move’s ultimate aim is to provide skills to the inmates and make them capable to adjust with gainful employment in the society after being released from the prisons. The emphasis is to engage convicts who have been sentenced to rigorous imprisonment.
As far as the revenue generated is concerned, it would be spent on the welfare of the families of the inmates, while a part of it would go to the prisoner welfare fund.
“We are going to open three more Mukti Bazar stores at Purnia, Motihari and Muzaffarpur soon. The idea is to have one store in place in every commissionerate or prison circle in the state. Products manufactured in various prisons would be brought and sold at them. These are good quality, completely unadulterated products made in impeccable hygienic conditions and could give any commercial brand a run for its money,” IG prisons and correctional services Shirsat Kapil Ashok said.
At present, something or other is being manufactured in 39 out of the 59 prisons in the state. Around 500 to 1,000 inmates are engaged in each of them — directly or indirectly — in the production process.
Sharing the plans of the initiative, Ashok said that the manufacturing activities would be expanded to smaller jails and there could be a tie-up with Sudha, the dairy brand of Bihar’s cooperative milk federation, if the scale of production goes up.
A printing press is going to start at Bhagalpur central jail where all files, folders and stationery needed by the Bihar police could be printed. Similarly, bakeries could also be started at some of the prisons."

Police and paramilitary forces had to use force to control the massive crowds that thronged the temple after over 8,000 VIPs left the town with memories of being the privileged first to offer prayer there and receive prasad.
Security personnel seen behaving politely with the visitors till Monday turned into baton-wielding troops on Tuesday, forcing many devotees to run away without paying obeisance at the temple. Some devotees were lifted by their arms and legs and removed from the spot.
Rahul Barman from East Burdwan in Bengal, who had to leave Ayodhya without offering prayers at the Ram temple, said: “On Monday, the policemen were extremely polite and smiled when advising us to avoid coming on Ram Path (in front of the temple), but on Tuesday their cordiality had vanished and their baton was speaking.”
“I am going to Varanasi today (Tuesday) to offer prayer at Kashi Vishwanath temple and will be back to Ayodhya in February to see the Ram temple,” said Barman, whose relative lives in Varanasi, said.
“In Ayodhya, I slept on the floor of an under-construction shopping complex along Ram Path, waiting for the temple to open for us. The security personnel used to check the place but didn’t misbehave with me or any other devotee who had got shelter there,” Barman said.
Barman added: “Today (Tuesday) morning, they came and asked us not to sleep there in the night because we were security threats to the leftover VIPs who would visit Ayodhya.”
Shorty after resorting to lathi-charge to dispel the crowd, some policemen were seen standing on two elevated platforms at the main gate of the temple and announcing on hand-held loudspeakers that the devotees shouldn’t be desperate to enter the temple and stand in queues with patience.
“They were allowed to enter the temple from 6.30am to 11.30am, but we used mild force thereafter to control the crowd. The temple was also closed at that time and reopened at 2.30pm,” said a police officer who didn’t want to be named.
“We have no option because the VIPs are more desperate than the common pilgrims to visit the temple. Every time, we are forced to block the road on both sides of Ram Path along the temple and make arrangements for the entry of the VIPs. Many senior officers from Lucknow arrived here today with their families and offered prayers at the temple. How should we manage the crowd?” the officer said.
Piyush Mordia, the additional director-general of police who is in charge of security in Ayodhya, said: “There is no problem here. People are going to the temple smoothly. Those who were standing in lines since morning have already come out after offering prayers there. There is a big crowd here and we want them not to lose patience.”
Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited Ayodhya and held a meeting with the officers on the temple premises. He later said: “We appeal to the devotees to visit Ayodhya after a week.”
Satyendra Das, the head priest of the temple, said: “About 50,000 devotees offered prayers at the temple by Tuesday afternoon. This number may go up to three lakh per day.”"

The echoes of the 19th-century Bengal Renaissance, marked by personalities like Rabindranath Tagore, resonate through the city’s streets, symbolising an enduring legacy. Kolkata remains a lively centre for literary endeavours, evidenced by its celebrated festivals and ongoing contributions to southeast Asia’s literary landscape.
In the ongoing chapter of this literary saga, Kolkata hosts its 47th International Book Fair at Central Park, Salt Lake. This annual event serves as a meeting ground for global and regional literary voices, fostering cross-cultural exchanges. Simultaneously, the Kolkata Literary Meet at the iconic Victoria Memorial enhances intellectual vibrancy, providing a dynamic platform for discussions on literature. This coinciding of events underscores Kolkata’s unwavering commitment to nurturing literary ethos that transcends borders, creating a pivotal moment for avid readers both within and beyond the city.
On January 22, the Kolkata Book Fair saw the launch of Anaddha - The World of Tabla, a book by the late Shankar Ghosh, a distinguished Indian tabla player from the Farrukhabad gharana. Organised by the Pt. Shankar Ghosh Tabla Foundation and Birutjatio Sahitya Sammilani, it offered a sneak peek into the fascinating world of tabla.
Shankar Ghosh made a significant impact on solo and accompaniment tabla playing and his compositions have become integral to the contemporary tabla repertoire. His remarkable contributions earned him the prestigious 1999–2000 Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the highest recognition from The National Academy of Music, Dance and Drama.
Hosted by Bickram Ghosh, son of Shankar Ghosh, the event showcased his expertise as an Indian classical tabla player. Bickram, known for performances with Ustad Ali Akbar Khan and Ravi Shankar was joined by Tanmoy Bose, who is also a percussionist, a tabla player and composer. Bose, a disciple of Shankar Ghosh, has collaborated with Anoushka Shankar and Amjad Ali Khan and co-founded ‘The Taal Tantra Experience’ in 2002.

During their conversation, Bickram and Tanmoy fondly reminisced about their early tabla lessons from Shankar Ghosh, shedding light on his unique quirks and the warm-hearted nature that defined him. Sharing anecdotes from their youth, they painted a vivid picture of their guru, recalling moments when he displayed strict discipline and contrasting stories that showcased his genuine warmth and unwavering support.
Subhadrakalyan and Rjarshi Halder presented various taals and beats during the event, with harmonium accompaniment by Sanatan Goswami. The culmination of the evening featured a tabla recital, ‘Bir Bikram Taal’, presented by Bickram Ghosh, a composition by Shankar Ghosh, paying homage to the maestro.
Guests at the event
With luminaries of Kolkata’s Indian Classical Music scene, including Tejendra Majumdar, gracing the occasion, it was a fitting tribute to honour the invaluable contributions of the maestro’s legacy that continues to thrive in the hands of his dedicated disciples."

Chief minister and JDU national president Nitish Kumar chose to give a sarcasm-laced thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for conferring Bharat Ratna on Karpoori.
“Ramnath Thakur (Karpoori’s son and JDU Rajya Sabha member) told me that the Prime Minister called him up after the announcement. He has not called me so far. It is possible that he may claim full credit for the move. So be it, but I thank the Prime Minister and his government for fulfilling a demand that I have been raising since I assumed charge in Bihar,” Nitish said.
Nitish said just like Karpoori, he never promoted his family in politics.
RJD chief Lalu Prasad attacked the BJP for its timing in conferring Bharat Ratna on Karpoori. “Why did not they think about awarding Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur before? They announced this to get votes.... We had been demanding the highest national award for him for a long time.”
Bihar BJP chief Samrat Choudhary said Modi was implementing the vision of Karpoori Thakur, while Lalu and Nitish became chief minister because of Karpoori’s blessings."
BOKHLQHD4E_5IPYOBE1IX33W3Q,Yatra in Assam: Rahul not allowed to visit Sankardeva's birthplace; Congress blames PM Modi,"PTI Morigaon (Assam) Published 22.01.24, 07:40 PM","PTI Morigaon (Assam) Published 22.01.24, 07:40 PM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/yatra-in-assam-rahul-not-allowed-to-visit-sankardevas-birthplace-congress-blames-pm-modi/cid/1995520,"The Congress’ Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam was marked with high drama on Monday, as Rahul Gandhi was not allowed to proceed towards the birthplace of iconic Vaishnav saint Srimanta Sankardeva at Batadrava in Nagaon, besides being barred from holding a meeting in Morigaon district.
As a consequence, the fifth day of the Yatra in the state did not proceed as per the programme chalked out by the party in the two districts. In the evening, Gandhi and his entourage entered Meghalaya.
AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi exerted pressure on the Assam government to prevent Gandhi from visiting the birthplace of Srimant Sankardeva.
Sankardeva is an Assamese saint-scholar, social-religious reformer, poet, playwright and a towering figure in the cultural and religious history of Assam from the 15th-16th century.
Gandhi had left for the Sattra (Vaisnavite monastery) at Batadrava early in the morning but was stopped at Haibargaon, around 17 km away, prompted him and other party leaders to sit on a dharna.
Tight security arrangements were in force around the sattra.
The Sri Sankardeva Sattra authorities on Sunday announced that they will not allow Gandhi to visit the sattra before 3 pm on January 22, after Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said at a press conference that he requested Gandhi not to visit it before the consecration ceremony at the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.
Party MP Gaurav Gogoi and Batadrava MLA Sibamoni Bora went to the sattra to resolve the issue but failed. After returning, Gogoi claimed there was no crowd in and around the premises.
They offered prayers on behalf of Gandhi and the priests extended their blessings to him.
''A rumour was spread that a law and order situation could have risen if Gandhi had visited the place,” Gogoi said.
After the two returned, Gandhi told reporters that he believes in the philosophy of Sankardeva saying: “Like him, we believe in bringing people together and not spreading hatred''.
''He is like a guru to us and gives us direction. So I had thought when I came to Assam, I should offer my respects to him,” he said.
Gandhi said that they had received an invitation on January 11 but ''we were told that there is a law and order situation. This is strange as there is a law and order situation in the area, but Gaurav Gogoi and all can go but only Rahul Gandhi cannot go.''             The former Congress president said he would go to Batadrava after getting an opportunity.
“It is my belief that both Assam and the entire nation should follow the path shown by Sankardeva'', he said.
Gogoi, who visited the sattra along with the Congress MLA, said that there was no crowd in and around the premises.
''A rumour was spread that a law and order situation could have risen if Gandhi had visited the place. The Chief Minister has stamped a black spot in the history of Batadrava and the legacy of Sri Sankardeva'', the Congress MP from Kaliabor said.
Gogoi claimed they offered prayers of peace and harmony on behalf of Gandhi and all priests who were present in the premises extended their blessings to him.
Earlier, when Nagaon SP Navaneet Mahanta and Additional District Commissioner Lakhyajyoti Das explained why he could not be allowed to visit the sattra, Gandhi questioned, ""Will PM Modi now decide who will visit a temple and when?""              Ramesh said when the authorities had said there could be a law and order problem, Gandhi offered to go there alone but this too was refused.
''We were given permission to visit the Sattra on January 11 and the managing committee had welcomed the visit but suddenly on January 20, we were told that he could visit only after the consecration of the Ram temple is over'', Ramesh said.
After Gandhi was not allowed to visit Batadrava, the Morigaon district administration in a letter to the district Congress organisers asked Gandhi to refrain from holding street corner meetings and a foot march as a part of the Yatra saying miscreants may try to disrupt peace in the district.
''In the interest of Rahul Gandhi's safety and security, who is a 'Z plus Advance Security Liasoning (ASL) protectee along with our responsibility to avert any probable law and order disruption in Morigaon district, we request that the party refrain from proposed street corner meeting and padayatra in Morigaon town'', the letter read.
The authorities also requested the party not to stop carcade during his roadshow at Morigaon district till he reached the Golsepa alighting point for lunch and rest.
''This negates all earlier permissions accorded by the district administration for holding any public meeting/Padyatra in Morigaon district in connection with the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on January 22'', the letter stated.
Meanwhile, the state Director General of Police G P Singh had posted on 'X' that unscheduled stoppages should be avoided.
The participants of the road event were advised not to physically counter locals protesting the event and leave the same to the deployed police contingent, he said.
The Yatra later entered Meghalaya and it will return to Assam on Tuesday.
Gandhi will address students at the University if Science and Technology in Meghalaya.
Ramesh said that Gandhi will travel only on the route on which BJP president J P Nadda travelled recently as the party does not want any law and order situation to be created.

BPME872X0O_EDZYFL6C2XT4XJ3,SC glare on ‘tit-for-tat’ probes: Court mulls mechanism to halt state-ED reprisals,"R. Balaji New Delhi Published 26.01.24, 05:06 AM","R. Balaji New Delhi Published 26.01.24, 05:06 AM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/supreme-court-glare-on-tit-for-tat-probes-court-mulls-mechanism-to-halt-state-enforcement-directorate-reprisals/cid/1996203,"The Supreme Court on Thursday said it would try to evolve a transparent mechanism to avert “vindictive” or “tit-for-tat” actions between state police and central investigative agencies like the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI.
Two instances were mentioned at the hearing: the recent arrest of ED officer Ankit Tiwari on bribery charges by Tamil Nadu police, and Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee laying siege to the CBI office in Calcutta in 2021 after the arrest of Trinamul ministers in the Narada scam.
Recently, Bengal police registered a trespass case against ED officials who had raided the home of a local Trinamul leader in connection with a corruption probe, while the central agency accused the state police of going soft on the absconding accused.
The bench of Justice Surya Kant and Justice K.V. Viswanathan was hearing an ED application for transfer to the CBI of the criminal case registered against Tiwari in Tamil Nadu.
“There may be genuine cases where ED may have to go in. Then there may be cases where they are brought in with a mala fide…” Justice Viswanathan observed.
“There has to be a mechanism, particularly when the ruling party is different between the Centre and the state. Something has to be evolved so that while the accused in genuine cases don’t go scot-free merely because it is being handled by the central agency and there is also no mala fide or witch-hunt.”
He added: “This is just the start. If this happens in different states where ED officers are posted, what will happen to this country?... Suppose there is a given scenario where there is a tit-for-tat reaction. That is why some kind of screening mechanism should be there before a probe.”
Justice Kant said the objective was to ensure fair and objective investigation. “A mechanism can be devised so that no guilty should go scot-free under the veils of counter-allegations. It can then be applied (to) other states… one by one,” he said.
Tiwari was arrested by Tamil Nadu’s directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) in December for allegedly demanding a Rs 20-lakh bribe from a state official implicated in an ED case.
The bench cautioned solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, who was representing the ED, and senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the Tamil Nadu government along with the state’s additional advocate-general Amit Anand Tiwari, after they engaged in mutual recrimination.
“We are on the larger issues of best practices considering the federal structure of the country. We will evolve a mechanism — you should sit together and give suggestion,” the bench said.
It directed that the parallel probes being conducted by the ED and the DVAC against Tiwari be kept on hold.
Mehta alleged that following Tiwari’s arrest, the DVAC had raided ED’s regional office in Chennai and seized several documents relating to a money-laundering probe against several state ministers. He also cited how Mamata had led a siege of the Calcutta CBI office nearly three years ago.
Sibal questioned the impartiality of the CBI and the ED, wondering why they did not investigate BJP politicians. “You should not protect your ministers. Investigate all FIRs against the chief minister of Assam,” he told Mehta.
As the two senior counsel traded charges, Justice Kant referred to an order passed by Madras High Court refusing a CBI probe into the Tiwari case while hearing a public-interest plea.
“The way the high court entertained it and passed the order, we don’t want to comment…. But there is something which can be said about both sides (Centre and the state). Either you both come up with some solutions, otherwise we will find out. The matter needs to be probed in a transparent manner,” he said."

The FIR was registered at Amritsar's Sultanwind police station on January 23, the police said on Wednesday.
Pannun has been designated as a terrorist by the Union Home Ministry under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Sikhs for Justice banned.
In a video posted on social media, Pannun allegedly claimed that the Shri Durgiana Mandir in Amritsar had no historical significance in Hinduism.
The pro-Khalistan leader also purportedly warned the temple management to shut its gates and hand over the keys to the Golden Temple administration.
The police said the case was registered on the basis of Pannun's social media video.
He has been booked under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race), 153B (making or publishing statements that promote disharmony or hatred between different religious, racial, language, or regional groups) and 505 (whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement, rumour or report) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the IT Act, the police said.
Pannun on January 16 issued a veiled threat to Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and police chief Gaurav Yadav as he asked gangsters in the state to join the Sikhs For Justice and stop top political leaders from attending the Republic Day parade.
In an email sent to some journalists and two videos accessed by PTI, Pannun compared Mann with former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh, who was assassinated in a bomb blast in August 1995.
Pannun also equated Punjab Director General Police Yadav to assassinated officer Gobind Ram, who was killed in a bomb blast in 1990.
In one of the purported videos, Pannun dared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the Republic Day parade without security.
In another video, he asked gangsters in Punjab to join the Sikhs for Justice, participate in a referendum for Khalistan, and also prevent Mann from hoisting the Tricolour on Republic Day.
The email sent to journalists, however, deviated slightly from the videos where Pannun, besides giving a call to Punjab gangsters to join the Sikhs for Justice, also asked them to get recognised as ""shaheeds (martyrs)"".

BSR8U0XTHY_C1SWTBP7YQ02LXN,"INDIA shaken, not stirred: Congress underplays concerns over ‘implosion’ within alliance","Sanjay K. Jha New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 05:17 AM","Sanjay K. Jha New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 05:17 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/india-shaken-not-stirred-congress-underplays-concerns-over-implosion-within-alliance/cid/1995979,"Clearly needing to counter adverse speculation that all is not well in the INDIA coalition, top Congress leaders have argued that powerful or entrenched partners in states will naturally dictate terms when it comes to Lok Sabha seats. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s declaration that Trinamul will contest the 2024 parliamentary elections alone should not be seen by INDIA partners or the electorate as a sign of implosion because “strategic compulsions” may at times override the logic of coalitions.
While the Congress was quick to describe Mamata as a pillar of the INDIA alliance, senior Opposition leaders argued that her positioning may be driven more by local political imperatives rather than be a sign of betrayal. There is an assessment that the BJP could gain if the Congress-Left vacated the anti-Mamata space and, therefore, a three-cornered contest is not entirely undesirable in the larger interest of giving the BJP a better fight in Bengal.
While Mamata was not willing to accommodate the Left, it is also true that the Congress is not ready to accept the two seats that Trinamul is offering of a total of 42 in the state. At the same time, Congress and other alliance leaders continue to consider Mamata an intrinsic part of INDIA, notwithstanding her announcement to go it alone. “Every state will have a different model,” NCP leader Supriya Sule said, fondly describing Mamata as “Didi who is loved by all”.
A similar dilemma has cropped up in Punjab where the central leaderships of both AAP and the Congress are alive to the possibly adverse consequences of the ruling and main Opposition parties coming together to contest elections and making it a direct battle with the BJP rather than a multi-cornered one. While the state unit of both the parties are not ready to yield an inch, the overriding factor is the undesirability of leaving the entire Opposition space to the BJP or even the Akali Dal, which could scurry back to the BJP after the elections.
The assessment is that the BJP is not in a position to win a single seat in Punjab and there was no harm in polarising the state between AAP and the Congress. Though AAP and Congress will have an understanding in Delhi, sharing seats through a four-three formula, they are poised to fight a bitter battle in Punjab. Chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Wednesday declared he was unwilling to make any seat concessions to the Congress, claiming APP will win all the 13 of the state’s seats.
Though such a muddled and apparently messy seat-sharing table makes for poor optics ahead of a key national election, INDIA leaders assert there exists “tactical logic” behind some of the decisions which apparently convey a breakdown on seats among INDIA partners.
Bihar worry
The real concern emanates from Bihar where speculation over yet another somersault by chief minister Nitish Kumar is dominating the political discourse. RJD and Congress leaders deny any such possibility in formal interactions but their tone changes in off-the-record conversations. Nobody is in a position to firmly rule out the eruption of a sudden crisis in Bihar as a result of yet another political somersault by Nitish.
One INDIA leader went so far as to tell The Telegraph: “We will be surprised if Nitish Kumar doesn’t go back to the BJP. He obviously came to this side with prime-ministerial ambitions. But there were objections to making him the convenor of the INDIA group. Then Mallikarjun Kharge became the chairperson of the group. Nitish now is cynical about his prospects in the Opposition camp and his ties with the RJD too are always strained no matter what his or the RJD’s public posturing.”
The language of JDU spokesperson and Nitish confidant K.C. Tyagi has suddenly changed; he has not only started finding multiple faults with the Congress, he even threw hints of displeasure about the way Nitish has been treated in INDIA. While many parties in the Opposition alliance nurture reservations about Nitish because he has been a staunch BJP backer in the past and has a history of switching sides without any moral or ideological qualms, the JDU believes Nitish is the pivot around which INDIA was conceived and developed but that was not appreciated enough by other parties, particularly the Congress.
There are problems in Uttar Pradesh too, even as seat-sharing talks are proceeding smoothly in states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. While there is a strong desire in the Congress to rope in Mayawati, Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav is averse to the idea. The Congress believes the BJP, which has over 50 per cent votes, cannot be defeated without the BSP, but serious efforts have not been made so far to woo Mayawati into INDIA.
A Congress leader said: “There is a conspiracy to scuttle Mayawati’s induction into INDIA by some leaders of SP and Congress. Rahul Gandhi is on his Nyay Yatra now and only Sonia Gandhi can resolve this issue. If the BSP fights separately, the BJP can still win 60-70 seats in the state. If the BSP joins the coalition, the BJP’s tally can be whittled down by 20-30 seats. That’s the key battlefield none of the top INDIA leaders are seriously working on.”"

Ramanujan’s wonderful essay, “Three Hundred Ramayanas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation”, which says that the Ramayana is a narrative that has been told numerous times in numerous ways across languages and cultures, ends with a delightful story. The essay was dropped from the Delhi University syllabus after Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad protested against it for allegedly hurting the sentiments of Hindus.
It is about a cultured woman who had a complex about her husband not being cultured enough. When a great reciter of the epic came to the village, she sent him to the performance, hoping that her husband would return from it smarter.
The man was very bored and slept through the first three nights. The wife was so enraged by this that she accompanied him on the fourth night and made him sit in the first row. He could not fall asleep and soon was caught up in the twists and turns of the plot of the epic.
The reciter was narrating an episode in which Hanuman has to take Rama’s signet ring to Sita.
“When Hanuman was leaping across the ocean, the signet ring slipped from his hand and fell into the ocean. Hanuman didn’t know what to do. He had to get the ring back quickly and take it to Sita in the demon’s kingdom… the husband who was listening with rapt attention in the first row said: ‘Hanuman, don’t worry. I’ll get it for you.’ Then he jumped up and dived into the ocean, found the ring on the ocean floor, brought it back, and gave it to Hanuman,” writes Ramanujan.
“Everyone was astonished. They thought this man was someone special, really blessed by Rama and Hanuman…That’s what happens when you really listen to a story, especially to the Ramayana.”
Listening deeply is like deep diving; it can eliminate everything else and draw you in, into even the sublime. It is the unlocking of imagination, which is a key element of faith. If you are listening that intently, metaphors cast off their skin and turn into facts. The believer fishes out the blessed ring. A miracle is performed.
But what if we reverse the premise a bit? Reversing can be a useful technique to understand many a phenomena. It can help us to understand the limits of possibility. For example, can Palestine pound Israel back, the way it is being pounded? No. Can India be reluctant to issue visas to Americans or Europeans? No. Can you visualise a future in which Bengali-style weddings will replace Bollywood-style weddings? No.
Reversing also highlights the direction in which power flows.
In other cases, when the reverse is possible, you may want to explore its implications.
So in the case of listening, to frame a question that is a little more complex, what if you are hearing something, insistently, despite yourself, and you do not want to be dragged into its plot?
A few days ago, when the Ram mandir was inaugurated, a lot of Indians felt obliged to dress up as Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman. I felt the pressure, too, to be part of such a pageant. But I could not take the risk. Firstly, I would not look good in any of the costumes. I am too short, fat, bald and old for any of them, and of the wrong gender, mostly. Secondly, induced by the constant music and chanting around me, if I do lose myself and get caught up in the action, and then the person dressed up as Rama, or Hanuman, or anyone, loses something valuable, say an iPhone, what will I deep dive into? The Calcutta pavement?
The transcendental will not work for me, not in these changed circumstances. I think I will keep wearing my own clothes. I will also really switch off my ears, at times, whether the storytelling is going on on WhatsApp or offline.
On a cold, winter day, I will listen to Kishore Kumar."

With this, the police have so far arrested nine out of the 19 people named in the FIR.
The man, Paresh Shah, whose family members are partners in the Kotia Projects which was given the contract by the civic body to operate boats and other leisure activities at Motnath Lake in Harni area, was arrested from a highway on the city outskirts on Thursday morning, a senior police official said.
""Investigations revealed that Shah was handling the overall operations of the Kotia Projects and was on the run after the tragedy. Employees of the firm at the lake zone used to report to Shah. We have arrested him from the outskirts of the city. Efforts are on to nab the others,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Panna Momaya said.
Though Shah was not formally associated with the firm on paper, his wife, son and daughter are associated with the firm as partners and have also been named as accused in the FIR, the official said.
Twelve students and two teachers of the New Sunrise School on a picnic drowned, while 18 students and two teachers were rescued after an overloaded boat capsized in the Motnath Lake on the city's outskirts on January 18.
The police have registered a case under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) of the Indian Penal Code against 19 persons in connection with the boat tragedy.
As per the FIR, Kotia Projects was given a contract by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to operate the Harni Lake Zone in 2017.
Those arrested so far include four partners of Kotia Projects, its manager and and boat operators.
In its complaint, the Vadodara civic body pointed out lapses, including non-maintenance of boats by the Kotia Projects and not keeping the adequate number of life-saving equipment and life jackets, on the part of the contractor.
It was also revealed that only a few students were given life jackets on the day of the incident.
According to officials, the Kotia Projects had sub-let the contract for boating activities to another company, and the boat operator had no prior experience.
The Gujarat High Court has directed the state government to submit an action taken report (ATR) on the death of students and teachers in the boat tragedy, observing that it has ""shocked the conscience"" of the public.

Justice Subhash Chand has mentioned the replies of Yudhisthira against the questions of the Yaksha God. The “father is higher than heaven” is one of the statements of the eldest Pandava brother in the Mahabharata.
A 60-year-old man, Deoki Sao, had filed a petition before the Family Court in Koderma seeking maintenance from his younger son Manoj Sao. The court directed him to pay Rs 3000 per month to his elderly father.
Claiming that his father is money-minded and has several sources of income, Manoj filed a criminal revision in the high court challenging the order of the Family Court.
Deoki Sao, who lives with his elder son, equally divided the agricultural land he owned between his two sons.
Justice Chand observed that it is the duty of a son to look after his parents.
The court order said: “In Mahabharat, the Yaksh asked to Yudhisthira: ‘What is weightier than the earth itself? What is higher than the heavens?’ Yudhisthira answered: ‘The mother is weightier than the earth; the father is higher than the heaven.” 	Even if for the sake of argument, the father earns something; it is pious duty of a son to maintain his old aged father, Justice Chand observed in the order.
He also quoted from a scripture: “Father is your God and Mother is your Nature. They are the seed you are the Sapling.” 	While deciding the case, the court dismissed the petition filed by Manoj and upheld the order of the Family Court directing him to pay Rs 3,000 a month to his father.
In an earlier order involving a distraught wife seeking maintenance from her husband, Justice Chand cited religious texts.
Quoting from a judgment of the apex court, Justice Chand stated that a wife is expected to be with her husband's family after marriage, unless there is a strong justifiable reason for separation.
He also used excerpts from the Rigveda, Yajurveda and Manusmriti in the order.

For Trump, it's become a familiar ritual to welcome the backing of someone who once tried to take him on. Nonetheless, it was notable at Sunday's rally in New Hampshire to see Trump praise DeSantis without calling him “DeSantimonious” or “DeSanctus,” putting an end to perhaps the most bitter rivalry of Republicans' 2024 campaign.
“I just want to thank Ron and congratulate him on doing a very good job,” Trump said at the outset of his remarks. “He was very gracious, and he endorsed me. I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron.” Trump described DeSantis as ""a really terrific person.”
Earlier in the day, DeSantis said via video that he would be ending his campaign two days before New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation GOP primary. But, Trump's glee Sunday night aside, it wasn't the warmest of endorsements.
“It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” DeSantis said, offering matter-of-fact analysis through a forced smile without adding plaudits for Trump.
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honour that pledge,"" he continued, before adding a dig at the remaining contender, Nikki Haley. DeSantis described the former UN ambassador and onetime South Carolina governor as a stand-in for “the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism.”
Trump seemed unbothered by DeSantis' approach, striking a tone of camaraderie as fellow political combatants. “I will tell you it's not easy,” Trump said Sunday night in Rochester. “They think it's easy doing this stuff, right? It's not easy.”
Brenda Moneypenny, a 64-year-old from Alton, waited in the cold for two hours to see Trump on Sunday night. She whipped out her driver's license to prove her last name and explained she is a registered independent who often votes Republican. Moneypenny said she has considered Haley, especially because of the chance to elect the first woman to the presidency. But she never considered DeSantis.
“Too flim-flamsy,” Moneypenny said of the governor. “He needs better campaign people. He doesn't have anybody that's doing him any favors right now.”
Ultimately, she settled on Trump: “Tried and true,” she said.
The former president seemed to revel in skewering DeSantis throughout the campaign, often making clear it was a personal grudge because he considered the governor's decision to run in the first place an act of disloyalty. Trump endorsed DeSantis, then a congressman, in a competitive 2018 GOP primary for Florida governor. DeSantis went on to win the nomination and the general election. By the time DeSantis won a landslide reelection four years later, though, he was positioning himself for his own White House campaign.
As recently as November, Trump came to Florida and addressed a boisterous crowd at a state GOP meeting standing in front of a sign that read: “Florida is Trump Country.” That evening, Trump did not mention DeSantis until more than 30 minutes into his speech. Even then, it was to brag about polls showing his advantages over the governor.
“I endorsed him, and he became a rocket ship in 24 hours,” Trump said, claiming that DeSantis had begged for his endorsement. “Now he's like a wounded falling bird from the sky.”
Trump never did debate DeSantis or any other 2024 rival. He has said he wouldn't until one proves they are a legitimate threat to him winning the nomination.
DeSantis concentrated his campaign in recent months in Iowa, where he finished in second place in last week's caucuses — 30 percentage points behind Trump and barely ahead of Haley. Haley, meanwhile, has long prioritised New Hampshire as a potential springboard ahead of her home-state South Carolina primary next month.
In Iowa, APVoteCast surveys of caucusgoers suggested DeSantis's supporters were much more likely than Haley's to consider themselves conservatives who would back Trump no matter what if he wins the nomination and faces President Joe Biden in November. If that trend holds in New Hampshire, then Trump could expect at least some boost from DeSantis dropping out, and whatever he gets could stretch out his margin and frustrate Haley's ability to claim any momentum. Indeed, Trump's aides have said they expect DeSantis' support around the country will shift heavily to Trump.
Trump noted Sunday that he won New Hampshire's 2016 primary by about 20 points. He lost the battleground state twice in general elections.
On Monday, he plans to be in New York at a civil defamation trial stemming from a columnist's claims he sexually attacked her. Then he is scheduled to return to New Hampshire for an evening rally in Laconia."

This makes Krutrim the first artificial intelligence unicorn from India.
""Krutrim , India's own AI company focused on building the complete AI computing stack, announced the successful closure of its first round of funding. The funding round, led by prominent investors such as Matrix Partners India and others, garnered an investment of USD 50 million in equity at a valuation of USD 1 billion,"" the company said.
The funds raised will be instrumental in accelerating the company's mission to revolutionize the AI landscape, drive innovation, and expand its reach globally.
""India has to build its own AI, and at Krutrim, we are fully committed towards building the country's first complete AI computing stack. We are thrilled to announce the successful closure of our first funding round, which not only validates the potential of Krutrim 's innovative AI solutions but also underscores the confidence investors have in our ability to drive meaningful change out of India for the world,"" Krutrim Founder Bhavish Aggarwal said.
Krutrim unveiled its base Large Language Model (LLM) last month.  With the largest representation of Indian data used for its training, Krutrim claims to power generative AI applications for all Indian languages.
Trained by a team of leading computer scientists, based in Bangalore and San Francisco, the model will also power Krutrim's conversational AI assistant that claims to understand and speak multiple Indian languages fluently.
Krutrim is a family of Large Language Models, including Krutrim base and Krutrim Pro which will have multimodal, larger knowledge capabilities, and many other technical advancements for inference.
Krutrim last month announced that it will run an early access programme until January 2024 with a simple sign up page on the website.
Additionally, Krutrim's open APIs (tool to embed it with apps) will open to all developers by February 2024.

Chief minister and JDU national president Nitish Kumar chose to give a sarcasm-laced thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for conferring Bharat Ratna on Karpoori.
“Ramnath Thakur (Karpoori’s son and JDU Rajya Sabha member) told me that the Prime Minister called him up after the announcement. He has not called me so far. It is possible that he may claim full credit for the move. So be it, but I thank the Prime Minister and his government for fulfilling a demand that I have been raising since I assumed charge in Bihar,” Nitish said.
Nitish said just like Karpoori, he never promoted his family in politics.
RJD chief Lalu Prasad attacked the BJP for its timing in conferring Bharat Ratna on Karpoori. “Why did not they think about awarding Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur before? They announced this to get votes.... We had been demanding the highest national award for him for a long time.”
Bihar BJP chief Samrat Choudhary said Modi was implementing the vision of Karpoori Thakur, while Lalu and Nitish became chief minister because of Karpoori’s blessings."

A bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and S C Sharma said the high court and the trial court committed error in granting bail to them.
""We have no hesitation that the charge sheet having been filed and cognisance being taken in due time, respondents could not have claimed statutory bail as a right,"" the bench said.
Under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), an accused becomes entitled for grant of statutory bail if the probe agency fails to file the charge sheet on conclusion of the investigation in a criminal case within 60 or 90 days period.
In this case, the CBI filed the charge sheet on the 88th day after registration of the FIR and the trial court granted default bail to the accused and the Delhi High Court upheld the order.
The Wadhawan brothers were arrested in this case on July 19 last year. The high court, however, had clarified it did not go into the merits of the case.
The charge sheet was filed on October 15, 2022 and cognisance was taken.
The FIR in the case was based on a complaint made by the Union Bank of India.

As Bose's convoy reached the university gate, students of both Trinamul Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) and leftist AIDSO separately showed black flags to him and shouted ""go back"" slogans.
However, the policemen present at the spot ensured the convoy went inside the campus and the protestors were kept at a distance.
A TMCP spokesperson said, ""We hold the governor responsible for the crumbling of infrastructure in Calcutta University due to the absence of a permanent Vice Chancellor in the university and demanded immediate appointment of a permanent VC"".
The AIDSO, students' wing of leftist SUCI (Communist) also made similar demands apart from scrapping the New Education Policy 2020.
Bose came to the university on the occasion of the Calcutta University foundation day programme.
CU has been without a permanent VC since March last year and the Higher Education minister has opposed the appointment of Santa Dutta as the officiating VC by Bose, who is the ex-officio chancellor of the state university.
The students also held placards which read ""Go back governor"", and ""we demand permanent vc for CU"".

CCSSUBOEUG_D92NPNJX7AD3RWG,Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rebuffs pressure from President Joe Biden,"Adam Rasgon Jerusalem Published 22.01.24, 04:55 AM","Adam Rasgon Jerusalem Published 22.01.24, 04:55 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/world/prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-again-rebuffs-pressure-from-president-joe-biden/cid/1995332,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has doubled down on his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state, again rebuffing pressure from President Biden to agree to that path after the war in Gaza is over.
“I will not compromise on full Israeli security control of the entire area west of the Jordan River — and that is irreconcilable with a Palestinian state,” Netanyahu posted on Saturday evening in Hebrew on X, formerly Twitter.
Netanyahu’s comments came just a day after Biden spoke to him about a two-state solution and floated the possibility of a disarmed Palestinian nation that would not threaten Israel’s security. Biden has argued that the creation of a Palestinian state is the only viable long-term resolution to a conflict that has dragged on for decades, repeating a position held by most American presidents and European leaders in recent history.
While there was no indication that Netanyahu would ease his strenuous opposition, which is popular with his fragile Right-wing political coalition, Biden expressed optimism that they might yet find consensus.
“There are a number of types of two-state solutions,” the President told reporters at the White House several hours after the call, their first in nearly a month amid tension over the war. “There’s a number of countries that are members of the UN that are still — don’t have their own militaries. Number of states that have limitations.” He added: “And so I think there’s ways in which this could work.”
On Sunday, Grant Shapps, Britain’s defence secretary, called Netanyahu’s latest comments “disappointing.”
“There isn’t another option,” Shapps told Sky News in a televised interview. “The whole world has agreed that the two-state solution is the best way forward.”
António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, said that denying statehood for the Palestinian people was “unacceptable”.
“The right of the Palestinian people to build their own state must be recognized by all,” Guterres wrote on X, without referencing Netanyahu.
The Biden administration and the Israeli government have diverged sharply over how Gaza will be governed when the fighting ends. President Biden and his top diplomat, Antony J. Blinken, have urged Israeli officials to move toward the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state.
Biden has suggested that a “revitalised” Palestinian Authority, which is based in the West Bank, could take over Gaza once Hamas has been removed from power there. Netanyahu has rejected the idea of the authority returning to the enclave.
Despite support from the international community, a two-state approach still faces enormous obstacles, including waning support for it among the Israeli and Palestinian populations, the continued building of settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and a divided Palestinian leadership.
Analysts pointed out that Netanyahu’s willingness to undermine his American counterpart was becoming routine.
“Humiliating Biden has become a daily occurrence for Netanyahu,” Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington, wrote on social media.

The high court bench, headed by acting Chief Justice Manmohan, was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by the civil rights group Social Jurist.
The petitioner alleged that children enrolled in Classes I to VIII in schools of the Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) had to forgo allowances because they did not have bank accounts to which the amount could be transferred.
The PIL was based on an audit memo of November 2023 by the chief auditor of the MCD that found that these students didn’t receive the benefits between 2016-17 and 2022-23.
“The high court issued notices to the parties to file counter-affidavits within four weeks,” said Ashok Agrawal, an advocate and activist associated with Social Jurist.
“These children have been denied uniforms, school bags, notebooks, scholarships and stationery, which are provided to them every year. Neither the schools nor any authority ever thought of opening their bank accounts. We have pleaded that they should be paid the dues for all these years and a system should be enforced to ensure smooth and timely payment of allowances to all eligible students,” Agrawal said.
According to the audit memo, cash subsidy is provided to the students only through bank accounts to avoid malpractice and misappropriation of funds. The school authorities are supposed to help the students open the accounts. A total of 2,69,488 students in schools run by the Delhi government and 3,83,203 students of MCD schools were deprived of the statutory benefits.
Professor C.B. Sharma, former chairman of the National Institute of Open Schooling, attributed the lackadaisical attitude of the Delhi government to the little scope for pilferage in the transfer of allowance.
“There is no reason for not opening the bank accounts of children. If the officials and schools were given the charge to deal with payment of cash, they might have shown eagerness,” he said.
Sharma said the government is supposed to monitor the implementation of the transfer of allowance as it is a key component of the Right To Education (RTE) Act.
“The central government had adopted direct benefit transfer to beneficiary accounts to check pilferage, but the administration seems to be not so keen to implement it,” he said.
An email was sent to Ashok Kumar, the secretary of education of the Delhi government, to understand his perspective on the alleged denial of the benefits. His response is awaited."

Gandhi also said he was happy and wanted the BJP to disrupt the yatra as it was helping it in getting publicity.
The remarks by Gandhi, who once again accused Sarma of being ""one of the most corrupt chief ministers"" in the country, came after the Assam chief minister said he has instructed the Director General of Police (DGP) to register a case against Gandhi for ""provoking the crowd"" to break barricades, and called their actions ""Naxalite tactics"".
The Rahul Gandhi-led yatra was stopped from entering the city, triggering protests from Congress workers who broke barricades and raised slogans. Gandhi also claimed that he was ""not allowed"" to interact with students of a private university in Meghalaya as part of the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' at the ""instructions"" of the Union Home Minister Amit Shah.
""BJP had the experience of the earlier yatra, it started from Kanyakumari and they maintained that it would not have any impact. Slowly its impact started being felt and a crescendo was formed in Jammu and Kashmir. Now their thinking is to disrupt it first. The problem for them (BJP) is that by disrupting the yatra, they end up helping it,"" he said at a press conference here.
""So frankly, I want them to disrupt the yatra, stop me from going into colleges. They stopped us from going into a college, we spoke to students outside, and it was seen by the whole country. So I am happy, do it (disrupt the yatra) as much as you (BJP) want, we are enjoying it. It is for our benefit,"" Gandhi said.
Asked about the hindrances and alleged violence against the yatra, Gandhi said at the presser, ""I would not call it violence. He (pointing to the state Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah) got slightly hurt. We are tough people. We can take all this."" 	On the BJP workers disrupting the yatra, Gandhi said they don't try to attack and even if they do, it does not affect him.
""I don't get scared of these things. I don't get intimidated. Abuse me, disturb me, or target me, I don't get intimidated. I fight for my truth and even if the whole world stands on the other side, it does not matter to me. Once I make up my mind and fight for my ideology, I do not get intimidated,"" the former Congress chief asserted.
The Congress is benefiting from what the Assam Chief Minister and the Union Home Minister are doing and the yatra has become the main issue in Assam, Gandhi said.
""As far as stopping me from visiting a temple, university and also preventing the 'padyatra' here is concerned, it is their style, it is part of intimidation tactics; we don't get intimidated by these people, we are not scared of them,"" the Congress leader said.
Elaborating on BJP workers lining up to protest against the yatra, Gandhi claimed that they were holding party flags in one hand and with the other they were waving at him.
""What kind of protest is this? Mr Himanta thinks it is a protest, it is no protest that is taking place, they are lining up to shout slogans, we are perfectly happy for them to line up there,"" he said.
Gandhi said,""There is a clear problem in the state...The chief minister of the state is one of the most corrupt chief ministers in the country. Wherever I move in the state, people tell me -- that there is massive unemployment, massive corruption, massive price rise, farmers are struggling and no youth can get a job in this state. These are the issues we are raising."" 	He said the yatra is about five pillars of justice that will give strength to the country -- participation, justice for youth, labourers, women and farmers.
The Congress party will put forward its programme for the five pillars of justice over the next one or one-and-a-half month, he said.
Asked about the consecration ceremony at the Ram temple in Ayodhya and how he would counter the wave it has generated in the country, Gandhi said, ""It is nothing like that, that there is a wave...this is the BJP's political programme and Narendra Modi ji did a function and a show there, it's good, but we have told you, we have clarity about our programme which is about five justices to strengthen the country.""  	Talking about the opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), Gandhi said on one side, there is Narendra Modi and the RSS and on the other is the INDIA bloc, which is an ideology and has 60 per cent of the country's votes.

A unique photo tribute, available at Hall 1 stall number 8, has been nicely put together by veteran photojournalist Rajib De and corporate communications professional Arup Ghosh. The photo-essay juxtaposes old Kolkata against its new avatar. De’s photographs and Ghosh’s words weave a poetry of the traditional and the modern.
The book cover showing four sari-clad women walking down an endless road in New Town many years ago before the realty boom is timeless. Speaking of the image, De said: “It is a photograph so close to my heart. It portrays two worlds — the old and the new. Villagers from the outskirts would often walk down long stretches in New Town to get a feel of their rapidly transforming neighbourhood. On one side, there was this burning desire to be a part of the change yet they would cling to their roots.”
On the choice of photographs, De said: “This city touched my soul from childhood days. My father taught me to love the smell of Kolkata’s history. So apart from my journalistic career, I had started exploring the city right from Kumartuli. Initially, we sat down with 200 pairs of visuals I had clicked roughly between 2008 and 2023. Finally, it was trimmed down to 46 pairs.”
Sharing his thoughts, Ghosh, credited with curating the book, said: “It is a visual love letter to the city. All the pictures you see are through the eyes of the common man as if celebrating the ordinary and the day-to-day.”
Asked why there’s no mention of the locations in the captions provided with the photographs, Ghosh reasoned: “Ours is not meant to be a photo guidebook on Kolkata, rather it’s a photo-essay that hunts for magic and poetry in the mundane.”
Speaking of the response received so far, De said: “Just yesterday, a probashi Bangali bhadrolok (from the US) buying the book said it had achieved something immeasurable about Kolkata, something which he had not come across before.”
After Invincible City and Kolkata, My Endless City, De revealed he would soon be bringing out yet another visual ode to the City of Joy.
Kolkata, My Endless City, published by Penprints Publications and foreword written by Debanjan Chakrabarti, director, British Council, East and Northeast India, would be available for online sale after the book fair."

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also said that the National Voters' Day reaffirms the power of the people to determine their own destiny by exercising the freedom to elect their own representatives.
In a post on X, AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh said every year January 25 is celebrated as the National Voters' Day by the Election Commission of India.
But sadly, this independent institution has been simply refusing to meet a delegation of leaders belonging to the INDIA bloc who only want to put across their point of view on the greater use of VVPATs when voters cast their vote, he said.
""VVPAT is nothing but Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail. This persistent refusal of the ECI is an ANYAY that strikes at the very foundations of our democracy, the right of the voter to verify that their vote has been recorded accurately,"" Ramesh said.
Kharge also said, ""We are proud that the election process of Universal Adult Suffrage, has deepened to the grassroots, Panchayat and Urban Local Bodies, as our towering founders had imagined.""  	""India's tryst with Democracy is a story which needs to be told time and again, but any complacency enables authoritarian tendencies to gain ground,"" he said.
""Today, we are at a juncture where safeguarding the independence of our institutions is paramount, so that Democracy is protected and the Constitution is upheld,"" Kharge said.

Ambedkar that sparked violent protests in parts of the north Karnataka city of Gulbarga on Tuesday.
A resident had early on Tuesday found a garland of footwear placed around the bust of Ambedkar in Kotnur village on the outskirts of Gulbarga.
District police commissioner Chetan R. on Wednesday told a media conference in Gulbarga that the four arrested men were booked under various penal provisions for trying to spark a riot and hurting the sentiments of a community, and remanded in judicial custody.
The accused have been identified as Kiran, Hanumanth, Bhanu and Sangamesh. Efforts are on to trace a fifth accused who has been absconding since the incident. “The preliminary investigation points to a larger plan to trigger violence,” Chetan said.
Hundreds of locals rushed to the spot as the news of the desecration spread. Eventually, more people joined in a protest that brought life to a standstill in the area.
Protesters burnt tyres and allegedly forced shops to down shutters and vehicles to stay off the roads, demanding the arrest of the culprits. Many resorted to stone-pelting at shops.
State minister for IT, biotechnology and rural development, Priyank Kharge, who is in charge of Gulbarga and was present at the media conference, said it was not clear if the desecration had anything to do with the sentiments surrounding the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.
“I don’t know. The investigation is on,” he said.
But he added such acts of desecration were usually the handiwork of “Manuvadis”. Manuvadis are followers of the Manu Smriti, which the Sangh Parivar espouses.
“Whether it is a statue of Babasaheb Ambedkar or Basavanna (12th-century social reformer), it is usually the Manuvadis who engage in such acts. It’s not about which party they belong to. But Manuvadis are Manuvadis,” said Priyank, who had camped in the district after the desecration and the protests that followed.
The police commissioner said that the accused were identified and arrested by the three special teams formed to crack the case. “We will interrogate them again to get to the bottom of the case and arrest the conspirators behind this incident (of desecrating the statue),” said the officer.
Both Priyank and Chetan pledged appropriate action against those who had resorted to violence and destroyed public property.
“The first task was to arrest those behind this desecration. Now we would take action on those who took the law into their hands,” said the minister."

This is Shah's first visit to the state after the inauguration of the Ram temple at Ayodhya and his third in the past three months. In December, he was in Calcutta, along with national BJP president J.P. Nadda, to form an election management committee for the Bengal unit.
Confirming Shah's visit to Calcutta later this month, a BJP leader said: ""The Union home minister is scheduled to arrive in the city on Sunday and will put up at a five-star hotel in New Town. During his stay, he plans to convene a meeting with prominent BJP leaders, including state president Sukanta Majumdar, leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari and MP Dilip Ghosh.""
The leader added that when Shah and Nadda had reached Calcutta the last time, they had given a series of instructions to the state leadership. ""With polls likely to be announced anytime soon, this time, he (Shah) will hold a series of meetings to find out what the leaders have done since the poll management committee was formed last month.""
After meeting party leaders in Calcutta on January 28, Shah is expected to host a party workers' meeting at Mecheda in East Midnapore district. Before leaving the city, Shah is scheduled to participate in a meeting with intellectuals aligned with the BJP at the Science City auditorium.
The BJP has been attacking the Mamata Banerjee government on charges of corruption and a senior leader said Shah's visit was likely to see the saffron camp intensifying its fight against the ruling Trinamul."

The remarks were made by the Ajit Pawar faction of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) during the hearing on disqualification petitions before assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar on Wednesday.
Patil maintained he was the state NCP president because he was elected to the post and senior leader Praful Patel, now a member of the Ajit Pawar group, had given him a letter to that effect.
Lawyers representing the Ajit Pawar faction said Patil's term as state NCP president ended in 2022.
Patil countered the argument, saying he was elected for three years and his term continued till a new appointment was made.
During the hearing, Patil was asked 90 questions.
Shirur Lok Sabha member Amol Kolhe was also cross-examined.
The 1999-founded party suffered a split when Ajit Pawar and eight other NCP MLAs loyal to him took oath as ministers in the Shiv Sena-led government on July 2, 2023.
Subsequently, both factions filed cross-petitions before the speaker seeking disqualification of each other's members from the assembly.
The Supreme Court has set January 31 deadline for the speaker's verdict in the NCP disqualification case.

CX6NEHO5FJ_RUQUFRV7ZL8NZAM,Hubba: Bangladeshi actor Mosharraf Karim is the lifeline of Bratya Basu’s gripping gangster drama,"Agnivo Niyogi Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 04:23 PM","Agnivo Niyogi Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 04:23 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/entertainment/hubba-bangladeshi-actor-mosharraf-karim-is-the-lifeline-of-bratya-basus-gripping-gangster-drama/cid/1995919,"In his fifth directorial venture, Bratya Basu delivers a gritty gangster film built around dreaded criminal Hubba Shyamal Das, who was infamous as the ‘Dawood Ibrahim of Hooghly’ in Kolkata of the early 2000s. The film is loosely based on a chapter from Supratim Sarkar’s book Goyendapeeth Lalbazar.
Shymal becomes Bimal in Basu’s film and Bangladeshi actor Mosharraf Karim undergoes a remarkable transformation into the title character of a crime lord. Shyamal’s associates Benarasi Bapi and Ritesh Mahto are Bokaro Bapi and Umesh Mahto in the film.
The film begins in 2005, with CID officer Dibakar Sen (Indraneil Sengupta) attempting to catch Hubba. A cat-and-mouse chase begins, portraying the challenges faced by the police in pinning down this uneducated but street-smart criminal. Hubba keeps playing mind games with the police and manages to give them the slip every time. When he is finally captured, his layered personality is further revealed through flashbacks, providing a nuanced understanding of his journey from an ordinary guy-next-door to a notorious criminal.
Basu, who has written the screenplay, recreates Hubba’s gangster empire with all its intricacies and complexities, showcasing the nexus between crime and politics. Hubba’s early life, family, first love and entry into the criminal world is also woven into the story that gives a nod to Bollywood gangster films like Sarkar and Vaastav.
While Hubba boasts of a line-up of strong performances, it is Mosharraf Karim who carries the film on his shoulders. He effortlessly switches between the ruthlessness of a criminal and the childlike charm of a funny man. Karim captures Bimal’s fascination with Bollywood movies too, which is evident in his clapworthy rendition of the iconic ‘Don ko pakadna na mumkin hai’ dialogue from the Amitabh Bachchan-starrer. His interactions with Indraneil Sengupta’s cop character light up the screen whenever they are together.
Loknath Dey as Bapi and Anujoy Chattopadhyay as Umesh also leave a mark. Theatre actor Gambhira Bhattacharya wins hearts as a young Bimal transitioning into a life of crime. The ferocity in his eyes in the scene where he murders a man for smiling at his girlfriend is spine-chilling.
Cinematographer Soumik Halder captures the violence permeating the film, and the judicious use of music, composed by Prabuddha Banerjee —  particularly the retro vibe in the title track sung by Silajit Majumdar — enhances the overall cinematic experience."

D4APU5MNMK_NRJND7N3RS1YZNI,"We are tough guys, we can handle it: Rahul on attack by BJP workers on Assam Congress chief","Sanjay K. Jha New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 06:47 AM","Sanjay K. Jha New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 06:47 AM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/we-are-tough-guys-we-can-handle-it-rahul-gandhi-on-attack-by-bjp-workers-on-assam-congress-chief/cid/1995772,"Rahul Gandhi isn’t a crybaby. Unlike Narendra Modi who imagines constant threats to his life, hypes up minor irritants and seldom misses out on playing the victim card, Rahul’s demeanour in the face of vicious and consistent attacks from the Sangh ecosystem has been: We are tough guys, we can handle it!
Rahul hasn’t only demonstrated exceptional will and courage in his public interactions, walking and jostling with unregulated crowds of thousands of people during his Yatras, he has also been open to taking questions from audiences the world over, visited troubled spots like Manipur, and remained calm in adversity — from shocking electoral losses to expulsion from Parliament.
While the ongoing Nyay Yatra has faced several violent attacks from BJP workers and threats from the Assam chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, he hasn't been rattled. Asked about the attacks at a media conference on Tuesday, Rahul smiled and said, “I don’t get intimidated. Threaten me, Abuse me, hit me… I am not scared.” He held the bandaged hand of his state unit chief Bhupen Borah and said, “He got injured but that’s okay. We are tough guys, we can handle it.”
The Assam Congress chief was given a bloody nose by anti-Congress hooligans a couple of days ago. That would have been enough for any leader to create a huge fuss. But Rahul kept his focus on real concerns of the people, discussing unemployment and prices, instead of indulging in any chest-thumping victimhood. He had shrugged off serious security threats in Kashmir during his Bharat Jodo Yatra and walked through militant-infested areas last year.
This equanimity is in sharp contrast to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tendency to create hype around any unpleasant situation. In January 2022, he told security men in Punjab when some farmers had blocked a flyover that he was supposed to take: “Apne CM ko thanks kehna, ki mein Bathinda airport tak zinda laut paaya (Say thanks to your CM that I was able to return to Bathinda airport alive).” He abandoned his trip and returned to Delhi even though there was no attack and he was fully secure under SPG cover.
It is difficult to count how many times reports about threats to Modi’s life have surfaced since he became chief minister of Gujarat in 2002.
Modi has on several occasions publicly complained that Opposition leaders insult him, reeling out a list of abuses, and even exploited statements of minor functionaries, emotionally telling people that Congressmen want him dead. During the Gujarat Assembly elections in 2017, he went so far as to accuse former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, former Vice-President Hamid Ansari and top retired defence officers and bureaucrats of plotting to unseat him using Pakistani help. The BJP was forced to apologise in Parliament for this false accusation.
Victim of a nasty propaganda campaign that portrayed him as a Pappu, Rahul succeeded in shaking off that false tag by pulling off what no politician in the world has achieved — walking over 4,000km from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, and freely mingling with millions of people on the way, often shrugging off high-security risks that tail him and his family. While his father Rajiv Gandhi was blown to pieces by an LTTE suicide squad during one such public interaction in Tamil Nadu in 1991, security personnel shot his grandmother Indira Gandhi to death at the prime ministerial residence in 1984.
Rahul has remained extraordinarily composed in the face of vicious campaigns based on lies, half-truths, doctored videos and unsubstantiated allegations. He once said the BJP had spent thousands of crores to ruin his image but he didn’t care as truth would triumph in the end.
Two days ago, when angry BJP workers were protesting against him in Assam, Rahul got off the bus to interact with them instead of running away. He has shown a consistent will to face the truth, even if uncomfortable, rather than relying on escapism.
Modi, on the other hand, has not ever faced questions from the media, or enlightened audiences. Unlike Rahul, there are no videos available of Modi’s meaningful conversation with global leaders and intellectuals. During the 2019 election campaign, Rahul repeatedly dared Modi to have a debate but to no avail. Modi, projected as a powerful speaker, had the opportunity to maul a rival often berated as a poor speaker, but he didn’t accept the challenge.
Another comparison being made in political circles is over the nature of public outings of the two leaders. While Rahul shares space with all Congress leaders, Modi chooses to remain alone. Rahul’s bonhomie with senior leaders of all the states during the Bharat Jodo Yatra was widely remarked upon, while Modi’s solo show at the G20 summit attracted national attention. The perception is that Modi doesn’t like anybody else in the frame while Rahul naturally merges with people.
Even in the once-in-a-lifetime ceremony of the Ram temple inauguration in Ayodhya, top BJP leaders Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari were missing; as were L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, two chief actors of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement."

""Oppenheimer"", an ambitious biopic of J Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atom bomb, earned 13 nods, including top categories of best picture, director for Nolan and actor for Cillian Murphy.
""Poor Things"", which entered the race later, was the second favourite film for Academy voters who gave the wacky comedy a lot of love by nominating it in 11 categories, while Scorsese's relook at one of the bloodiest chapters in American history, ""Killers..."" followed with 10 nods. 	  	Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie"", another summer mega hit that released with ""Oppenheimer"" and sparked the ""Barbenheimer"" phenomenon amongst fans, earned eight nominations, including a best picture and a twin nod in original song category.
Other than than these four films, the best picture list also includes ""American Fiction"", ""Anatomy of a Fall"", ""The Holdovers"", ""Maestro"", ""Past Lives"" and ""Zone of Interest"", showcasing Academy's attempt to balance the big movies with intimate independent films this year.
The directing list has giants like Scorsese, Nolan as top contenders. The other nominees are: Lanthimos, Justine Triet for ""Anatomy of a Fall"" and Jonathan Glazer for ""The Zone of Interest"".
Murphy is believed to be the frontrunner for the actor in a leading role Oscar but he will have to fight it out with Bradley Cooper (""Maestro""), Paul Giamatti (""The Holdovers""), Colman Domingo (""Rustin"") and Jeffrey Wright (""American Fiction""). Leonardo DiCaprio was a clear omission in the list.
Lily Gladstone's standout performance in ""Killers..."" rightfully earned her a nod in the actress in a leading role category alongside equally talented performers in Emma Stone for ""Poor Things"", Annette Bening for ""Nyad"", Carey Mulligan for ""Maestro"" and Sandra Huller for ""Anatomy of a Fall"".
It's Robert versus Robert in the supporting actor category with Robert De Niro (""Killers...""), and Robert Downey Jr for ""Oppenheimer"" battling it out alongside other contestants like Sterling K Brown for ""American Fiction"", Mark Ruffalo for ""Poor Things"" and Ryan Gosling for ""Barbie"".
Actresses in supporting roles are Emily Blunt for ""Oppenheimer"", America Ferrera for ""Barbie"", Jodie Foster for ""Nyad"", Danielle Brooks ""The Color Purple"" and Da'Vine Joy Randolph for ""The Holdovers"".
Though India's official entry ""2018"" is out of the international feature film race, ""To Kill a Tiger"", set in a small Indian village, secured a nomination in documentary feature category at the 2024 Academy Awards.
It is directed by Delhi-born Nisha Pahuja, an Emmy-nominated filmmaker based in Toronto. The documentary is nominated alongside ""Bobi Wine: The People's President"", ""The Eternal Memory"", ""Four Daughters"", and ""20 Days in Mariupol"".
""Past Lives"", one of the most loved films of 2023, directed by debutante Celine Song, not only earned a nomination in best picture category but also one in the original screenplay category. This segment also featured ""Anatomy of a Fall"", ""The Holdovers"", ""Maestro"" and ""May December"".
""Barbie"" is competing in the adapted screenplay category alongside ""American Fiction"", ""Oppenheimer"", ""Poor Things"" and ""The Zone of Interest"".	  	The nominees in the international feature category are “Io Capitano” (Italy), “Perfect Days” (Japan), “Society of the Snow” (Spain), “The Teachers’ Lounge” (Germany) and “The Zone of Interest” (United Kingdom). 	  	The nominations were also announced in animated feature and short categories, song, score, production design, visual effects, cinematography, film editing, production design, makeup and hairstyling, costume design, sound, documentary short film and live action short film.
The 96th Academy Awards will be held on March 10 at the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood in Los Angeles. Jimmy Kimmel is returning to host the ceremony for the second consecutive year. He has hosted the ceremony four times.

The CBI had issued summons to the two TMC leaders – Bappaditya Dasgupta and Debraj Chakraborty, who is also mayor in the council of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation – on Wednesday, asking them to appear before its officers for questioning.
""We are trying to find out how both of them were benefited by the irregularities in school jobs,"" the official told PTI.
Chakraborty, who is also the husband of Trinamul Congress MLA Aditi Munsi from the Rajarhat-Gopalpur constituency, and Dasgupta are being questioned together, he said.
The central probe agency had conducted search operations at the residences and offices of the two TMC councillors in November last year.
In October 2022, the CBI had questioned Chakraborty in connection with its investigation into incidents of post-poll violence in the state.
Several leaders of the ruling TMC, including former minister Partha Chatterjee, have been arrested in connection with the school jobs scam.

He and his supporters would enter Mumbai on Saturday for their planned protest at Azad Maidan ground if their demands were not met by tonight, he warned.
Addressing a rally at Shivaji Chowk in Vashi area of neighbouring Navi Mumbai where he arrived in the morning with thousands of his supporters, Jarange said he will stay put in Navi Mumbai for the day.
""I am taking a step backward,"" the 40-year-old activist said, adding that he had stopped having food from Friday and was taking only water.
""If an ordinance (to meet his various demands) is not promulgated tonight, I will come to Mumbai tomorrow,"" he said.
""I will take decision on going to Azad Maidan (in Mumbai) tomorrow at noon. Once I set out, there will be no turning back,"" the activist warned.
The free education policy should be amended so that boys also get free education besides girls, and all Marathas should get free education ""from KG to PG"" (kindergarten to post-graduation) until the entire community gets reservation, he said.
He has sought data of the 37 lakh Kunbi certificates issued by the state government, Jarange further said. Kunbi, an agrarian community, falls in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, and Jarange has been demanding Kunbi certificates for all Marathas.
""The government has told me that 54 lakh Kunbi records (records showing that a Maratha person/family belongs to Kunbi community) have been found, of which 37 lakh certificates have been given. Who are these people? We need data,"" he said.
""More than two crore Marathas will get OBC certificates after Kunbi records are found,"" Jarange said, adding that all Marathas should apply for the Kunbi certificate to avail of reservation. Once a person is established as belonging to the Kunbi caste, all his/her relatives should get reservation, he demanded.
Present government job recruitment should be carried out by keeping some seats reserved for the Marathas, he said.
He has also demanded withdrawal of cases registered against Maratha activists during the quota protests, he said.
The government has been trying to persuade Jarange not to proceed to Mumbai, sending delegations to hold talks with him. State education minister Deepak Kesarkar told reporters earlier in the day that Jarange's demands had been accepted, and would be fulfilled as per government procedure.
Jarange and his supporters reached the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) on the outskirts of Mumbai around 5 am by bikes, cars, jeeps, tempos and trucks.
He had announced on Thursday that he would start his hunger strike at Azad Maidan from Friday, despite Mumbai Police denying him permission to hold a hunger strike in the city by issuing a notice under section 149 of the Criminal Procedure Code that enables the police to prevent cognisable offences.
Police suggested that the protestors could gather at International Corporation Park Ground at Kharghar in Navi Mumbai.

Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister who spent days in the build up to Monday's pran-pratishtha at the under-construction Ram temple at Ayodhya, had made sure the narrative was focussed on one holy deity or the other. Leaders of most of these parties had turned down the invite to attend the grand ceremony held at Ayodhya but decided to turn up at other holy sites.
The success of the RSS, which will complete 100 years in 2025, and its political progeny the BJP lies in keeping the political narrative tied around a temple --- not the temples of modernity that the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had referred to at inauguration of the Bhakhra-Nangal dam seven decades ago.
In Calcutta, chief minister Mamata Banerjee, one of the main stakeholders in the Opposition block, visited Kalighat temple and performing aarti there, before leading a harmony march through the city streets with religious heads. She also visited a gurdwara, a church and a mosque on her way to the Park Circus Maidan where she addressed a gathering.

Earlier in the day,  Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi, on his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam’s Nagaon, was stopped from entering the Batadrava Temple, the birthplace of Srimanta Sankardeva, a 15th century scholar and saint from the north-eastern state. The Congress MP later staged a sit-in demonstration demanding he be allowed. The BJP-led state government did not budge.
“Will PM Modi now decide who can visit a temple and when? We do not want to create any problems, simply pray at the temple,” said Rahul. “I cannot go to Sankardeva’s birthplace but others can during a law and order crisis.""

Later, on his X handle Rahul wrote in Hindi: “Through devotion, Sankardeva had strung together the religious diversity in India, but I was stopped from showing my respect today. I sought his blessings from outside the temple. Our struggle for dignity against the brute show of power will continue.”
Rahul's party colleagues,  Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and his Himachal Pradesh counterpart Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu had no such trouble.
The Karnataka chief minister inaugurated a Sita Rama Lakshmana temple in Bangalore’s Mahadevpura around the same time when Modi was leading the show at Ayodhya. The chief minister also unveiled a 33-foot statue of Rama’s devotee, Lord Hanuman, at the temple premise. Official duties called Siddaramaiah to chair a meeting at the state secretariat to discuss the upcoming state budget.

Sukhu visited the ancient Hanuman temple at Jakhu hill near the state capital Shimla and offered prayers.
“Ramayana is incomplete without Hanuman. On the occasion of pran-pratishtha of Lord Ram, visited the Jakhu temple and bowed before Lord Hanuman and recited the Hanuman Chalisa (a hymn in praise of Hanuman),” Sukhu wrote on his Facebook page signing off with Jai Jai Sita Ram. Sukhu’s official residence was illuminated for the evening, where he was joined by actor Nana Patekar.
Though Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann of the Aam Aadmi Party spent the day at his official residence in Chandigarh sector-1, his party’s convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet colleagues in Delhi were busy celebrating the event, organising “shobha yatras” and “bhandaras”.
“Hearty congratulation and best wishes to all of you on this sacred occasion of the installation of Maryada Purushottam Lord Shri Ram in the grand temple. Hail Siya Ram,” Kejriwal wrote in a post on his X handle.
Former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the head of the Shiv Sena faction, has been camping in the Maharashtra holy town of Nashik since Sunday. On Monday, Thackeray offered prayers at the Kalaram temple, where B R Ambedkar had led a satyagraha in 1930, where the Dalits were not allowed to enter. Thackeray also performed aarti on the banks of river Godavari later in the evening.
Thackeray’s visit to Nashik has a political purpose as well. On Tuesday, the 98th birth anniversary of Balasaheb Thackeray, one of the staunchest Hindutva leaders, his son the former chief minister will launch the campaign for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Shiv Sena under Bal Thackeray was one of the oldest allies of the BJP along with the Akali Dal. Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena is in an alliance with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress party.
At least three other non-BJP chief ministers, two of them known atheists, Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan of the CPM and Tamil Nadu chief minister, the DMK’s MK Stalin, had nothing to do with any temples for the day.
On returning from Salem where the party’s youth wing conference was held on Sunday, Stalin had a government event to attend on Monday evening.
Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik could possibly be the only chief minister to have stayed in front of a television set at “Naveen Niwas”, his official residence in Bhubaneswar’s airport area, watching the proceedings at Ayodhya along with VK Pandian, his former principal secretary and now BJD leader.
“Witnessed the auspicious Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha being held at Ayodhya. Delighted to see the nation coming together with religious fervour for the pran pratishtha,” Patnaik posted on X along with an image.
The Kerala chief minister, who was reportedly at the state secretariat, released a strongly worded video statement, calling upon India’s political fraternity to reject the majoritarianism being pushed by the Sangh parivaar. CPM was the first party to reject the invite to Monday’s event.
“Secularism is the soul of the democratic republic of India. It has been part of our identity as a nation right from the days of our national movement. Those belonging to different faiths and those who were not part of any religion had taken an active part in our freedom struggle,” Vijayan said.
“This nation belongs to all people and all sections of Indian society in equal measures. Religion is a private affair and Indian Constitution has minced no words in stating that all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and have the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion, as those who have taken an oath to uphold the constitution of India we ought to ensure that every person within our territories enjoys this right in equal measures,” the Kerala chief minister said.
“At the same time, we cannot be promoting one religion above all others or demean any religion beneath every other. As our first prime minister Pt Jawaharlal Nehru has often opined Indian secularism means the separation of religion and state. We even have a strong tradition of maintaining that separation,” Vijayan reminded.
The Kerala chief minister observed: “However, of late the line that demarcates religion and state seems to be getting thinner and thinner. This is a major departure from the times when our constitutional office bearers have been cautioned from taking part in religious events as it would cast aspersions on our credentials as a secular state. Now we have come to a point in time, when the inauguration of a religious place of worship in the country is being celebrated as a state event.”
“Most of us have been invited to participate in the rituals by the trust in charge of it. Those who have pledged to preserve and protect our constitution let us reaffirm our commitment to its secular character by declining to participate in the event upholding our constitutional responsibilities. Let this serve as an opportunity to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood among all the people of India, transcending religious, linguistic, regional or sectional diversity. May India prosper further by developing scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform,” Vijayan said in the video."

The incident occurred at the bank branch at the ADB Chowk in the town, 320km northeast of the state capital. Incidentally, the place is hardly a couple of hundred metres from the residence of the local sub-divisional police officer.
The miscreants entered the bank branch and fired twice to terrorise the people present inside before moving ahead to collect the cash kept there.
“They (the miscreants) entered the branch a little after noon, gathered everyone present inside, including bank employees and customers, at gunpoint and locked them inside the ‘chest’ room (strong room). They grabbed the money that was available inside and escaped,” Axis Bank Araria branch manager Neeraj Kumar told reporters.
Sources said that the miscreants decamped with around Rs 90 lakh and also fired a couple of bullets from their weapons while looting the bank. However, there was no official statement from the bank about the amount looted till the time of filing the report. The police rushed to the spot after getting information about the incident.
Araria superintendent of police (SP) Ashok Kumar Singh told The Telegraph: “Six unknown miscreants arrived at the bank branch on three motorcycles and robbed it in 15 to 20 minutes. They took around Rs 90 lakh with them. We are trying to identify and arrest them.”
Singh added that the bank robbers had to flee due to the prompt action of the police.
“Nobody has been killed in the incident. We will soon arrest the people involved in the loot,” the Araria SP said.

All 16 benches, led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud, continued sessions until 4.30pm — 30 minutes beyond the standard 4pm closing time. The CJI’s court held regular proceedings.
Earlier, the Bar Council of India and Supreme Court Bar Association president Adish C. Aggarwala had requested a holiday for the Supreme Court, but Justice Chandrachud reportedly declined the plea. Justice Chandrachud, previously part of the constitution bench that overturned Allahabad High Court’s trisection of the disputed land on November 19, 2019, was part of the unanimous 2019 verdict confirming Hindu ownership of the land, leading to the formal consecration ceremony at the Ram temple.
TN order
Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta directed the Tamil Nadu government to ensure legal permission for processions, pujas and ceremonies related to the consecration ceremony. The order followed a complaint by a local BJP leader, Vinoj P. Selvan, alleging a ban on festivities by the state.
The Supreme Court expressed dissatisfaction with the reported blanket restrictions imposed by Tamil Nadu police, emphasising that religious activities could only be restricted in the case of genuine law and order concerns.
Solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, representing the Union government, supported the petitioner, asserting that such broad directives should not have been issued by the state. The bench, headed by Justice Khanna, criticised the rejection of permission based on the religious composition of certain areas and emphasised that applications should not be rejected arbitrarily. “If there is any law-and-order situation, the application (permission for procession) may be rejected. But this is not the way…,” Justice Khanna observed."

Later at night, Sarma tweeted that an FIR had been registered against Rahul and Congress leaders K.C. Venugopal and Kanhaiya Kumar for ""wanton acts of violence, provocation, damage to public property and assault on police personnel"".
The Congress leaders prevented the situation from getting out of hand by reverting to the officially assigned Yatra route. The police, too, exercised restraint to avert an escalation of the situation.
Going by the videos shared by the Congress, the fracas reflected the growing bitterness between the ruling BJP and the Opposition since the Yatra started its Assam leg on January 18. A few Congressmen and cops were hurt in the fracas and traffic on the busy NH37 was disrupted for close to an hour.
Several Congress leaders told The Telegraph that they forcefully removed the barricades not to enter the city but to register their protest against the hurdles the BJP-led government had put up to derail the peaceful Yatra.
The roadblocks included the denial of permission for grounds, padyatras and a visit to Batadrava Than, attacks on Congress leaders and supporters and intentionally organising government events linked to welfare schemes in districts through which the Yatra was scheduled to pass, the Congress said.
Responding to the allegations, a BJP leader said the chief minister had already said he would not allow the Yatra through the city as it would lead to traffic disruptions.
“Today, the Congressmen broke the barricades and created a law and order situation. Policemen had to retaliate in which a few Congressmen and policemen were injured. Moreover, Rahul Gandhi was not allowed to visit Batadrava Than because the management committee wanted him to visit after 3pm, expecting a rush of devotees on the occasion of the Ram temple inauguration in Ayodhya on Monday. The attacks, we have heard, have been carried out by former Congressmen.”
The BJP leader added: “Permission to use college and school fields during the Yatra was denied because the institutions are open. Government events are pre-decided, not fixed overnight. They are doing all this to garner political mileage.”
Both camps have engaged in personal attacks, with Rahul repeatedly accusing Sarma of being the most corrupt chief minister of the country and the BJP leader responding by accusing the Gandhi family of being the most corrupt in India.
Congressmen maintain that Sarma had been at his “provocative best” even before the Yatra entered the state. “Yes, the bitterness is growing but we are not to be blamed. Our people are also hurt by the treatment dished out to us. There were no problems in other states before entering Assam. Why?” a Congress leader said.
After the forceful removal of the barricades on Tuesday, Sarma posted on X: “These are not part of Assamese culture. We are a peaceful state. Such ‘Naxalite tactics’ are completely alien to our culture. I have instructed @DGPAssamPolice to register a case against your leader @RahulGandhi for provoking the crowd & use the footage you have posted on your handles as the evidence. Your unruly behaviour and violation of agreed guidelines have resulted in a massive traffic jam in Guwahati now.”
‘Intimidation’
Addressing the gathering from his bus top at the site of the fracas, Rahul said they had broken the barricades “but will not break the law”, reiterating that rallies of BJP president J.P. Nadda and the Bajrang Dal had been allowed to take the same route.
He said the Congress did not fear anybody and would defeat the BJP-RSS in Assam.
Praising the policemen on duty for doing their job, he said the Congress was not against them but against the “most corrupt chief minister” of the country.
At a media interaction held later at Hajo, about 40km from the city, before the Yatra proceeded to Barpeta in Lower Assam, Rahul said Sarma’s actions against the Yatra were eventually benefitting it.
“The publicity we are getting we would not have got otherwise. By doing this (putting up hurdles), the Assam chief minister and Union home minister Amit Shah are helping us. The Yatra has now become the main issue in Assam... by stopping me from going to the mandir (Batadrava Than), by stopping me from going to a college (USTM), stopping the padyatra. This is their style. Intimidation tactics. We don’t get intimidated. We are not scared of them. Our message of Nyay is reaching the people...”
He said there was “massive unemployment, massive corruption, massive price rise, farmers are struggling and no youth can get a job in this state. These are the issues we are raising and we are being very successful at it”."

The discom in BJP-ruled Rajasthan is represented by a virulent critic of the Narendra Modi-dispensation, Dushyant Dave.
A bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sanjay Kumar who heard the duo for over three hours, reserved its verdict on the maintainability of the miscellaneous application moved by Adani Power.
The Adani firm’s plea before the bench was in the news after the apex court on Tuesday pulled up its registry for not listing the case for unspecified reasons despite a judicial order to post it.
Dave was engaged by the previous Ashok Gehlot-government of the Congress in January last year.
Despite the BJP storming to power in the state, JVVNL chose to retain Dave reflecting his perceived expertise in corporate dispute and indispensability in handling the case. Dave is also a trenchant critique of the Adanis.
On the other side of the spectrum, Singhvi, one of the most formidable corporate lawyers and Congress MP, a party which has no love lost for the Adanis because of the latter’s “proximity” to the BJP government, appeared for the Gujarat-based entity.
However, it is an admitted fact in the legal fraternity that despite political or ideological differences, lawyers often appear for the other side.
Former attorney-general Mukul Rohatgi had appeared for political leaders such as Karnataka Congress strongman D.K. Sivakumar. Even as AG, Rohatgi had appeared for a liquor lobby in Kerala."

Shortly past noon at the same stage on Monday, Modi concluded — to a populace awash in celebration —  his telling. And doing so, he unveiled the absolute amalgamation of Church and State, a devotee nation whose decreed chief deity should henceforth be Ram.
It may not be entirely moot what this stimulation of religious giddiness means for the 2024 general election; the BJP’s numerical fortunes have clearly profited from its spearheading of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement over past decades. Under Modi the shoring up of sentiment, and its electoral translation, have become as robust a project as it is unabashed.
As he walked to the consecration rituals at a spanking Ramjanmabhoomi Temple this afternoon — in off-white silks and solitary, as his cameras often direct him to be — Modi wore the aura of raja and rishi combined.
When he spoke much later, having presided, mahant-like, over the Pran Pratistha rituals of the Ram Lalla idol under the central dome, it was often not clearly manifest that he was also elected head of a secular and vastly pluralist country, and that he not only swore allegiance to a secular Constitution but, on occasion, also respectfully placed his forehead to it.
“This is not just a divine temple, it is a temple of India’s vision, philosophy and direction,” Modi said, during a well-deliberated discourse that lasted a little more than half an hour. “It is a temple of national consciousness in the form of Ram.”
Gathering at the consecration ceremony of Ram Temple, in Ayodhya, Monday.                                                             PTI picture
He proceeded, thereon, to pronounce upon his countrywide audience, what sounded like a new ethic and ethos he’d have the nation adopt. “Ram is the faith of India, the foundation of India. Ram is the thought of India, the law of India. Ram is the consciousness of India, the contemplation of India. Ram is the prestige of India, the might of India. Ram is the flow, Ram is the influence. Ram is the norm and Ram is the policy.”
It would seem an understatement to call the invited league of celebrities and sadhus gathered before him merely “Ram-maya”, or suffused with Ram. So too of some of the scenes of heady festivity that popped in from far and near quarters of the country, Calcutta included.
The Prime Minister did refer to the Constitution in the Ayodhya context, but only as attestation of faith. “In India’s Constitution, in its first copy, Lord Ram is present. Even after the advent of the Constitution, legal battles over the existence of Lord Shri Ram continued for decades,” Modi said. “I express my gratitude to the judiciary of India, which upheld the dignity of justice. The temple of Lord Ram, synonymous with justice, was also built in a judicial manner.”
It perhaps deserves mention that in unanimously granting the once-disputed site at Ayodhya for the purposes of the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple, the Supreme Court also called the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, an “egregious violation of the rule of law”.
But in truth, the political stewing around Ayodhya began far before the BJP, or Narendra Modi, came anywhere close to power. It was in 1986, when Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister on the heftiest Lok Sabha majority ever awarded by the electorate, that the locks on the then Babri Masjid were undone and a local court allowed Hindu worshippers into the three-domed mosque where congregational namaz had ceased to take place.
In 1989, even while the title suit to the disputed 2.77 acres of land was in the Uttar Pradesh courts, the VHP performed the shilanyas rites of the would-be temple at an adjacent site. It was a widely contested and widely reported event, seen by many as a portent to what lay in the future.
Rajiv Gandhi was learnt to have been keen to participate in the shilanyas, but was persuaded to amend his intention. V.P. Singh had revolted by then, the government’s move to placate the Muslim clergy on the Shah Bano case had stirred up anger against alleged appeasement, Rajiv’s seat was shaken. He did, eventually, arrive in Faizabad, Ayodhya’s twin town, to launch his 1989 Lok Sabha campaign and promised “Ram rajya”. Much in vain, of course.
Ayodhya was a card, often waved or pushed, for political profit. It has travelled a long way since and become an emblazoned billboard that is unembarrassed about proclaiming Narendra Modi, an elected Prime Minister of constitutionally secular India, as Hindu hriday samrat.

But Modi wouldn’t have arrived here without the political astuteness and labours of Lal Krishna Advani, or even the skilled and relatively unabrasive sentiment-building by Murli Manohar Joshi. Both witnessed, first-hand, the demolition of the Babri Masjid; neither was encouraged to be in Ayodhya today, or at the ground-breaking ceremonies in August 2020.
The central star of both stages was Narendra Modi, the man who played dutiful major domo to the crusades Advani triggered following the Palampur Resolution of 1989, which made the construction of a Ram temple at the site of the Babri Masjid the arrowhead of the BJP’s objectives.
The Advani-led “Ram-Rath” campaigns swelled the BJP’s popularity but left the nation riven and incensed along barbed communal fences as never after the Partition. Thousands were killed along flashpoints that opened in the wake of Advani’s yatras, or were sparked by its flaming temper. Hinduism acquired the menace-edge and militancy of Hindutva; the kindly greeting of “Jai Siya Ram” morphed into the “Jai Shri Ram” war cry, although Modi himself has been signalling a return to “Jai Siya Ram” and “Jai Siyapati Ram”.

The Ramjanmabhoomi movement ignited a seminal moment in a secular nation’s lives and times. It shook the belief systems of society and politics, it echoed belligerently from the legislatures to the courthouses, it rent India’s streets bloodied, its populace rekindled with medieval bitterness and loathing. The day the cynically gathered mob at Ayodhya razed the Babri Masjid, in brazen violation of political pledge and underwritten guarantees to the Supreme Court, many deemed it the nation’s second Partition.
The Ramjanmabhoomi movement, Modi has in the past also likened to the Independence movement led by Mahatma Gandhi. He has omitted to mention that Gandhi’s was a painstakingly inclusive mission that brought all manner of Indians together to the common purpose of sending off an imperial regime. Today, Monday, January 22, 2024, sounded like the foundation rite of a nativist one."
E0SYBXQ9P8_OC6D5DVYO11JTFB,RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat preaches restraint over Ram temple sadhu's eulogy for PM Modi,"Piyush Srivastava Ayodhya Published 23.01.24, 06:14 AM","Piyush Srivastava Ayodhya Published 23.01.24, 06:14 AM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-preaches-restraint-over-ram-temple-sadhus-eulogy-for-pm-modi/cid/1995563,"A senior sadhu and office-bearer of the Ram temple trust used such eulogistic expressions for Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the consecration here on Monday that RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat apparently felt compelled to react.
Acharya Govind Dev Giri had described Modi as Shivaji reborn and a “Shrimant Yogi” (most holy person), narrating how the Prime Minister had volunteered to follow a much harder austerity regime than suggested in the run-up to the consecration.
Bhagwat, delivering a speech a little later, said one should “stay in one’s senses amid all this excitement”. He did not name Giri but referred to the claim about the “harder vrat” Modi had opted for.
Invited by temple trust general secretary Champat Rai to address the gathering, Giri had said: “I was asked to give the routine (for the ascetic regime to be followed) to the Prime Minister, who was to be the chief guest for the Pran Pratistha. I suggested some rituals and a three-day fast but he fasted for 11 days.
“We will never find another such tapasvi national leader who would opt to sleep on the ground for 11 days and observe every rule. Such religious rituals were followed in the past by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.”
Giri, who belongs to Maharashtra and studied the Vedas in Varanasi, said: “God has sent him (Shivaji) to us again. A Shrimant Yogi is standing before us…. He has purified himself to attend the sacredness of a sadhu.”
When Bhagwat’s turn to speak came, he said: “A new Bharat is bound to stand up and bring succour to the world. Today’s event symoblises this. You don’t have to explain your enthusiasm in the given situation… but it’s better to stay in one’s senses (hosh) amid all this excitement (josh).”
He added: “We heard today that the Prime Minister observed a harder vrat (rituals and fast) than suggested. I have known him for a long time, he is a tapasvi. But is it enough if he alone observes austerity?
“Ram Lalla has come to Ayodhya but why did he leave Ayodhya? According to the Ramayan, he left Ayodhya because there was discord in Ayodhya. Ayodhya has to be without tension, discord or confusion. He (Ram) went into vanavas for 14 years. He returned to Ayodhya after resolving discord across the world. Ram Lalla has come back again after 500 years.”
Modi had trained under Bhagwat’s father Madhukar Rao Bhagwat after joining the RSS as a young man.
“We salute his (Ram’s) tapasya, his sacrifice, his hard work hundreds of times. The PM observed austerity but now it’s our turn,” the RSS chief said.
He advocated unity and asked people to help others without expecting the government to do everything.
“We have to behave accordingly. We have to discard all the discords…. We have to discard our small differences…. Everybody is ours and this is why we are able to move forward,” he said.
“We have to behave in a coordinated manner with each other, which is the first truth of religion. Compassion is the second necessity, which includes service (seva) and charity (paropkar).”
Talking about his 11 days of austerity, Modi said in his speech: “During my 11 days of fast and rituals, I tried to visit places where Ram had stopped — Panchvati Dham in Nashik, the sacred Triprayar temple in Kerala, Lepakshi temple in Andhra Pradesh, Rangnathswami temple in Srirangam, Sriramanathswamy temple in Rameshwaram…. It is my good fortune that, with this purity in mind, I got the opportunity to travel from the sea to the Saryu.”
Modi did not mention Chitrakoot, where Ram had spent most of his time in the forest."

Gandhi’s Manipur-Mumbai Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra crossed over from Assam to Bengal at Baxirhat in Cooch Behar on Thursday morning where the leader was welcomed by Pradesh Congress chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. “I feel overjoyed to come to Bengal and I am here to listen to what you have to say, to stand with you in your troubles. I thank my leaders and workers in Bengal to have showered such love in welcoming me,” Gandhi said, ahead of a brief tour of the district in his bus.
Gandhi will take a two-day break from his Yatra on account of the Republic day celebrations, and is scheduled to resume his travels from the same venue on January 28 covering some 637 kilometers across eight districts and 10 Lok Sabha constituencies of Bengal.
“We have added the word ‘Nyay’ (Justice) to this Yatra since there is ‘Anyay’ (Injustice) taking place in this country,” the leader said and maintained: “The BJP and RSS are spewing hate, violence and injustice. That’s why the INDIA coalition is going to fight against injustice together.”
Gandhi’s statement assumes significance in the wake of Mamata Banerjee declaring that she would consider her role in the alliance only post Lok Sabha elections and that she would not want the Congress to interfere in the regional party strongholds like Bengal.
It was also interesting to witness Gandhi making that confidence-in-Opposition-unity statement while being flanked by Chowdhury who has consistently opposed electoral ties with the Trinamul and whose sharp criticisms of the Trinamul supremo in the wake of unity messages from the party high-command has been seen as the deal breaker for the Trinamul leadership.
Gandhi’s convoy, however, met with protestors at the Jorai More near the Assam-Bengal who stood by the roads holding placards which read “Didi is enough for Bengal '' and rhymed slogans against Adhir Chowdhury. Though the protestors carried no flags or any visible identification marks of a political party, they made little attempts to hide that they were local Trinamul workers.
“We have no opposition to Rahul Gandhi’s Nyay Yatra. In fact, we believe that this Yatra is necessary to strengthen the Opposition INDIA bloc across the country. But we also think that Adhir Chowdhury’s comments against the Bengal chief minister are detrimental to the cause of unity,” said Indrajit Pal, a Trinamul Congress worker leading the protesters.
“We are trying to give a message to Adhir babu that he should mend his attitude towards our leader and accept an alliance in Bengal under Mamata Banerjee’s leadership,” Pal said.
Congress general secretary in charge of communications Jairam Ramesh, on the other hand, countered Banerjee’s allegation that the Congress failed in its courtesy to even inform her about the Yatra passing through Bengal despite Trinamul being an integral part of the INDIA bloc. “Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had both written to her and e-mailed her informing her of Rahulji’s schedule in Bengal,” Ramesh said.
“She had been invited. Our leaders - Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi - all of them want leaders from TMC to come and participate in Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. We especially want CM Banerjee to come, even if it means managing to take 10-15 minutes out of her busy schedule. Her joining the Yatra will enhance its pride and impact,” Ramesh insisted.
“Mamata Banerjee is one of the most important pillars of the INDIA coalition. She is one of the tallest and most experienced leaders of this country. The Congress and its top leadership respects Mamata Banerjee and we all know that he holds a special place and recognition in the political landscape of this country,” the Congress spokesperson said and added: “We will find a solution to this impasse.”"

France is a key member of the 27-nation bloc European Union (EU).
In June 2022, India and the EU restarted the negotiations for the long-pending trade and investment agreement, after a gap of over eight years.
The negotiations for the ambitious free-trade agreement (FTA) were suspended in 2013 after several rounds of talks spanning six years.
Macron will be the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations on January 26 that would make him the sixth leader from France to grace the prestigious annual event. He will also visit Jaipur on Thursday.
The Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said that this visit is expected to provide an impetus to various domains of mutual interest, ranging from defence cooperation to economic ties, and from energy collaboration to space and nuclear partnerships.
The discussions will likely pave the way for new agreements and deepen existing cooperation, reflecting the dynamic and evolving nature of the India-France strategic partnership, it said.
""France, as India's eighth largest trading partner, aims to strengthen trade and investment ties. Both countries are negotiating an FTA (India-EU FTA) to further expand the relationship. They may discuss market access, intellectual property rights, and investment facilitation,"" GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said.
The seventh round of talks for the proposed agreement will be held from February 19-23 here.
Srivastava added that the discussions may include counterterrorism, intelligence sharing, and defence technology transfer.
""Potential collaboration is also expected in renewable energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable infrastructure development, underscoring their commitment to combating climate change,"" it said, adding that discussions between the two countries may also focus on enhancing multilateral cooperation on global health, food security, and climate change.
The growing space partnership between India's ISRO and France's CNES, including joint missions and technology transfer, will likely be a topic of discussion besides increasing cooperation in the civil nuclear segment, it said.

Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also said that the National Voters' Day reaffirms the power of the people to determine their own destiny by exercising the freedom to elect their own representatives.
In a post on X, AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh said every year January 25 is celebrated as the National Voters' Day by the Election Commission of India.
But sadly, this independent institution has been simply refusing to meet a delegation of leaders belonging to the INDIA bloc who only want to put across their point of view on the greater use of VVPATs when voters cast their vote, he said.
""VVPAT is nothing but Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail. This persistent refusal of the ECI is an ANYAY that strikes at the very foundations of our democracy, the right of the voter to verify that their vote has been recorded accurately,"" Ramesh said.
Kharge also said, ""We are proud that the election process of Universal Adult Suffrage, has deepened to the grassroots, Panchayat and Urban Local Bodies, as our towering founders had imagined.""  	""India's tryst with Democracy is a story which needs to be told time and again, but any complacency enables authoritarian tendencies to gain ground,"" he said.
""Today, we are at a juncture where safeguarding the independence of our institutions is paramount, so that Democracy is protected and the Constitution is upheld,"" Kharge said.

The decision to deploy the Army was taken in a meeting of the cabinet that was chaired by caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar.
The summary for deployment of troops was moved by the Ministry of Interior.
“The federal cabinet approved the deployment of Pakistan Army and Civil Armed Forces troops for the peaceful conduct of general elections on the recommendation of the Interior Ministry,” according to an official statement issued at the end of the cabinet meeting.
“These forces will perform duties at sensitive constituencies and polling stations and will also act as a rapid response force,” the statement further said.
The decision comes after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) sought 277,000 Army personnel to be deployed across the country to maintain security, and law and order situation across the country on February 8 when over 126 million Pakistani voters cast their votes.
The armed forces are deployed under the Constitution in aid of the civil administration to provide security or any other services required by the government which authorises any such deployment through an approval by the cabinet.
The Army already announced that it was ready to provide any kind of help to carry out the electoral exercise as the country faces the rising threat of militancy.
The year 2023 was one of the worst since 2015 due to terror-related incidents.
Earlier this month, an independent candidate, Kaleemullah Khan — who was eyeing to contest polls for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly's PK-104 — was shot dead in the restive North Waziristan district.
Also, at the same time a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader, Shah Khalid, was also killed in Swabi after unidentified assailants riding a motorcycle opened fire on his car.
Owing to the precarious situation, caretaker Prime Minister Kakar set up a high-level committee to oversee security for the polls.

At a rally organised by the JD(U) here on the 100th birth anniversary of late Karpoori Thakur, Kumar made it clear that the highest civilian honour was ""fulfilment of only one of our many demands"".
""It has been long since I have been organising functions in the honour of Karpoori Thakur and writing letters to the Centre, be it the previous Congress regime or the current one, requesting Bharat Ratna for the Jan Nayak. The move is proof of the realisation that you cannot go far without respecting his contributions"", said Kumar, in an oblique reference to the BJP's attempt to make a dent in the JD(U)'s support base of extremely backward classes.
Kumar disclosed that before attending the rally, he had visited Karpoori Thakur's ancestral village in Samastipur as he ""has been doing for so many years on his birth anniversary"", where met the late leader's family members, including son Ramnath Thakur, the JD(U)'s national general secretary and leader in the Rajya Sabha, who was present on the dais.
""I was told by my brother Ramnath Thakur that the PM called him up (after announcement of Bharat Ratna). However, he did not bother to call me. I would like to extend my thanks to him, nonetheless, through the media persons present here. I would like to say to him, you may say that you took the step just like that, without taking into account what we did,"", said Kumar, the longest-serving CM of Bihar in his trademark style.
The JD(U) leader, who snapped ties with the BJP less than two years ago and has emerged as a key figure in the opposition INDIA bloc, also dropped hints that contrary to speculations in a section of the media, he did not consider the development as an ice-breaker which could pave the way for his return to the NDA in the foreseeable future.
""You all know that we have raised many demands before the Centre. Only one of them has been fulfilled with Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur. I wish that the needful is done with regard to other demands as well"", he said while addressing the rally.
Kumar's litany of grievances includes special status for Bihar, a country-wide caste census and central status to Patna University.
He also pointed out that it was ""Karpoori Thakur, who as Bihar chief minister ""recognised the Extremely Backward Classes as a separate category for the first time anywhere in the country and introduced quotas for them"".
""The EBCs are very poor and have a large population. We took that forward. I hope that the most backward classes would be identified across the country and targeted measures for their uplift will be taken,"" Kumar said.
The JD(U) supremo, who counts on the imposition of ban on liquor as a major step his government took nearly eight years ago, following demand from the state's women, also pointed out, ""It was Karpoori Thakur who first introduced prohibition in Bihar. But his government was toppled before completion of its term and sharaab-bandi was, subsequently, done away with"".

EGOP0GI0X7_NF8T5R9KI1AGTQX,"Assam: After CM’s delay plea, attack on Yatra leaves state Congress president with bleeding nose","Umanand Jaiswal Guwahati Published 22.01.24, 06:25 AM","Umanand Jaiswal Guwahati Published 22.01.24, 06:25 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/assam-after-cms-delay-plea-attack-on-yatra-leaves-state-congress-president-with-bleeding-nose/cid/1995341,"The Assam chief minister on Sunday asked Rahul Gandhi to delay his visit to Srimanta Sankardeva’s birthplace Bordowa till the Ram temple consecration was over in Ayodhya, hours before the Nyay Yatra faced an attack from suspected BJP members that left the Assam Congress president with a bleeding nose.
The Bordowa Than management committee joined chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in asking Rahul to postpone his visit till late afternoon, but the Congress remained firm about it taking place on Monday morning.
Tempers ran high on the Yatra route in Sonitpur district, with attacks on senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh’s car and on state Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah.
Borah, waving his blood-stained handkerchief at a meeting after the attack, said: “We will fight. We gave our blood today, we will give our life if needed.”
He said BJP goons had ""attacked"" him when he tried to stop an assault on the Yatra bus. A Congress worker, Hridaya Das, was injured, a party leader said.
A Congress leader from Sonitpur district has lodged a police complaint over the attack on Borah. The police said they had started a probe.
Chief minister Sarma has asked the police to probe the attack on Ramesh’s vehicle.
Sometime before the attack, Sarma, addressing a media conference in Guwahati, requested Rahul to go to Bordowa Than (in Nagaon district) after 2pm, by when the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya would be over.
“I will request Rahul Gandhi... he can go to Batadrava (Bordowa) Than tomorrow but it should not happen like there is a competition between the Ram temple and Batadrava,” the chief minister said.
“We will feel good or else there will be two windows on TV. We cannot stop anyone from going but those two windows on TV will go against the image of Assam. One side of the TV will show the Ram temple consecration and the other Batadrava.”
He added: “There is no competition (between the two places) and he (Rahul) should not come and create that competition.... There should be no double window (on TV). That will be very sad for the people of Assam.”
Sarma said it pained him that Rahul had chosen to go to Bordowa on Monday, and also pass through Jagiroad and Morigaon, which are “all sensitive places”.
“They should have avoided these places. I will not ask them officially because they will create a tamasha. Police will be deployed, and we will ensure that there is no conflict or clashes because in their Yatra a particular community comes out (an allusion to the ‘Miya’ or Bengali Muslim community),” he said.
“I am feeling a little perturbed why Rahul Gandhi deliberately chose Morigaon district where the 1983 Nellie massacre took place. He should have avoided Morigaon and Jagiroad because of the Nellie massacre.... From the law-and-order point of view, it should have been avoided. I would have been happy.”
A large number of Bengali-speaking Muslims were killed during the Nellie massacre.
Sarma made two requests of Rahul. “If you can avoid Morigaon, Nagaon and Jagiroad tomorrow, it will be good. They could have taken rest for one day. And don’t pitch Batadrava in competition with the Ram temple because I have crosschecked that the Batadrava Satra Samiti has not invited him.
“I saw a news (item) in the national media yesterday that while Modi will do Pran Pratistha in the Ram temple, Rahul Gandhi will be at the birthplace of Sankardeva. It is a wrong analogy because no one has invited him. He wants to go on his own.”
Soon after his media interaction, the Sri Sri Batadrava Than Parichalana Samiti said Rahul could visit after 3pm.
In a letter to the local MLA, the Samiti said it had decided at an emergency meeting to welcome Rahul but there was a possibility of a large number of devotees turning up at the Than on the occasion of the Ram temple consecration. Keeping that in mind, the Samiti told the MLA that it would not be able to allow Rahul’s visit before 3pm.
A Congress leader told The Telegraph that Rahul would go to the Than at 7am on Monday, as decided, to pay his homage to the 15th-century saint-reformer-playwright Sankardeva.
Asked about the Samiti statement that Rahul should come after 3pm, she said no permission was required to visit a temple or any place of worship. She added that the Congress had informed the administration about the visit well in advance.
Rahul’s visit to Bordowa Than is significant, a Congress leader said, as it would “send” a message to the Hindutva brigade considering it’s a pilgrimage site like Ayodhya.
“It is at Bordowa that Sankardeva founded and propagated Ekasarana Dharma, which stresses devotion to a single God and rejects the caste system and societal hierarchies,” the leader said.
She said that whether or not Rahul visited the Than, the BJP would make an issue out of it.
“They will say Rahul Gandhi did not visit the Than despite passing through Nagaon. Rahulji will be visiting in the morning; that is final,” she said.
The attack on Borah seemed to have galvanised the 15-party United Opposition Forum in Assam, which includes the Congress.
On Sunday night, the Forum said all leaders of the alliance would address a media meeting on the attack on Borah, indicating that Sunday’s developments were likely to have an impact on Monday.
Sarma has asked meat and fish shops to remain shut till 4pm on Monday, restaurants not to serve non-vegetarian food till 2.30pm, and government educational institutions to remain closed through the day, triggering much debate.
He has also requested business establishments to remain closed till 2.30pm on Monday and churches and mosques to hold special prayers. A dry day has been declared.
Bengal campaign
On Sunday, the Congress launched a campaign in the districts of Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and North Dinajpur, inviting people to join the yatra that is slated to enter Bengal on January 25."

Khan also said that institutions of higher education need to be autonomous and free of outside interference that could lead the youth to take part in activities that ""pollute the academic environment."" His statements come in the wake of vehement protests against him by the CPI(M)'s student wing SFI, over appointments made by him to senate of some universities, and his displeasure with the ruling Left in the state over alleged political interference in the functioning of varsities by the government.
Khan, leading the Republic Day celebrations at the Central Stadium in the state capital, said that society should not allow group rivalries or internal struggles for power to affect governance as it would set a bad example for the future generations.
The Governor further said that education was the chief means by which a society is transformed and it is the only effective method to purge the mind of old prejudices.
""The future depends on what we are in our thoughts and actions. For this, we need institutions of higher education which are truly autonomous and free from any outside interference that leads the youth to engage in activities which pollute the academic environment,"" he said at the event also attended by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.
Cooperative federalism requires support from all stakeholders including the states of the union, he added.
Khan also referred to the various accomplishments and laurels achieved by Kerala in various sectors, including startups, health and tourism.
The laurels and achievements of Kerala he referred to were -- becoming one of the best performers in the Start-up Ranking among the states, securing the first position in the National Food Safety Index, success in eradicating extreme poverty, winning the National Healthcare and Arogya Manthan awards and coming second in the Performance Grading Index (PGI) report for school education.
The Governor said that the people of a state which has made the country proud through such accomplishments were obligated to nurture a healthier democracy that encourages constructive public discourse in a spirit of mutual respect and deeper understanding.
""Dissent and differences of opinion are essential ingredients of democratic functioning. But dissent degenerating into violence, be it physical or verbal, is a betrayal of democracy and symbol of human failure.
""As a society, we should not allow group rivalries or internal struggles for power to affect governance, thereby setting a bad example for the youth."" Khan said.
He said that the need of the hour was to foster in society a culture of greater civility, empathy, and dialogue that ""reposes faith in the power of argument and not in the argument of power."" Khan also stressed upon the need to be more humane.
He said that through right education and austerities a man can become a ""superman"" and a mind can turn into a ""super-mind"" which can ""see One in many and many in One"".
""When one realises that the state of diversity of living things is rooted in the One, and that their manifestation is also from That One, then one becomes identified with the Supreme Soul.
""That realisation alone can infuse energy and wealth of spirit into our activities as we await the dawn of a greatly progressive and extraordinarily powerful India."" the Governor said, referring to the verses from the Bhagavad Gita.
He highlighted the strides made by the country in various sectors, including defence, healthcare, drug manufacturing, agriculture, infrastructure development, start-ups and welfare of the poor.
The Governor said that this spurt in production, growth and export was due to the spirit of 'Aatmanirbharta' which had helped the country surmount the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Today, we as a nation take immense pride in the soft-landing of India's Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the Moon's South Pole, a feat which no other country could achieve before. Mission Gaganyaan and the success of Aditya L-1, the first space based Indian mission to study the Sun, have also added to our national prestige,"" he further said.
India's presidency of the G-20, the Parliament passing the Nari Shakti Vandan Act, the country's upsurge as the world's preeminent nation in terms of real-time payments, our exports surpassing the USD 400 billion mark and overtaking Europe in terms of 5G user base were accomplishments that signal our potential for greater progress, Khan said.
He said that the 'Make in India' strategy was a success and the same was visible in the indigenous semi-high-speed train Vande Bharat as well as the Kochi Water Metro, the first of its kind in India, operating on electric hybrid mode.
Khan further said that genuine concern for the welfare of the citizens has been the highlight of the country's journey towards the goal of Viksit Bharat 2047.
""The Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra which reached even the remotest corners of the nation created awareness about the Government’s welfare schemes and ensured access to clean cooking fuel, Ayushman Health Cards and insurance to lakhs of people,"" he said.
After unfurling the national flag and inspecting the parade, the Governor received the salute from the various police and armed forces contingents who vigorously marched past the podium.
Amidst a running feud between the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Kerala government and the Raj Bhavan, Khan in an unusual move on Thursday had read out only the concluding paragraph of the government's customary policy address in the Assembly.

The Tamil Nadu Government will then take necessary action on the disposal of these gold and diamond jewellery which were part of the material evidence in the disproportionate assets case against Jayalalithaa and others.
The trial was held in Karnataka on the direction of the Supreme Court and therefore all material evidence is in the Karnataka treasury now under the custody of the court.
Judge H A Mohan presiding over the XXXII Additional City Civil & Sessions court passed the order on Monday.
The court had earlier held that the kins of Jayalalithaa were not entitled for the properties which are confiscated by the State. The Special CBI Court had thus rejected the petition filed by J Deepa and J Deepak, the niece and nephew of Jayalalithaa, respectively.
Ordering the transfer of the jewels to the Tamil Nadu Government, the Special Court judge said: “Instead of auctioning the jewels, it is better to transfer the same to Tamil Nadu by handing over the same through the Department of Home, State of Tamil Nadu.""         The Court then issued the direction that the Tamil Nadu Home Department authorise  ""competent persons preferably in the rank of Secretary along with police to come and collect the jewels.”        In the same order, the Special Court ordered the payment of Rs five crore to Karnataka for the expenses of the trial conducted in the State. The payment will be made from a fixed deposit in an account related to Jayalalithaa in the State Bank of India branch in Chennai.
The disproportionate assets trial against Jayalalithaa, her former close aide V Sasikala, V N Sudhakaran, who is the disowned foster son of Jayalalithaa, and Sasikala's sister-in-law J Ilavarasi was conducted by the Special Court in Bengaluru.

ES75EIIZ50_LY0YJZ6V5NP6FTU,RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat preaches restraint over Ram temple sadhu's eulogy for PM Modi,"Piyush Srivastava Ayodhya Published 23.01.24, 06:14 AM","Piyush Srivastava Ayodhya Published 23.01.24, 06:14 AM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-preaches-restraint-over-ram-temple-sadhus-eulogy-for-pm-modi/cid/1995563,"A senior sadhu and office-bearer of the Ram temple trust used such eulogistic expressions for Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the consecration here on Monday that RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat apparently felt compelled to react.
Acharya Govind Dev Giri had described Modi as Shivaji reborn and a “Shrimant Yogi” (most holy person), narrating how the Prime Minister had volunteered to follow a much harder austerity regime than suggested in the run-up to the consecration.
Bhagwat, delivering a speech a little later, said one should “stay in one’s senses amid all this excitement”. He did not name Giri but referred to the claim about the “harder vrat” Modi had opted for.
Invited by temple trust general secretary Champat Rai to address the gathering, Giri had said: “I was asked to give the routine (for the ascetic regime to be followed) to the Prime Minister, who was to be the chief guest for the Pran Pratistha. I suggested some rituals and a three-day fast but he fasted for 11 days.
“We will never find another such tapasvi national leader who would opt to sleep on the ground for 11 days and observe every rule. Such religious rituals were followed in the past by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.”
Giri, who belongs to Maharashtra and studied the Vedas in Varanasi, said: “God has sent him (Shivaji) to us again. A Shrimant Yogi is standing before us…. He has purified himself to attend the sacredness of a sadhu.”
When Bhagwat’s turn to speak came, he said: “A new Bharat is bound to stand up and bring succour to the world. Today’s event symoblises this. You don’t have to explain your enthusiasm in the given situation… but it’s better to stay in one’s senses (hosh) amid all this excitement (josh).”
He added: “We heard today that the Prime Minister observed a harder vrat (rituals and fast) than suggested. I have known him for a long time, he is a tapasvi. But is it enough if he alone observes austerity?
“Ram Lalla has come to Ayodhya but why did he leave Ayodhya? According to the Ramayan, he left Ayodhya because there was discord in Ayodhya. Ayodhya has to be without tension, discord or confusion. He (Ram) went into vanavas for 14 years. He returned to Ayodhya after resolving discord across the world. Ram Lalla has come back again after 500 years.”
Modi had trained under Bhagwat’s father Madhukar Rao Bhagwat after joining the RSS as a young man.
“We salute his (Ram’s) tapasya, his sacrifice, his hard work hundreds of times. The PM observed austerity but now it’s our turn,” the RSS chief said.
He advocated unity and asked people to help others without expecting the government to do everything.
“We have to behave accordingly. We have to discard all the discords…. We have to discard our small differences…. Everybody is ours and this is why we are able to move forward,” he said.
“We have to behave in a coordinated manner with each other, which is the first truth of religion. Compassion is the second necessity, which includes service (seva) and charity (paropkar).”
Talking about his 11 days of austerity, Modi said in his speech: “During my 11 days of fast and rituals, I tried to visit places where Ram had stopped — Panchvati Dham in Nashik, the sacred Triprayar temple in Kerala, Lepakshi temple in Andhra Pradesh, Rangnathswami temple in Srirangam, Sriramanathswamy temple in Rameshwaram…. It is my good fortune that, with this purity in mind, I got the opportunity to travel from the sea to the Saryu.”
Modi did not mention Chitrakoot, where Ram had spent most of his time in the forest."

The company has sold 54,000 EVs till the third quarter of the fiscal, with sales shooting up from 1,900 units in the first year to 19,000 in the second to over 50,000 units in the third year.
The company on Sunday said it will increase prices of its entire passenger vehicle range, including EVs, by an average of 0.7 per cent with effect from next month.This increase will be effective February 1, 2024, and is being taken to partially offset the rise in input cost, Tata Motors said in a statement.
The company sells a range of passenger vehicles including Punch, Nexon and Harrier.
“EV adoption is taking off in the small towns which already have the experience of the electric two-wheeler. The inherent benefits such as no dearth of parking space and adoption of solar power make EV adoption in smaller cities a breeze,” said Vivek Srivatsa, chief commercial officer of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility (TPEM) Limited.
He said buyers in smaller towns are charging their vehicles through the solar grid.
The Punch EV will accelerate adoption because it is suitable for rural roads. The two battery options, with 315km and 421km range, will boost adoption, Srivatsa said.
The company is introducing a separate sales channel for its EVs, with two running in Gurgaon.
“We will roll out our EV dealerships in the rest of the country soon. The behaviour of EV buyers is different from ICE (internal combustion engine) buyers. The approach of EV buyers is like buying a tech gadget. They are very community-oriented, they want to hang out with each other and share feedback with us and among themselves. There is no cross-shopping of EV and ICE vehicles. That is why we decided to have exclusive EV outlets,” said Srivatsa.
Asked about the pace of adoption and the range anxiety, Srivatsa said: “Battery sizes will increase and a range over 400km is a reality. Larger battery sizes and different options for battery sizes will help in enhancing adoption.”"

Saikia, in a memorandum to the Governor, alleged that the present state government under Himanta Biswa Sarma is creating ''serious administrative blockade and also resorted to unleashing unruly lumpens to sabotage the peaceful Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra by brute of physical force and criminal attack against our senior leaders."" 	During the yatra on Sunday, the vehicle carrying senior AICC leader Jairam Ramesh was forcefully stopped by supporters of the ruling BJP and they verbally abused him and tore the stickers on his car, he said.
Thereafter, at Jamugurihat, Bora was physically assaulted by BJP supporters leading to a bleeding nose while about 20-25 unruly people even targeted Rahul Gandhi and at various places even journalists were not spared, Saikia said.
The Congress MLA from Nazira alleged that the police personnel remained silent spectators from a safe distance.
''Even prior to these incidents, Sarma's BJP government has been using police and civil administration to disrupt the yatra. At the meeting grounds and during padyatras, anti-yatra posters and banners were displayed under the protection of Assam Police,"" he alleged.
The Congress leader said they had complained to the DGP but he tweeted that he had arranged for all kinds of protection during the yatra.
''This is, however, a blatant lie as no such arrangement is witnessed on the ground'', he said.
The Congress had applied for necessary permission for the yatra and completed formalities but the nervous state government has indulged in administrative delays to create all possible hurdles, Saikia alleged.
''In view of this serious law and order situation prevailing in Assam at present due to the lumpens of the ruling party, we have brought the matter to your kind attention and demand a judicial inquiry into the physical attack on our PCC president'', he added.

He and his supporters would enter Mumbai on Saturday for their planned protest at Azad Maidan ground if their demands were not met by tonight, he warned.
Addressing a rally at Shivaji Chowk in Vashi area of neighbouring Navi Mumbai where he arrived in the morning with thousands of his supporters, Jarange said he will stay put in Navi Mumbai for the day.
""I am taking a step backward,"" the 40-year-old activist said, adding that he had stopped having food from Friday and was taking only water.
""If an ordinance (to meet his various demands) is not promulgated tonight, I will come to Mumbai tomorrow,"" he said.
""I will take decision on going to Azad Maidan (in Mumbai) tomorrow at noon. Once I set out, there will be no turning back,"" the activist warned.
The free education policy should be amended so that boys also get free education besides girls, and all Marathas should get free education ""from KG to PG"" (kindergarten to post-graduation) until the entire community gets reservation, he said.
He has sought data of the 37 lakh Kunbi certificates issued by the state government, Jarange further said. Kunbi, an agrarian community, falls in the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category, and Jarange has been demanding Kunbi certificates for all Marathas.
""The government has told me that 54 lakh Kunbi records (records showing that a Maratha person/family belongs to Kunbi community) have been found, of which 37 lakh certificates have been given. Who are these people? We need data,"" he said.
""More than two crore Marathas will get OBC certificates after Kunbi records are found,"" Jarange said, adding that all Marathas should apply for the Kunbi certificate to avail of reservation. Once a person is established as belonging to the Kunbi caste, all his/her relatives should get reservation, he demanded.
Present government job recruitment should be carried out by keeping some seats reserved for the Marathas, he said.
He has also demanded withdrawal of cases registered against Maratha activists during the quota protests, he said.
The government has been trying to persuade Jarange not to proceed to Mumbai, sending delegations to hold talks with him. State education minister Deepak Kesarkar told reporters earlier in the day that Jarange's demands had been accepted, and would be fulfilled as per government procedure.
Jarange and his supporters reached the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) on the outskirts of Mumbai around 5 am by bikes, cars, jeeps, tempos and trucks.
He had announced on Thursday that he would start his hunger strike at Azad Maidan from Friday, despite Mumbai Police denying him permission to hold a hunger strike in the city by issuing a notice under section 149 of the Criminal Procedure Code that enables the police to prevent cognisable offences.
Police suggested that the protestors could gather at International Corporation Park Ground at Kharghar in Navi Mumbai.

Radhakrishnan on Thursday said that registering an FIR against senior CRPF officers, a day after the Enforcement Directorate’s questioning of chief minister Hemant Soren, is a government’s “mistake”.
The local administration on January 21 lodged an FIR against senior CRPF officers for “violating” prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC during the ED questioning of Soren in connection with a money laundering case linked to an alleged land scam.
Speaking to the reporters, on the sideline of the celebration of National Voters’ Day here, Radhakrishnan said: “Unnecessarily, a large gathering in front of the CM’s house had been organised. That is why CRPF had to come. This was the government’s mistake. This type of attitude should be stopped.”
The Ranchi district administration had imposed prohibitory orders near Soren’s official residence, where he faced the ED questioning on January 20 from 7am to 11pm, disallowing any demonstration and public meetings.
An FIR was also lodged against JMM workers and “Bhim Army” supporters for violating the orders.
Reacting to the governor’s statement, the ruling JMM termed it “unexpected and unnecessary”. The party said the governor should express his concern in a procedural manner and not on a public platform. “Otherwise, it will be understood that this statement is motivated by political motive, which is strongly condemnable,” the party said in the release issued by JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya.
The ruling JMM on Sunday had alleged that around 500 CRPF personnel tried to enter Soren’s residence without “any permission” when he was being questioned. The JMM had sought an investigation over the deployment of central forces.
The party claimed it was illegal and aimed at provoking Soren’s supporters demonstrating nearby so that they attack the CRPF personnel. PTI"

The Bengal leg of the Yatra will begin a day after Trinamul Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee's announcement that her party will contest the upcoming Lok Sabha polls independently in West Bengal.
Both Congress and the TMC are constituents of the INDIA bloc formed to take on the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in the 2024 Parliamentary elections.
The Yatra is scheduled to enter West Bengal through Bakshirhat in Cooch Behar district in the northern part of the state.
Following a two-day hiatus on January 26-27, it will navigate through Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Uttar Dinajpur, and Darjeeling districts before entering Bihar on January 29.
Re-entering West Bengal on January 31 via Malda, it will pass through Murshidabad, both Congress stronghold districts, before departing the state on February 1.
The Bengal leg of the yatra spans 523 km across six districts and six Lok Sabha constituencies—Darjeeling, Raigunj, North and South Malda, and two in Murshidabad—over five days.
This marks Rahul Gandhi's first visit to the state since the April-May 2021 assembly polls.
Former state Congress president Pradip Bhattacharya expressed optimism, stating, ""We are hopeful that the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra of Rahul Ji will give a new lease of life to Bengal's Congress unit. This Yatra will not only help us organisationally but also electorally ahead of the Lok Sabha polls."" 	On entering the state on Thursday afternoon, Gandhi will lead a padayatra from Maa Bhawani Chowk in Cooch Behar town.
The Yatra will continue by bus at Gokshadanga before reaching Falakata in the Alipurduar district for an overnight halt.
A recess has been planned on January 26 and 27, with the yatra resuming from Falakata on January 28, passing through Jalpaiguri, Siliguri, Naxalbari in Darjeeling district, and Uttar Dinajpur district.
The CPI (M) and Left parties, allies of the Congress within the state and the INDIA bloc at the national level, are expected to join the march.
However, TMC has decided to abstain, citing a lack of information about the Yatra.
Banerjee said, ""As a gesture of courtesy, did they (Congress) let me know that they are coming to Bengal for the Yatra? I am not aware of it."" 	""It seems the TMC is trying to help the BJP in the state,"" senior Congress leader Deepa Dasmunsi said.
In a setback to the opposition INDIA bloc, TMC boss Banerjee announced on Wednesday that her party would contest the upcoming Lok Sabha polls independently.
The surprise move left the grand old party stunned. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said in Assam, ""No one can imagine the existence of the opposition INDIA bloc without West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee."" 	The CPI (M)-led Left Front, Congress, and the TMC are part of the 28-party INDIA bloc.
However, in West Bengal, the CPI(M) and Congress have aligned against the TMC and BJP.
The Yatra, which started in Manipur on January 14, is scheduled to cover 6,713 km in 67 days while passing through 110 districts in 15 states, before culminating in Mumbai on March 20.

“My RELIGION has not taught me to accept and embrace a place of worship, whether it be a MANDIR, MASJID, CHURCH or GURUDWARA, which has been built over HATRED, VIOLENCE and the dead bodies of innocents. Period!” Abhishek posted on X.
A Trinamul MP said chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew attempted to underscore the history of the 16th century Babri Masjid at the site, demolished by saffron camp constituents on December 6, 1992.
“While the BJP and others in the saffron ecosystem are glorifying the event, our leader issued a simple reminder to the nation,” said a senior Trinamul leader.
On Monday, Abhishek’s party will conduct a number of unity and amity exercises across the state. His aunt will visit Kalighat temple and offer puja at the shrine before taking part in a 3.9km march, visiting several places of worship of various religions on her way from the Hazra crossing, before an integration rally at the Park Circus Maidan.
A source said the Trinamul dispensation was putting its best foot forward to bring representatives from all religions to the exercise, to showcase the power of its inclusive politics.
Trinamul will hit the streets with such interfaith rallies in all 341 blocks of the state. Trinamul leaders have been asked to visit major places of worship of various communities before taking out those rallies.
A Trinamul leader said apart from people from different faiths, several outfits of various Hindu castes and sects would take part in the interfaith rally in Calcutta.
“We are trying to bring all social and religious outfits of the state to the interfaith rallies. At least a dozen such organisations have already supported the move and ensured participation in the rallies in Calcutta and districts,” said a leader.
Suman Banerjee, the secretary of Bangiyo Sanatan Brahman Sangathan, an organisation of 70,000 Hindu priests, has decided to join the rallies.
“At least 3,000 people from our outfit will take part in the chief minister’s rally in Calcutta. Our members will also participate in interfaith rallies in various blocks across Bengal,” he said.
Tapasili Federation, a national outfit of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the OBCs, has also sent a letter to Mamata, pledging their participation.
“The representatives of various SC and ST communities, including those from Matua and Rajbanshi communities will take part in the interfaith rallies. A delegation of around 500 people will take part in Mamata Banrjee’s march,” said Mrityunjay Mallik, the national president of the Federation."

Balaji New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 06:01 AM",20230124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/supreme-court-rap-on-four-gujarat-policemen-for-publicly-flogging-five-muslim-men/cid/1995771,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday pulled up four Gujarat police personnel for publicly flogging five Muslim men on the charge of obstructing a garba event in Kheda district last year, but stayed the 14-day imprisonment handed down by Gujarat High Court to the cops.
“What kind of atrocities? Tying the people to poles and beating them in full public view and then you expect this court to save you?” said the bench of Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Sandeep Mehta, addressing senior advocate Sidharth Dave representing the cops.
The accused officers — A.V. Paramar, D.B. Kumavat, Laxmanisnh Kanaksinh Dabhi and Rajubhai Dabhi — had received a 14-day sentence on October 19 last year under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, following a petition from the victims. The victims had earlier moved the high court citing the apex court’s judgment in the D.K. Basu vs State of West Bengal case (1996) case in which directions had been passed to the police against any custodial violence or excesses against suspects or accused persons.
The accused officers appealed to the apex court, arguing that they were already facing criminal and departmental proceedings, making the contempt punishment unwarranted.
The bench rejected the argument, with Justice Gavai questioning the police’s authority: “So you (police) have an authority under law? To tie people to polls and beat them?”
The other judge, Justice Mehta, interjected to add: “… And take videos?”
The court alluded to reports suggesting the accused officers not only tied and beat the victims but also recorded videos of the incident.
Dave contended that the officers were unaware of the D.K. Basu judgment and argued against willful disobedience, to which Justice Gavai responded: “So ignorance of law is a valid defence.”
The apex court acknowledged the high court’s findings that the five Muslim men were illegally detained for over 24 hours before being publicly flogged.
Dave disputed the illegal detention claim, stating it was subject to trial and shouldn’t be considered under contempt jurisdiction.
Justice Gavai emphasised the duty of every police officer to be aware of the law laid down in D.K. Basu and admitted the statutory appeal by the accused officers.
“It is the duty of every police officer to know what is the law laid down in D.K. Basu. As students of law, we have been hearing about D.K. Basu,” Justice Gavai observed.
Senior advocate I.H. Syed, representing the victims, defended the high court’s punishment, asserting that contempt proceedings were independent of criminal and departmental actions.
The bench issued formal notices to the Gujarat government and the victims on the officers’ plea. Despite Dave urging the court to stay the high court’s imprisonment order, Justice Gavai remarked: “Enjoy the custody. You will be a guest of your own officers. They will provide you special treatment.”
Dave mentioned the high court’s three-month stay on the imprisonment order, enabling the appeal to the Apex court."

As soon as around 95 French troops marched down the Kartavya Path at the heart of the national capital, the whizzing warplanes pierced the morning sky making thousands of spectators crane their necks in wonder.
A 30-member band contingent from France also drew attention at the grand parade.
It was the second time the French armed forces participated in India's Republic Day celebrations. In 2016, French troops became the first foreign military contingent to participate in the biggest ceremonial event of the country.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the guest of honour at the prestigious Bastille Day Parade in Paris in July last year.
The Indian Air Force's Rafale fighter jets and a tri-services marching contingent took part in the Bastille Day parade.
""This reciprocal invitation to national day celebrations is unprecedented, and shows the deep mutual trust and unwavering friendship underpinning Indo-French ties,"" a French readout said on India inviting Macron to the Republic Day celebrations.
The French military contingent that participated in the parade comprised six Indians. It was led by Captain Noel Louis.
The contingent belonged to the Corps of French Foreign Legion.
The French Foreign Legion is an elite military corps that is open to foreigners who want to serve in the French Army.
Set up in 1831, the French Foreign Legion is an integral part of the French Army.
At present, it has almost 9,500 officers and legionnaires.
The defence and strategic ties between India and France have been on an upswing in the last few years.
The two strategic partners have been looking at co-development and co-production of advanced defence technologies, including for the benefit of third countries.
The two sides are also expanding cooperation in the maritime domain including in the Indian Ocean Region.

The 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,' led by Gandhi, entered West Bengal from Assam through Bakshirhat in Cooch Behar district.
State Congress president Adhir Chowdhury extended a warm welcome to Gandhi upon his arrival.
Addressing reporters in Cooch Behar, Gandhi accused the BJP and RSS of spreading hatred and violence across the country.
He said, ""The word 'Nyay' (justice) has been attached to the yatra because injustice is prevailing across the country. The INDIA bloc will fight against injustice across the country."" 	Gandhi's remark exuding confidence in the INDIA bloc came a day after Mamata Banerjee's decision to go solo in the Parliamentary elections in West Bengal caused ripples in the opposition bloc.
Banerjee's sudden comments forced the Congress to adopt a conciliatory approach with party spokesperson Jairam Ramesh asserting that the opposition bloc INDIA ""cannot be imagined without Mamata Banerjee.""  	The CPI(M) and Left parties, allies of the Congress within the state and the INDIA bloc at the national level, are expected to join the march.
However, the TMC has chosen to abstain, citing a lack of information about the yatra.
The Bengal leg of the yatra covers 523 km across six districts and six Lok Sabha constituencies — Darjeeling, Raigunj, North and South Malda, and two in Murshidabad — spanning five days. This is Gandhi's first visit to the state since the April-May 2021 assembly polls.
Commencing on January 14 in Manipur, the yatra is scheduled to cover 6,713 km in 67 days, passing through 110 districts in 15 states before concluding in Mumbai on March 20.

The Assam police suo motu registered the FIR against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and several other leaders for “wanton acts of violence” here during the party's 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' on Tuesday.
''We have filed an FIR. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) will conduct the investigation and he (Gandhi) will be arrested after the Lok Sabha elections'', Sarma said on the sidelines of a programme at Nazira in Sibsagar district.

Director General of Police G P Singh said that the case has been transferred to the Assam CID for a thorough investigation through an SIT to be constituted by the Additional Director General of Police (CID).
Sarma had instructed the DGP to register a case against Gandhi for provoking the crowd to break barricades in an attempt to enter Guwahati city during the Yatra on Tuesday leading to a scuffle with the police in which some senior Congress leaders, including the state party President Bhupen Bora and leader of opposition in the state assembly, and four police personnel were injured.
The FIR was filed against Congress leaders under IPC sections that deal with criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, rioting, assault or criminal force to deter public servants from discharging their duty, damaging public property and others.

A thick blanket of snow normally covers the mountainous passes connecting the Valley with PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir), acting as a natural barrier against infiltration during the initial winter months.
But winter so far has gone snowless in Kashmir this year, although the Srinagar meteorological centre has forecast the possibility of a wet spell from January 25 to February 1 — breaking nearly two months of dry spell.
The army on Wednesday said senior officers, led by Valley army chief Rajiv Ghai, visited the forward areas in the Gurez sector of Bandipora district on January 23 to review the counter-infiltration grid and operational preparedness.
The visit has come three days ahead of Republic Day. Security has been beefed up across Jammu and Kashmir to ensure incident-free celebrations. The security forces are also not taking any chances in letting Pakistan resort to any early infiltration attempts on the borders.
The army officers’ visit came on the same day director-general of police R.R. Swain said the security situation was under control in Jammu and Kashmir, but infiltration remained a challenge.
Officials said Lt Gen. Ghai exhorted soldiers to remain “in a high state of operational readiness” despite the bone-chilling night temperatures.
“Naturally, there are concerns that there could be early infiltration attempts this year due to the near absence of snow. Security has been beefed up across the LoC,” a police officer in Kupwara said.
Adding to the woes of security forces this year have been multiple forest fires in the border areas of Jammu’s Rajouri and Poonch districts — attributed again to the dry spell — prompting an increased vigil to prevent sabotage by the other side.
The army last week said a major fire broke out in the Dera ki Gali area of Poonch. The local army unit helped forest officials douse the flames.
Several landmines also blew up in another forest fire in the Mendhar and Balakote areas of Poonch.
“Despite the overall stability, the persistent challenge is posed by a handful of terrorists infiltrating from Pakistan, attempting to disrupt the hard-earned peace in the region,” Swain said.
“Our youths are not involved with them. While a few individuals may support these terrorists, the majority stand against them, indicating that the situation is under control.”
Swain said a person “sitting outside” who was not from “Jammu and Kashmir” was infiltrating or digging up tunnels to fight the security forces. “It is a challenge. Though their numbers are now less, this is a challenge,” he said."

The couple had knocked on the doors of the HC seeking a direction to the District Child Protection Unit for issuing them with a 'No Objection Certificate' (NOC) and a 'Conformity Certificate'.
The couple had adopted a girl child and the adoption deed between the biological mother and the couple was registered before the sub-registrar in the district headquarters town of Chikkaballapura on March 29, 2023.
The Deputy Commissioner had also verified the deed and recommended that necessary action be taken for the adoption. But still the District Child Protection Unit refused to grant them the NOC and Conformity Certificate.               Their petition was heard by Justice M Nagaprasanna.
The Deputy Solicitor General of India, H Shanti Bhushan, who appeared for the Union, contended that the adoption under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act was not internationally recognised and any inter-country adoption has to be done through the Hague Convention.              Under the Hague Convention to which Germany was also a signatory, the couple were required “to go before the country in which the father resides, communicate a mail to the Indian counterpart under the adoption regulations and within 10 days a certificate and NOC would be issued in this country.”
Agreeing with the argument, the HC in its judgement said: “The aforementioned norms would indicate inter-country adoption of German national. Therefore, the petitioners shall knock at the doors of the authorities in Germany under the Hague convention seeking a communication to India for issuance of NOC and Conformity certificate.                On receipt of the said communication from the aforesaid authority of Germany, the appropriate authority – the CARA (Central Adoption Resource Authority),  without brooking any delay, issue a no objection certificate and a conformity certificate.”
Refusing the petition seeking a direction to the authorities, the HC said: “If what is sought by the petitioners is granted, it would run counter to the established procedure. Therefore, the inter-country adoption should necessarily be in tune with the procedure quoted supra.”
The HC disposed of the petition giving the couple the liberty to approach the German authorities to communicate to the CARA for necessary action. The Authority was also directed to issue the necessary certificate within ten days of receiving the communication from the German authorities.

Mann's statement comes on a day West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamul Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee announced that her party will not ally with the Congress for the parliamentary polls in that state.
The AAP is part of the 28-party INDIA bloc along with the Congress, TMC and the CPI(M)-led Left Front.
The Punjab chief minister made the statement at a time the AAP and the Congress are locked in talks over seat sharing in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Goa and Gujarat for the general elections.
However, the AAP has entered into an alliance with the Congress for the Chandigarh mayoral poll.
Replying to a question on his party's alliance with the Congress, Mann said he has said many times that ""Punjab will become a hero in the country and the AAP will win 13-0 in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls"".
When questioned if it was clear that the AAP will not have an electoral alliance with the Congress, Mann said, ""We are not going with them (Congress)."" 	He further said discussions have already taken place on the AAP's probable candidates for Punjab's 13 Lok Sabha seats and the names of 40 probables have come up.
""There are three to four probable candidates per Lok Sabha constituency. Surveys will be conducted and we have kept winnabilty as the criterion (for fielding a candidate),"" he said while speaking to reporters after chairing a Cabinet meeting.
Mann and several AAP leaders have been opposing any truck with the Congress for the Lok Sabha polls.

The Yatra, currently in Assam, is scheduled to enter West Bengal through Bakshirhat in Cooch Behar district on January 25. After a recess of two days –January 26-27, it will be traversing Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Uttar Dinajpur and Darjeeling before reaching Bihar on January 29.
It will re-enter West Bengal on January 31 through Malda and travel via Murshidabad, both strongholds of the Congress, before leaving the state on February 1.
""We haven't received a formal invitation from the Congress. And even if we receive it we are most unlikely to join it"", the senior TMC leader told PTI.
The development came amid the growing animosity between both the parties – TMC and Congress - the INDIA bloc alliance partners over seat sharing in West Bengal.
TMC leaders, including Banerjee, have maintained that it is their party which is taking on the BJP in West Bengal.
On Tuesday, Banerjee at an internal party meeting had criticised the Congress for causing delays in seat-sharing discussions in West Bengal within the INDIA bloc, citing unjustified demands for 10-12 seats when the TMC is willing to share only two.
Senior state Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharya said the party has sent invites to all INDIA bloc partners, ""Now it is up to TMC to decide on whether they will join the yatra or not.
The TMC's offer of two seats based on Congress's 2019 Lok Sabha election performance was deemed insufficient, escalating the tension between the two parties.
In the 2019 elections, TMC secured 22 seats, Congress won two, and the BJP secured 18 seats in the state.
The TMC had allied with the Congress in the 2001 assembly polls, 2009 Lok Sabha elections, and the 2011 assembly polls. The alliance ousted the CPI(M)-led Left Front government of 34 years in the 2011 polls.

The consecration of Ram Lalla in the grand new temple could, in fact, spur the demand for a similar “abode for Lord Krishna in Mathura and Lord Shiva in Kashi/ Varanasi”, the insiders said, hoping to continue squeezing religious sentiment for political mileage.
Though the BJP has so far refrained from putting the twin issues on its official agenda, Hindu groups and individuals have already pushed them on a Ram Janmabhoomi-like path, spiritedly pursuing the dispute in local courts and espousing the cause on the street.
The petitioners have been asserting that both the Gyanvapi mosque, beside the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi, and the Shahi Idgah mosque, abutting the Krishna Janmabhoomi temple in Mathura, have been built by demolishing temples in the Mughal era and should therefore be returned. In the backdrop of Ayodhya, the twin cases appear to have acquired a fresh momentum with the courts concerned actively hearing the petitioners.
The Supreme Court earlier this month stopped the execution of an Allahabad High Court order to appoint a commission to inspect the premises of the Shahi Idgah, but didn’t interfere with the proceedings on the maintenance of the suit filed by Hindu groups claiming that a temple once stood over the mosque land.
In the case of the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi, the Archaeological Survey of India has already submitted its report before a local court; the issue is also being pushed in Allahabad High Court.
In 2022, the issue had grabbed national headlines as Hindu groups claimed that water spouts used by Muslim worshippers for pre-prayer ablutions were actually “Shivlings”.
“The conclusion of the Ram Janmabhoomi project has awakened Hindus. Now the party and the RSS are not required to undertake agitations. People will pursue and win,” a BJP leader said, confident that in both the Mathura and Kashi disputes, the courts would rule in favour of Hindu litigants.
After the Gyanvapi case hit headlines, BJP chief J.P. Nadda had said that “courts and the Constitution will decide” such contentious issues. He was answering questions on whether the party would also take up the Mathura and Kashi cases.
“In the near future, evidence of Hindu temples being demolished in both Mathura and Kashi will come before the courts as surveys are undertaken. Then, the cases will acquire a momentum of their own,” a BJP general secretary said. “Once evidence like the presence of Shivlings inside the Gyanvapi mosque starts coming, party leaders will be compelled to speak,” this leader added.
BJP insiders said that the twin issues may not figure in a big way in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls but indicated that they could be put on the centre stage post the general elections and ahead of the next Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh in 2027.
“Mathura and Kashi will enter the BJP’s and Modi’s agenda post the Lok Sabha polls,” a BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh said, arguing that the Krishna Janmabhoomi issue had the potential to deal a blow to the Samajwadi Party’s Muslim-Yadav vote bank.
This BJP MP pointed out that during his recent visit to Mathura, Prime Minister Modi had said: “The day is not far when God will be seen with even more divinity in the Braj (Mathura-Brindavan) region.”
“Modiji’s statement was a clear indication that after Ram Janmabhoomi, it was the turn of the Krishna Janmabhoomi to get a grand temple, but not just now. It will be reserved for Modiji’s third term in power,” the MP said."

The 11 convicts surrendered before jail authorities late Sunday night, local Crime Branch inspector NL Desai said.
""They reached the jail before midnight of January 21, which was the deadline set for them to surrender,"" he said.
The top court on January 8 annulled the remission granted by the Gujarat government to the 11 convicts in the high-profile case while slamming the state for being ""complicit"" with an accused and abusing its discretion.
It ordered the convicts, who were released prematurely on Independence Day in 2022, to go back to jail within two weeks.
The apex court on Friday rejected pleas of the convicts for grant of more time to surrender and asked them to do so by Sunday.
The 11 convicts are Bakabhai Vohania, Bipin Chandra Joshi, Kesarbhai Vohania, Govind Nai, Jaswant Nai, Mitesh Bhatt, Pradeep Mordhiya, Radheshyam Shah, Rajubhai Soni, Ramesh Chandana and Shailesh Bhatt.
Bilkis Bano was 21 years old and five months pregnant when she was gang-raped while trying to escape the horror of the communal riots that broke out after the Godhra train burning incident in February 2002. Her three-year-old daughter was among the seven family members killed.
On August 15, 2022, the 11 convicts, who spent 14 years in jail as part of the life sentence, were granted premature release after the Gujarat government accepted their remission applications in accordance with its 1992 policy, citing their 'good conduct' during imprisonment.
The 11 convicts are residents of Singvad and Randhikpur villages in Singvad taluka of Dahod district near Panchmahal.
Quashing the remission order, the Supreme Court had ruled that the Gujarat government lacked jurisdiction to grant premature release to the convicts as the case trial was held in Maharashtra.
Days after the SC order, the convicts moved the top court seeking more time to surrender on various grounds such as failing health, impending surgery, son's marriage and harvesting ripe crops.
These applications were dismissed by the apex court on Friday with the observation that the reasons cited had no merit.

FR96WX9XOQ_PYYBWT2O5ZG1526,My role is to be a historical eavesdropper: Nandini Das,"Udita Chakraborty Kolkata Published 23.01.24, 05:39 PM","Udita Chakraborty Kolkata Published 23.01.24, 05:39 PM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/my-kolkata/events/author-and-academic-nandini-das-on-her-book-courting-india-and-its-most-compelling-characters/cid/1995695,"“So much of history is about exchange. And that exchange can be both good and bad,” said academic and author Nandini Das while discussing her latest book, Courting India: England, Mughal India and the Origins of Empire, at the latest session of An Author’s Afternoon, organised by Prabha Khaitan Foundation in association with Shree Cement Limited, with My Kolkata as digital partner.
Thomas Roe arrived in India in 1616 as an ambassador of James I. Being the first English ambassador, he came bearing the task of establishing trading relationships between the fledgling British Empire and the opulent Mughal Empire under Jahangir. Das’s book chronicles the time that Roe spent in India and explores the history of the period through the exchanges between the two disparate cultures. In her conversation with Abhijit Gupta, professor at the Department of English at Jadavpur University, Das explored the process of her research, storytelling, and more, with an attentive audience at Taj Bengal.
Abhijit Gupta (left) in conversation with Das
Winning a Rhodes Scholarship to the University of Oxford changed Das’s life. It was transformative because it allowed her to read whatever she wanted. Her early interests in the novel finally culminated into a love for narratology, wherein travelling was a constant theme.
“While the novel, as we recognise it, emerged in the 18th century, my exploration extended back to the late 16th century. This period witnessed a generation of well-educated youth in London facing an economic crisis, reminiscent of certain contemporary challenges. In the late 1500s, with an ageing queen (Elizabeth I), economic turmoil and limited job opportunities for recent graduates, these well-educated scholars found themselves at a crossroads. Frustrated by the lack of employment, they turned to writing imaginative stories in prose, marking a shift towards fiction that resonates with today’s popular genres,” explained Das.
This narrative thread appears frequently in Das’s work on travel — both directly and indirectly. For her, travel remains a “timeless human experience”, which has been a constant theme in literature, from the earliest forms to contemporary genres like railway station novels or airport novels.
Das spoke about Thomas Coryat as a contrasting character to Thomas Roe
While Roe was someone who insisted on “commercial enterprise” rather than a “colonial initiative”, he was also deeply critical of what he saw in India. As a contrast to him is the character of Thomas Coryat, who was also a traveller and who bet that he would travel to India on foot, only to never return.
“While Coryat had the potential to be a modern-day celebrity like Orry, hanging out with the who’s who of England, he remained relatively unknown. However, he was deeply motivated to make a name for himself. To achieve this, he devised a clever plan — he began taking bets, challenging himself to walk around Europe. People would bet against him, and he would successfully complete the journey, documenting his experiences in a book. This dual-income strategy made him one of the earliest English celebrities.
“Having accomplished his European journey, Coryat faced the challenge of surpassing himself. The solution? A daring plan to walk across the land of the great Mughals. This decision was influenced by the cultural zeitgeist of the 1590s, with Christopher Marlowe’s blockbuster play Tamburlaine shaping the popular imagination. The plan was not merely an adventure; it was a bid to win more bets and further enhance his celebrity status. Unfortunately, he never returned,” noted Das.
Das signing copies of her book, ‘Courting India’
Even though Roe’s journey to India spanned a mere five years, it has been particularly significant in terms of India’s history.  Das leaned into that history to become, as she said, a “historical eavesdropper,” rummaging through art, letters and literature to unearth different narratives.
“The East India Company, newly granted its trading licence just before Elizabeth I’s death, struggled in a challenging geopolitical landscape. With Spain at their doorstep and a new monarch, James VI, on the throne, the nation faced complexities. When Roe was sent to India, he functioned as an ambassador under pressure, needing to secure trading licences from the East India Company and convince Jahangir of England’s trading worth. The Portuguese had deliberately kept England and Protestantism concealed from the Mughals, making Roe’s mission daunting,” elaborated Das.
But academic writing is often weighty and inaccessible to common readers. So how did Das manage to present a large amount of historical information in a manner that was also pleasant to read?
“I'm a literary scholar by training and one of the things that I would firmly tell my students, which I try to practise myself, is that we have an aesthetic responsibility towards our readers. If we’re writing about beautiful literature that plays with language and themes and ideas, we owe our readers that exact same pleasure. When I was writing the book, I was equally conscious of a sense of double duty: I wanted to convey the story in a way that was pleasurable to my readers without losing the academic rigour,” concluded Das.
The session came to a close with a Q&A interaction with the audience. Anindita Chatterjee, executive trustee of the Foundation, delivered the vote of thanks.
Juergen Gerhard Kurzhals
“I’m curious to read the book and see how Das’s view of India in those days will be different from the descriptions we’ve become accustomed to. I find it very difficult to believe that there’s such an abundance of material… If it’s the 1600s, how do you source all of that? If she has sourced it successfully and that too within 10 years, then I think she has done a fantastic job!”

The Supreme Court earlier this month stopped the execution of an Allahabad High Court order to appoint a commission to inspect the premises of the Shahi Idgah, but didn’t interfere with the proceedings on the maintenance of the suit filed by Hindu groups claiming that a temple once stood over the mosque land.
In the case of the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi, the Archaeological Survey of India has already submitted its report before a local court; the issue is also being pushed in Allahabad High Court.
In 2022, the issue had grabbed national headlines as Hindu groups claimed that water spouts used by Muslim worshippers for pre-prayer ablutions were actually “Shivlings”.
“The conclusion of the Ram Janmabhoomi project has awakened Hindus. Now the party and the RSS are not required to undertake agitations. People will pursue and win,” a BJP leader said, confident that in both the Mathura and Kashi disputes, the courts would rule in favour of Hindu litigants.
After the Gyanvapi case hit headlines, BJP chief J.P. Nadda had said that “courts and the Constitution will decide” such contentious issues. He was answering questions on whether the party would also take up the Mathura and Kashi cases.
“In the near future, evidence of Hindu temples being demolished in both Mathura and Kashi will come before the courts as surveys are undertaken. Then, the cases will acquire a momentum of their own,” a BJP general secretary said. “Once evidence like the presence of Shivlings inside the Gyanvapi mosque starts coming, party leaders will be compelled to speak,” this leader added.
BJP insiders said that the twin issues may not figure in a big way in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls but indicated that they could be put on the centre stage post the general elections and ahead of the next Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh in 2027.
“Mathura and Kashi will enter the BJP’s and Modi’s agenda post the Lok Sabha polls,” a BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh said, arguing that the Krishna Janmabhoomi issue had the potential to deal a blow to the Samajwadi Party’s Muslim-Yadav vote bank.
This BJP MP pointed out that during his recent visit to Mathura, Prime Minister Modi had said: “The day is not far when God will be seen with even more divinity in the Braj (Mathura-Brindavan) region.”
“Modiji’s statement was a clear indication that after Ram Janmabhoomi, it was the turn of the Krishna Janmabhoomi to get a grand temple, but not just now. It will be reserved for Modiji’s third term in power,” the MP said."

The idea of India is going through fire to be further strengthened, Gandhi recently told a group of students in Meghalaya during his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
Publishing a video on social media on Friday of the interaction with the students, Gandhi said, ""Universities, once bastions of free thought and expression, have now been converted to breeding grounds of fear, suppression, and blind obedience.""  	""Can the future of India spread its wings within a cage? This is why politics and resistance matters for Indian students,"" he said.
In his interaction with the students along with Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Kanhaiya Kumar, Gandhi asked the students, ""What is a slave?"" 	""What the RSS is trying to do to India is trying to make sure everybody is blindly obedient to what they say. Can a country function like that?"" he can be heard saying in the video.
Gandhi claimed he wanted to meet the students in their university and not in a closed room.
He alleged that Home Minister Amit Shah ""gave an order"" to the owner of the university that his conversation with the students was not allowed because he would say things to those students that would make them think about what was going on in India.
""And the answer to this blind obedience is resistance,"" Gandhi told the students.
""Resistance because as an individual I have my own view of the world,"" he added.
Sharing a link to the video of the interaction, Ramesh -- the Congress general secretary -- said in a post in Hindi on X, ""Recently, during the Bharat Jodo Nyaya Yatra, Rahul Gandhi interacted with students in Meghalaya on many issues, including youth politics, atmosphere of fear and pressure spread in universities."" 	During this, Rahul Gandhi openly answered the questions of the students, he said.
Ramesh further said the things Gandhi said are applicable not only to the northeast but to universities of the entire country.
He also posted a short clip from the same interaction in which a student asked a question to Gandhi and Kumar regarding the entry of youngsters into politics, to which both said those dissuading them from entering politics tell them it is dirty and not worth it when changes in the country are brought about only through politics.
The Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra has taken a pre-planned break after 12 continuous days and will resume on January 28 with a padyatra in West Bengal's Jalpaiguri.
Having passed through Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Cooch Behar in West Bengal, the yatra stopped for a pre-planned break on Thursday afternoon.
The yatra will resume at 2 pm on January 28 with a padyatra in Jalpaiguri, followed by a padyatra and a public address in Siliguri.
Gandhi is undertaking the over 6,700-kilometre Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra from Manipur to Mumbai.
The yatra entered Cooch Behar early on Thursday where Gandhi was accorded a rousing welcome by party workers. The yatra flag was handed over to the Congress' West Bengal chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury by the Assam Congress.

Foster began her acting career as a child artist who gained prominence in her teens with roles in 1970s films ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Bugsy Malone"" and cemented her stardom with her Oscar-winning role of a rape survivor in the 1988 movie ""The Accused"".
Within four years, she clinched her career's second best actress Oscar for ""The Silence of the Lambs"" for her role as Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who is hot on the heels of a serial killer and seeks help from a jailed cannibalistic serial killer.
Foster said her current role as Alaskan police chief Liz Danvers in ""True Detective: Night Country"", the fourth chapter of the hit drama that has two women police officers at the helm, is completely different from Clarice, who was a ""good student"" and without contradictions.
""Clarice and Danvers are pretty different. I don't think Clarice, if she grew up, turned into Danvers. She was on a different path. But I do see the connection there with women that are in an all male dominated culture. There's a certain kind of personality that comes out of that,"" Foster told PTI in a group interview.
The women she portrays are messy, make mistakes, learn and grow, something that she found in Danvers as well, added the 61-year-old actor.
""I've always played more human characters, the person that stuff happens to, the person that takes action. I didn't really make a career of playing the mother of, sister of, girlfriend of and this is just another extension of that,"" she said.
""These are women that are taking agency, have power, are complicated and (are) messed up and are not on one path. They grow throughout the show. That arc of change is always very important to me,"" Foster said.
Created by Issa Lopez, the fourth season of the HBO anthology series ""True Detective: Night Country"" is currently streaming on JioCinema.
The six-episode show also features Kali Reis as Evangeline Navarro as they team up to solve the disappearance of eight men from the Tsalal Arctic Research Station. 	Though largely shot in Iceland for logistical reasons, the story is set in Alaska's Ennis, amidst the polar night's months-long darkness.
Foster said she probably stayed away from cop roles because she loves to ""mix it up"" when it comes to her performances, but ""Silence of the Lambs"" sort of paved the way for such stories in Hollywood.
""'Silence of the Lambs' is in many ways the godfather, or the great great grandfather of this show. And Issa is really good at talking about this and she says 'Silence of the Lambs' birthed 'Se7en', 'Se7en' birthed 'True Detective' one, and now we are in season four. I feel like there's a real conduit from one to the other,"" she explained.
""True Detective: Night Country"" marks Foster's return to the small screen after 1975 but the actor said she hadn't noticed the long gap.
""We look at it as a big, long movie. So for us, it's just a movie, a six-hour movie, and I feel like this show in particular is so cinematic that it's easy to see it that way. I loved 'True Detective'. I was a huge fan and I went back to see it many times actually,"" she said.
Foster said she felt ""incredibly flattered"" and ""blessed"" to be a part of the show and was struck by the contrast between the critically-praised first season and her version.
""It's really the work of our showrunner. HBO approached her. She came up with the opposite of the original 'True Detective' season one. Instead of it being like the hot Louisiana, it's going to be the cold dark Arctic and two women.
""So it really does feel like a completely different universe, but a universe that's very specific, and almost timeless. That has a supernatural element that's just sort of embedded into it. I thought that was a great idea and I was like, 'Yeah, I'm coming'.""

The police said that two persons were arrested and six were booked in Jammu district for allegedly uploading objectionable content on social media to create communal tension between two communities.
One of the arrested persons was identified by residents as Zaffar Hussain from Khanna Chargal, which is on the outskirts of Jammu district.
Some reports claimed the other arrested person was a female undergraduate student, although her family denied her arrest.
“She too has been booked but not arrested so far. Some other youths, however, have also been picked up for questioning. We have moved court for their bail,” the girl’s relative told The Telegraph.
The relative said the girl was a cousin of Zaffar and the two had posted some comments on the razed Babri Masjid.
“They were angry over the Babri Masjid’s demolition and construction of a temple at the place,” he said.
The police said a case was registered against Zaffar and the other youths at Nagrota police station following a complaint from a resident, who is from another community.
Multiple cases have also been filed in Reasi, Ramban, Rajouri and Kathua districts of the Jammu division.
Reasi district police said that they had registered two FIRs and arrested three persons for posting objectionable content on social media platforms.
“Acting promptly on directions of SSP Reasi Sh. Amit Gupta-JKPS, FIR No. 19/2024 U/S 295-A IPC (outraging religious feelings) has been registered at Police Station, Reasi and FIR No. 04/2024 U/S 295-A IPC of the law has been registered at Police Station Arnas,” the police said.
Gupta advised people to refrain from posting any objectionable content on social media that could disturb peace and harmony in the area."

Avigyan Kishor Das, 16, a student of Hooghly Collegiate School, has been invited by the Centre to grace the historic 75th Republic Day celebration as a “distinguished” patent holder, which is a recognition of his “substantial contribution in the field of science and technology” and for raising the “stature of India globally”.
Avigyan, a science student, holds a patent for a touch-free portable automatic hand sanitising system. Approval for patents for eight other inventions of his is pending.
Sources said the teenager received the prestigious National Intellectual Property Award in October last year. It paved the way for his invitation to the historic occasion as one of the youngest dignitaries.
“Being invited to be a distinguished guest by the country’s government is a huge honour. It will be the experience of my lifetime to watch the parade on the 75th Republic Day celebration in New Delhi seated with other dignitaries. This invitation will inspire me to undertake more new endeavours,” Avigyan said.
A communication on invitations to patent holders issued by the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, a wing of the Union ministry of commerce and industry, states: “The inventors and patent holders play a very significant role in the economic development of a country. To acknowledge the contribution and ingenuity of Indian inventors, the Government of India has decided to invite to the Republic Day parade the distinguished patent holders.""
Avigyan was chosen for the National Intellectual Property award for his work on “the development of a real-time automobile and industrial pollution monitoring and controlling device, as well as for the touch-free sanitizing system in the below 18 years category titled “Top Indian Individual for patents”.
Avigyan's father Anindya Kishor Das is an employee of the Indian Audit and Accounts Department. His mother Priyanka Das is a homemaker. Both said their son was ""innovative since his childhood"".
His father Anindya said: “The central government's invitation to my son to witness the Republic Day parade is a great honour for our family also.""
When he was only 11, one of Avigyan's innovations was adjudged the best in a competition organized by the International Science Festival in Calcutta. For the science festival, Avigyan developed a real-time pollution control device that when fitted to the engine of a vehicle can eventually disable its movement permanently once its pollutant capacity rose beyond the permissible level.
In 2019, the then Class VII student developed a device to automatically stop a running train to avert possible accidents in case the driver suffered a cardiac arrest or became unconscious. The young inventor used a pulse oximeter to develop his device. The innovation earned him the first prize in the “Best Innovative Project” category at a competition organised by a private engineering college.
Asked about his future plans, Avigyan said he wanted to do research in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
“I want to develop tools and systems using basic science and technology to provide solutions to domestic needs in daily life,"" said the gifted teen."

Dawshom Awbotaar
Srijit Mukherji’s Dawshom Awbotaar, a prequel to the 2011 thriller Baishe Srabon, marks the return of Prosenjit Chatterjee as the fierce cop Probir who specialises in investigating serial murders. It also brings back Anirban Bhattacharya’s Bijoy Poddar from Srijit’s 2019 thriller Vinci Da as Probir’s apprentice. When serial killer Biswaroop, played by Jisshu Sengupta, enters the scene, a cat-and-mouse chase begins between the murderer and the two cops.
What makes the film interesting is that it reveals the identity of the killer in the very first scene, making it an exciting whydunnit rather than a whodunnit. While maintaining the essence of his previous film in this prequel, Srijit has also incorporated rebellious poetry and Anupam Roy’s music. Also starring Jaya Ahsan, Dawshom Awbotaar released in theatres on October 19 last year.

As he suddenly finds himself in possession of an ancient alien relic called the Scarab, Jaime Reyes aka Blue Beetle’s life turns upside down. The Scarab, an AI created by an alien race of conquerors named Reach, chooses Jaime as its host, providing him with incredible powers and strength, which help him emerge as a superhero.
Blue Beetle, which ultimately highlights the importance of family, proved to be a milestone for DC with its exceptional representation of Latino people on screen.

Yet, even as much of the international community called for calm and urged both sides to pull back from any escalation, the Indian ministry of external affairs appeared to justify Iran’s attack on Pakistani soil, saying it understood the rationale for Tehran to act against terrorist infrastructure in another nation’s territory if it felt threatened. For now, the tensions between Pakistan and Iran are no longer on the boil, with the neighbours committing to de-escalate matters, although their broader border differences remain intact. Yet, India’s response to the Iranian attack raises questions that could complicate its responses to subsequent crises around the world, including when New Delhi might be involved. To be sure, India has long argued that Pakistan’s State support for terrorism, which includes funding and training of armed groups, not just remains a fundamental challenge in relations between New Delhi and Islamabad but is also a cause for deep concern for Iran and Afghanistan. Indeed, Pakistan-based terror groups have threatened both Iran and Afghanistan. Jaish al-Adl, the group that Tehran claims it targeted, had taken responsibility for the killing of 11 Iranian security personnel in a December attack on a police station in the Iranian town of Rask.
But India must not forget another cornerstone of its international relations doctrine: respect for the territorial sovereignty and integrity of all nations. Extraterritorial killings, whomever the target might be, represent a breach of that policy. India’s position on the cross-border attacks risks weakening its ability to stand by that principle in other global hotspots. Israel and Iran, for instance, frequently target enemies across border lines even if these raise the prospects of escalation. Would India justify the United States of America, or other military powers like China and Russia, engaging in targeted, cross-border military strikes that, they say, are pre-emptive? And how would India respond if its own territory were targeted in this manner? India rightly argues for all nations to uphold international law because that also benefits New Delhi’s strategic calculus. It must not deviate from that for short-term convenience or to score brownie points. A rules-based order that is applied only selectively strengthens neither rules nor order."

The legislators claimed that in several areas, the Assam Rifles was ""not responsive"" and remained ""mute spectators"" when unarmed civilians, mostly farmers, came under attack by armed men.
""SoO agreements with the militant groups and the immunity it provides to them from central forces are the main cause of the never-ending cycle of violence. Thus SoO... should be abrogated immediately. It should not extended beyond its expiry date of February 29, 2024,” the MLAs said in a statement.
The SoO was signed with the Centre, the Manipur government and two conglomerates of Kuki militant outfits – the Kuki National Organisations and United Peoples Front. The pact was first inked in 2008 and extended periodically.
""These forces (Assam Rifles) and their leadership (chain of command) need to give strict instructions and be held accountable, and replace with forces that have the ability to act by returning suppressive fires when they observe that unarmed civilians are being fired upon,” it said.
The MLAs have also called for ""complete disarmanent of illegal arms in the possession of unauthorised persons” in the state at the earliest.
The legislators asserted that if the Union government is “unable to take any positive action as per these demands”, the MLAs will take “appropriate action in consultation with the public”.

The police had to use force to stop the Congress supporters from moving forward.
Earlier, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had asserted that the Yatra would not be permitted to enter the city to avert potential traffic congestion. Despite this, large crowds gathered at the Guwahati Chowk in Khanapara, warmly welcoming Gandhi with spirited slogans and drum beats, reports PTI.
""We have won as we have broken the barricades,"" AICC in-charge for Assam Jitendra Singh said.

On Monday, leaders of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) announced that the yatra led by Rahul Gandhi had decided to traverse the Guwahati bypass on Tuesday. However, the Assam government has denied permission to proceed through the main routes within Guwahati city.
The Congress said that Guwahati police asked them to take the yatra through NH27 (Khanapara- Jayanagar- Basistha- Gorchuk- Lokhra route). Bedabrata Bora, spokesperson for Assam PCC, stated, according to news reports, ""It has been decided to abandon the plan of taking the 'Nyay Yatra' through the main routes of Guwahati. The police are not allowing us. Now, we will gather at Khanapara for a protest meeting, and subsequently, the yatra will move towards the Lower Assam district through the Guwahati bypass.""
The Yatra, which entered Meghalaya on Monday, returned to Assam for its last leg. The plan, sources said, was to travel through the outskirts of the state's largest city Guwahati. But now it is uncertain. The Yatra is scheduled to be in Assam till Thursday.
On Monday, Rahul Gandhi was stopped from visiting Batadrava Than owing to “issues related to his security”. The day witnessed competing narratives of the Right-wing ecosystem and the Congress over the Ram temple consecration play out “peacefully” on the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra route in two central Assam districts of Nagaon and Morigaon.
Police said Rahul was not allowed to go because of a letter written by the Sri Sri Batadrava Than Parichalana Committee, which wanted him to visit after 3pm because a lot of devotees were expected there on the occasion of the Ram temple consecration.
Sources said a group of local youths had arranged a live screening of the Ram temple’s inaugural ceremony outside the Than. A lot of people were also expected to turn up to see Rahul. They said the Than committee did not want any kind of misunderstanding between the two groups.
The Congress brass had turned down the invite to the Ayodhya temple inauguration, prompting the Right-wing ecosystem to term them “anti-Hindu”.
Rahul tried to make it to the birthplace of saint-reformer Srimanta Sankardeva to pay his homage by reaching Haiborgaon around 8.25am but ran into barricades put up by the police."

The new Ram Lalla idol was consecrated at the Ayodhya temple on Monday, an event led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and watched by lakhs of people on television at their homes and in temples across the country.
Modi took part in the 'pran pratishtha' rituals in the presence of Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat.

Yadav New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 06:16 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/bharat-ratna-to-karpoori-thakur-modis-grab-at-socialist-icons-legacy-ahead-of-lok-sabha-polls/cid/1995978,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move to confer the Bharat Ratna on Bihar’s socialist icon Karpoori Thakur, 36 years after his death and just ahead of the general elections, is being seen by BJP insiders as an audacious attempt to usurp the legacy of the legendary OBC protagonist and nibble away the voter base of chief minister Nitish Kumar.
Thakur, twice chief minister of Bihar, was a staunch Lohiaite socialist whose politics and ideology ran against both the Sangh and the Congress; both groups have suddenly begun to compete to celebrate Thakur and claim his legacy.
Modi, brimming with confidence post the Ram temple inauguration, is eyeing a straight third term in power with record numbers in the Lok Sabha; excelling in Bihar is key to that ambition.
Bihar, on the current state of play with the JDU and the RJD allied, remains an outlier among northern heartland states. Modi and the BJP have been desperately looking for a narrative to make substantive inroads into the backward and extremely backward caste-dominated politics of the state.
“Modiji’s surprise move will shake not only Nitish and Lalu (Prasad) but the political landscape of Bihar. We are hopeful that the decision (to confer the Bharat Ratna on Thakur) will put pressure on Nitish Kumar to break away from the RJD, which doesn’t carry the legacy of Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur,” a BJP leader said, indicating that Bihar may spring yet another surprise with Nitish essaying yet another somersault.
“Karpoori Thakur was against promoting dynasty and was committed to serving the most backward. Lalu and his party are only concerned about serving the interests of their family and the Yadavs and the Muslims,” the BJP leader added.
Conferring the Bharat Ratna on Thakur, a demand his legacy carriers Nitish and Lalu’s RJD have been pressing for long, came not as yet another government decision but as a carefully planned electoral manoeuvre. Most prominent newspapers reaching Bihari readers carried a long write-up by Modi, hailing the late socialist Thakur.
“He (Thakur) belonged to one of the most backward sections of society, the Nai Samaj,” Modi wrote, highlighting the “Nai” or the “barber” caste of the late leader and went on to underline his backward roots. “As a person belonging to the backward classes myself, I have much to thank Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji for. Unfortunately, we lost him when we needed him the most,” Modi wrote, aiming to counter the caste-survey politics brandished by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.
Thakur is most remembered for his affirmative action to uplift the most deprived sections and Modi appeared to be eyeing the same sections.
More than a decade ahead of the Mandal Commission, Thakur as chief minister had implemented a path-breaking reservation system splitting the wider OBC category into two parts — OBC and EBC (Extremely Backward Classes). A larger share of 12 per cent was allotted for the EBCs and only 8 per cent was set out of the other OBCs out of a total quota of 26 per cent. In addition, Thakur allotted 3 per cent for women and another 3 per cent for economically backward classes from among the upper castes.
Decades later, Nitish sought to borrow from Thakur’s legacy by wooing EBCs in his bid to beat friend-turned-foe Lalu’s Mandal politics focused on the Muslim-Yadav vote base. After taking power in 2005, Nitish once again split the backward reservation pie in two parts, focusing on the EBCs and also implementing 50 per cent reservation for women in panchayats.
On Wednesday, speaking at an event to mark the centenary of Thakur, home minister Amit Shah claimed that Modi was inspired by the “Jan Nayak”. “Modiji’s move to give 10 per cent reservation to the economically backward among upper castes and 33 per cent to women along with many decisions for OBC welfare is praised across the country. But it was started in the 70s by Jan Nayak Karpooriji,” Shah said, adding that 27 ministers in Modi’s ministry, including Modi himself, hail from the backward classes.
“The biggest coincidence was that on January 22, Modiji did Ram Kaaj and on January 23, by conferring the Bharat Ratna on Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur he did Garib Kaaj. He worked to connect Ram and the poor,” Shah said, going on to claim that Modi’s stress on Hindi and other regional languages was also inspired by the late socialist leader.
BJP leaders see the Karpoori-Bharat Ratna move as an aggressive effort to lay claim on the socialist leader’s legacy and make a grab on the EBCs who account for 36 per cent of Bihar’s population.
The BJP has been able to make inroads in the non-Yadav backward voters in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh but failed to do the same effectively in Bihar due to their dependence on Nitish when they have been allied, BJP leaders argue.
The BJP-JDU-LJP combine had swept the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Bihar, winning 39 (BJP 17, JDU 16 and LJP 6) of the 40 seats in the state. This time, with Nitish not with them, Modi and the BJP fear that they may not be able to repeat the feat and so moves like the one on Karpoori Thakur."
GQAZ4N7LRS_WRQCFZWTGJT1UD8,Tata Steel UK takes fresh guard after spending £6.8 billion over 16 years to cover losses,"Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 22.01.24, 10:35 AM","Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 22.01.24, 10:35 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/tata-steel-uk-takes-fresh-guard-after-spending-6-8-billion-over-16-years-to-cover-losses/cid/1995391,"The two blast furnaces at Port Talbot, scheduled to be shut forever later this year, are the last remnants of a sprawling primary steel-making operation in the UK that Tata Steel had inherited when it acquired the Anglo-Dutch Corus Group Plc for £6.2 billion in 2007.
In the 16 years since then, it has been mostly a struggle for the Indian management to keep the hearth aglow as the UK operations, spread principally over three locations — Port Talbot, Scunthorpe and Teesside — at the time of the takeover, managed to post profit only twice on the strength of the business.
In the process, Tata Steel UK suffered close to £5 billion in losses, excluding an exceptional non-cash gain of £1.64 billion from the restructuring of the British Steel Pension Schemes (BSPS) in 2017-18.
The company on Friday disclosed that it had sunk £6.8 billion to cover losses, improvements in steel-making sites, pension restructuring costs and in capital support to service Tata Steel UK’s share of debt. In other words, it spent more to keep the UK business running than it paid to acquire the UK and Netherlands operations.
The chronology
Records kept by Tata Steel UK show it posted a profit in 2007-08, the very first year of operations under the Tata management and before the Lehman Brothers crash sent the world economy into a tailspin.
The first signs of strain were visible as early as 2009 when the company began consultation to mothball Teesside Cast Products (TCP) in north England as four international slab buyers declined to honour off-take agreements. The plant was mothballed at the end of February 2010 and sold to SSI of Thailand in March 2011. In the process, it posted a profit in 2010-11 on the back of the gain from the sale.
The next wave of restructuring hit the company in 2014 when the long product business based in Scunthorpe was hived off to a separate entity. On May 31, 2016, the Scunthorpe operations and other long products group companies were sold to Greybull Capital, reportedly for a token £1. Consequently, it was left with only one primary steel-making capacity in Port Talbot, Wales.
A year later, TSUK’s speciality steel and bar products business, principally located at Rotherham using an electric arc furnace (EAF), was sold to Liberty Speciality Steels Ltd (Liberty House).
In September 2017, Tata Steel Europe also signed a memorandum of understanding with thyssenkrupp AG (TK) Germany to forge an equal (50:50) joint venture to combine the steel business of the two behemoths. However, the plan was abandoned a year later after it failed to receive merger control approval from the European Commission.
While operational restructuring was ongoing, TSUK also took steps to insulate itself from the liabilities of BSPS and in September 2017, it received approval from the UK pension regulator to separate the pension scheme.
On the back of the restructuring of the BSPS, TSUK booked a notional gain of £1.64 billion in 2017-18 and reported book profit. Without the same, it would have made a loss of £260 million in that fiscal.
The company’s profitable outing on the back of operations came in 2021-22 as steel mills across the globe experienced an unprecedented margin expansion in the aftermath of the pandemic. It swung to red again in 2022-23 with a loss of £674 million.
Way ahead
The Tata Steel management believes the closure of the BFs at Port Talbot and the subsequent erection of an EAF can be game changer for the business which has been a drag on the more profitable Indian operations for years.
The transition is expected to reverse years of losses and be environmentally sustainable as the plant will use scrap and electric as raw materials, instead of coal and iron ore, reducing TSUK’s CO2 emissions by 5 million tonnes per year and overall UK country emissions by about 1.5 per cent.
The investment of £1.25 billion includes a £500 million grant from the UK government and the EAF is going to be ready by 2027. In the process, TSUK’s steelmaking capacity would be at 3mt, down from 14.4mt at the time of acquisition.
TSUK is hoping to be self-sufficient in raw materials use as it plans to source scrap compared to now when almost all of the raw materials for the current blast furnaces are imported.
In the interim period, Tata Steel has developed plans which would enable it to secure continuity of supply through its existing downstream and steel processing sites for UK and overseas customers, utilising imported semi-finished steel including from Tata Steel plants in the Netherlands and India as well as other select strategic suppliers until the commencement of EAF production.
In order to be able to deliver the proposed EAF in 2027, the company has begun engineering design work and construction planning.
It is in advanced planning discussions with National Grid about enabling infrastructure and has also begun engagement with the local authority and regulators."
GVGICAB1MP_2K0JRKR5KKXL6QJ,Alabama executes convicted murderer Kenneth Smith with new nitrogen asphyxiation method,"Reuters Alabama Published 26.01.24, 01:38 PM","Reuters Alabama Published 26.01.24, 01:38 PM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/alabama-executes-convicted-murderer-kenneth-smith-with-new-nitrogen-asphyxiation-method/cid/1996322,"Alabama executed convicted murderer Kenneth Smith by asphyxiating him with nitrogen gas on Thursday, the first use of a new method of capital punishment that the state is advancing as a simpler alternative to lethal injections.
The state has called its new protocol ""the most painless and humane method of execution known to man.""
United Nations human rights experts and lawyers for Smith had sought to prevent it, saying the method was risky, experimental and could lead to a torturous death or non-fatal injury.
Smith, convicted of a 1988 murder-for-hire, was a rare prisoner who had already survived one execution attempt. In November 2022, Alabama officials aborted his execution by lethal injection after struggling for hours to insert an intravenous line's needle in his body.
In Smith's second and final trip to the execution chamber on Thursday, executioners restrained him in a gurney and strapped a commercial industrial-safety respirator mask to his face. A canister of pure nitrogen was attached to the mask that once flowing, deprived him of oxygen.
The execution began at 7:53 p.m. (0153 GMT Friday) and Smith was declared dead at 8:25 p.m. (0225 GMT), prison officials said.
Smith appeared to remain conscious for several minutes after the nitrogen was activated, according to five journalists were allowed to watch the execution through glass as media witnesses. He then began shaking and writhing on the gurney for about two minutes, and then could be seen breathing deeply for several minutes before his breathing slowed and became imperceptible, the witnesses said.
Alabama officials had said in court filings they expected Smith would be rendered unconscious in under a minute and die shortly after.
""It appeared that Smith was holding his breath as long as he could,"" Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm said when asked at a press conference if the writhing had been expected. ""He struggled against the restraints a little bit but it's an involuntary movement and some agonal breathing. So that was all expected.""
Before the nitrogen was switched on, Smith made a lengthy final statement that began: ""Tonight, Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward.""
His wife and other relatives attended and he gestured towards them. ""I'm leaving with love, peace and light,"" he said, according to media witnesses. ""Love all of you.""
Failed challenges
Smith mounted legal challenges in federal courts arguing that Alabama's method amounted to unconstitutional ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" but he failed to cross the high bar needed to have a judge order a delay of his execution.
Smith's lawyers had told courts they feared the mask would not properly seal against Smith's face, allowing oxygen to seep in, delaying or even averting the moment of unconsciousness but risking serious brain injury. They proposed Alabama instead use a hood pre-filled with pure nitrogen, to be plunged over his head, or else to use a firing squad.
Smith's lawyers also told courts Smith had been repeatedly vomiting as his return to the execution chamber drew near. They raised fears he could be sick after the mask was strapped on and choke on his own vomit.
In response, prison officials said they would serve him his final meal on Thursday morning and forbid any solid foods after 10 a.m..
His final meal was steak, hash browns and eggs, prison officials said.
The U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority rejected Smith's final attempt to have his execution delayed to allow his legal challenge to continue on Thursday evening, and the execution began soon after.
The court did not explain its reasoning in denying Smith's appeal, but the three liberal justices offered written dissents.
""Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its 'guinea pig' to test a method of execution never attempted before,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, saying she would have granted the injunction. ""The world is watching.""
Approved but unused in other states
U.S. states that use capital punishment have found it increasingly difficult to get drugs for lethal injections, partly because pharmaceutical companies forbid supplying them to prisons to comply with a European trade ban on goods to be used in torture or executions.
Lawmakers in Oklahoma and Mississippi have also approved similar nitrogen-asphyxiation execution protocols in recent years, but have yet to put them into practice.
Smith was convicted of murdering Elizabeth Sennett, a preacher's wife, after he and an accomplice each accepted a $1,000 fee from her husband to kill her, according to trial testimony.
Eleven of 12 jurors voted to sentence Smith to life in prison, but an Alabama judge overruled their recommendation under a law that has since been abolished as unconstitutional.
Several of Sennett's relatives attended the execution and they addressed the media after, saying they had forgiven Sennett's killers.
""Nothing that happened here today is going to bring mom back,"" Mike Sennett said. ""It's a bittersweet day, we're not going to be jumping around, hooping and hollering, hooraying and all that, that's not us. We're glad this day is over."""

""Oppenheimer"", an ambitious biopic of J Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atom bomb, earned 13 nods, including top categories of best picture, director for Nolan and actor for Cillian Murphy.
""Poor Things"", which entered the race later, was the second favourite film for Academy voters who gave the wacky comedy a lot of love by nominating it in 11 categories, while Scorsese's relook at one of the bloodiest chapters in American history, ""Killers..."" followed with 10 nods. 	  	Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie"", another summer mega hit that released with ""Oppenheimer"" and sparked the ""Barbenheimer"" phenomenon amongst fans, earned eight nominations, including a best picture and a twin nod in original song category.
Other than than these four films, the best picture list also includes ""American Fiction"", ""Anatomy of a Fall"", ""The Holdovers"", ""Maestro"", ""Past Lives"" and ""Zone of Interest"", showcasing Academy's attempt to balance the big movies with intimate independent films this year.
The directing list has giants like Scorsese, Nolan as top contenders. The other nominees are: Lanthimos, Justine Triet for ""Anatomy of a Fall"" and Jonathan Glazer for ""The Zone of Interest"".
Murphy is believed to be the frontrunner for the actor in a leading role Oscar but he will have to fight it out with Bradley Cooper (""Maestro""), Paul Giamatti (""The Holdovers""), Colman Domingo (""Rustin"") and Jeffrey Wright (""American Fiction""). Leonardo DiCaprio was a clear omission in the list.
Lily Gladstone's standout performance in ""Killers..."" rightfully earned her a nod in the actress in a leading role category alongside equally talented performers in Emma Stone for ""Poor Things"", Annette Bening for ""Nyad"", Carey Mulligan for ""Maestro"" and Sandra Huller for ""Anatomy of a Fall"".
It's Robert versus Robert in the supporting actor category with Robert De Niro (""Killers...""), and Robert Downey Jr for ""Oppenheimer"" battling it out alongside other contestants like Sterling K Brown for ""American Fiction"", Mark Ruffalo for ""Poor Things"" and Ryan Gosling for ""Barbie"".
Actresses in supporting roles are Emily Blunt for ""Oppenheimer"", America Ferrera for ""Barbie"", Jodie Foster for ""Nyad"", Danielle Brooks ""The Color Purple"" and Da'Vine Joy Randolph for ""The Holdovers"".
Though India's official entry ""2018"" is out of the international feature film race, ""To Kill a Tiger"", set in a small Indian village, secured a nomination in documentary feature category at the 2024 Academy Awards.
It is directed by Delhi-born Nisha Pahuja, an Emmy-nominated filmmaker based in Toronto. The documentary is nominated alongside ""Bobi Wine: The People's President"", ""The Eternal Memory"", ""Four Daughters"", and ""20 Days in Mariupol"".
""Past Lives"", one of the most loved films of 2023, directed by debutante Celine Song, not only earned a nomination in best picture category but also one in the original screenplay category. This segment also featured ""Anatomy of a Fall"", ""The Holdovers"", ""Maestro"" and ""May December"".
""Barbie"" is competing in the adapted screenplay category alongside ""American Fiction"", ""Oppenheimer"", ""Poor Things"" and ""The Zone of Interest"".	  	The nominees in the international feature category are “Io Capitano” (Italy), “Perfect Days” (Japan), “Society of the Snow” (Spain), “The Teachers’ Lounge” (Germany) and “The Zone of Interest” (United Kingdom). 	  	The nominations were also announced in animated feature and short categories, song, score, production design, visual effects, cinematography, film editing, production design, makeup and hairstyling, costume design, sound, documentary short film and live action short film.
The 96th Academy Awards will be held on March 10 at the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood in Los Angeles. Jimmy Kimmel is returning to host the ceremony for the second consecutive year. He has hosted the ceremony four times.

GYETHQOAGP_IHMYO5KBZBH8TSH,"'Dior bag scandal' lands South Korea's Yoon, ruling party in disarray ahead of election","Reuters Seoul Published 24.01.24, 12:19 PM","Reuters Seoul Published 24.01.24, 12:19 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/world/dior-bag-scandal-lands-south-korea-president-yoon-suk-yeol-ruling-party-in-disarray-ahead-of-election/cid/1995863,"Hidden camera footage appearing to show South Korea's First Lady accepting a Dior bag as a gift has plunged President Yoon Suk Yeol and his party into a controversy that may threaten their bid to reclaim a parliamentary majority in April's election.
Some members of Yoon's conservative People Power Party (PPP) have urged the president and his wife, Kim Keon Hee, to apologise for the incident dubbed by local media ""Dior bag scandal"" and admit receiving the purse was, at least, inappropriate, in the hope of putting the matter to rest.
Yoon's office said it had no information to share.
By opting to remain silent and, at the weekend, pushing for the party leader to resign due to a disagreement over some members' stance, Yoon risks creating a flash point that could end up costing PPP the April 10 election, analysts say.
""It is a political bombshell,"" said Rhee Jong-hoon, a political analyst. ""The Kim Keon Hee risks are only going to get bigger.""
Yoon won a close election in 2022 but his PPP is a minority in the parliament, which is controlled by the rival Democratic Party.
Analysts said when Kim, as the spouse of a government official, accepted the purse, which had a price tag of 3 million won ($2,250), she may have violated an anti-bribery law.
The president's supporters say Kim is the victim of an illegal plot to set her up and a smear campaign.
The case surfaced in November when a YouTube channel aired a video clip secretly recorded by a Korean American pastor with a hidden camera as he visited Kim and handed her the handbag.
The pastor, Rev. Abraham Choi, who has been involved in religious exchanges with North Korea and is an advocate of engagement with Pyongyang, said he initially sought a meeting with Kim out of concern for Yoon's hardline North Korea policy.
Choi said while Kim was a family acquaintance, her response to discussions over possible luxury gifts - including Chanel cosmetics he claims he gave her in their first meeting - led him to believe such gifts were the only way to secure an audience.
""You might say they were like an entry pass, a ticket for a meeting (with Kim),"" Choi told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
Yoon's office said it had no information to provide when asked about Choi's claims.
An unnamed presidential official told Yonhap news agency last week that Choi had deliberately approached Kim with the intention of illegally filming using his family connections, and that gifts to the couple are handled and stored as property of the government.
After a first meeting, Choi said he became concerned about Kim's role in the administration and worked with a reporter at the YouTube channel, which airs left-wing news and commentary, to film her accepting the pricey bag during a second visit.
""A normal person would then say, 'Reverend, I can't see you if you do this,'"" he said. ""But the First Lady gave me the place and time.""
Kim also remains mired in allegations of stock price manipulation from about 12 years ago, a case for which opposition-controlled parliament voted last month to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate.
PPP opposed the bill as a plot by the DP to hamper an investigation into its leader, Lee Jae-myung, and his corruption charges, which he denies. Yoon vetoed the bill as politically motivated.
In 2021, Kim made a public apology after months of allegations of falsified professional record and plagiarism in her Ph.D. thesis overshadowed Yoon's campaign for president.
'Marie antoinette'
A number of PPP members have argued public sentiment is focused on Kim and not the hidden camera sting, reflecting growing concern the issue is leaving a bad impression with voters.
Tension between Yoon's office and his party boiled over last week when a member of its leadership, Kim Kyung-yul, likened the situation to the notoriety of Marie Antoinette, the French Queen known for her profligacy.
Local news reports said Yoon was livid and wanted to remove the party's leader, Han Dong-hoon, marking at least a brief split between the president and an official widely seen as a protégé and close associate.
In a poll released by YTN cable news conducted this week, 69% of respondents said Yoon needs to explain his position regarding the controversy around the first lady.
Another poll by the financial publication News Tomato in December showed 53% of respondents believe Kim acted inappropriately, while 27% said she was caught in a trap set up to embarrass her.
""The general public thinks, 'Okay, it may be a trap, but why did she take it (the bag) anyway?'"" said Shin Yul, political science professor at Myongji University."
H33I3NVPZ1_62MZNJRHRQNOHKA,ED summons ration scam case accused Shahajahan Sheikh after fresh raids at his house draw a blank,"Sougata Mukhopadhyay Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 02:12 PM","Sougata Mukhopadhyay Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 02:12 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/west-bengal/ed-summons-ration-scam-case-accused-shahajahan-sheikh-after-fresh-raids-at-his-house-draw-a-blank/cid/1995889,"Nineteen days after officials of the Enforcement Directorate came under attack  while attempting to conduct a search operation at Trinamul Congress leader Shahajahan Sheikh’s residence in Sandeshkhali, North 24 Parganas, in connection with the multi-crore state ration distribution scam case, the agency raided the same premises once again on Wednesday morning. This time, with reinforced security cover, both from the central armed troops as well as from the state police.
Despite a total reversal of scenario with an uneventful operation this time around, sources confirmed that the ED virtually drew a blank after breaking open into Shahajahan’s residence. Three empty briefcases, virtually empty cupboards having no more than ordinary clothing and a kitchen full of household utensils were all the agency officials could find in the first five hours of search, which was in progress at the time this report was filed.
Unable to lay its hands on anything significant in the premises, the ED put up a summons notice asking the Trinamul leader-in-hiding to appear before the investigating agency at its Salt Lake office on January 29.
The owner of the premises and the prime suspect in the Sandeshkhali assault case, Shahajahan, continues to abscond. The development begged the question of whether the suspect, besides managing to evade police net for 19 days, also succeeded in removing incriminating evidence from the premises.
A team of thirteen ED officials, led by an officer of the joint director rank, reached Shahajahan’s residence at Akunjipara More adjacent to the Dhamakhali Road in the Sarberia area of Sandeshkhali at around 8 AM. Besides being accompanied by around 125 central armed central forces jawans who secured the area the moment the team landed at the said premises while state armed police from the block and RAF provided an additional layer of security cover over a 100-meter radius from the house. Together, the forces converted the region into an impenetrable fortress. Central forces jawans also conducted route marches in the vicinity during the raid.
The agency took help of a locksmith to break open locks put up on one of the entry gates to the house. A videographer accompanied the ED team inside the house to record search proceedings. The Bengal police, on the other hand, had their own videographer to record proceedings outside the house while the raids continued inside. Five witnesses, including two local residents who were deployed as witnesses by the local police, also formed part of the raiding team.
The fact that nothing significant was recovered warranted the ED to focus on footage of the last few days from the CCTV cameras which were installed on the premises on court orders. Sleuths, though, expressed doubts on whether anything worthwhile would be revealed by the tapes since the cameras were installed only on January 17, a good 12 days after the previous raid. The window of virtually no vigilance at Shahajahan’s place for a significant period of time, sources opined, may have allowed the suspect or his accomplices to remove vital evidence from the premises.
The raiding officers were seen on the rooftop of Shahajahan’s house, presumably awaiting further orders from agency headquarters in Delhi, after failing to secure any significant evidence in connection with the case. The leading officer of the team also visited the adjacent houses of the suspect’s relatives looking for a particular key to Shahajahan’s property, but had to return empty handed.
On January 5, widespread violence broke out in the area after local villagers gathered in large numbers and attacked the raiding ED officials, their security personnel and even members of the media who had accompanied the search team for news coverage. Vehicles were vandalised, equipment destroyed and three agency officials and media personnel left severely injured by miscreants who were allegedly summoned by the Trinamul leader at large to prevent the agency from carrying out the raid.
The ED later submitted in court that while Shahajahan’s cell phone location confirmed that he was still present in his house which was locked from inside and had, in fact, picked the first call made to him by the raiding officers, the subsequent 28 phone calls made to him went unanswered. The agency also maintained that Sheikh himself had summoned the Trinamul-sheltered miscreants to carry out the attack which forced the officials to flee the spot before himself vanishing into thin air. It also questioned the “inactive” role of the state police while coming under attack at another part of the district on the same day.
So far seven people have been arrested by the local Nazat Police Station in connection with the Sandeshkhali violence while the police have also lodged an FIR against the ED on the basis of a complaint lodged by the caretaker of the suspect’s house. While the state police have come under scanner of the Calcutta High Court for its inability to nab Shahajahan for so long, the court has directed a joint Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and West Bengal Police to probe an attack on the ED officials at Sandeshkhali. That order, though, has already been challenged before an appeals bench of the court by the Directorate and has appealed for a holistic investigation by the CBI without interference of the state police."

The daily wage worker lives below the poverty line and stays in one room at Kapileswarpur village with his three children, wife and mother. He said his name was on the waiting list of beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) till last year but has been dropped now.
“My father Sagar Behera was a toddy tapper and could barely feed us. Throughout his life, he tried for housing support. He died last month in this ramshackle house,” Behera said.
Now Behera can get a house only if the Modi government asks the states to identify new families for the PMAY scheme.
Lalatendu Mohanty, a former sarpanch of the village, said a three-member team of officials comprising the panchayat executive officer, the gram rozgar sevak and a nodal official from the block decide who will be included on the beneficiary list.
“I do not know why Behera has not got PMAY support. There are many undeserving people getting the benefit while several genuine families are waiting,” Mohanty said.
Behera’s condition has raised the possibility of the Modi government failing to ensure housing for all by March this year.
In 2016, the Union government had announced its target to provide ""housing for all"" by March 2022. Based on the data of the Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC), the government set the target to provide housing support to 2.95-crore households under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G). Under the scheme, Rs 1.2 lakh each is offered to beneficiary households in plain areas and Rs 1.3 lakh in hilly areas.
The state governments run their own housing schemes and have constructed nearly one crore houses out of the 2.95-crore target. The Centre hopes to complete the rest by March this year.
In 2018, the state governments conducted an Awaas Plus survey and identified 3.57 crore additional households that needed housing support. However, the ministry of rural development (MoRD) felt the figure was exaggerated and asked the states to verify it. After scrutiny, the Awaas Plus list was revised to 2.8 crore. Of these, the MoRD sanctioned 91 lakh houses. However, there is no clarity on the 1.9 crore houses identified under Awaas Plus and accepted by the Centre as waitlisted beneficiaries.
Anees Thillenkery, secretary of the Ekta Parishad, a civil society organisation spearheading a movement for a legally entitled right to homestead land for the landless, said ""housing for all"" could not be a deadline-driven programme as new beneficiaries would always be there.
“It is not correct if the government sticks to the 2.95-crore target. With this target, housing for all cannot be achieved. Those families selected under Awaas Plus should be provided support. Also, many more homeless families would have emerged in the last five years. A fresh survey should be done to identify new families too,” he said.
A source said that the MoRD had apprised the Prime Minister’s Office of the waitlisted families under Awaas Plus and the other homeless families that have emerged in the last five years.
“Apart from the Awaas Plus list, there could be another three crore homeless families in the last five years. The PMO is yet to take a decision,” the source said.
An email has been sent to MoRD secretary Shailesh Kumar Singh to understand his perspectives on the fate of Awaas Plus and the unidentified households for support. His response is awaited."
H7D5XABU82_PGW7NPHOB9WLYYG,"INDIA Bloc: Response to Didi and Mann indicates Congress pursuing different seat sharing models for Bengal, Punjab","Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 08:43 PM","Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 08:43 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/india-bloc-response-to-mamata-banerjee-and-bhagwant-mann-indicates-congress-pursuing-different-seat-sharing-models-for-bengal-punjab/cid/1995965,"The Congress central leadership reacted in two different ways towards two belligerent allies in two far ends of the country, Bengal and Punjab.
The chief ministers from two different parties, Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamul Congress and Bhagwant Mann of the Aam Aadmi Party, made loud noises of going it alone in their respective states while remaining in the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) block.
However, the last may not have been heard yet from either of them.
The varied response to both the instances that happened in quick succession appeared to be the Congress’ strategy to push a different model for seat-sharing in each state.
“I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we will alone defeat BJP,” Mamata said on Wednesday.
Mamata was also unhappy at not being informed about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. Later in the evening Congress claimed party president Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul wrote separate letters to Mamata on January 13, informing her about the yatra. Whether the letters reached her Kalighat residence or the state secretariat Nabanna is not known.
Within hours of Mamata’s going alone diatribe, Mann used the A-word in a news briefing in Chandigarh.
“There are 13 seats in Punjab and we have shortlisted 40 probable candidates for these seats,” Mann said. “Woh unka aapas mein chal raha hoga (in Bengal), lekin Punjab mein hum alliance nahin karenge (They may have been holding talks but in Punjab we will not go for an alliance).”
Congress left Mann alone, but made attempts to placate Mamata.
“Trinamul is a pillar of the alliance, we cannot imagine the alliance without Mamata ji. Tomorrow our yatra is entering West Bengal. Discussions regarding seat sharing are being done and a result will come soon that will keep everyone satisfied,” said Jairam Ramesh, Congress general secretary in charge of communications.
While a decision on Bengal cannot happen without the nod of the Trinamul chief, Mann has been kept out of the negotiating table, though he is being kept informed of every move.
Both Mamata and Mann have been talking about going it alone over the past few weeks. In  internal meetings with the leaders from West Midnapore, Murshidabad and Birbhum (the last one was held on Tuesday evening) Mamata has asked local leaders to prepare to fight the polls on their own strength (not that the Bengal Congress has much muscle). In the past weeks, Mann too has said the same thing on two separate occasions.
Mann’s assertion comes at a time when leaders of both the AAP and the Congress are in the midst of negotiating a seat-sharing deal for Delhi. In two meetings held in Delhi, the AAP had raised the issue of Gujarat, Goa and Haryana where it wants to contest with the alliance. Punjab remains the thorn.
A section of the Punjab Congress leaders like state unit president Amarinder Singh Raja Warring or Partap Singh Bajwa are against any alliance with the AAP, with their eyes on the 2027 Assembly polls.
“In the two years since AAP came to power, the party’s credibility has taken a hit. Mahaul woh nahin raha (The situation is not the same). The Shiromani Akali Dal is in a disarray and the BJP is restricted to some urban pockets. The Congress does stand a chance to return to power in 2027. The Punjab leaders here feel any alliance with AAP for the Lok Sabha will come to bite them in the Assembly polls,” said a Chandigarh-based political observer.
Both the parties do agree in private that in Delhi the BJP cannot be stopped from making a seven-nil score line for the third time in a row unless both of them hold hands.
AAP leaders contend the Congress is wary of losing the political space in Punjab to the much younger outfit, which was born out of a movement against alleged corruption in the Congress-led UPA.
“In Delhi since 2013 they are nowhere. Neither in the Assembly nor Lok Sabha,” said an AAP leader. “They are afraid the same will happen in Punjab.”
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, in Punjab the Congress had won eight of the 13 Lok Sabha seats, while the AAP finished third with just one seat. In the intervening five years, AAP has formed the government in Punjab and emerged as the third largest party in Gujarat with 12.92 per cent vote share. The AAP presence made a difference in at least 50 Assembly seats in Gujarat, as the Congress bled profusely. Last May, the Congress lost the Lok Sabha seat of Jalandhar which was a party stronghold for 24 years to AAP.
Though no formal announcement has been made yet, there is a buzz that AAP has offered three of the seven seats in Delhi to the grand old party.
In Bengal, the local leaders are against any alliance with Mamata as the Trinamul has aggressively poached its elected representatives at all levels. The last being Bayron Biswas, who won a bypoll to the Sagardighi seat on a Congress ticket with Left support and then moved to the Trinamul."

In 124 countries, this level has gone below the replacement rate of 2.1. Significantly, both India and China — together they account for more than a third of the world’s population — are among them.
In 2023, the global birth rate is 17.46 per thousand, marking a 1.15% decline from 2022. The slowdown process, The Economist notes, will set in all over the world by 2040. But the causes, extent and consequences of demographic convergence and transition that negate the Malthusian nightmare of a famine-stricken, overpopulated world have neither been fully understood nor adequately explained.
How and why are India’s birth rate falling in the absence of a stringent population control policy?
A survey I conducted recently among educated, working women across cities revealed some emerging social trends. More than 60% of the women respondents have the family’s support to raise a child, 43.3% depend on their in-laws for this purpose, while a significant 24% have no one to look after the infant. The rise of female literacy has led to a talent pool joining the workforce, particularly in those segments where women are preferred. Career consciousness, a good pay package, along with recognition at work stressing individuality and independence have resulted in child-rearing not always being their first option. Almost half of the respondents (51.1%) concede to the baby being a hindrance to career pursuits. While 42.9% say staying single might help in pursuing a career, for 28.6% the response is an unhesitant “definitely yes”. Another 28.6%, however, do not see maternity as a roadblock: they look at adoption as an answer to their predicament.
There are other contributing factors. Crèche facilities are either non-existent or extremely inadequate. Only 6% of the respondents say they have this facility at their workplace. A more serious problem for working women is the employers’ reluctance to sanction leave for their partners. As many as 38% of the respondents say the child’s father is not granted any paternity leave. For another 50%, it’s just two weeks. A minuscule 4% get a month off. Be it the public sector or elite private organisations, most employers find ways of retrenching women workers instead of paying them for the maternity period. Paid childcare is confined to the privileged: only 14.9% of the respondents could afford to access it. At the same time, families loathe doing without the economic advantage of the women working. So the baby can be deferred — or even denied.
This trend, strong in urban areas, is gaining momentum in the rural interior as well. The 15 largest countries in terms of GDP have a below-replacement fertility rate. Africa, the most underdeveloped continent containing over 70% of the world’s least developed countries, continues to have a high population growth rate for the same reason. Economic, social, technological and demographic factors have pushed India into a vortex of change. In 1970, India’s GDP growth rate slumbered at 5.16% and its population registered a substantially high growth of 2.23%. Half a century later, the GDP grew at 7.8% in 2023 while the population growth rate marked a record low of 0.81%.
The economic-demographic linkages are unambiguously visible. Now look at another crucial factor in the slowdown — infotainment. Computers, mobile telephony, internet, 24-hour satellite television, WhatsApp… technology has pervaded our lives comprehensively in the past 30 years than in the previous three centuries. A 10-hour power-cut in New York on November 9, 1965 reputedly triggered a baby boom. India has indubitably left the blackout night way behind. With poverty alleviation initiatives along with effective immunisation programmes and enhanced healthcare, which has drastically brought down the infant mortality rate, the need for more children has diminished.
The working woman has two choices: quit to raise a child or say no to babymaking. She has opted for the latter.

For the first time, an all-women tri-services contingent marched down the Kartavya Path, reflecting the country's growing 'Nari Shakti' (women power).
In another first, the parade was heralded by over 100 women artistes playing Indian musical instruments such as sankh, naadswaram and nagada instead of traditional military bands kickstarting the celebrations.
The parade commenced with President Droupadi Murmu taking the salute shortly after she and Macron, flanked by the Indian president's bodyguards, arrived at the Kartavya Path in a 'traditional buggy'.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, several other Union ministers, the country's top military brass, foreign diplomats and senior officials were among the spectators at the biggest event on Kartavya Path, the centrepiece boulevard of the national capital.
The first Army contingent leading the mechanised column was the 61 Cavalry which was raised in 1953. It was followed by 11 mechanised columns, 12 marching contingents and a fly-past by advanced light helicopters of the Army Aviation Corps.
Tank T-90 Bhishma, NAG missile systems, infantry combat vehicles, all-terrain vehicles, weapon locating radar system 'Swathi', drone jammer system, and medium-range surface-to-air missile were among the key displays by the mechanised columns.
The all-women tri-service contingent, led by Captain Sandhya of Army Military Police, with three supernumerary officers Captain Sharanya Rao, Sub Lieutenant Anshu Yadav and Flight Lieutenant Shrishti Rao drew huge applause.
Another all-women Armed Forces Medical Services contingent, headed by Major Srishti Khullar with Captain Amba Samant of the Army Dental Corps, Surgeon Lieutenant Kanchana of the Indian Navy and Flight Lieutenant Dhivya Priya of the Indian Air Force also marched down the ceremonial boulevard.
The Army's marching contingents included the Madras Regiment, the Grenadiers, the Rajputana Rifles, the Sikh Regiment and the Kumaon Regiment.
The Indian Navy's contingent consisted of 144 men and women Agniveers, led by Lt Prajwal M as contingent commander and Lt Mudita Goyal, Lt Sharvani Supreiya and Lt Devika H as platoon commanders.
It was followed by a naval tableau, depicting the themes 'Nari Shakti' and 'Sea Power Across the Oceans Through Indigenisation'.
The first part of the tableau showcased the women in the Indian Navy in all roles and ranks, while the second part depicted the very first indigenous Carrier Battle Group, comprising aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, her highly capable escort ships Delhi, Kolkata and Shivalik and the Kalvari class submarine and Rukmani satellite among others.
The Indian Air Force contingent comprised 144 airmen and four officers, and it was led by Squadron Leader Rashmi Thakur. Squadron Leaders Sumita Yadav and Pratiti Ahluwalia and Flight Lieutenant Kirti Rohil were the supernumerary officers.
The IAF tableau was themed 'Bharatiya Vayu Sena: Saksham, Sashakt, Aatmanirbhar'.
The tableau depicted LCA Tejas and Su-30 flying over the Indian Ocean Region and a C-295 transport aircraft being flown by women aircrew in the cockpit.
The GSAT-7A positioned on the tableau represented the IAF's incorporation of space technology in its operations.
The tableau showed that IAF has been at the forefront of rendering humanitarian aid, both within and across borders.
Another highlight of the parade was the veterans' tableau on the theme 'Rashtra Nirmaan: Pehle Bhi, Ab Bhi, Aage Bhi aur Hamesha'. It showcased the bravery and sacrifices of the ex-servicemen towards the nation.
In its tableau, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) displayed many home-grown critical systems and technologies developed by it.
The tableau was based on the theme of women power in protecting the nation by providing the defence shield in all the five domains of land, air, sea, cyber and space.
Outstanding scientist Sunita Devi Jena was the contingent commander, with P Laxmi Madhavi, J Sujana Choudhary and A Bhuvaneswari also present on the tableau.
The tableau displayed a man-portable anti-tank guided missile, anti-satellite missile, Agni-5, surface-to-surface ballistic missile, very short range air defence system, naval anti-ship missile'short range (NASM-SR) and anti-tank guided missile 'HELINA'.
Quick reaction surface-to-air missile (QRSAM), Astra, Light Combat Aircraft 'Tejas', Uttam active electronically scanned array radar (AESAR), advanced electronic warfare system and Shakti Cyber Security systems were also on display.
The themes of the celebrations were -- 'Viksit Bharat' and 'Bharat -- Loktantra Ki Matruka' (India--Mother of Democracy). A 95-member marching contingent and a 30-member band contingent from France also took part in the parade.
Two Rafale fighters and an Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport aircraft of the French air force also featured in the celebrations.
The celebrations ended with a jaw-dropping flypast by 46 aircraft of the Indian Air Force.
The IAF fleet included 29 fighter jets, seven transport aircraft, nine helicopters and one heritage plane. All these aircraft operated from six different bases.
Fifteen women pilots, including six from the fighter streams, operated the IAF platforms during the fly-past.
For the first time, indigenously-built Tejas aircraft flew in a formation of four aircraft.
There was a previous occasion of one Tejas jet being part of the Republic Day parade but this was the first time that the aircraft flew in a formation."

Advani serves as an advisory council member of the not-for-profit organisation G5A, which is hosting the three-day retrospective on Irrfan through its vertical Cinema House.
The retrospective, which will be held at the G5A warehouse in South Mumbai from Friday, will trace the actor’s cinematic journey through some of his iconic characters in feature films such as “Maqbool”, “The Namesake”, “The Warrior”, “Paan Singh Tomar”, “Qissa” and “The Lunchbox”.
""We are also showing behind-the-scenes photographs of his interactions with his directors, writers and co-actors. So it's a weekend of celebrating Irrfan Khan,"" Advani told PTI in an interview.
The filmmaker had worked with Khan for his 2013 action-thriller ""D-Day"", an experience that he continues to cherish even today.
""He taught me to be fearless and instinctive. He believed that once you have written the script, let's just enjoy the journey. Irrfan chose (films) wisely, like if he had decided to do a mainstream film, it was because he wanted a bigger house.
""Irrfan was a modern-day sufi, he knew poetry and literature. He had read so much and interacted with so many people thanks to the international films that he made with Ang Lee, Mira Nair and Ron Howard... He was very passionate about lots of things that today we have forgotten, like brotherhood, art and cinema,"" he added.
Considered one of India's finest and most versatile actors, Khan died after a battle with a rare form of cancer in April 2020, at the age of 54.
The retrospective will also screen the actor's short films, Mira Nair’s “Migration” and “Road to Ladakh”, as well as a few diploma films that Khan did with FTII students and the episodes from the Star Bestseller TV series.
It is hosted by Khan's wife Sutapa Sikdar, who helped them curate a list of titles that will be showcased.
Advani believes Khan always enabled filmmakers who wanted to ""tell a different story"".
""He allowed them to do that by being part of those movies, by sitting, questioning, and collaborating. And that is what we are celebrating,"" he added.
The “Kal Ho Naa Ho” director also revealed that he wanted to make his 2016 production ""Airlift"" with Khan but they could not.
“Irrfan was the first choice for ‘Airlift’ and when I went to him for narration, he said, ‘You will not get the budget. My shoulders are too small for this film. You should go to Akshay Kumar’.” 	Noted cinema personalities, including filmmakers Vishal Bhardwaj, Tigmanshu Dulia and Shoojit Sircar, as well as actors Pankaj Kapur, Nasseruddin Shah, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Nimrat Kaur, will be part of the retrospective.
Mira Nair, Ritesh Batra and actor Konkana Sen Sharma are expected to attend the retrospective virtually.
Anuradha Parikh, the founder and artistic director of G5A which seeks to promote contemporary art and culture, credited Khan for bridging the gap between mainstream and indie filmmaking.
""The reason that we felt it is important to start this series is because we wanted to celebrate and bring back the culture of watching films together and create a space specifically for independent cinema in a world that's still dominated by the mainstream,” she said.
""It is this kind of watching together and discussing the film which we are screening. Meeting the cast and crew of the film enables discussion on filmmaking at a deeper level,” she added.

These leaders included those from the immediate neighbourhood in South Asia and some from far-flung nations such as Australia. Almost all of them posted their greetings on social media handles and some of them wrote letters or messages to Indian leaders.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese extended his warm wishes to the people of India on the same day as his country celebrates its national day and said, “We have an opportunity to celebrate the depth of our friendship. Australia and India have never been closer.” 	 In a message to President Droupadi Murmu, the British King Charles III said he cherishes the “close bond” shared between the two countries.
“I am confident that our ties will continue to flourish in this very special seventy-fifth anniversary year of the Commonwealth — a fitting reminder of the enduring values and aspirations that unite us,” he wrote.
Congratulating India on a successful G20 presidency last year, King Charles said, “I look forward to our countries continuing to work together to tackle the world's most pressing global challenges.” 	 Russian President Vladimir Putin commended the privileged strategic partnership with India and he congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Republic Day in a telegram message.
“We value the privileged strategic partnership between our countries. I am confident that, through joint efforts, we will continue to systematically boost the constructive cooperation between Russia and India across the board,” the Russian leader said in his message published on the Kremlin website.
“This fully meets the interests of our friendly peoples as it in line with strengthening security and stability both regionally and globally,” he added.
Nepal Prime Minister Pushapakamal Dahal Prachanda posted on his X handle, “On the occasion of 75th Republic Day of India, I extend my best wishes to PM Shri @narendramodi ji, the government and friendly people of India for good health, peace and prosperity.
“I am confident that the ties of friendship between our countries will continue to grow further,” Prachanda said.
Israel Katz, Minister of Foreign Affairs and member of the political-security cabinet, Likud in Israel, extended his respect to his Indian counterpart Jaishankar, and the people of India as he said, “Our nations’ bond is strong, and we continue to strive for shared growth and enduring friendship between India and Israel.” 	 M U M Ali Sabry, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka echoed the same greetings to Jaishankar and the people of India.

I0S7KUHGZZ_LMNEIGQL23LAPZQ,"Canada announces immediate, two-year cap on international student permits amid housing crunch","Reuters Ottawa Published 23.01.24, 09:51 AM","Reuters Ottawa Published 23.01.24, 09:51 AM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/canada-to-cap-international-student-permits-amid-housing-crunch/cid/1995622,"Canada on Monday announced an immediate, two-year cap on international student permits and said it would also stop giving work permits to some postgraduate students as it seeks to rein in record numbers of newcomers seen aggravating a housing crisis.
The cap is expected to result in approximately 360,000 approved study permits in 2024, a decrease of 35% from 2023, according to a statement from the immigration ministry.
Immigration Minister Marc Miller said the federal government would work with the provinces, which oversee the educational system, to apply the cap.
He said the main reason for the cap is to protect students who attend colleges, which are often private-public partnerships, that provide inadequate services at high costs, but also to ease pressure on housing and services.
""Some private institutions have taken advantage of international students by operating under-resourced campuses, lacking supports for students and charging high tuition fees, all the while significantly increasing their intake of international students,"" Miller told reporters.
""This increase is also putting pressure on housing, healthcare and other services,"" he said, adding that fewer numbers would primarily help lower prices for rent.
Rapid population growth fueled by immigration has put pressure on services, like healthcare and education, and has helped drive up housing costs. These issues have weighed on Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's support, with polls showing he would lose an election if one were held now.
In the third quarter of last year, the population grew at its fastest pace in more than six decades, with non-permanent residents - mostly students - increasing by 312,758, the most in more than five decades.
The Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (CASA), a student advocacy group, criticized the cap.
""The biggest problem is that ... there's been announced a cap that is a reaction to the housing crisis,"" said CASA Director of Advocacy, Mateusz Salmassi, adding that what is needed is more support and housing for international students.
The University of Toronto welcomed the announcement and said it would work with all levels of government on the allocation of study permits.
The changes are ""focused on addressing abuses in the system by particular actors and are not intended to adversely impact universities such as ours,"" the university said in a statement."

Troops advanced for the first time into the al-Mawasi district near the Mediterranean Coast, west of Khan Younis, the main city in southern Gaza. There, they stormed the Al-Khair hospital and were arresting medical staff, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al Qidra told Reuters.
There was no immediate word from Israel on the situation at the hospital. The military spokesperson’s office had no comment.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said tanks had also surrounded another Khan Younis hospital, al-Amal, headquarters of the rescue agency, which had lost contact with its staff there. Qidra said at least 50 people were killed overnight in Khan Younis, while the sieges of medical facilities meant dozens of dead and wounded were beyond the reach of rescuers.
“The Israeli occupation is preventing ambulance vehicles from moving to recover bodies of martyrs and the wounded from western Khan Younis,” he said.
The Israeli military spokesperson’s office had no immediate comment on the situation at Al-Khair hospital.
Israel says Hamas fighters operate from in and around hospitals, which Hamas and medical staff deny.
“Hamas embeds its operation within and under hospitals and other medical facilities,” said Elad Goren of COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry branch that coordinates with the Palestinians. “A particular effort led by a dedicated team has been put on making sure that civilians have access to medical care.”
Residents said bombardment from air, land and sea was the most intense in southern Gaza since the war began in October, as Israeli tanks surged across Khan Younis from the east towards the Mediterranean coast.
Video filmed from afar showed scattered civilians wandering a ghost city, crowded with tents with abandoned laundry flapping on lines, as gunfire rattled and columns of smoke rose into the sky.
Israel launched an offensive last week to capture Khan Younis, which it now says is the principal headquarters of the Hamas militants responsible for the October 7 attacks on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies."

The Tata Steel India business, which reflects the merger of three listed and two unlisted subsidiaries, reported PAT of Rs 4,429 crore in the quarter ended December 31, compared with PAT of Rs 1,786 crore a year ago.
However, the UK and Netherlands operations, which posted EBDITA losses of Rs 1,657 crore and Rs 1,215 crore, respectively, yet again dragged the overall performance of the company down during the period.
On a consolidated level, the revenues were down 3.1 per cent to Rs 55,312 crore in Q3, while deliveries were flat at 7.15mt. India turnover was marginally up 2.8 per cent to Rs 35,011 crore, while deliveries were up to 4.88mt.
Commenting on the results, T.V. Narendran, chief executive officer and managing director of Tata Steel, said the global operating environment was complex with the economic slowdown in China and geopolitics weighing on commodity prices in general.
China exported 7-8mt steel every month, the highest since 2015, adversely affecting steel prices and profitability.
“Despite this context, Tata Steel India has delivered better margins aided by higher deliveries as well as realisations on a QoQ basis. Our domestic deliveries for the quarter stood at 4.78 million tonnes and were up 3 per cent QoQ and 10 per cent YoY,” Narendran said.
The company said it has started commissioning a 5mt expansion of the Kalinganagar plant in Odisha. It has spent Rs 4,715 crore on capital expenditure during the quarter and Rs 13,357 crore for the nine months ended December 31, 2023.
Koushik Chatterjee, executive director & CFO of Tata Steel, noted margins increased by 300 basis points quarter-on-quarter even as subdued demand dynamics weighed on margins in the UK and Netherlands. “The UK business continues to face production shortfalls arising from the end-of-life condition of several of its heavy end assets. In the Netherlands, we expect BF#6 to restart by the end of January,” he said.
On January 19, Tata Steel announced the closure of the Port Talbot operations in 2024-25 and building of an electric arc furnace by 2027, cutting 2,800 jobs. Tata Steel proposes to commit more than £130 million to a comprehensive support package for the affected employees."

State JD(U) president Umesh Singh Kushwaha made the statement, refuting rumours that his party, headed by the chief minister, was thinking of a return to the BJP-led NDA.
""All is well in Bihar's ruling Mahagathbandhan and the media speculations are driven by some agenda,"" Kushwaha told reporters.
He also said, ""I met the CM yesterday as well as today. It is a routine affair. There is no truth in the rumours doing the rounds. We also reject the rumours that party MLAs have been asked to rush to Patna"".
He also made light of Kumar and his deputy Tejashwi Yadav, who is in RJD, sitting far from each other at the Republic Day parade, asserting that ""we are firmly with INDIA coalition"".
Kushwaha, however, said, ""We want the Congress, which is our alliance partner, to do some introspection with regard to its stance towards other constituents and sharing of seats. Our leader Nitish Kumar has for long been stressing on the need for early finalisation of seat-sharing deal so that we could concentrate on Lok Sabha polls"".
The statement of the JD(U) leader came in the backdrop of two opposition bloc INDIA partners, TMC and AAP, ruling out the possibility of a truck with the Congress in West Bengal and Punjab respectively.
To a pointed query about his party's return to the NDA, which it had junked less than two years ago, the JD(U) leader said, ""these are rumours spread by those with some agenda"".
Kushwaha was also asked about social media posts of Rohini Acharya, daughter of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, in which she appeared to have taken a swipe at Kumar.
The JD(U) leader replied, ""We take no notice of that because Rohini Acharya is not an RJD office-bearer"".
Meanwhile, when asked about the delay in seat-sharing in the opposition bloc INDIA, state Congress president Akhilesh Prasad Singh asked, ""why nobody asks about the BJP-led NDA? They, too are yet to sort out sharing of seats with allies"".
Replying to another query, he said, ""Nitish Kumar is our leader in Bihar. I have no idea from where rumours of his going back to NDA have emanated."""

The remark came a day after West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee announced that her party will fight the Lok Sabha polls ""alone"" in the state.
Claiming that Chowdhury was the reason the alliance did not work out in West Bengal, O'Brien said the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) had many detractors but only two -- the BJP and Chowdhury -- have repeatedly spoken out against the bloc.
""After the general elections, if the Congress does its job and defeats the BJP on a substantial number of seats, the Trinamul Congress will very much be a part of the front that believes and fights for the Constitution,"" O'Brien told reporters here.
Banerjee's sudden comments on Wednesday forced the Congress to adopt a conciliatory approach with party general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh asserting that the opposition bloc INDIA ""cannot be imagined without Mamata Banerjee"".

In an apparent swipe at Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the opposition party said many chief ministers can fall to any level of sycophancy to ""make Delhi happy"".
Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said the country needs ""five types of justice"" in the current scenario -- justice for youth, women, farmers, labourers, and participation of all.
Only the restoration of these justices will give strength to the country. The majority of the population of our country is still outside its ambit, Kumar said at a press conference at the AICC headquarters here.
""It seems the rulers are afraid of the success of struggle,"" he said, adding that while Bharat Jodo Yatra did not face any major hindrances, obstacles were being created for the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
He said it started with the denial of permission to start the Yatra from an Imphal ground.
""They (BJP governments) give the excuse of security every time to disrupt our Yatra and the unjust forces are creating obstacles in this fight for justice,"" Kumar said.
""This is not an electoral yatra but a yatra of struggle for the country. Efforts are being made repeatedly to stop the Yatra and permissions are withdrawn at the last moment,"" the Congress leader alleged.
""The question is that due to our Yatra, a law and order situation arises but on the same route when ministers or (BJP chief J P) Nadda ji's programme is there, it is allowed. So the government is standing with injustice,"" Kumar said.
The Congress party ""which defeated the British, which was not afraid of their cannons, why would they be afraid of the barricades"", he said in a reference to the Yatra being stopped from entering Guwahati on Tuesday.
""Many CMs can fall to any level of sycophancy in order to make Delhi happy... 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' is being organised only to establish social, economic and political justice in the country.
""FIRs on false allegations and false cases have been filed against Congress workers and leaders and we will not be scared of such tactics, we will not be cowed down,"" the Congress leader said.
Rahul Gandhi was booked on Tuesday for ""wanton acts of violence"" by the Assam Police as the political confrontation between the Congress leader and state Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma escalated on the tenth day of the Yatra.
""Concerning wanton acts of violence, provocation, damage to public property and assault on police personnel today by Congress members, an FIR has been registered against Rahul Gandhi, KC Venugopal, Kanhaiya Kumar and other individuals...,"" the chief minister posted on X.
Sarma had earlier in the day instructed Director General of Police G P Singh to register a case against Gandhi for ""provoking the crowd"".
Gandhi said Sarma was ""scared"" and asserted that his actions were only helping the Yatra in getting publicity.
The state police didn't allow the Gandhi-led yatra to enter the capital city, triggering protests from Congress workers who removed barricades, resulting in a clash in which some Congress leaders, including state party president Bhupen Borah, suffered minor injuries.
At the presser on Wednesday, Kumar said unemployment in the country is at a ""45-year high"" and, therefore, justice for youths means employment for them.
""We have to ensure participation of people, irrespective of the sector,"" he said and asserted that there was a need to build a safe and free society for women.
""Farmers should get fair prices for their crops... workers are not getting fair wages. Congress government will ensure fair wages,"" he said, elaborating on what he called the ""five pillars of justice"" needed in the country.
Kumar's remarks come a day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the idea behind his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is to provide justice to people and the party will present a five-point blueprint of 'nyay' that will also help strengthen the country.
Gandhi said it will be based on five pillars which are justice to youth, women, farmers, labourers and achieving equal participation.

""You must have seen full-page advertisements screaming ‘Modi’s guarantee’. What’s Modi’s guarantee? Modi promised two crore jobs every year; has that been delivered? He promised to bring back black money and distribute (shares of) Rs 15 lakh to everybody. Has that been done?"" Kharge told a party workers' convention in Hyderabad.
He said Modi had made several such unfulfilled promises, including bringing down prices.
""The high prices are tormenting people. Don’t fall into his trap. Democracy will be destroyed if he is not removed. He promises to strengthen democracy while MPs are suspended from Parliament for raising people’s concerns,"" the Congress president said.
Kharge accused Modi of using religiosity to mislead the people.
He said the country’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had described industries and dams as modern-day temples and that to him, pilgrimage meant ensuring a bright future for future generations. However, Kharge rued, Modi was wandering around temples and seashores instead of solving the people’s problems.
""He won’t go to Manipur where the lives of thousands of families have been destroyed,"" Kharge added.
This was the first of a series of workers’ conventions that Kharge is to address to prepare the Congress machinery for the general election, at a time Rahul Gandhi is occupied with the Nyay Yatra.
In Hyderabad on Thursday, he said the Opposition grouping INDIA would fight the BJP with all its might even if cracks seem to be developing in Bengal and Bihar.
He made it clear that Modi's failings would remain the main focus, apart from the Nyay infrastructure the party has been working on relating to issues of the youth, women, farmers, workers and equal participation.
""Modi was elected to solve problems, not to worship in temples and whip up religious passions. He destroyed the careers of youths by introducing schemes such as Agniveer (for temporary military recruitment),"" he said.
""Where will the youths go after retiring (from the military services) in four years? He (Modi) is engaged in personal publicity and electioneering at public expense. The nation’s debt jumped from Rs 55 lakh crore to Rs 155 lakh crore — is this development?""
Kharge appeared worried about the religious frenzy Modi has succeeded in generating over the Ram temple. He repeatedly said that religion was a private affair but Modi was linking it to politics.
Responding to Modi's claim of taking ""the youth out of the darkness that had faced them"", Congress communications chief Jairam Ramesh said: ""Really, Mr Prime Minister?! The reality is that the 10 years since 2014 have seen the maximum ANYAY against the youth of India. One out of every three youths has completely given up on their future as they do not have jobs, are not employed, and are not in training. This number is over 50 per cent for young women."""

Justice Subramonium Prasad said the former Jharkhand chief minister’s petition challenging the Lokpal proceedings as well as the complaint was “premature”.
It is premature at this juncture, the judge stated while delivering the verdict on Soren’s petition.
A copy of the judgment is awaited.
In the complaint made in August 2020, Dubey, the BJP Lok Sabha MP from Jharkhand’s Godda seat, claimed: “Shibu Soren and his family members acquired huge wealth and properties by misusing the public exchequer and have been grossly indulged in corruption.”
On September 12, 2022, the high court had stayed the Lokpal proceedings and said the matter required consideration.
Assailing the complaint and the Lokpal proceedings, Soren argued before the high court that the case against him was “purely malafide” and “politically motivated”.
He argued the anti-corruption ombudsman could not have entertained the complaint as the allegations pertained to a time which was seven years before the date of submission of the complaint.

Acharya had used derogatory language against Kumar, also the ruling JD(U) president, in several posts on X, which were deleted later, Bihar BJP leader Nikhil Anand claimed.
Sharing a screenshot of the purported deleted posts, Anand said, ""These are like an arrow released from the bow.” 	The BJP leader said if Acharya regrets having used words like ‘badtameez’ (ill-mannered) against the chief minister in the post, she should publicly express regret and apologise.
A section of the media claimed that Acharya had reacted to Kumar's statement against dynastic politics at a JD(U) rally commemorating former state chief minister and socialist icon Karpoori Thakur's birth anniversary on Wednesday. Thakur was conferred with the Bharat Ratna posthumously earlier this week.
While addressing the rally here, Kumar criticised dynastic politics, stating that JD(U) followed the path shown by the late leader by not promoting anyone from the family in the party ranks.
A section of the media claimed that his statement was indirectly aimed at the RJD, an ally of the JD(U) in Bihar's Mahagathbandhan government in which sons of Prasad are ministers.
Prasad’s younger son and heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav is the Deputy chief minister of the Bihar government, while his elder son Tej Pratap Yadav is a minister in the state cabinet. The RJD president’s eldest daughter Misa Bharti is a Rajya Sabha member.
Responding to Kumar's comments on dynastic politics, Acharya attacked the chief minister in posts on X but she deleted them later, according to BJP leader Anand.

That seems to be the implicit demand in the claim presented in court in the name of the deity Krishna and worshippers asking that the Shahi Idgah mosque area in Mathura be transferred to the Katra Keshav Dev temple with which it shares the premises. The mosque is supposed to have been built over the presumed ‘prison cell’ in which Krishna was born — according to legend, nowadays indistinguishable from fact — and the Allahabad High Court passed an order last December for a commissioner to inspect the mosque’s premises. Earlier, it had ordered the Archaeological Survey of India to conduct a ‘scientific’ survey around the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi which members of the majority community claimed to be part of the Kashi Vishwanath temple. The Supreme Court, however, stayed the Mathura order in response to a petition from the mosque’s management, reportedly saying that the order was based on a vague application without specified reasons. The high court was adjudicating on all the suits regarding the Krishna birthplace dispute, and the Supreme Court allowed other matters regarding the issue to be heard as usual.
The Supreme Court’s decision seems to have paused a growing trend: using the law to claim places of worship of minority faiths supposed to have ‘originally’ belonged to the majority religion. Yet altering the religious character of a place of worship as it stood on August 15, 1947 is barred by the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991. The Allahabad High Court order was passed in the face of the earlier Supreme Court ruling that no interim relief could be afforded by civil courts when the maintainability of suits was in question, as in this case. Are ‘inspections’ and ‘surveys’ to obtain motifs and objects of apparently Hindu origin meant to open a back-door to the issue, thus strengthening the claims? In any case, artisans used practised forms in their structures as they travelled from patron to patron; motifs and designs overlap. Besides, the temple trust in Mathura had given the land to the mosque by legal agreement in 1973. But all this is being treated as inconsequential in the Hindutva push to use the legal route for religious domination. This back-door needs to be closed firmly for the sake of equality, secularism and harmony."

The seat next to that of Kumar was occupied by senior JD(U) leader and minister Ashok Kumar Choudhary who removed the slip said to be bearing the name of Yadav before occupying the chair.
Leader of the opposition in the assembly, Vijay Kumar Sinha of the BJP, sat next to Choudhary and he was seen exchanging pleasantries with Kumar.
The high tea was organised on the occasion of Republic Day.
Though education minister Alok Kumar Mehta, who is also a national general secretary of the RJD, was among the attendees, Yadav and many other party leaders, including Speaker Awadh Bihari Chaudhary, did not turn up.
When Kumar was approached with queries about Yadav’s absence at the function, he gave a curt reply, “Ask those who did not turn up (jo nahin aaye unse puchhiye)”, and drove back to his official residence.
Speculations are rife that Kumar was unhappy with the Mahagathbandhan, which includes the Congress and the RJD with three Left parties supporting the government from outside.
There are also rumours that he might be planning a return to the BJP-led NDA, though leaders of the saffron party have maintained that doors were “closed” for the JD(U) supremo.
JD(U) leaders have also been maintaining that the party was “firmly with"" the opposition bloc INDIA.
However, when Sinha was approached with queries by journalists after the function was over, he replied, “I am here in my capacity as the leader of the opposition. I have no knowledge about the truth behind the speculations. The BJP is a party in which decisions are taken collectively, by the leadership. We will all abide by whatever decision is taken”.
Notably, Sinha was also present at a meeting of Bihar BJP leaders held at Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s residence in Delhi late Thursday night.
He also declined to comment on the rumours of a rift in the 'Mahagathbandhan', saying “It is a question you should ask members of the coalition”."

Yet, even as much of the international community called for calm and urged both sides to pull back from any escalation, the Indian ministry of external affairs appeared to justify Iran’s attack on Pakistani soil, saying it understood the rationale for Tehran to act against terrorist infrastructure in another nation’s territory if it felt threatened. For now, the tensions between Pakistan and Iran are no longer on the boil, with the neighbours committing to de-escalate matters, although their broader border differences remain intact. Yet, India’s response to the Iranian attack raises questions that could complicate its responses to subsequent crises around the world, including when New Delhi might be involved. To be sure, India has long argued that Pakistan’s State support for terrorism, which includes funding and training of armed groups, not just remains a fundamental challenge in relations between New Delhi and Islamabad but is also a cause for deep concern for Iran and Afghanistan. Indeed, Pakistan-based terror groups have threatened both Iran and Afghanistan. Jaish al-Adl, the group that Tehran claims it targeted, had taken responsibility for the killing of 11 Iranian security personnel in a December attack on a police station in the Iranian town of Rask.
But India must not forget another cornerstone of its international relations doctrine: respect for the territorial sovereignty and integrity of all nations. Extraterritorial killings, whomever the target might be, represent a breach of that policy. India’s position on the cross-border attacks risks weakening its ability to stand by that principle in other global hotspots. Israel and Iran, for instance, frequently target enemies across border lines even if these raise the prospects of escalation. Would India justify the United States of America, or other military powers like China and Russia, engaging in targeted, cross-border military strikes that, they say, are pre-emptive? And how would India respond if its own territory were targeted in this manner? India rightly argues for all nations to uphold international law because that also benefits New Delhi’s strategic calculus. It must not deviate from that for short-term convenience or to score brownie points. A rules-based order that is applied only selectively strengthens neither rules nor order."

The Tata Steel India business, which reflects the merger of three listed and two unlisted subsidiaries, reported PAT of Rs 4,429 crore in the quarter ended December 31, compared with PAT of Rs 1,786 crore a year ago.
However, the UK and Netherlands operations, which posted EBDITA losses of Rs 1,657 crore and Rs 1,215 crore, respectively, yet again dragged the overall performance of the company down during the period.
On a consolidated level, the revenues were down 3.1 per cent to Rs 55,312 crore in Q3, while deliveries were flat at 7.15mt. India turnover was marginally up 2.8 per cent to Rs 35,011 crore, while deliveries were up to 4.88mt.
Commenting on the results, T.V. Narendran, chief executive officer and managing director of Tata Steel, said the global operating environment was complex with the economic slowdown in China and geopolitics weighing on commodity prices in general.
China exported 7-8mt steel every month, the highest since 2015, adversely affecting steel prices and profitability.
“Despite this context, Tata Steel India has delivered better margins aided by higher deliveries as well as realisations on a QoQ basis. Our domestic deliveries for the quarter stood at 4.78 million tonnes and were up 3 per cent QoQ and 10 per cent YoY,” Narendran said.
The company said it has started commissioning a 5mt expansion of the Kalinganagar plant in Odisha. It has spent Rs 4,715 crore on capital expenditure during the quarter and Rs 13,357 crore for the nine months ended December 31, 2023.
Koushik Chatterjee, executive director & CFO of Tata Steel, noted margins increased by 300 basis points quarter-on-quarter even as subdued demand dynamics weighed on margins in the UK and Netherlands. “The UK business continues to face production shortfalls arising from the end-of-life condition of several of its heavy end assets. In the Netherlands, we expect BF#6 to restart by the end of January,” he said.
On January 19, Tata Steel announced the closure of the Port Talbot operations in 2024-25 and building of an electric arc furnace by 2027, cutting 2,800 jobs. Tata Steel proposes to commit more than £130 million to a comprehensive support package for the affected employees."

The FIR was registered at Amritsar's Sultanwind police station on January 23, the police said on Wednesday.
Pannun has been designated as a terrorist by the Union Home Ministry under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Sikhs for Justice banned.
In a video posted on social media, Pannun allegedly claimed that the Shri Durgiana Mandir in Amritsar had no historical significance in Hinduism.
The pro-Khalistan leader also purportedly warned the temple management to shut its gates and hand over the keys to the Golden Temple administration.
The police said the case was registered on the basis of Pannun's social media video.
He has been booked under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race), 153B (making or publishing statements that promote disharmony or hatred between different religious, racial, language, or regional groups) and 505 (whoever makes, publishes or circulates any statement, rumour or report) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the IT Act, the police said.
Pannun on January 16 issued a veiled threat to Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and police chief Gaurav Yadav as he asked gangsters in the state to join the Sikhs For Justice and stop top political leaders from attending the Republic Day parade.
In an email sent to some journalists and two videos accessed by PTI, Pannun compared Mann with former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh, who was assassinated in a bomb blast in August 1995.
Pannun also equated Punjab Director General Police Yadav to assassinated officer Gobind Ram, who was killed in a bomb blast in 1990.
In one of the purported videos, Pannun dared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the Republic Day parade without security.
In another video, he asked gangsters in Punjab to join the Sikhs for Justice, participate in a referendum for Khalistan, and also prevent Mann from hoisting the Tricolour on Republic Day.
The email sent to journalists, however, deviated slightly from the videos where Pannun, besides giving a call to Punjab gangsters to join the Sikhs for Justice, also asked them to get recognised as ""shaheeds (martyrs)"".

The police said that two persons were arrested and six were booked in Jammu district for allegedly uploading objectionable content on social media to create communal tension between two communities.
One of the arrested persons was identified by residents as Zaffar Hussain from Khanna Chargal, which is on the outskirts of Jammu district.
Some reports claimed the other arrested person was a female undergraduate student, although her family denied her arrest.
“She too has been booked but not arrested so far. Some other youths, however, have also been picked up for questioning. We have moved court for their bail,” the girl’s relative told The Telegraph.
The relative said the girl was a cousin of Zaffar and the two had posted some comments on the razed Babri Masjid.
“They were angry over the Babri Masjid’s demolition and construction of a temple at the place,” he said.
The police said a case was registered against Zaffar and the other youths at Nagrota police station following a complaint from a resident, who is from another community.
Multiple cases have also been filed in Reasi, Ramban, Rajouri and Kathua districts of the Jammu division.
Reasi district police said that they had registered two FIRs and arrested three persons for posting objectionable content on social media platforms.
“Acting promptly on directions of SSP Reasi Sh. Amit Gupta-JKPS, FIR No. 19/2024 U/S 295-A IPC (outraging religious feelings) has been registered at Police Station, Reasi and FIR No. 04/2024 U/S 295-A IPC of the law has been registered at Police Station Arnas,” the police said.
Gupta advised people to refrain from posting any objectionable content on social media that could disturb peace and harmony in the area."

The remark came a day after West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee announced that her party will fight the Lok Sabha polls ""alone"" in the state.
Claiming that Chowdhury was the reason the alliance did not work out in West Bengal, O'Brien said the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) had many detractors but only two -- the BJP and Chowdhury -- have repeatedly spoken out against the bloc.
""After the general elections, if the Congress does its job and defeats the BJP on a substantial number of seats, the Trinamul Congress will very much be a part of the front that believes and fights for the Constitution,"" O'Brien told reporters here.
Banerjee's sudden comments on Wednesday forced the Congress to adopt a conciliatory approach with party general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh asserting that the opposition bloc INDIA ""cannot be imagined without Mamata Banerjee"".

J5ILEWQTTA_KLQP0J4E23TQ00B,Book of revelations,"Sushant Singh Published 25.01.24, 06:49 AM","Sushant Singh Published 25.01.24, 06:49 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/opinion/book-of-revelations-the-lid-on-m-m-naravanes-memoirs/cid/1995986,"Five years after the ignominy of the 1962 Sino-India conflict, one of the men blamed for India’s defeat, Lieutenant-General B.M. Kaul, came out with his memoirs, The Untold Story. The book gave his version of the 1962 operations in which he first served as the Chief of General Staff and then took over the command of the newly-raised 4 Corps in the eastern sector where the Indian army suffered a humiliating rout. Kaul had resigned after the military defeat but when his book came out, it caused a furore in Parliament.
Many members of Parliament asked whether Kaul had sought prior permission from the government to publish it or had submitted the manuscript to the government before its publication. When the then defence minister, Swaran Singh, replied in the negative to both queries, some MPs demanded Kaul’s arrest. Singh then clarified that defence personnel need to seek permission to write a book only when they are in service. “But after their retirement, no permission as such is required. But the law of the land still prevails, namely the Official Secrets Act, and anything which comes within the Official Secrets Act will be an offence and as such actionable under the Official Secrets Act,” he added.
The law hasn’t changed since, but the political environment certainly has. Four Stars of Destiny: An Autobiography, the memoirs of General M.M. Naravane who retired as the army chief in April 2022, was to be released on January 15. The author and the publisher had made the announcement and the book was available for pre-order. But as soon as certain excerpts from the book were released by a news agency as part of the publisher’s promotion strategy, the Narendra Modi government stalled the release of the book. The tentative date for the book’s release is now April 30 on e-commerce portals.
Some chapters of the book have been given to the external affairs ministry while the army headquarters is reviewing the other material. Unlike an order issued by the Modi government in 2021 to bar retired bureaucrats, diplomats and intelligence officials from writing anything without prior approval, there is no such bar on retired military officers. They are only bound by the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, which they sign as having read on the first day of every year when in service.
Naravane is not the first retired army chief to pen his memoirs. It is hard to imagine that he is neither aware of the provisions of the law nor sensitive about revealing information that can jeopardise military operations. Most memoirs of retired government officials contain revelations that are interesting; some disclosures have even embarrassed governments. But such books get published freely even if they sprout a political controversy. That is the norm in any functioning democracy.
Based on the extracts, Naravane’s recounting of the decision-making process around the Agnipath scheme — the controversial arrangement for short-term contractual recruitment of soldiers announced in June 2022 — seems to have ruffled feathers in the Modi government. The former army chief writes that his proposal was only for a 10% recruitment of soldiers for five years on same terms as regular soldiers but this was converted by the Prime Minister’s Office into a new scheme that mandated 100% short-term contractual recruitment of soldiers into the three defence services at a monthly salary of Rs 20,000 for a period of three years.
""This was just not acceptable,"" writes the former army chief. ""Here, we were talking about a trained soldier, who was expected to lay down his life for the country. Surely a soldier could not be compared with a daily wage labourer?"" This led to an increase in the starting salary to Rs 30,000 per month but the army’s insistence on retaining 75% of the short-term contracted soldiers was rejected by the government. Even a proposal for 50% retention by General Bipin Rawat was not accepted by the political leadership which argued that only 25,000 demobilised Agniveer soldiers returning to society every year was too little. People in the know say that the current army chief, General Manoj Pande, has moved a case for 50% retention with the government late last year but has not got the formal political approval so far.
More important is his revelation that for the other two services, the navy and the air force, the political direction for the Agnipath scheme “came like a bolt from the blue."" Naravane explains that he needed some time to clarify to the other two service chiefs that his initial proposal had been specific to the army and that he, too, was taken aback by these unforeseen developments. For the air force, the three/four years' contractual engagement was insufficient to adequately train individuals in the technical skills essential for such tasks as repairs and routine operating and maintenance procedures for aircraft.
In November 2023, speaking at the army’s Chanakya Dialogue in New Delhi, a former navy chief revealed that the then navy chief, Admiral Karambir Singh, had rejected, in writing, the draft Agnipath scheme. But the scheme was still imposed upon the three services. More critically, the three service chiefs — Naravane and Singh had by then retired — were paraded in front of the media to take ownership of the Agnipath scheme. When massive protests broke out in many states over the new scheme, the military leadership was at the forefront of defending the unsatisfactory arrangement. None of the incumbent service chiefs has displayed the moral courage to state the truth. Instead, they have allowed the military to be used as a shield for an unwise political decision that is damaging for the armed forces.
The Modi government has deceived the public about the Agnipath scheme, portraying it as an idea of the military leadership for a ‘youthful profile’ for the armed forces. Their objections and the political impositions have never been revealed by the government. An RTI application seeking records of deliberations on the Agnipath scheme was rejected by the defence ministry, arguing that the files were classified as “secret”. The word, 'secret', is nowhere in the exemption clause of the RTI Act under which information could be denied to an applicant. Instead of passing specific orders, the Central Information Commission has only asked the ministry to either ""provide the revised information or reply as per the applicable exemption of the RTI Act.”
Naravane’s revelations do not violate the Official Secrets Act. They nail the untruths in the political narrative about the short-term contractual recruitment of soldiers at poor wages. The general demonstrates, perhaps unwittingly, that the Modi government was apathetic to the aspirations of the youth who wish to serve in the military, ignored the recommendations of the service chiefs, and was unconcerned about the health of the armed forces as an institution. Going into general elections in a couple of months, the ruling party is in no mood to let this truth about the Agnipath scheme be known to the public before they press the button on the voting machines.
Naravane’s memoirs are unlikely to see the light of the day before the elections, lest they damage the ruling party in any way. This is not a formal banning of the book but a devious way of imposing censorship. The effect, in furthering ignorance and subverting democracy, is the same as the burning of books in Europe in the previous century. The warning lies in the words of the Jewish writer, Heinrich Heine, in Almansor, a play he wrote in 1821: “That was but a prelude; where they burn books, they will ultimately burn people also.”

As Bose's convoy reached the university gate, students of both Trinamul Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) and leftist AIDSO separately showed black flags to him and shouted ""go back"" slogans.
However, the policemen present at the spot ensured the convoy went inside the campus and the protestors were kept at a distance.
A TMCP spokesperson said, ""We hold the governor responsible for the crumbling of infrastructure in Calcutta University due to the absence of a permanent Vice Chancellor in the university and demanded immediate appointment of a permanent VC"".
The AIDSO, students' wing of leftist SUCI (Communist) also made similar demands apart from scrapping the New Education Policy 2020.
Bose came to the university on the occasion of the Calcutta University foundation day programme.
CU has been without a permanent VC since March last year and the Higher Education minister has opposed the appointment of Santa Dutta as the officiating VC by Bose, who is the ex-officio chancellor of the state university.
The students also held placards which read ""Go back governor"", and ""we demand permanent vc for CU"".

In a virtual address to young voters organised by the youth wing of the ruling BJP, Modi said his government took the country out of the darkness staring at youngsters 10-12 years back. The young generation at that time had given up hope on the possibilities being created now, he said.
Modi asked the youngsters to send their suggestions for the BJP's manifesto for the elections, expected in April-May, to him through the NaMo app, saying he would meet with some of them whose ideas are good and workable.
The prime minister presented a grim assessment of the Congress and other opposition parties without naming them and highlighted the changes effected by his government after coming to power in 2014. He said corruption and scams used to make the headlines back then but the talk these days is about credibility and success stories in different sectors.
""It is Modi's guarantee that your dreams are my resolve,"" he said, asserting that youngsters have always been his priority and that a host of development schemes like 'Digital India', 'Start-up India' and reforms in various fields besides the massive spending in infrastructure have created limitless opportunities for them.
His government has been working day and night to fulfil their dreams and boost their capabilities, Modi said, stressing that he has always had trust in them. First-time voters support the BJP's development agenda, he added.
Taking a swipe at opposition parties, Modi said youngsters are against corruption and ""parivarwaad"" (nepotism), adding that family-run parties never allow other youngsters to move ahead.
""The mindset of the leaders of these parties is anti-youth. You have to defeat these family parties with the strength of your votes,"" he said in the address on the occasion of the National Voters' Day.
The presence of a stable and strong-majority government at the Centre in the last 10 years led to big decisions and the resolution of issues pending for decades, Modi said, citing the abrogation of Article 370, GST roll-out, reservation for women in the Lok Sabha and assemblies and the end to the practice of instant triple talaq among Muslims.
In this context, he also mentioned the recent consecration ceremony at the Ram temple in Ayodhya.
With young voters listening in from over 5,000 locations across the country, Modi said they have the responsibility of making India a developed nation in the next 25 years in the same way the young generation fought for its freedom during the 25 years before Independence.
Due to the presence of a stable and strong government, India's prestige has reached a new high globally, he said. ""India stands strong and resilient, more than ever before. This is the power of a majority government,"" the prime minister said.
""Your one vote and the direction of the country's development are intertwined. Your one vote will make India the third-largest economy in the world. Your one vote will bring a stable government enjoying a big majority. Your one vote will further speed up reforms and land India in a space on its own."" 	Noting that India will celebrate its 75th Republic Day on Friday, the prime minister told the young voters that theirs and the country's next 25 years were very important as he asked them to make choices that would guide it towards development.
India's strong infrastructure today is proving to be the biggest driver for growth, he said.
""From regional connectivity to communication, from mobile towers to optical fibre network, from semi-conductors mission to Mission Hydrogen, from aviation sector to tourism sector – every transformation taking place in the country is for the youth of the nation, for you,"" Modi added.
This is perhaps the first time, Modi said, that any leader in the world has connected with such a large number of young voters.
The prime minister said it was his government that implemented the new education policy and also protected the interests of SCs, STs and OBCs while ensuring 10 per cent reservation for the poor among the general class.

In a late night post on X on Sunday, Congress general secretary, organisation, K C Venugopal alleged that since the yatra's entry in Assam, ""the most corrupt chief minister in India has been carrying out relentless attacks on our convoys, properties and leaders using his goons."" 	""This is a matter that every Indian must take seriously because it exposes the BJP's fascism and hooliganism. All across India, PCCs and DCCs are instructed to hold large-scale protests tomorrow evening and expose how the Modi-led BJP is killing democracy in Assam through their corrupt CM,"" he said.
""Our fight for justice - social, economic and political - will continue undeterred!"" he said.
In his letter to all Pradesh Congress Committee chiefs, state in-charges, party secretaries, heads of frontal organisations, departments and cells, Venugopal said the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra led by Rahul Gandhi, which commenced in Manipur on January 14, has successfully journeyed through Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and now entered Assam.
""Regrettably, as you know, the BJP, particularly its most corrupt Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in Assam, is desperately trying to disrupt this peaceful Yatra,"" he said.
""Over the past two days, we have seen planned attacks on the convoys of Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra and instances of tearing down our Yatra posters by these troublemakers,"" the Congress leader said.
Today, a deliberately assembled crowd of BJP workers ""attacked"" the convoy led by Rahul Gandhi, resulting in injuries to several party leaders, including the Assam Congress chief, Venugopal alleged.
This evening, there was a fresh attack on the Nyay Yatra by the ""goons"" supported by the BJP, he said.
""This is nothing but a desperate attempt to mask the administrative failures and corruption of the Assam chief minister and the BJP government at the Centre,"" he said.
""In the face of such blatant attempts to suppress our cause, it is imperative that we stand firm and united. Our collective resistance is not just a response to these attacks; it is a declaration of our unwavering commitment to justice,"" Venugopal said in the letter.
""We cannot allow the desperate actions of a few to deter us from our mission,"" he said.
In light of these events, it is requested that massive protest demonstrations be held in state and district headquarters by the PCCs, involving our senior leaders and party functionaries Monday evening, the 22 January, Venugopal said.
""Let us come together to strongly oppose these heinous, planned violent attacks on the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,"" he said.
Assam Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah was allegedly assaulted while general secretary Jairam Ramesh's car was targeted in Assam's Sonitpur district during the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on Sunday.
The party has demanded a judicial inquiry into the attack on Borah, alleging involvement of a BJP MLA and his supporters.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was also mobbed at a roadside eatery in Assam's Nagaon district on Sunday evening.
The crowd raised slogans against the Wayanad MP and also displayed placards with messages such as 'Anyay Yatra' and 'Rakibul go back', referring to Samaguri Congress MLA Rakibul Hussain.

An idol of the new Ram Lalla was consecrated at the Ayodhya temple on Monday, a landmark event led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who also gave a clarion call to go beyond the grand mandir's construction to build the foundation of a ""strong, capable and divine"" India of the next 1,000 years.
""January 22, 2024, is not merely a date in the calendar but heralds the advent of a new era,"" Modi said after he performed a series of rituals in the 'garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum)' with the consecration taking place during an 84-second 'Abhijeet muhurta' starting at 12.29 pm.
The prime minister also prostrated himself before the 51-inch idol that depicts the child Ram.
""Today, our Ram has arrived. After a long wait for ages, our Ram has arrived. Our Ram Lalla will no longer live in a tent. Our Ram Lalla will stay in a magnificent temple,"" Modi said in his address to the invitees, which included seers, leading figures from different fields and those part of the decades-long Ram Janmabhoomi movement for building the temple.
A large number of the invitees, including seers, later had a 'darshan' of the deity soon after the consecration ceremony ended.
For the general public, the doors of the temple opened on Tuesday morning.
Waiting in the serpentine queues outside the temple were people who have been camping in Ayodhya since before the consecration ceremony, having made long and difficult journeys to reach the temple town.
Nitish Kumar, a resident of Bihar's Madhepura district, cycled more than 600 kilometres to reach Ayodhya.
""There is a massive rush but I am hopeful I will get a chance to have 'darshan' today. I will start my journey back once my wish is fulfilled. Though I couldn't go to the temple on Monday, what a day it was to be in Ayodhya,"" he told PTI.
Anurag Sharma from Rajasthan's Sikar was seen walking around with a model of the temple on the day of the consecration ceremony.
""I brought this model with me from my hometown. I arrived on the inaugural flight to Ayodhya and I have been here since then. I will go back only after having a 'darshan' of Ram Lalla,"" he told PTI.
Groups of people could also be seen marching towards the temple, passing through the decked up Ram Path.
""Ram Lalla gave us the strength to walk all the way from Chhattisgarh and now He only will get us through this crowd so we can take His blessings,"" said Sunil Madho, part of an eight-member group that undertook a 'padyatra' to Ayodhya.
Maharashtra native Gopal Krishna, who arrived in Ayodhya a few days ago, also jostled in the thick crowd as it moved towards the security check.
""We came here a few days ago as Lord Ram called us. People were telling us to not travel as police would impose restrictions on travel and rooms would not be available in hotels. We are staying at an ashram and this is the day we waited for,"" he told PTI.
He was accompanied by a few friends with whom he travelled in a four-wheeler to Ayodhya from Akola district.
The gates of the temple, decorated with flowers and lights, turned into selfie spots for the devotees as they gathered to join the queues.
The devotees chanted ""Jai Shri Ram"" as they walked in and out of the temple complex. Inside the main temple, ""Jai Shri Ram"" chants reverberated in its grand halls.
The temple complex, built in the traditional Nagara style, is 380 feet long from the east to the west, 250 feet wide and will eventually rise to 161 feet at the 'shikhar'. It is supported by 392 pillars and has 44 doors.
Lakhs of people watched the 'pran pratishtha (consecration)' ceremony on television in their homes and neighbourhood temples, savouring the historic moment on Monday.
A bevy of artistes performed folk dances, a 'palki yatra' was conducted by a religious troupe from Bhopal and scores of devotees from Ayodhya and other cities chanted ""Jai Shri Ram"" in the streets of the temple town as the ceremony unfolded.

The surprise announcement by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee that caught the Congress off guard came on the back of the growing tussle between the Trinamul Congress(TMC) and the grand old party over sharing of seats to be contested in the key eastern state. It also came just a day ahead of the scheduled entry of the Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra into West Bengal.
""I had given them (Congress) a proposal (on seat sharing) but they refused it at the outset. Our party has now decided to go it alone in Bengal,"" Banerjee told reporters at Dumurjala helipad in Howrah district.
“Now, we have decided that there will be no relations with the Congress in Bengal,"" the chief minister said in remarks that has dented opposition unity efforts. A total of 28 parties have come together to form the INDIA grouping to take on the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections.
According to sources, the TMC had offered only two seats to the Congress based on its 2019 Lok Sabha polls performance. This was not acceptable to the Congress causing strains between the two parties in West Bengal which accounts for 42 parliamentary seats.
A rattled Congress appeared to underplay the rift with the TMC on the seat-sharing issue in West Bengal, asserting that no one can imagine the existence of the INDIA bloc without Mamata Banerjee and that her party is an ""important pillar"" of the opposition alliance.
""We cannot imagine the INDIA bloc without Mamata ji. The INDIA bloc will fight the Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal and all (partners) will participate,"" Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh told a press conference at North Salmara in Assam as part of Rahul Gandhi's ongoing yatra 	 ""Banerjee said that defeating BJP is the priority and prime responsibility of all of us. With this sentiment, our 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' will enter West Bengal tomorrow,"" Ramesh said when asked about the TMC supremo's statement on seat-sharing talks.
The BJP also waded into the TMC-Congress tussle, claiming that Banerjee's decision is a sign of her desperation and it will be a “death knell” for the INDIA bloc.
In Chandigarh, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann said his party will not enter into an alliance with the Congress in the state, reiterating that the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party(AAP) will win all 13 seats at stake.
Denying reports that the TMC and Congress are in talks for seat-sharing, Banerjee asserted that she has not spoken to anyone in the grand old party on the issue.
""Let the Congress fight 300 seats on its own (in the country). The regional parties are together and can contest the rest. However, we will not tolerate any interference by them (Congress) in Bengal,"" she said.
The TMC supremo also stressed that her party would prepare its strategies at the national-level after the elections are over.
""At the national level, we, as part of the INDIA grouping, will decide our strategy after the elections. We will do whatever it takes to defeat BJP,"" she added.
Dwelling on the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra', Banerjee expressed her displeasure over the Congress not informing her about the visit of Rahul Gandhi to West Bengal.
""As a gesture of courtesy, did they (Congress) let me know that they are coming to Bengal for the Yatra? I am not aware of it,"" she said.
West Bengal's Congress state president Adhir Chowdhury, a vocal TMC critic, has maintained that it wouldn't ""beg"" for seats from Bengal’s ruling party.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal, TMC bagged 22 seats and the Congress won two while the BJP got 18 seats.
The TMC had recently skipped the recent INDIA bloc virtual meeting and highlighted the necessity for the Congress to recognise its limitations in Bengal, and allow the regional party to spearhead the state's political battle.
Mann's reiteration of AAP's stance in Punjab comes at a time when the party and the Congress are in the midst of seat sharing talks in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Goa and Gujarat.
However, the AAP has entered into an alliance with the Congress for the Chandigarh mayoral poll.
Replying to a question by reporters after a Cabinet meeting on his party's alliance with the Congress, Mann said he has said many times that ""Punjab will become a hero in the country and the AAP will win 13-0 in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls"". Punjab accounts for 13 Lok Sabha seats.
Asked if it was clear that the AAP will not have an electoral alliance with the Congress, Mann said, ""We are not going with them (Congress)."" 	 In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Congress won eight seats, Shiromani Akali Dal(SAD) and its erstwhile ally BJP two each and the AAP one.
Mann and several AAP leaders have made known their opposition to any truck with the Congress for the Lok Sabha polls.
IT department head Amit Malviya, BJP co-incharge for West Bengal, said Banerjee’s decision to fight alone in West Bengal is a sign of desperation.
""Unable to hold her political ground, she wants to fight all seats in the hope that she can still be relevant after the polls,” he said in a post on X.
In New Delhi, TMC sources claimed the Congress delayed the seat-sharing talks and made unreasonable demands without acknowledging the ground reality.
The TMC is open to ""courtesy back-channel"" talks but there is hardly any hope left for reaching a pact, they said.
Maintaining that the TMC had offered two Lok Sabha seats to the Congress, a senior party leader said it is open to discussing a third seat, provided it agrees to give the TMC some seats in Meghalaya and Assam.
The NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) said Banerjee's announcement could be part of a ""strategy"" and maintained that the INDIA bloc stands united against the BJP.
Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray was of the view that Banerjee was ""fighting like a tigress"", and her fight was important for her state."

The application for divorce is pending at the counselling stage and efforts are on for an amicable solution between the woman and her husband, Family Court marriage counsellor Shail Awasthi told PTI on Thursday.
“They got married on May 3 last year. The woman insisted on going on a honeymoon abroad as they are earning well. The husband is an IT professional, while the woman works in a private company,” Awasthi said.
“The husband was reluctant to go abroad for honeymoon and later settled for Goa or somewhere in south India as possible destinations claiming he also had to look after his parents,” the official added.
The man booked flight tickets to Ayodhya and Varanasi without informing his wife and told her about the trip just a day before departure, Awasthi said.
“He told his wife his mother wanted to visit Ayodhya before the idol consecration of the Ram Temple. The woman did not object at the time but had an argument over it once the family returned and later filed for divorce. The woman in her statement has claimed the man took greater care of his parents than her,” the official said, quoting the divorce application.
The couple is being counselled but it may take time for the matter to be resolved, Awasthi added.

South Africa, which brought the case, had asked for the court to order Israel to halt its operation.
The top UN Court court decided not to throw out genocide charges against Israel for its military offensive in Gaza, as part of a preliminary decision in a case that goes to the core of one of the world's most intractable conflicts.
In the highly anticipated decision made by a panel of 17 judges, the International Court of Justice decided not to throw out the case. The reading of the ruling is ongoing.
""The court is acutely aware of the extent of the human tragedy that is unfolding in the region and is deeply concerned about the continuing loss of life and human suffering,” Joan E. Donoghue, the court's president, said.
Friday's decision is only an interim one; it could take years for the full case brought by South Africa to be considered. Israel rejects the genocide accusation and had asked the court to throw the charges out.
While the case winds its way through the court, South Africa has asked the judges “as a matter of extreme urgency” to impose so-called provisional measures to protect Palestinians in Gaza — and the court could order those on Friday.
Top of the South African list is a request for the court to order Israel to “immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza.” It is also asking for Israel to take “reasonable measures” to prevent genocide and allow access for desperately needed aid.
In a statement Thursday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said he hoped the decision would “include immediate action to stop the aggression and genocide against our people in the Gaza Strip ... and a rapid flow of relief aid to save the hungry, wounded and sick from the threat of slow death that threatens them.""
On Thursday, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy had said that Israel expected the court to toss out the “spurious and specious charges.”
Israel often boycotts international tribunals and UN investigations, saying they are unfair and biased. But this time, it took the rare step of sending a high-level legal team — a sign of how seriously it regards the case and likely the fear that any court order to halt operations would be a major blow to the country's international standing.
An Israeli official said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu huddled with top legal, diplomatic and security officials on Thursday in anticipation of the ruling. He said Israel is confident in its case but discussed “all scenarios.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing confidential meetings.
Israel launched its massive air and ground assault on Gaza after Hamas militants stormed through Israeli communities on October 7 killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducting another 250.
The offensive has decimated vast swaths of the territory and driven nearly 85% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.
More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed, the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run enclave said on Friday. The ministry does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its death toll, but has said about two-thirds of those killed were women and children.
The Israeli military claims at least 9,000 of those killed in the nearly four-month conflict are Hamas militants.
UN officials have expressed fears that even more people could die from disease, with at least one-quarter of the population facing starvation.
Ahead of the ruling, Marieke de Hoon, an associate professor of international law at the University of Amsterdam, said she thought the court was unlikely to throw the case out since the legal bar South Africa has to clear at this early stage is lower than the one that would be applied for ruling on the merits of the accusation.
“The standard ... is not, has there been genocide? But a lower standard,"" she said. “Is it plausible that there could have been a risk of genocide that would invoke Israel's responsibility to prevent genocide?”
But De Hoon also did not expect the world court to order an end to Israel's military operation.
“I think that they will shy away from actually calling for a full cease-fire, because I think they will find that beyond their abilities right now,” she said in a telephone interview.
Provisional measures by the world court are legally binding, but it is not clear if Israel would comply with any order.
Top Hamas official Osama Hamdan, meanwhile, said his group would abide by a cease-fire if ordered and would be ready to release the hostages it is holding if Israel releases Palestinian prisoners.
How the US, Israel's top ally, responds to any order will be key, since it wields veto power at the UN Security Council and thus could block measures there aimed at forcing Israel's compliance.
The US has said Israel has the right to defend itself, but also spoken about the need for the country to protect civilians in Gaza and allow more aid in.
The genocide case strikes at the national identity of Israel, which was founded as a Jewish state after the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II.
South Africa's own identity is key to it bringing the case. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel's policies in Gaza and the West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Black people to “homelands” before ending in 1994."

“Officials from Bengal who were present in the meeting faced questions on why the state did not follow central guidelines on the names and the logos of schemes which were being implemented in Bengal. The officials also faced questions over financial irregularities that allegedly took place under the schemes,” said a source aware of the meeting's deliberations.
A senior state government official said they had presented facts and figures that established that Bengal had initiated steps to rectify the problems whenever central teams had pointed them out.
“We made it clear that we had submitted action-taken reports whenever the Centre had pointed out any discrepancy…. The action-taken reports have been verified by the central teams and no further question was raised. We are hopeful that we can get due funds at the earliest,” said a senior state government official.
The meeting was held after the chief minister led a delegation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 19, demanding the immediate release of funds under several schemes, including one for 100 days of jobs.
“It was decided during the talks between the Prime Minister and the chief minister that a meeting would be held between the officials of the central and state governments. The meeting was held today (Tuesday), more than a month after the chief minister had met the Prime Minister,” said a source.
In the meeting held on Tuesday, secretaries of finance, panchayat, health, education, public works and food and supplies departments represented the state government. On behalf of the Centre, officials in the prime minister’s office and the ministry of rural development attended the meeting.
“It is not very comfortable for the state as the Centre is asking questions on the non-compliance with the rules related to the names and the logos of the central schemes. It is a political decision whether to use the names and the logos of the central schemes in the state. But after the Centre had raised questions earlier, we tried to use the names and the logos of the central schemes,” said a state government official.
Sources said although the state had tried to use the logos and the names of central schemes like the PMGSY (rural roads) and PMAY (housing for rural poor), it was yet to use the name and the logo of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) on ration shops."

Banerjee, who was seated in front beside the driver, was injured after her head hit the dashboard, he said.
The accident took place when the CM was returning to Kolkata from an administrative review meeting in Purba Bardhaman.
Later in the evening, she went to the Raj Bhavan to meet Governor C V Ananda Bose.
""All of a sudden, a car came in front of us at high speed. By God's grace, I was saved as my driver was alert. I am not feeling well as I am having pain and swelling. I have taken some medicines,"" Banerjee said.    	""At times, people misuse vehicles; as was the case when a person pretending to be a BSF jawan was caught outside my residence. The police is looking into today’s incident. I won't comment on it further,"" she added.
Banerjee had in June last year suffered a knee injury, while alighting from a helicopter in Sevoke in north Bengal. The chief minister had suffered another ligament injury on her left knee in September, and had to undergo a microsurgery.
In the run-up to the 2021 assembly polls, she had fractured a leg and moved on a wheelchair to campaign for the election.
Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh, who is presently in Assam for Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, wished her a speedy recovery.
“We have just heard of the injury suffered by Mamata Banerjee ji in a car accident. We wish her a full and speedy recovery. The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is looking forward to entering West Bengal tomorrow late morning. January 26 and 27th being break days, the Yatra will resume on the 28th,” he posted on X.
Ramesh’s message for Banerjee came amid a surprise announcement by the CM earlier in the day to go alone in the state in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
Banerjee’s remarks caught the grand old party off guard, prompting it to state that “no one can imagine the existence of the opposition INDIA bloc without the TMC supremo"".

Mudur New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 07:27 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/indias-cheetah-introduction-project-gets-third-litter-three-cubs-born-in-kuno-national-park/cid/1995958,"India’s cheetah introduction project has registered its third litter, three cubs born to a Namibian cheetah in the Kuno National Park, Madhya Pradesh, but most of the project’s cheetahs remain behind fenced enclosures, not in the wild as the project had envisaged.
The Union minister for environment and forests, Bhupender Yadav, announced on Tuesday that the Namibian cheetah named Jwala has given birth to three cubs. The new litter follows just weeks after another Namibian cheetah named Aasha had given birth to three cubs.
“Congratulations to all wildlife frontline warriors and wildlife lovers across the country,” Yadav posted on X on Tuesday. Yadav had on January 3 described the arrival of Aasha’s cubs as a “roaring success” for project cheetah, a long-term conservation project aimed at introducing clusters of cheetah populations in India’s wilderness.
The environment ministry had brought into Kuno eight cheetahs from Namibia in September 2022 and 12 cheetahs from South Africa in February 2023. They were to be released into the unfenced area of the park after weeks to months of quarantine and observations within fenced enclosures.
But seven adult cheetahs and three of four cubs born in captivity in Kuno in March 2023 have died from various determined and undetermined causes since March 27 last year. Project authorities had attributed the cub deaths in May 2023 to heat and dehydration.
Wildlife officials and other experts have often asserted over the past several months that the cheetahs’ deaths, while unfortunate, should not be viewed as setbacks to the project’s long-term goals which is to establish self-sustaining cheetah populations in the wild.
But sections of wildlife biologists who have criticised the project for not anticipating the large spaces that cheetahs require but are unavailable in Kuno have questioned the long periods of the cheetahs’ captivity in fenced areas within Kuno.
A query sent by this newspaper on Tuesday to two officials associated with the project and an official in the environment ministry asking how many cheetahs are in the open wild and how many in fenced areas has not evoked a reply.
A wildlife biologist not associated with the project said the time spent by the adult cheetahs behind fenced enclosures in Kuno exceeds what is prescribed for the rehabilitation of large carnivores under Namibian regulations.
The Namibian regulations require an adult large carnivore, after being captured from the wild, to be held in a rehabilitation facility “for a maximum period of three months”. However, the rules allow an extended stay if required for veterinary reasons.
“The Namibian regulations won’t apply in India for jurisdictional reasons, but the logic underlying early release into the wild remains valid,” said Ravi Chellam, a large cat specialist and coordinator of the Biodiversity Collaborative, a network of conservation researchers.
“Prolonged captivity and frequent handling, including repeated tranquilisation, affects behaviour and instincts and can impact the overall well-being of wild cats,” Chellam said. “This reduces their fitness to thrive in the wild.”"

The Ministry of Home Affairs has identified around 1,700 km of fencing that needs to be done, BRO’s Additional Director General (East) PKH Singh said.
The organisation has already finished fencing 10 km along the border in Manipur’s Moreh, which was handed over to the Assam Rifles, Singh told PTI in an interview.
Union Home Minister Amit Shah recently said the Centre has decided that the India-Myanmar border will be protected by barbed fencing like the India-Bangladesh border, and the government was rethinking the free movement agreement with Myanmar.
Four Indian states – Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram – share a 1,643-km border with Myanmar.
Singh said the next 80-km stretch in Manipur has also been identified and the detailed project report (DPR) submitted to the ministry.
Fencing the remaining 250 km, along with its approach roads, is in the planning stage with the DPR under preparation.
“The fencing of the India-Myanmar border is an important project for the BRO, which is now coming up in Moreh. The area around this border has been unfenced since long, and there was a need to check the activities around it,” the ADG said.
Singh said the BRO has a long-term roll-out plan of nearly Rs 30,000 crore in the northeast over the next five years, and out of this, almost two-thirds is focused in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.
The organisation was earlier involved in fencing the India-Bangladesh border along with the BSF, he said.

K4QV8MJJN5_HGP9KKT3TNAX0LP,Congress leader Rahul Gandhi welcomes Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur,"PTI New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 01:31 PM","PTI New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 01:31 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/congress-leader-rahul-gandhi-welcomes-bharat-ratna-to-karpoori-thakur/cid/1995859,"A caste census will be a true tribute to Karpoori Thakur as the country now needs ""real justice"" and not ""politics of symbolism"", Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Wednesday, even as he welcomed the decision to confer Bharat Ratna on the socialist leader.
Two-time Bihar chief minister Thakur has been named for the country's highest civilian award Bharat Ratna posthumously.
""I pay respectful tribute to Jannayak Karpoori Thakur ji, an incomparable warrior of social justice, on his birth centenary. He is certainly a precious gem of India and the decision to award him Bharat Ratna posthumously is welcome,"" Gandhi said in a post in Hindi on X.
The former Congress chief alleged that the BJP government's ""concealment"" of the results of the social and economic caste census conducted in 2011 and their ""indifference"" towards a nationwide census is an attempt to weaken the movement for social justice.
""'Justice of equal participation', one of the five justices of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, is at the centre of justice and social equality, which can begin only after the caste census,"" Gandhi said.
""In the true sense, this step will also be a true tribute to Jannayak Karpoori Thakur ji and his struggles for the rights of the backward and the deprived,"" he said.
""The country now needs 'real justice' not 'politics of symbolism',"" Gandhi asserted.
Thakur, who was born on this day in 1924 and passed away in 1988, was the first non-Congress socialist leader who became chief minister twice -- first for seven months in December 1970 and later for two years in 1977.
Thakur, known affectionately as 'Jan Nayak' (people's leader), is the 49th recipient of the country's highest civilian award. The award was last conferred on late president Pranab Mukherjee in 2019.
Born on January 24, 1924 in Nai samaj (barber society), Thakur is credited in Bihar politics for enforcing total prohibition of alcohol in 1970. The village where he was born in Samistupur district was renamed after him as Karpuri Gram.
He was inspired by heavyweights like Ram Manohar Lohia who spearheaded the socialist movement in post-Independent India. He was also close to Jayaprakash Narayan.

The high court bench, headed by acting Chief Justice Manmohan, was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by the civil rights group Social Jurist.
The petitioner alleged that children enrolled in Classes I to VIII in schools of the Delhi government and the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) had to forgo allowances because they did not have bank accounts to which the amount could be transferred.
The PIL was based on an audit memo of November 2023 by the chief auditor of the MCD that found that these students didn’t receive the benefits between 2016-17 and 2022-23.
“The high court issued notices to the parties to file counter-affidavits within four weeks,” said Ashok Agrawal, an advocate and activist associated with Social Jurist.
“These children have been denied uniforms, school bags, notebooks, scholarships and stationery, which are provided to them every year. Neither the schools nor any authority ever thought of opening their bank accounts. We have pleaded that they should be paid the dues for all these years and a system should be enforced to ensure smooth and timely payment of allowances to all eligible students,” Agrawal said.
According to the audit memo, cash subsidy is provided to the students only through bank accounts to avoid malpractice and misappropriation of funds. The school authorities are supposed to help the students open the accounts. A total of 2,69,488 students in schools run by the Delhi government and 3,83,203 students of MCD schools were deprived of the statutory benefits.
Professor C.B. Sharma, former chairman of the National Institute of Open Schooling, attributed the lackadaisical attitude of the Delhi government to the little scope for pilferage in the transfer of allowance.
“There is no reason for not opening the bank accounts of children. If the officials and schools were given the charge to deal with payment of cash, they might have shown eagerness,” he said.
Sharma said the government is supposed to monitor the implementation of the transfer of allowance as it is a key component of the Right To Education (RTE) Act.
“The central government had adopted direct benefit transfer to beneficiary accounts to check pilferage, but the administration seems to be not so keen to implement it,” he said.
An email was sent to Ashok Kumar, the secretary of education of the Delhi government, to understand his perspective on the alleged denial of the benefits. His response is awaited."

In a recent message to all the district police heads, the home department instructed that spots where giant screens will be set up — for live telecast of the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya — must have adequate police presence and there should be special watch on areas with mixed population.
The superintendents of police have been told to assess intelligence feedback about certain congregations and rallies under their respective jurisdiction and ensure that even the smallest of incidents are immediately attended to by the local police, sources said.
""Events involving pujas to mark the occasion and the distribution of bhog at the end of the rituals must have adequate police presence so that there is no flaring up of emotions at the slightest instigation,"" said a senior official in the home department. ""The subdivisional police officers will maintain constant liaison with police stations under their jurisdiction and make necessary arrangements for police deployment.""
The BJP decided to set up LED screens in several parts of the state to telecast live the inauguration of the Ram temple by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
""A preliminary mapping of the trouble-prone and sensitive areas has been completed in each district.... The deployments will start from early morning on Monday,"" said a senior officer in charge of a zone.
Against the backdrop of last year's violence on the occasion of Ram Navami processions in Howrah and Hooghly and the violence at Basirhat in North 24-Parganas a few years back, the police superintendents of all districts were told to remain alert.
""Tact is the word. Since a situation can't be predicted, senior police officers have been asked to use their skills and experience in handling a situation that might tend to flare up,"" the officer said.
Several police superintendents said the thrust was on the use of lathis and tear gas shells to disperse mobs in case of violence. But to avert that, the focus will be on intense patrolling.
""Separate teams of motorcycle mobile and RT mobile vans will be doing their rounds across subdivisions and blocks. Even senior officers will be on their mobile rounds throughout the day,"" said Avijit Banerjee, superintendent of police, Purulia, the south Bengal district which had erupted a week back following the alleged assault on three Ganga Sagar-bound sadhus.
The police superintendents were also asked to ensure that the timings and the routes of rallies for interfaith harmony, one of which chief minister Mamata Banerjee would lead in Calcutta, didn't clash with those of other processions.
""No procession should be allowed to move without adequate police coverage,"" the home department official said."

According to Alexei Kulemzin, the city’s Russian-installed mayor, Ukrainian forces bombarded a busy area where shops and a market are located. Pushilin said the city was shelled by Ukrainian artillery. There was no immediate Ukrainian comment.
Reuters photos and video taken at the scene showed crying people, some of whom said they had lost their relatives, and bodies lying on blood-soaked snow near one of the city’s markets.
Pushilin said emergency services were working at the scene and that forensic specialists were trying to collect fragments of the weapons used in the attack.
In Moscow, the Russian foreign ministry issued a statement calling the attack “a barbaric act of terrorism” committed by Ukraine, saying it was carried out “with the use of weapons supplied by the West”.
“The Russian side categorically condemns this treacherous strike against the civilian population,” the ministry said.
Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago, has voiced outrage in the past when Ukrainian attacks have killed civilians in Donetsk and other areas.
Russia’s own campaign of air strikes and heavy shelling, however, has killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians.
Donetsk is one of four regions in Ukraine’s east and south that Russia claimed to have annexed in late 2022 in a move condemned as illegal by most countries at the UN General Assembly. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.
Separately on Sunday, Russia’s defence ministry said Russian forces had taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region.
A Ukrainian military spokesman confirmed that Kyiv’s forces had withdrawn from the area, but said the lost territory was of no consequence for the overall military situation."

The missile dubbed ""Pulhwasal-3-31"" is currently under development and the test-firing had no impact on the security of neighbouring countries, the state media said, adding it had ""nothing"" to do with the regional situation.
The test was also part of the process of updating the country's weapon system, the report said, citing The Missile Administration.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it believed the firing was to test upgrades of existing missiles' capabilities.
On Wednesday, the South Korean military said the North had fired multiple cruise missiles towards the sea off its west coast at around 7 a.m. (2200 GMT on Tuesday) while Seoul's defence minister, Shin Won-sik, condemned the launches as a serious threat to his country.
""Strategic"" typically refers to nuclear-capable weapons.
North Korea carried out its first test of a cruise missile with possible nuclear strike capabilities in September 2021.
On Thursday, South Korea said it was starting mass production of medium-altitude reconnaissance drones with the goal of deploying them in 2027 to improve surveillance capabilities and contribute to defence exports.
North Korea's cruise missiles usually generate less interest than ballistic missiles because they are not explicitly banned by any U.N. Nations Security Council resolutions.
But analysts have said intermediate-range, land-attack cruise missiles were no less a threat than ballistic missiles and are a serious capability for North Korea.
Cruise missiles and short-range ballistic missiles that can be armed with either conventional or nuclear bombs are seen as particularly destabilising in the event of conflict as it can be unclear which kind of warhead they are carrying."

Jarange said two official delegations met him earlier in the day, but they had nothing new to offer. They were deliberating on the “same old points”, he said.
The activist, who set out on a march towards Mumbai from Jalna district on January 20 with thousands of supporters, is demanding that the state government grant quota to Marathas under the OBC grouping in jobs and education.
Jarange said he has been informed that a larger delegation would be coming to meet him. If that happens, the activist said, they will meet the delegation midway.
“We have not come here for fun. On behalf of the Maratha community, I appeal to CM Ekanth Shinde and deputy CMs Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar to come together for discussion and find a solution to the issue,” he said.
Asked if they have been granted permission by the Mumbai police to agitate at Azad Maidan in the city, Jarange said a stage is being erected there.
Earlier, addressing his supporters at Lonavala, Jarange asked them to keep calm and not get provoked, insisting that theirs is a peaceful protest.
He said two teams of officials, including one led by Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Divisional Commissioner Madhukar Ardad, met him earlier, but they had no new proposal.
Jarange has announced the launch of an indefinite hunger strike in Mumbai from January 26 if the state government fails to grant the reservation to Marathas in government jobs and education.
He claimed on Wednesday that 54 lakh records have been found in Maharashtra so far identifying members of the Maratha community as Kunbi (OBC sub-caste) and demanded immediate issuance of caste certificates.
Kunbis enjoy reservation in government jobs and admissions to educational institutes under the OBC category.
CM Shinde on Wednesday had appealed to members of the Maratha community not to stage protests saying the government was thinking positively about their quota demand.
Speaking about an ongoing survey by the state Commission for Backward Classes to assess the social, economic and educational backwardness of the Maratha community, Shinde said 1.5 lakh people were working in three shifts.
The CM had last month said that a special session of the state legislature would be held in February 2024, if necessary, to provide reservation to the Maratha community.

The cap is expected to result in approximately 360,000 approved study permits in 2024, a decrease of 35% from 2023, according to a statement from the immigration ministry.
Immigration Minister Marc Miller said the federal government would work with the provinces, which oversee the educational system, to apply the cap.
He said the main reason for the cap is to protect students who attend colleges, which are often private-public partnerships, that provide inadequate services at high costs, but also to ease pressure on housing and services.
""Some private institutions have taken advantage of international students by operating under-resourced campuses, lacking supports for students and charging high tuition fees, all the while significantly increasing their intake of international students,"" Miller told reporters.
""This increase is also putting pressure on housing, healthcare and other services,"" he said, adding that fewer numbers would primarily help lower prices for rent.
Rapid population growth fueled by immigration has put pressure on services, like healthcare and education, and has helped drive up housing costs. These issues have weighed on Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's support, with polls showing he would lose an election if one were held now.
In the third quarter of last year, the population grew at its fastest pace in more than six decades, with non-permanent residents - mostly students - increasing by 312,758, the most in more than five decades.
The Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (CASA), a student advocacy group, criticized the cap.
""The biggest problem is that ... there's been announced a cap that is a reaction to the housing crisis,"" said CASA Director of Advocacy, Mateusz Salmassi, adding that what is needed is more support and housing for international students.
The University of Toronto welcomed the announcement and said it would work with all levels of government on the allocation of study permits.
The changes are ""focused on addressing abuses in the system by particular actors and are not intended to adversely impact universities such as ours,"" the university said in a statement."
KO37TY7TWH_CNXGGDQXHMIJYA9,It’s PM Modi all Ayodhya waits upon: Town gears up for Ram temple consecration,"Piyush Srivastava Ayodhya Published 22.01.24, 05:55 AM","Piyush Srivastava Ayodhya Published 22.01.24, 05:55 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/its-pm-modi-all-ayodhya-waits-upon-town-gears-up-for-ram-temple-consecration/cid/1995338,"Juhu Sarkar, a 35-year-old commercial artist from Calcutta, is engrossed in painting Hanuman on a canvas at the camp of Rambhadracharya, a sadhu.
The monk, who narrates the story of Ram’s life to congregations of devotees every evening, cannot see what she is painting since he’s visually impaired.
But his trust, Shri Tulsi Peeth Seva Nyas, has hired Sarkar and 19 other painters from across the country to capture Ram’s life, and that of Rambhadracharya himself, on canvas.
“I learnt painting in Calcutta, my hometown, but I recently shifted to Delhi. A relative is associated with Rambhadracharya’s trust; he suggested I attend the workshop from January 14 to 22,” Sarkar told The Telegraph, paintbrush working furiously.
She said the trust was taking care of the painters’ travel, stay and meals, but was evasive when asked how much she was being paid. “It’s mostly out of my religiosity that I am here,” she said.
Somnath Bothe, 40, a painter from Pune hired for the same job, hinted at a smooth co-existence between business and temple-fuelled religiosity.
“Most of us have been assigned to make paintings based on the Valmiki Ramayana. These paintings will be the property of Rambhadracharya’s trust, which may hold an exhibition somewhere and put them on sale,” he said.
He added: “We shall leave Ayodhya after the Prime Minister inaugurates the temple on January 22.”
Not just Sarkar and Bothe, all the bustle, glitter and pomp that is now Ayodhya will be gone within hours of Narendra Modi leaving the town at 3pm on Monday after the Ram temple consecration.
For now, the town is decked out in its finery and wrapped in ecstasy as it waits to welcome the Prime Minister, expected to arrive at 10.25am on Monday.
“The state’s department of culture has hired 100 troupes — 2,500 folk artistes in all — to sing and dance while the Prime Minister is here,” a state government source said.
“Modi may take a chopper from the Maharshi Valmiki Airport and land at the helipad at Saker College, close to the temple, at 10.45am. Or he may decide to travel by road. Whether he travels by car or helicopter, he can see the cultural presentations.”
The itinerary released by the local administration has Modi taking a chopper. From the helipad he will be driven to the Ram temple, arriving at 10.55am. His schedule has been kept free between 11am and noon, and there’s a possibility he might take a dip in the Saryu.
Modi will participate in the Pran Pratistha rituals from 12.05pm to 12.55pm and then address the gathering of over 8,000 VIP guests between 1pm and 2pm. He is scheduled to leave Ayodhya at 3pm.
“We will start preparing to return home soon after Modi leaves,” said Sugam Singh, 30, a Vantangiya tribal dancer from Gorakhpur.
Geet Sharma, 25, a peacock dancer from Mathura, said: “The department of culture has hired our troupe to perform, on a roadside platform, till 5pm on Monday.”
Huge decorative pillars of fibreglass have been installed on both sides of a stretch of the national highway as it approaches Ayodhya, and on the banks of the Saryu.
The administration has decorated all the houses near the temple with fairy lights. Labourers were hired to decorate the façades of the houses with flowers. They will all be gone after Monday.
“We have rented these fibre pillars and lights; they will be removed after the Prime Minister’s programme. The flowers will dry up on their own,” an official of the state information department said.
“This razzmatazz we have been seeing in Ayodhya for the past few days cannot be expected to be there every day. Our goal is to make this event remembered for centuries.”
Asked whether the ambience did not reflect a momentary carnival spirit more than religious devotion, Rambhadracharya said: “Modi is a historic personality and he deserves to be welcomed for giving the Ram temple to Ayodhya.”
Reminded that it was the Supreme Court that in 2019 handed the site over to Hindus to build the temple, he said: “We all contributed to convincing the Supreme Court to give us the disputed land in Ayodhya.”
He claimed: “I had furnished 441 pieces of evidence that there was a temple at the site before Babar raised the Babri Masjid at the birthplace of Ram.... I am now planning to bring back the Gyanvapi Mosque in Kashi and the Shahi Idgah Masjid in Mathura for the Hindus. Modi will obviously play a decisive role in that too. His welcome here should be historic so that he speeds up Kashi and Mathura.”
Some Sangh Parivar supporters have moved court saying the Gyanvapi and the Shahi Idgah were built after destroying portions of the Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi and Krishna Janmasthan Mandir in Mathura, and the sites should be given back to Hindus.
Lamp fiasco
A diya (lamp) projected as the world’s biggest ever caught fire around 2pm, about four hours after it had been lit on an open ground near the Tapasvi Ki Chawani Ashram.
Paramhans Das, a self-styled sadhu known to be happy to seek the limelight, said he had got the lamp, 300 feet in diameter, made with 1,008 tonnes of loam. “About 21,000 litres of oil was poured into it just for tonight. About 1.25 quintals of cotton were used for the wick. I spent over Rs 7 crore in all,” Das had told reporters on Saturday night.
“Some 108 teams of workers took one year to make this diya. We used oil brought from Mithila, Sita’s birthplace. We are trying to recreate the celebratory scenes Ayodhya witnessed when Ram returned victorious.”
Eyewitnesses said a canopy erected above the lamp to protect it from rain and dew had caught fire as the flames rose. The fire then spread to nearby trees.
With open ground all around, they said, the flames died down by themselves. But parts of the diya have got burnt or developed cracks.
Das said he had asked labourers to repair the lamp so it could be lit again in the night.
Mahant Rajkumar Das, another sadhu who lives at Tapasvi Ki Chawani, said: “Paramhans has grabbed a portion of the ashram and is using the lamp as a gimmick to grab it entirely in the name of celebrating the temple inauguration.”"

Among others, the prepared text accused the Union government of denying the state’s legitimate share of tax revenues, exacerbating its fiscal situation.
While the state government reacted cautiously, the Opposition accused the governor of insulting the Assembly.
Khan, who entered the Assembly at 9am, began his address two minutes later and completed it in 1 minute and 17 seconds. He read out only the first and last of the 136 paragraphs in the 61-page text.
After reading the first paragraph, the governor said: “And now I am reading the last para.”
The last sentence of the last paragraph read: “Together as part of this varied and beautiful nation we will weave the tapestry of inclusive growth and responsible resilience, overcoming all the challenges that are thrown our way.”
He swiftly left the House following the national anthem, as dazed government and Opposition benches watched the drama.
Sources said the governor’s act had no precedent in Kerala history.
Governors are meant to deliver the policy address at the start of the budget session of the Assembly every year. Khan had in his policy address of 2020 read out remarks against the central government’s CAA despite being already engaged in a running battle with the Left government.
Kerala law minister P. Rajeev was circumspect, underlining that the governor had, technically, “accepted” the policy address. “It’s as good as reading out the whole policy address. And the last para contains the essence of the statement,” he told reporters.
But leader of the Opposition and Congress member V.D. Satheesan told a news conference: “It is a gross humiliation of the Assembly procedures and principles of the Constitution…. We register our strong protest against the governor insulting the Assembly.”
Deputy leader of the Opposition P.K. Kunhalikutty, an Indian Union Muslim League member, too attacked the governor.
“He walked in and left like a rocket. There is a tradition of greeting us (Opposition benches). We were waiting to greet him. But he just walked away. So, today, he converted the Assembly session into a mere mockery. This is an insult to the Assembly.”
The skipped portions of Thursday’s policy address included references to the “liquidity stress stemming from the vertical imbalance between the Union and the states in fiscal matters”.
“Kerala witnessed a decline in its share of taxes devolved by the Union government from 3.88 per cent during the 10th Finance Commission period (1995-2000) to a mere 1.92 per cent during the 15th Finance Commission period (2021-2026),” the text said.
“In 2023-24, the discontinuation of GST compensation, a reduction in revenue deficit grant, and restrictions imposed on off-budget borrowings of the state by the Union exacerbated the fiscal condition of the state.”"

Expressing his disappointment, Gandhi criticised the decision, questioning the interference in his visit during such a significant religious occasion. The temple, located at the birthplace of Assamese icon Srimanta Sankardeva, has become the center of controversy as authorities cited the Ram temple consecration as the reason for denying early access to the Congress leader.
Gandhi, along with other Congress leaders, was stopped at Haiboragaon today, and not allowed to proceed further. The former Congress chief was scheduled to pay obeisance to the local deity before starting his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on Monday.
Mahila Congress leaders subsequently sat on a dharna to protest against denial of permission to Gandhi to visit the temple. The former Congress chief also joined the dharna.
Authorities said Gandhi will be allowed permission to visit the temple only at 3 PM.
Gandhi questioned the police on why he was being stopped from visiting the temple.
""Will PM Modi now decide who will visit a temple and when,"" Gandhi said.
The Batadrawa Than is located at the birthplace of Assamese icon Srimanta Sankardeva, a social-religious reformer of the 15th-16th century.
In a letter to Batadrawa's Congress MLA Shibamoni Bora on Sunday afternoon, the managing committee's president Jogendra Nath Dev Mahanta said that on the occasion of the Ram temple's consecration, several organisations have planned devotional programmes at the premises of the Than.
""Several thousands of people are expected to visit the place and as such we cannot allow Gandhi to enter the premises before 3 pm,"" he said.
""We had received a letter from Bora regarding the Congress MP's visit and we extend a warm welcome to him but we cannot allow him to enter the premises before 3 pm,"" he said.
The decision was taken at a meeting of the committee, he added.
Earlier, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had also said that Gandhi should avoid visiting Batadrawa on January 22 as there can be no competition between Lord Ram and the medieval-age Vaishnav saint.
Reacting to Sarma's statement, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had said that Gandhi would visit the Than as planned, maintaining that no politics should be done over it."

The Trinamul Congress (TMC) is open to ""courtesy back-channel"" talks but there is hardly any hope left for reaching a pact, they said.
Maintaining that TMC had offered two Lok Sabha seats to the Congress in West Bengal, a senior party leader said it is open to discussing a third seat, provided Congress agrees to give the TMC seats in Meghalaya and Assam.
The TMC leader accused the Congress of causing ""unreasonable delay"" in seat-sharing discussions, saying no communication has happened in the last two weeks.
The leader also alleged that the Congress was making unreasonable demands in terms of the number of seats without acknowledging the ground reality of Bengal.
The TMC had suggested a formula for deciding seat sharing based on the results of previous elections, and the offer the party made to Congress was based on that criteria.
Much damage was also done due to the statements made by Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who had recently called the West Bengal chief minister an 'opportunist' and also said that the Congress would fight the polls on its own, the sources said.
While the TMC has not announced exiting the INDIA grouping, the leader added that there is very little chance of seat sharing in the state with the Congress.
The TMC is also skipping the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra of the Congress, even as the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is likely to attend it.
A TMC source claimed that they were not invited by Congress to attend the Yatra.
The INDIA bloc received twin setbacks on Wednesday with chief ministers Mamata Banerjee and Bhagwant Mann ruling out an alliance with the Congress in their respective states of West Bengal and Punjab for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
“I had given them (Congress) a proposal (on seat sharing) but they refused it at the outset. Our party has now decided to go alone in Bengal,” Banerjee said amid the seat-sharing tussle between the Congress and the TMC.
The CM also asserted that she has not spoken to anyone in the Congress on the seat-sharing issue.

Speaking to reporters in Siliguri, Chowdhury said the schedule of the Yatra was submitted to the administration in the state long back.
""In some places, we are facing roadblocks as we are not getting permission to organise public meetings, citing exams. The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra has faced problems in the Northeast, including Assam, and now it is facing problems in TMC-ruled West Bengal as well,"" he said.
""We were denied permission to hold a public meeting in Siliguri. We expected better cooperation from the state government. Anyways, the route and the itinerary of the Yatra remain the same except for a few changes,"" he added.
Asserting that the Rahul Gandhi-led Yatra was a movement to safeguard Constitution, Chowdhury claimed that it had nothing to do with the Lok Sabha elections.
Speaking of the issue on Thursday night, he had said that they thought they would get ""relaxations"" in some places in West Bengal for the public meetings but the administration ""is saying that they can't give it"".
The Yatra, which began in Manipur on January 14, entered West Bengal from Assam on Thursday, and took a two-day break. It will resume on January 28.
The ruling Trinamool Congress, however, claimed that the administration in West Bengal is free of political influences.
""Adhir Chowdhury is responsible for the INDIA alliance falling apart in West Bengal. Secondly, all opposition parties conduct programmes in the state, nobody faces any problems. The administration must have taken the decision as there are board examinations in schools,"" TMC MP Santanu Sen said.
Taking a dig, the BJP said that Congress was getting a taste of ""authoritarianism"" from its ally.
""Does the TMC own West Bengal that they will decide who will get permission to hold a rally? Now, the Congress, which complains against the BJP, is getting a taste of authoritarianism from its own ally TMC,"" BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said.

Calcutta chains, is in an advanced stage of discussion to acquire a restaurant chain focused on oriental cuisine.
The company, promoted by Anjan Chatterjee, has earmarked Rs 125 crore for the acquisitions. If the deals are struck, this would be the first inorganic move by the company in its journey over the last quarter of a century.
Speciality, which has 125 units under eight brands as of December 31, has signed a term sheet with at least one of the potential targets which operates about eight restaurants. “We are looking at a couple of targets. There is a Rs 200 crore cash sitting on the balance sheet. The plan is to deploy it judiciously rather than just earn interest income (from it),” Chatterjee said.
While the company added four new outlets under the Mainland China and Asia Kitchen by Mainland China brands in the last quarter, Chatterjee emphasised that expanding fine dine chains rapidly without compromising quality was not possible and hence the need for acquisitions.
Chatterjee, however, added his group would not look at growing unprofitably. The restaurants under the buy-out wish list are said to be profitable operationally and can be turned profitable at net level following integration after acquisitions. Speciality plans to retain the acquired brand and grow.
Even as Speciality is operating under multiple brands, formats and cuisines, it has chosen to focus mostly on the oriental space with Mainland China and Asian Kitchen brands which cumulatively contributed 41 per cent to the Rs 109.49 crore turnover in Q3FY24. The other significant brand under it is Oh! Calcutta. The company posted a PAT of Rs 14.15 crore.
Banquets
Chatterjee, who was in Calcutta at the inauguration of a banquet at Primarc Square, said Speciality is planning to expand in this space in the East. It has identified locations in Salt Lake, Rajarhat and Central Calcutta for three possible banquet locations.
“We have a lot of brand equity in the city, which can be capitalised on,” Chatterjee said. In a banquet, clients will have the option to choose from multiple cuisines (oriental, Indian and continental) and brands such as Mainland China, Sigree & Global Grill, Oh! Calcutta and Café Mezzuna.
Speciality intends to develop this as a separate business vertical, building on the catering business it had entered before the pandemic. Banquets are big revenue earners and profit centres for hotels in Calcutta, thriving on marriages and conferences.
The banquet at Primarc Square, named Nishtara, has been developed by Primarc Projects, where Speciality and Munna Maharaj will offer their catering services. Chatterjee said he plans to set up at least two restaurants in the property, including a Café Mezzuna on the 10th floor rooftop."

The decision to deploy the Army was taken in a meeting of the cabinet that was chaired by caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar.
The summary for deployment of troops was moved by the Ministry of Interior.
“The federal cabinet approved the deployment of Pakistan Army and Civil Armed Forces troops for the peaceful conduct of general elections on the recommendation of the Interior Ministry,” according to an official statement issued at the end of the cabinet meeting.
“These forces will perform duties at sensitive constituencies and polling stations and will also act as a rapid response force,” the statement further said.
The decision comes after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) sought 277,000 Army personnel to be deployed across the country to maintain security, and law and order situation across the country on February 8 when over 126 million Pakistani voters cast their votes.
The armed forces are deployed under the Constitution in aid of the civil administration to provide security or any other services required by the government which authorises any such deployment through an approval by the cabinet.
The Army already announced that it was ready to provide any kind of help to carry out the electoral exercise as the country faces the rising threat of militancy.
The year 2023 was one of the worst since 2015 due to terror-related incidents.
Earlier this month, an independent candidate, Kaleemullah Khan — who was eyeing to contest polls for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly's PK-104 — was shot dead in the restive North Waziristan district.
Also, at the same time a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader, Shah Khalid, was also killed in Swabi after unidentified assailants riding a motorcycle opened fire on his car.
Owing to the precarious situation, caretaker Prime Minister Kakar set up a high-level committee to oversee security for the polls.

Ramanujan’s wonderful essay, “Three Hundred Ramayanas: Five Examples and Three Thoughts on Translation”, which says that the Ramayana is a narrative that has been told numerous times in numerous ways across languages and cultures, ends with a delightful story. The essay was dropped from the Delhi University syllabus after Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad protested against it for allegedly hurting the sentiments of Hindus.
It is about a cultured woman who had a complex about her husband not being cultured enough. When a great reciter of the epic came to the village, she sent him to the performance, hoping that her husband would return from it smarter.
The man was very bored and slept through the first three nights. The wife was so enraged by this that she accompanied him on the fourth night and made him sit in the first row. He could not fall asleep and soon was caught up in the twists and turns of the plot of the epic.
The reciter was narrating an episode in which Hanuman has to take Rama’s signet ring to Sita.
“When Hanuman was leaping across the ocean, the signet ring slipped from his hand and fell into the ocean. Hanuman didn’t know what to do. He had to get the ring back quickly and take it to Sita in the demon’s kingdom… the husband who was listening with rapt attention in the first row said: ‘Hanuman, don’t worry. I’ll get it for you.’ Then he jumped up and dived into the ocean, found the ring on the ocean floor, brought it back, and gave it to Hanuman,” writes Ramanujan.
“Everyone was astonished. They thought this man was someone special, really blessed by Rama and Hanuman…That’s what happens when you really listen to a story, especially to the Ramayana.”
Listening deeply is like deep diving; it can eliminate everything else and draw you in, into even the sublime. It is the unlocking of imagination, which is a key element of faith. If you are listening that intently, metaphors cast off their skin and turn into facts. The believer fishes out the blessed ring. A miracle is performed.
But what if we reverse the premise a bit? Reversing can be a useful technique to understand many a phenomena. It can help us to understand the limits of possibility. For example, can Palestine pound Israel back, the way it is being pounded? No. Can India be reluctant to issue visas to Americans or Europeans? No. Can you visualise a future in which Bengali-style weddings will replace Bollywood-style weddings? No.
Reversing also highlights the direction in which power flows.
In other cases, when the reverse is possible, you may want to explore its implications.
So in the case of listening, to frame a question that is a little more complex, what if you are hearing something, insistently, despite yourself, and you do not want to be dragged into its plot?
A few days ago, when the Ram mandir was inaugurated, a lot of Indians felt obliged to dress up as Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman. I felt the pressure, too, to be part of such a pageant. But I could not take the risk. Firstly, I would not look good in any of the costumes. I am too short, fat, bald and old for any of them, and of the wrong gender, mostly. Secondly, induced by the constant music and chanting around me, if I do lose myself and get caught up in the action, and then the person dressed up as Rama, or Hanuman, or anyone, loses something valuable, say an iPhone, what will I deep dive into? The Calcutta pavement?
The transcendental will not work for me, not in these changed circumstances. I think I will keep wearing my own clothes. I will also really switch off my ears, at times, whether the storytelling is going on on WhatsApp or offline.
On a cold, winter day, I will listen to Kishore Kumar."

Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian will also visit the country on January 29 at the invitation of cash-strapped Pakistan’s foreign minister Jalil Abbas Jilani, the FO said.
Tensions escalated between Islamabad and Tehran after Pakistan conducted “precision military strikes” against what it called “terrorist hideouts” in Iran’s Siestan-Balochistan province that killed 9 early on Thursday.
The attack was seen as retaliation to Iranian missile and drone attacks last Tuesday on two bases of the Sunni Baloch militant group Jaish al-Adl in Pakistan’s unruly Balochistan province.
“Following the telephone conversation between the foreign ministers of Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, it has been mutually agreed that ambassadors of both countries may return to their respective posts by January 26, 2024,” the statement said.
Information minister Murtaza Solangi said Jilani “deserves all the credit for his visionary engagement and managing possibly one of the fastest de-escalations of the diplomatic history”.
The development comes amidst the reported visit of Chinese foreign minister Sun Weidong to Pakistan on a mediation mission.
China on Monday said it is maintaining close contacts with Pakistan and Iran to “bridge their differences” after the two nations conducted airstrikes against each other last week.
4 rescued from Russia  jet crash
Islamabad: Four people have been rescued and two died following the crash of a private Russian jet carrying six over the weekend in Afghanistan, the Taliban said on Monday.
The crash on Saturday took place in a mountainous area in Badakhshan province, some 250 km northeast of Kabul. Rescue teams were dispatched to the remote rural area that is home to only several thousand people.
On Monday, the chief Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, posted videos on X, previously known as Twitter, showing the four rescued crew members. He said they were given first aid and were being transferred from Badakhshan to Kabul. He said the four are in good health.

Gandhi later addressed party supporters on the outskirts of the city, and said, ""We have broken barricades, but will not break the law"".
The police, which had set up barricades at two places to prevent the Yatra from entering the city limits, had to use force to stop the Congress workers, reports PTI.
Gandhi was earlier accorded a boisterous welcome as he tried to enter Guwahati and addressed some varsity students on the way.
Addressing supporters, he said while BJP president J P Nadda took the same route, they were not allowed to travel on it.
""You should not think we are weak. We have broken the barricades,"" he told his workers and supporters, calling them ""babbar sher"" (lion).
""They have cancelled my programme at the university. My programme was cancelled, but the students heard me outside,"" he said.
""Congress workers do not fear anyone,"" he said, adding that ""we will defeat the BJP in Assam and form the Congress government soon."" 	He also lauded the police for doing their job well.
""We know that police officers have done a good job and followed orders, with one person coming and lying down before the (yatra) bus. We are not against you. We are against the chief minister who is most corrupt. Our fight is with him,"" Gandhi said.
He said policemen were also clapping on his speech but hastened to add that they should not.
""We have won as we have broken the barricades,"" AICC in-charge for Assam Jitendra Singh said.
Gandhi later proceeded from the designated route on the ring road.
Earlier, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had asserted that the Yatra would not be permitted to enter the city to avert potential traffic congestion. Despite this, large crowds gathered at the Guwahati Chowk in Khanapara, warmly welcoming Gandhi with spirited slogans and drum beats.
Leaders of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) had announced that the yatra led by Rahul Gandhi had decided to traverse the Guwahati bypass on Tuesday. However, the Assam government has denied permission to proceed through the main routes within Guwahati city.
The Congress said that Guwahati police asked them to take the yatra through NH27 (Khanapara- Jayanagar- Basistha- Gorchuk- Lokhra route). Bedabrata Bora, spokesperson for Assam PCC, stated, according to news reports, ""It has been decided to abandon the plan of taking the 'Nyay Yatra' through the main routes of Guwahati. The police are not allowing us. Now, we will gather at Khanapara for a protest meeting, and subsequently, the yatra will move towards the Lower Assam district through the Guwahati bypass.""
The Yatra, which entered Meghalaya on Monday, returned to Assam for its last leg. The plan, sources said, was to travel through the outskirts of the state's largest city Guwahati. But now it is uncertain. The Yatra is scheduled to be in Assam till Thursday.
On Monday, Rahul Gandhi was stopped from visiting Batadrava Than owing to “issues related to his security”. The day witnessed competing narratives of the Right-wing ecosystem and the Congress over the Ram temple consecration play out “peacefully” on the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra route in two central Assam districts of Nagaon and Morigaon.
Police said Rahul was not allowed to go because of a letter written by the Sri Sri Batadrava Than Parichalana Committee, which wanted him to visit after 3pm because a lot of devotees were expected there on the occasion of the Ram temple consecration.
Sources said a group of local youths had arranged a live screening of the Ram temple’s inaugural ceremony outside the Than. A lot of people were also expected to turn up to see Rahul. They said the Than committee did not want any kind of misunderstanding between the two groups.
The Congress brass had turned down the invite to the Ayodhya temple inauguration, prompting the Right-wing ecosystem to term them “anti-Hindu”.
Rahul tried to make it to the birthplace of saint-reformer Srimanta Sankardeva to pay his homage by reaching Haiborgaon around 8.25am but ran into barricades put up by the police."

The Bengal chief minister, on her way to a state government event in East Burdwan, told journalists in the afternoon that she had not had any seat-sharing talks with the Congress.
“No, I have not had any talks (with the Congress). I have not had any talks with anybody. The proposal I had given, they had rejected at the very start. Since then, our party has decided to go it alone in Bengal,” the Trinamul chief said. She, however, reaffirmed her pledge as a secular force willing to do anything to defeat the BJP.
“But right now, there is no discussion… absolutely wrong. It is wrong,” Mamata said, a day after Rahul issued a statement on the sidelines of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra saying that seat-sharing negotiations were underway with her party.
Rahul said during an interaction with journalists on Tuesday: “Mamataji and I are on very good terms personally, and so is the party.”
“Yes, some little things keep happening. Sometimes, somebody says something from their side, sometimes, somebody says something from our side. These are natural things, these are not things that are going to disrupt anything,” Rahul said.
The Congress appears in an uncomfortable spot with the party sharing space with Trinamul and the CPM within the INDIA combine while being at daggers drawn with Trinamul in Bengal and in an on-again, off-again relationship with the consistently friendly CPM.
Mamata did not seem impressed with the olive branch from Rahul. Bringing up the Yatra, she said the Congress had not even bothered to let her know about its passage through Bengal.
“Their rally, have they told us about it? As a matter of courtesy? I am an INDIA ally. Did they let me know, ‘Didi, we are going to your state’? No, they did not,” Mamata said on Wednesday.
“Therefore, there are no terms whatsoever with me, as far as Bengal is concerned,” she added, in an apparent response to what Rahul had said on Tuesday.
“About the all-India scenario, what we will do, what we won’t, we will think about that after the election.”
However, she was quick to add: “We are a secular party, we will do anything necessary to defeat the BJP.”
Asked whether she would stay on in INDIA, Mamata said it was not the monopoly of any one entity. “It does not belong exclusively to someone. Us regional parties, we will remain together,” Mamata said.
“We have said that they are free to contest 300 seats on their own, while the regional parties will fight in the remaining seats,” she added, referring to her December 19 proposal to Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge for his party to directly take on the BJP in 300 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats, leaving the rest for INDIA allies. She had mooted a 1:1 formula, which implies fielding a single INDIA candidate from each seat, the one with the highest winnability against the BJP nominee.
“Do not interfere there (in the 243 seats for regional parties). If they do interfere there, we will figure it out differently then,” Mamata warned.
The Trinamul chief’s expression of displeasure prompted a placatory statement from Jairam Ramesh, Congress general secretary (communications), who urged focus on her unwavering commitment to fighting the BJP.
“Mamataji is a big leader of Trinamul, of Bengal, of India. Trinamul is a very important pillar of INDIA. Without Mamataji, we cannot even imagine the alliance,” he said.
Sources in Trinamul said nothing was set in stone yet and Mamata could still consider setting aside up to four seats for the Congress in Bengal if approached amicably.
“One proper phone call from Sonia Gandhi, with whom she still has a great relationship, or a duly pliant message from Rahul could still save this alliance, with regard to Bengal,” said a Trinamul MP.
“She was willing to set aside two seats for them, they went about issuing statements demanding 7, 8, 9, 12, without trying to talk to her properly first…. She might still be willing to yield up to four,” he added.
The Congress state unit wants to contest in at least seven seats out of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha constituencies. Besides Behrampore and Malda South (which they won in 2019), the Congress is said to be keen on Murshidabad, Jangipur, Malda North, Raiganj, Darjeeling, Purulia and Basirhat.
At the December 19 INDIA meeting, Mamata had clearly said she was willing to discuss the tie-up with the Congress for the state and was not averse to being a considerate ally in the negotiations.
But the likes of Behrampore MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Mamata’s bete noire who is not only the state unit chief of the Congress but also its leader in the Lok Sabha, has since thrown a spanner in the works, telling Rahul that even in his “worst nightmare” he could not imagine taking her help for elections in Bengal.
Even on Wednesday, the Congress’s chief spokesperson for Bengal, Soumya Aich Roy, responded with derision.
“This is inevitable, given her political compulsions. The BJP and Trinamul are shaking in fear on account of the success of Rahul Gandhi’s Yatra…. We have been saying for so long that she cannot ever be genuine in her opposition to the BJP because they are two sides of the same coin,” Aich Roy said.
Virtually echoing him, CPM state secretary Md. Salim added that INDIA is not about seat-sharing alone.
“She has been insisting on nothing but seat-sharing. We want to talk about the neeti (policy) not the neta (leader), but how will Trinamul talk about any neeti, being fueled solely by (Mamata’s) prime ministerial ambition?” asked Salim.
“It seems that they have now been reassured by the Prime Minister that the central agencies are no longer going to chase (Mamata’s nephew) Abhishek Banerjee,” he added.
The BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad said this was always going to be the case in the INDIA space.
“Selfish, opportunist people have come together for an alliance, so this was always most likely. They neither have a neta nor any neeti…. The people will surely elect Narendra Modi for a third consecutive term,” he said."

Yadav New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 06:16 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/bharat-ratna-to-karpoori-thakur-modis-grab-at-socialist-icons-legacy-ahead-of-lok-sabha-polls/cid/1995978,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move to confer the Bharat Ratna on Bihar’s socialist icon Karpoori Thakur, 36 years after his death and just ahead of the general elections, is being seen by BJP insiders as an audacious attempt to usurp the legacy of the legendary OBC protagonist and nibble away the voter base of chief minister Nitish Kumar.
Thakur, twice chief minister of Bihar, was a staunch Lohiaite socialist whose politics and ideology ran against both the Sangh and the Congress; both groups have suddenly begun to compete to celebrate Thakur and claim his legacy.
Modi, brimming with confidence post the Ram temple inauguration, is eyeing a straight third term in power with record numbers in the Lok Sabha; excelling in Bihar is key to that ambition.
Bihar, on the current state of play with the JDU and the RJD allied, remains an outlier among northern heartland states. Modi and the BJP have been desperately looking for a narrative to make substantive inroads into the backward and extremely backward caste-dominated politics of the state.
“Modiji’s surprise move will shake not only Nitish and Lalu (Prasad) but the political landscape of Bihar. We are hopeful that the decision (to confer the Bharat Ratna on Thakur) will put pressure on Nitish Kumar to break away from the RJD, which doesn’t carry the legacy of Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur,” a BJP leader said, indicating that Bihar may spring yet another surprise with Nitish essaying yet another somersault.
“Karpoori Thakur was against promoting dynasty and was committed to serving the most backward. Lalu and his party are only concerned about serving the interests of their family and the Yadavs and the Muslims,” the BJP leader added.
Conferring the Bharat Ratna on Thakur, a demand his legacy carriers Nitish and Lalu’s RJD have been pressing for long, came not as yet another government decision but as a carefully planned electoral manoeuvre. Most prominent newspapers reaching Bihari readers carried a long write-up by Modi, hailing the late socialist Thakur.
“He (Thakur) belonged to one of the most backward sections of society, the Nai Samaj,” Modi wrote, highlighting the “Nai” or the “barber” caste of the late leader and went on to underline his backward roots. “As a person belonging to the backward classes myself, I have much to thank Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji for. Unfortunately, we lost him when we needed him the most,” Modi wrote, aiming to counter the caste-survey politics brandished by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.
Thakur is most remembered for his affirmative action to uplift the most deprived sections and Modi appeared to be eyeing the same sections.
More than a decade ahead of the Mandal Commission, Thakur as chief minister had implemented a path-breaking reservation system splitting the wider OBC category into two parts — OBC and EBC (Extremely Backward Classes). A larger share of 12 per cent was allotted for the EBCs and only 8 per cent was set out of the other OBCs out of a total quota of 26 per cent. In addition, Thakur allotted 3 per cent for women and another 3 per cent for economically backward classes from among the upper castes.
Decades later, Nitish sought to borrow from Thakur’s legacy by wooing EBCs in his bid to beat friend-turned-foe Lalu’s Mandal politics focused on the Muslim-Yadav vote base. After taking power in 2005, Nitish once again split the backward reservation pie in two parts, focusing on the EBCs and also implementing 50 per cent reservation for women in panchayats.
On Wednesday, speaking at an event to mark the centenary of Thakur, home minister Amit Shah claimed that Modi was inspired by the “Jan Nayak”. “Modiji’s move to give 10 per cent reservation to the economically backward among upper castes and 33 per cent to women along with many decisions for OBC welfare is praised across the country. But it was started in the 70s by Jan Nayak Karpooriji,” Shah said, adding that 27 ministers in Modi’s ministry, including Modi himself, hail from the backward classes.
“The biggest coincidence was that on January 22, Modiji did Ram Kaaj and on January 23, by conferring the Bharat Ratna on Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur he did Garib Kaaj. He worked to connect Ram and the poor,” Shah said, going on to claim that Modi’s stress on Hindi and other regional languages was also inspired by the late socialist leader.
BJP leaders see the Karpoori-Bharat Ratna move as an aggressive effort to lay claim on the socialist leader’s legacy and make a grab on the EBCs who account for 36 per cent of Bihar’s population.
The BJP has been able to make inroads in the non-Yadav backward voters in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh but failed to do the same effectively in Bihar due to their dependence on Nitish when they have been allied, BJP leaders argue.
The BJP-JDU-LJP combine had swept the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Bihar, winning 39 (BJP 17, JDU 16 and LJP 6) of the 40 seats in the state. This time, with Nitish not with them, Modi and the BJP fear that they may not be able to repeat the feat and so moves like the one on Karpoori Thakur."

“Officials from Bengal who were present in the meeting faced questions on why the state did not follow central guidelines on the names and the logos of schemes which were being implemented in Bengal. The officials also faced questions over financial irregularities that allegedly took place under the schemes,” said a source aware of the meeting's deliberations.
A senior state government official said they had presented facts and figures that established that Bengal had initiated steps to rectify the problems whenever central teams had pointed them out.
“We made it clear that we had submitted action-taken reports whenever the Centre had pointed out any discrepancy…. The action-taken reports have been verified by the central teams and no further question was raised. We are hopeful that we can get due funds at the earliest,” said a senior state government official.
The meeting was held after the chief minister led a delegation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 19, demanding the immediate release of funds under several schemes, including one for 100 days of jobs.
“It was decided during the talks between the Prime Minister and the chief minister that a meeting would be held between the officials of the central and state governments. The meeting was held today (Tuesday), more than a month after the chief minister had met the Prime Minister,” said a source.
In the meeting held on Tuesday, secretaries of finance, panchayat, health, education, public works and food and supplies departments represented the state government. On behalf of the Centre, officials in the prime minister’s office and the ministry of rural development attended the meeting.
“It is not very comfortable for the state as the Centre is asking questions on the non-compliance with the rules related to the names and the logos of the central schemes. It is a political decision whether to use the names and the logos of the central schemes in the state. But after the Centre had raised questions earlier, we tried to use the names and the logos of the central schemes,” said a state government official.
Sources said although the state had tried to use the logos and the names of central schemes like the PMGSY (rural roads) and PMAY (housing for rural poor), it was yet to use the name and the logo of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) on ration shops."

The permission to allow the Chinese ship comes amid strained ties between India and Maldives after its recently-elected President Mohamed Muizzu made Beijing as his first port of call early this month soon after assuming office. Traditionally, New Delhi has been the first port of call for a Maldivian President.
“The current administration appears to be making a stark pivot towards an anti-India stance. Both, the MDP and The Democrats believe alienating any development partner, and especially the country’s most long-standing ally will be extremely detrimental to the long-term development of the country,” the two opposition parties said in their assessment on “the direction in foreign policy” of the Maldivian government.
“Consecutive governments of the country must be able to work with all development partners for the benefit of the people of the Maldives, as the Maldives has traditionally done. Stability and security in the Indian Ocean is vital to the stability and security of the Maldives,” they told a joint news conference.
MDP’s chairperson and former Minister Fayyaz Ismail and the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament, MP Ahmed Saleem, along with Democrats party president MP Hassan Latheef and the Parliamentary Group Leader, MP Ali Azim addressed a joint press conference to flag the issues.
The two parties committed to work together on several governance-related issues and expressed concern on another set of issues including the foreign policy and lack of transparency.
The MPs of the two parties together hold 55 seats in the 87-member house.
The joint statement was posted on the official websites of the two parties and their official X handles too.
The other issues of concern included a lack of transparency in the financial status of the state and the lack of transparency in the MOUs and Agreements that the Government is signing, especially, with foreign parties, although no country was named in the statement.
The opposition also criticised the attempts at censoring the media and meddling with the freedom of the press.

LJ3YGY0F8Q_ZQZC7X5ICJYGC4F,SC glare on ‘tit-for-tat’ probes: Court mulls mechanism to halt state-ED reprisals,"R. Balaji New Delhi Published 26.01.24, 05:06 AM","R. Balaji New Delhi Published 26.01.24, 05:06 AM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/supreme-court-glare-on-tit-for-tat-probes-court-mulls-mechanism-to-halt-state-enforcement-directorate-reprisals/cid/1996203,"The Supreme Court on Thursday said it would try to evolve a transparent mechanism to avert “vindictive” or “tit-for-tat” actions between state police and central investigative agencies like the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI.
Two instances were mentioned at the hearing: the recent arrest of ED officer Ankit Tiwari on bribery charges by Tamil Nadu police, and Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee laying siege to the CBI office in Calcutta in 2021 after the arrest of Trinamul ministers in the Narada scam.
Recently, Bengal police registered a trespass case against ED officials who had raided the home of a local Trinamul leader in connection with a corruption probe, while the central agency accused the state police of going soft on the absconding accused.
The bench of Justice Surya Kant and Justice K.V. Viswanathan was hearing an ED application for transfer to the CBI of the criminal case registered against Tiwari in Tamil Nadu.
“There may be genuine cases where ED may have to go in. Then there may be cases where they are brought in with a mala fide…” Justice Viswanathan observed.
“There has to be a mechanism, particularly when the ruling party is different between the Centre and the state. Something has to be evolved so that while the accused in genuine cases don’t go scot-free merely because it is being handled by the central agency and there is also no mala fide or witch-hunt.”
He added: “This is just the start. If this happens in different states where ED officers are posted, what will happen to this country?... Suppose there is a given scenario where there is a tit-for-tat reaction. That is why some kind of screening mechanism should be there before a probe.”
Justice Kant said the objective was to ensure fair and objective investigation. “A mechanism can be devised so that no guilty should go scot-free under the veils of counter-allegations. It can then be applied (to) other states… one by one,” he said.
Tiwari was arrested by Tamil Nadu’s directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) in December for allegedly demanding a Rs 20-lakh bribe from a state official implicated in an ED case.
The bench cautioned solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, who was representing the ED, and senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the Tamil Nadu government along with the state’s additional advocate-general Amit Anand Tiwari, after they engaged in mutual recrimination.
“We are on the larger issues of best practices considering the federal structure of the country. We will evolve a mechanism — you should sit together and give suggestion,” the bench said.
It directed that the parallel probes being conducted by the ED and the DVAC against Tiwari be kept on hold.
Mehta alleged that following Tiwari’s arrest, the DVAC had raided ED’s regional office in Chennai and seized several documents relating to a money-laundering probe against several state ministers. He also cited how Mamata had led a siege of the Calcutta CBI office nearly three years ago.
Sibal questioned the impartiality of the CBI and the ED, wondering why they did not investigate BJP politicians. “You should not protect your ministers. Investigate all FIRs against the chief minister of Assam,” he told Mehta.
As the two senior counsel traded charges, Justice Kant referred to an order passed by Madras High Court refusing a CBI probe into the Tiwari case while hearing a public-interest plea.
“The way the high court entertained it and passed the order, we don’t want to comment…. But there is something which can be said about both sides (Centre and the state). Either you both come up with some solutions, otherwise we will find out. The matter needs to be probed in a transparent manner,” he said."

Hum aur kar bhi kya sakhte hain, sivaye dekhne ke. (Let things happen the way they are happening. What else can we do besides watching silently).""
The helplessness in the voice of Najafzafar Jilani, son of now-deceased senior advocate Zafaryab Jilani who argued the Ram Janmabhoomi case, overrode his efforts to sound indifferent when asked about his thoughts on the hoopla surrounding the scheduled Ram Mandir consecration on January 22.
“What can we do or say when there is a Supreme Court judgment that gives legitimacy to all that is happening,” Jilani murmured.
Jilani was referring to the landmark November 2019 Supreme Court verdict which ordered the disputed 2.77-acre plot in Ayodhya to be handed over a Central government trust on which the Ram Temple is being currently built and allot an alternative plot to build a mosque to replace the demolished Babri Masjid.
“Right now all we can do is wait and watch,” Jilani said. “We will keep a keen eye on the government’s moves after January 22 and then decide whether or not we have a course of action to follow,” he continued.
Careful about his utterances on what he considered a “sensitive issue”, Jilani avoided speaking his mind for fear of persecution. “We don’t want to say anything that might stoke a fresh controversy. The government would most certainly be filing cases and causing us harassment if it found our opinions not to their liking. We have had enough of those and want to steer clear of them now,” he said.
Asked whether he felt included in the so-called frenzy sweeping across significant parts of the country over the Pran Pratishtha ceremony of Ram Lalla, Jilani answered: “Of course, we feel left out, but we have kept our mouths shut for fear of government backlashes.”
His brief response to how he hoped to get roped back into the nation’s mainstream: “We don’t have a solution in sight.”
Syed Ilyas Qasim Rasool, former convenor of the now-defunct Babri Masjid Action Committee (BMAC) was more forthcoming, though. Especially, when it came to questioning the Uttar Pradesh government’s role in the Pran Pratishtha ceremony.
“Why should the government get so deeply involved in a religious programme like this?” Rasool asked. “Shouldn’t it have been left entirely to the religious group concerned? It almost feels like the government has donned a particular religious colour with its full machinery deployed for the work. It defies the tenets of secularism enshrined in our Constitution and goes against the basic fabric of federalism,” he argued.
“The whole Ram Mandir movement has been done with political ambitions right from the start,” Rasool maintained. “Today that has become apparent even before the Shankaracharyas. Several priests from Ayodhya too have opposed the function. Only five people would be allowed inside the Ram Lalla Garbha Griha, four of whom are political Sangh Parivar political persons. The indications are there for all to see and interpret. This would be a one-party ceremony.”
Rasool believes that Apex Court judgment was laden with inherent contradictions which paved the way for Hindu groups to flock to courts of the land with similar petitions based on faith rather than facts. “The fundamental basis of the 2019 Supreme Court judgment was the rejection of the contention that the Babri Masjid was built after destroying a Ram Temple in that location. Despite the court not finding any scientific evidence to back that claim, it ruled in favour of the Ram Mandir petitioners,” the BMAC member said.
“It was a court decision which we have to adhere to. But justice wasn’t meted out,” he stated.
But unlike Jilani who feels “left out” and marginalized, advocate Iqbal Ansari, former Babri Masjid litigant, thinks the hatchet is already buried. Ansari has received an invitation for the consecration and confirmed to The Telegraph Online that he would be attending the ceremony. Setting an example of the Ganga-Jamuni Tehzeeb, Ansari has already gifted a miniature replica of the Ram Temple to one of his aides.
“The Muslim community of this entire nation welcomed the judgment of the top court. Not one untoward incident was reported following the order. Not even a demonstration took place against it. There are no differences between the Hindus and Muslims anymore. The construction of the temple is almost complete and Lord Ram would be taking his position in it. I am happy the way things have turned out and the community too feels in the same way,” Ansari told reporters earlier this month following the receipt of invitation.
Ansari has, since, slammed the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board for failing to build a mosque at the alternate site despite the five-acre plot awarded to it by the Supreme Court four years ago while, instead, only managing to come up with a proposed layout.
Syed Ahmed Bukhari, Shahi Imam of the Jama Masjid in Delhi and currently traveling abroad, preferred to remain guarded about voicing his opinion. “This is their own religious affair. Everyone in this country has the freedom to follow the path dictated by their own religion,” Bukhari said in the form of a statement when approached for his views."

Several programmes were held in various parts of the state on the occasion of the 'Pran Pratishtha' of the idol of Ram Lalla -- the childhood form of Lord Ram -- at the Ayodhya temple.
Sarma viewed the consecration ceremony at the Harijan Colony in the city, while special prayers were organised in various places and people burst crackers as the event streamed live on various platforms.
""The return of Dashrathnandan Ram to His Bhavya Mandir marks a turning point in our civilisation and a reawakening of national consciousness,"" Sarma wrote on X.
He said the events being organised during the day will inspire ""more than a thousand future generations to uphold Sanatan Dharma to its fullest glory"".
""As Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji leads the nation to restore a vital dharmic and sanskritik link, I am eternally grateful to Prabhu Shri Ram for allowing me to exist in this particular time of history, a Swarnim Yug,"" the CM added.
The state government had earlier declared a half-day holiday in the state, with government offices and institutions to open from 2 pm on Monday.
Government schools, colleges and universities remained closed for the day, while private educational institutions had also been urged to declare a holiday.
Sarma, at a press conference on Sunday, had urged people of all faiths to hold special prayers on the occasion of the Ram temple consecration to promote harmony.
A 'dry day' has also been declared on Monday, and shops selling non-vegetarian food items will remain closed till 4 pm, he said.
He also appealed to people across the state to light lamps outside their homes, shops and business establishments as well as visit 'namghars' (community prayer halls) on Monday evening.

Expressing his disappointment, Gandhi criticised the decision, questioning the interference in his visit during such a significant religious occasion. The temple, located at the birthplace of Assamese icon Srimanta Sankardeva, has become the center of controversy as authorities cited the Ram temple consecration as the reason for denying early access to the Congress leader.
Gandhi, along with other Congress leaders, was stopped at Haiboragaon today, and not allowed to proceed further. The former Congress chief was scheduled to pay obeisance to the local deity before starting his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on Monday.
Mahila Congress leaders subsequently sat on a dharna to protest against denial of permission to Gandhi to visit the temple. The former Congress chief also joined the dharna.
Authorities said Gandhi will be allowed permission to visit the temple only at 3 PM.
Gandhi questioned the police on why he was being stopped from visiting the temple.
""Will PM Modi now decide who will visit a temple and when,"" Gandhi said.
The Batadrawa Than is located at the birthplace of Assamese icon Srimanta Sankardeva, a social-religious reformer of the 15th-16th century.
In a letter to Batadrawa's Congress MLA Shibamoni Bora on Sunday afternoon, the managing committee's president Jogendra Nath Dev Mahanta said that on the occasion of the Ram temple's consecration, several organisations have planned devotional programmes at the premises of the Than.
""Several thousands of people are expected to visit the place and as such we cannot allow Gandhi to enter the premises before 3 pm,"" he said.
""We had received a letter from Bora regarding the Congress MP's visit and we extend a warm welcome to him but we cannot allow him to enter the premises before 3 pm,"" he said.
The decision was taken at a meeting of the committee, he added.
Earlier, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had also said that Gandhi should avoid visiting Batadrawa on January 22 as there can be no competition between Lord Ram and the medieval-age Vaishnav saint.
Reacting to Sarma's statement, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh had said that Gandhi would visit the Than as planned, maintaining that no politics should be done over it."

Buzz on Nitish Kumar's return to BJP fold amid rift in INDIA bloc","PTI New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 08:40 PM","PTI New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 08:40 PM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/will-he-wont-he-buzz-on-nitish-kumars-return-to-bjp-fold-amid-rift-in-india-bloc/cid/1996190,"Signs of deepening fissures between Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his INDIA bloc allies have given rise to the possibility of his return to the BJP fold amid hectic efforts within the opposition camp to stall any such development.
On a day RJD president Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya took a swipe at Kumar for ""changing his ideology as the wind changes its direction"" in posts on 'X' following the JD(U) president's swipe at parties promoting family members in politics, a BJP leader well-versed with the state's politics said the party will be guided by its future political imperatives, and not past bitterness.
He, however, noted that any call has to be taken by the party's top brass.
The BJP has been showing signs of warming up to Kumar, who has swapped his alliance preference between the saffron party and the RJD-Congress-Left camp frequently while remaining in power, with its leaders toning down their criticism of him of late and even praising him at times.
Union Home Minister Amit Shah himself sounded more open to such a possibility in a recent interview. Asked about the likelihood of the Janata Dal (U) president's return to the BJP-led alliance, Shah said the party will consider if such a proposal is ever made.
Earlier, Shah had often asserted that the doors had been closed for Kumar's return to the country's ruling alliance.
Bihar's longest-serving chief minister has been cut up with the INDIA bloc for not getting a position in the alliance commensurate with his stature and also favours an early assembly poll to go with the Lok Sabha elections, a suggestion which has not drawn a positive response from the RJD, the biggest party in the state's ruling alliance, sources said.
JD(U) and RJD leaders have also been sniping at each other amid apprehensions among Kumar's supporters that their ally has been trying to undermine him in matters of governance as well as politics.
Kumar's decision to take over as the party president by cutting short the tenure of Lalan Singh was seen as a determined effort by him to take firm control of its organisation amid suggestions by a section of JD(U) leaders that the chief minister's confidant may have grown too close to the RJD or was pursuing an independent agenda.
The RJD has, however, taken some placatory moves by first agreeing to the relegation of Education Minister Chandra Shekhar to the relatively insignificant portfolio of sugarcane industries.
Acharya also deleted her posts targeting the chief minister without naming him, hours after putting them out. The Bihar BJP accused Acharya, who does not hold any position in the RJD, of insulting Kumar and demanded an apology from her.
The INDIA bloc has been marred by incoherence and distrust, with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Singh Mann dealing twin blows on Wednesday that their parties, the TMC and AAP respectively, will go solo in the Lok Sabha elections expected in April-May.
Signs of disconnect among the INDIA parties in Bihar will suit the BJP in the run-up to the elections as the same alliance had handed it a big defeat in the 2015 assembly polls before Kumar joined hands again with the BJP-led NDA, which then swept the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.
He vaulted into the opposition's alliance in 2022 as the BJP grew increasingly assertive following his party's sub-par performance in the 2020 assembly polls.
With Kumar's critics both within the opposition and the BJP being of the view that he has diminished as a political force, experts say it will be interesting to see how the shrewd leader manages to close out yet another round of political gamesmanship as the elections approach.

Mudur New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 07:27 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/indias-cheetah-introduction-project-gets-third-litter-three-cubs-born-in-kuno-national-park/cid/1995958,"India’s cheetah introduction project has registered its third litter, three cubs born to a Namibian cheetah in the Kuno National Park, Madhya Pradesh, but most of the project’s cheetahs remain behind fenced enclosures, not in the wild as the project had envisaged.
The Union minister for environment and forests, Bhupender Yadav, announced on Tuesday that the Namibian cheetah named Jwala has given birth to three cubs. The new litter follows just weeks after another Namibian cheetah named Aasha had given birth to three cubs.
“Congratulations to all wildlife frontline warriors and wildlife lovers across the country,” Yadav posted on X on Tuesday. Yadav had on January 3 described the arrival of Aasha’s cubs as a “roaring success” for project cheetah, a long-term conservation project aimed at introducing clusters of cheetah populations in India’s wilderness.
The environment ministry had brought into Kuno eight cheetahs from Namibia in September 2022 and 12 cheetahs from South Africa in February 2023. They were to be released into the unfenced area of the park after weeks to months of quarantine and observations within fenced enclosures.
But seven adult cheetahs and three of four cubs born in captivity in Kuno in March 2023 have died from various determined and undetermined causes since March 27 last year. Project authorities had attributed the cub deaths in May 2023 to heat and dehydration.
Wildlife officials and other experts have often asserted over the past several months that the cheetahs’ deaths, while unfortunate, should not be viewed as setbacks to the project’s long-term goals which is to establish self-sustaining cheetah populations in the wild.
But sections of wildlife biologists who have criticised the project for not anticipating the large spaces that cheetahs require but are unavailable in Kuno have questioned the long periods of the cheetahs’ captivity in fenced areas within Kuno.
A query sent by this newspaper on Tuesday to two officials associated with the project and an official in the environment ministry asking how many cheetahs are in the open wild and how many in fenced areas has not evoked a reply.
A wildlife biologist not associated with the project said the time spent by the adult cheetahs behind fenced enclosures in Kuno exceeds what is prescribed for the rehabilitation of large carnivores under Namibian regulations.
The Namibian regulations require an adult large carnivore, after being captured from the wild, to be held in a rehabilitation facility “for a maximum period of three months”. However, the rules allow an extended stay if required for veterinary reasons.
“The Namibian regulations won’t apply in India for jurisdictional reasons, but the logic underlying early release into the wild remains valid,” said Ravi Chellam, a large cat specialist and coordinator of the Biodiversity Collaborative, a network of conservation researchers.
“Prolonged captivity and frequent handling, including repeated tranquilisation, affects behaviour and instincts and can impact the overall well-being of wild cats,” Chellam said. “This reduces their fitness to thrive in the wild.”"

""It is Pakistan's latest attempt at peddling false and malicious anti-India propaganda,"" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.
He said Pakistan will ""reap what it sows"", adding ""to blame others for its own misdeeds can neither be a justification nor a solution.""  	The comments came hours after Pakistan claimed that it had ""credible evidence"" of links between what it called as ""Indian agents"" to the assassination of two Pakistani terrorists associated with the Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Lashkar-e-Taiba.
India was carrying out ""extra-territorial and extra-judicial killings"" inside Pakistan, Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi alleged at a press conference in Islamabad.
""As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicentre of terrorism, organised crime, and illegal transnational activities,"" Jaiswal said.
""India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence,"" he said.
""Pakistan will reap what it sows. To blame others for its own misdeeds can neither be a justification nor a solution,"" Jaiswal added.
Shahid Latif, a key aide of Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and the mastermind of the 2016 attack on the Indian Air Force base in Pathankot, was gunned down in a mosque in Sialkot in Punjab province on October 11 last year.
Riyaz Ahmad alias Abu Qasim, a Lashkar-e-Taiba operative and one of the main conspirators behind the Dhangri terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir in January last year, was shot dead in Rawalakot in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir on September 8, 2023.
""Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan. They recruited, financed, and supported criminals, terrorists, and unsuspecting civilians to play defined roles in these assassinations,"" Qazi alleged.

Ramesh's remark came amid a Congress-TMC impasse over seat-sharing in Bengal for the Lok Sabha polls and a day after Banerjee announced that her party will fight the elections in the state ""alone"".
Congress president Kharge, Rahul Gandhi and everyone in the party would be ""just delighted and privileged to have her as part of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra even if it is for a few minutes"", AICC general secretary in-charge communications Ramesh told PTI.
""Congress president Kharge has spoken with her today and we will find a way forward because her objective is the objective of the INDIA bloc which is to defeat the BJP resoundingly in West Bengal and convincingly in other parts of the country,"" he said.
Ramesh said the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra would be immensely strengthened by her presence.
""Without her, we cannot fight the BJP in Bengal and the rest of the country. She is the integral, essential pillar of the opposition bloc INDIA. She has played a crucial role in making the INDIA bloc a reality,"" the Congress leader said.
Ramesh's remarks came after Gandhi expressed confidence in the unity of the opposition INDIA bloc in combating injustice nationwide.
The 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,' led by Gandhi, entered West Bengal on Thursday from Assam through Bakshirhat in Cooch Behar district. It will take a two-day break on January 26-27 before restarting on January 28.
Banerjee had told reporters on Wednesday, ""I had given them (Congress) a proposal (on seat sharing) but they refused it at the outset. Our party has now decided to go it alone in Bengal."" 	After Banerjee's sudden comments, the Congress has adopted a conciliatory approach with Ramesh asserting that the opposition bloc INDIA ""cannot be imagined without Mamata Banerjee"".
The CPI (M)-led Left Front, Congress, and the TMC are part of the 28-party INDIA bloc.
In the 2019 elections, the TMC secured 22 seats, Congress won two, and the BJP bagged 18 seats in the state.
TMC had previously allied with the Congress in the 2001 assembly polls, the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, and the 2011 assembly polls, leading to the ousting of the CPI (M)-led Left Front government of 34 years.

The Congress has described the FIR lodged on Tuesday against leaders who are part of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra as a “political FIR”.
Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had on Tuesday night written to Union home minister Amit Shah about the “serious” security issues faced by Rahul and the Yatra in Assam over the last few days.
Assam police chief G.P. Singh on Wednesday wrote on X that the FIR was registered under various sections of the IPC and PDPP (Prevention of Damage to Public Property) Act and handed over to the CID for a “thorough and in-depth investigation” through an SIT to be constituted by the additional director-general of police.
Early in the day, Congress general secretary in charge of communications, Jairam Ramesh, had told reporters that Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had lodged the FIR against Rahul, K.C. Venugopal, Jitendra Singh, Gaurav Gogoi, Bhupen Borah, Debabrata Saikia and other leaders, including him. He termed it a political FIR with no link to reality and added that they were not scared.
Ramesh asserted that the party would face any legal procedure without fear and the Yatra would continue.
“PM Modi goes around the world and says that India is the Mother of Democracy. But this is not Mother of Democracy but Murder of Democracy,” he said.
After a night halt in Dhubri on Wednesday, the Yatra will enter Bengal on Thursday.
The Assam Congress also hit out at Sarma by tweeting: “Thank you @himantabiswa Ji for helping us with publicity. BTW, it seems you yourself filed the FIR, such cowardice doesn’t suit you. And rather than wasting so much energy in disrupting the yatra, you could’ve done some real work. No wonder why Assam is spiralling down to the bottom in every aspect.”
Congress leaders and workers had on Tuesday forcibly removed barricades put up by the administration to prevent the Rahul-led Yatra from entering Guwahati as a “mark of protest”.
In his letter to Shah on Tuesday, Kharge said that the Congress had taken out the Yatra to “promote” the message of justice and harmony among the people of India.
“Unfortunately, since the Yatra has entered Assam on the 18th of January, 2024 there have been several instances where the Assam Police has been found wanting in providing adequate security that Shri. Rahul Gandhi who is entitled to as a Z+ security.”
Kharge cited instances of alleged police lapses, including how the cops were “found” protecting the posters of the BJP at Amguri in Sibsagar district “instead of ensuring safe passage for the Yatra” on January 18, the first day of the travel through Assam. On the second day, “miscreants associated with the BJP were caught defacing and taking down posters and hoardings” of the Yatra in Lakhimpur district, Kharge alleged.
He also mentioned the “outrageous attack” on the Yatra in Sonitpur district on January 21."

Addressing his first public meeting on the 7th day of 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' in Barpeta district, the Congress leader slammed Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and termed him the ""most corrupt CM"" of the country with a series of allegations related to land and areca nut.
""I don't know how Himanta Biswa Sarma got the idea that he can intimidate me by filing cases. File as many cases as you can. File 25 more cases, I am not going to be intimidated. BJP-RSS can't intimidate me"", he added.
The Guwahati Police on Tuesday suo motu registered an FIR against Gandhi and other leaders for wanton acts of violence in the state capital.
""I gave a speech against (Narendra) Modi's special friend (Gautam) Adani and case was filed against me. Then threw me out of parliament and took away my government residence. I gave the keys myself, I don't want it.
""My home is in the heart of every Indian citizen, I live there. I have lakhs of houses in Assam, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and all other states,"" Gandhi said amidst a huge round of applause from the public.
Alleging that a series of corruption is taking place in Assam, the Congress leader termed Sarma as the ""most corrupt CM"" in the country.
""While he (Sarma) speaks to you, he steals your land. While you chew betel nut, he corners the supari business. He steals money from your pocket. He has taken land in Kaziranga National Park also"", the Congress leader added.
Referring to the media conglomerate owned by the wife of Assam Chief Minister, Gandhi alleged that TV media shows what Sarma wants in the state.
""Sarma is controlled by Amit Shah. If anyone says anything against Amit Shah, he is thrown out by Sarma within two minutes. Tarun Gogoi was also a CM, but he did what Assam wanted. Tarun Gogoi was my guru, but I never told him what to do,"" he claimed.
Showing the 'Gamocha' (Assamese scarf), a symbol of the culture and identity of Assam, wrapped around his neck, Gandhi said the ruling dispensation is insulting the pride of the state.
""The BJP-RSS wants to wipe out the language, culture and history of Assam. They want to end the education given by your ancestors. They want to run Assam from Nagpur, but we will not allow it. Assam will be run from Assam only"", he added.
The Congress MP also alleged that the hearts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Sarma are ""filled with hatred"".
""HBS (acronym for Himanta Biswa Sarma) wakes up with hatred in his heart. He hates all the people in the world. He speaks hatred and fear for 24 hours. The fight is not against him, but the hatred in his heart,"" he added.
Stating that hatred can't defeat hatred, Gandhi appealed to everyone to use love to eradicate hatred.
""Fear hides behind hatred. These people spread hatred and fear, and we spread love. BJP-RSS fight one religion with another religion, one language with another language.
""We spoke to millions of people in 'Bharat Jodo Yatra'. Everyone told us that hatred won't work in India, love works here. This is the country of love"", he added.
Gandhi alleged that the BJP-RSS ideology has burned Manipur for several months now with people still being killed and houses set ablaze, but the Prime Minister of the country has not visited the state till date.
The Yatra, led by the Congress MP, commenced from Manipur on January 14 and will culminate on March 20 in Mumbai.
The Assam leg of the march, which started on January 18, will continue till January 25. It will travel 833 km in 17 districts.
The Yatra plans to cover 6,713 km in 67 days while passing through 110 districts in 15 states.

The chartered plane was carrying six people and disappeared from the radar screens over Afghanistan on Sunday, according to a Reuters report. Two Taliban officials in Badakhshan said on Sunday that two passengers were killed in a plane crash, but four others had survived.
Khan Mohammad, head of the provincial governor’s office, said the four surviving passengers were now with Taliban administration representatives. Zabihullah Amiri, Badakhshan’s provincial spokesman, confirmed the death toll and that four had survived.
Since the aircraft had taken off from Gaya in Bihar after refuelling, most reports initially suggested that this was an Indian carrier.
Amid conflicting reports about the ownership of the aircraft, the civil aviation ministry in its first statement clarified that “the unfortunate plane crash that has just occurred in Afghanistan is neither an Indian Scheduled Aircraft nor a Non-Scheduled (NSOP)/Charter aircraft. It is a Moroccan-registered small aircraft. More details are awaited”.
Later, the ministry said the DF-10 (Dassault Falcon) aircraft was registered in Morocco and was serving as an air ambulance. It was flying from Thailand to Moscow and had refuelled at Gaya airport.
An official told PTI that the plane departed the Gaya airport after refuelling at 4.02pm on Saturday. There were six passengers onboard, including a female patient, the official added.
The Russian news agency TASS had initially reported that an Indian jet flying to Moscow had crashed in Afghanistan’s northeast, quoting the Aamaj News agency. It was apparently transporting a Russian citizen who needed hospitalisation from Pattaya to Moscow.
A manifest list for the plane, which named everyone on board and which was published by the SHOT news outlet appeared to show that the crew were Russian nationals too.
According to Reuters, the Taliban-run Afghan aviation ministry said in a statement on X that the plane’s planned route did not include passing through Afghanistan’s air space and that “probably due to technical issues” the plane had diverted from its planned route.
The statement said a ministry technical team was investigating the matter. “Afghanistan police had received reports of a plane crash in a remote, mountainous region of Badakhshan,” a provincial police spokesperson said on Sunday."

""Upon returning from Ayodhya Dham after witnessing the most unforgettable moments of my life, I am writing this letter to you. I have returned with an Ayodhya in my heart, an Ayodhya which can never be separated from me,"" Modi said. 	  	He was responding to Murmu's letter to him a day before the January 22 consecration ceremony of the new idol of Ram Lalla at the temple.
In her letter to the prime minister, Murmu had said the nationwide celebratory atmosphere around the inauguration of the grand Ram temple was an uninhibited expression of India's eternal soul and the start of a new cycle in the country's resurgence.
Noting that he received Murmu's letter a day before leaving for Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, Modi said he is very grateful for her good wishes and affection. ""Every word of your letter expressed your compassionate nature and your immense happiness at organisation of the consecration ceremony,"" he said.
Modi said when he received Murmu's letter, he was in a different state of mind and her letter gave him immense support and strength in handling these feelings and in coming to terms with them.
""I visited ayodhya Dham as a pilgrim. My mind was overwhelmed with many emotions after going to the holy land where such a confluence of faith and history has taken place,"" he said.
""To witness such a historic occasion is both a privilege and a responsibility. You had also discussed about my 11-day religious exercise and the 'Yama-Niyams' related to it. Our country has been the witness to countless people who kept many vows for centuries so that Ram Lalla once again resides at his birthplace,"" Modi said.
""Being the medium of the fulfilment of these centuries-long resolves was a very emotional moment for me and I consider it my good fortune,"" the prime minister said.
Along with 140 crore people, seeing Ram Lalla and welcoming him was amazing, Modi said.
""That moment was possible only with the blessings of Lord Shri Ram and the people of India, and I will always be grateful for it,"" he said.
""As you said, we not only worship Lord Shri Ram but also take inspiration from him in every aspect of life, especially in the social sphere,"" Modi said.
The prime minister noted that President Murmu in her letter had discussed the impact of the scheme PM-JANMAN and the empowerment of extremely backward people in the tribal society.
""Being associated with the tribal society, who can understand this better than you? Our culture has always taught us to work for the most deprived sections of the society. Many campaigns like PM-JANMAN are bringing a big change in the lives of the people of the country today,"" Modi said.
The ideals of Lord Ram ""give us constant energy for the welfare works and empowerment campaigns for the poor"", he said.
""It is Lord Shri Ram who has given the inspiration for 'sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishvas aur sabka prayas' in every chapter of his life,"" the prime minister said.
The results of this mantra are visible everywhere today, and in the last decade, the country has succeeded in bringing about 25 crore people out of poverty, he said.
The eternal thoughts of Lord Ram are the basis of India's glorious future, Modi said.
""The power of these ideals will pave the way for all the people of the country to create a developed India by the year 2047,"" Prime Minister Modi said.
He said the grand temple of Lord Ram will ""continue to inspire us to create new paradigms of development and success"".
President Murmu on Sunday had complimented Prime Minister Modi ahead of the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony.
In a two-page letter to him, the president had said that ""as you prepare yourself to go for 'Pran Pratishtha' of Prabhu Shri Ram's 'murti' (idol) at the new temple built at his birthplace in Ayodhya, I can only contemplate the unique civilisational journey that will be accomplished with each step taken by you in the hallowed precincts"".
Referring to the 11-day rigorous 'anushthan' that the prime minister has undertaken, Murmu said it is not only a sacred ritual but also a supreme spiritual act of sacrifice and submission to Lord Ram.
Sending heartfelt wishes, the president said that the nationwide celebratory atmosphere around the inauguration of the grand temple of Prabhu Shri Ram in Ayodhya Dham is an uninhibited expression of the eternal soul of India. ""We all are fortunate to witness the commencement of a new cycle in the resurgence of our nation,"" she had said.

The release date is almost eight months after memes mixing visuals from the film ""Barbie"" with atomic blasts provoked anger from people in Japan - the only country hit by a nuclear bomb during war.
The outrage over the ""Barbenheimer"" memes prompted an apology from Barbie distributor Warner Brothers Japan, which said at the time they were ""extremely deplorable"".
A spokesperson for Bitters End declined to comment on the release date or say why it took over half a year for ""Oppenheimer"" to be screened in Japan.
""We decided to release this film in Japan after much debate and deliberation, as the themes covered in this film are ones that hold a very significant and special meaning for us as Japanese people,"" Bitters End said in December, according to local media, when it said Oppenheimer would be released in Japan sometime in 2024.
The United States dropped a nuclear bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6 1945 during World War Two, killing thousands instantly and about 140,000 by the end of the year. The US dropped another bomb on Nagasaki three days later, which killed more than 73,000 people. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15."

In her address to the nation on the eve of the 75th Republic Day, the president spoke on various issues including the welfare schemes initiated by the government and said it will be a proud day for the nation when it will be among those countries where homelessness ""is a rarity"".
She also touched on the conflicts that have emerged in several parts of the world and stressed at finding a way out in the light of reason.
""When each of the two conflicting sides believes that it is right and the other is wrong, the way out should be found in the light of reason. Unfortunately, instead of reason, fears and prejudices have fuelled passions, leading to relentless violence. There have been a series of humanitarian tragedies on a large scale, and we feel aggrieved over the human suffering,"" she said.
Citing the teachings of Vardhaman Mahavir, Samrat Ashoka and Mahatma Gandhi, the president said let's hope that the regions embroiled in conflicts will find a peaceful way to resolve conflicts and bring about peace.
Referring to the recent consecration rituals of Lord Ram at the newly-constructed temple at Ayodhya, she said when this event will be seen in the wider perspective, the future historians will consider it a landmark in India's continued re-discovery of its civilisational heritage.
""The construction of the temple commenced after the due judicial process and the decision of the highest court of the land. Now it stands as a grand edifice, giving a befitting expression not only of people's faith but also as a testament to people's enormous trust in the judicial process,"" she said.
Murmu said the ""magnificent"" G20 Summit hosted by India provided lessons for all in making citizens participants in strategic and diplomatic matters that are, in the final analysis, going to shape their own future.
""The G20 Summit also boosted India's emergence as the voice of the Global South, adding a necessary element to the international discourse,"" she said.
Talking about the economy of the country, she said India is moving ahead with confidence, which comes from and is also reflected by the robust health of the economy.
Emphasising that the nation is in the early years of Amrit Kaal, the period leading to the centenary of Independence, which is also the time of an epochal transformation, Murmu asked citizens to abide by fundamental duties enshrined in the Constitution.
""These duties are essential obligations of every citizen towards making Bharat a developed nation when it completes 100 years of independence. Here, I think of Mahatma Gandhi who had rightly said, 'No people have risen who thought only of rights. Only those did so who thought of duties'."" 	She said the period of Amrit Kaal is also going to be the period of unprecedented technological changes.
""Technological advances like Artificial Intelligence and machine learning have moved from headlines into our daily lives at a breathtaking speed. There are numerous areas of concern in the foreseeable future, but there are also exciting opportunities ahead, especially for the youth. They are exploring new frontiers,"" she said.
The president said we have to remove hurdles from the path of youth and let them unleash their full potential.
""What they want is equality of opportunity. What they want is not the same old rhetoric of equality, but the realisation of our cherished ideal of equality,"" she said.
Underlining the welfare schemes launched by the government, Murmu said the government has not only expanded and enhanced the welfare schemes, but it has also redefined the idea of welfare itself.
She  said there are reasons to believe that the extraordinary performance of the economy which recorded highest GDP growth among major economies will continue in the year 2024 and beyond.
Murmu said the same farsighted planning that fuels the economy has also given a push to the welfare drive to make the development inclusive in every sense of the term.
""The government had increased the scope of schemes to provide free food to the weaker sections of society during the pandemic days. These measures were later continued to extend a helping hand to the vulnerable population to come out of that crisis,"" she said.
Murmu said expanding the scope of that initiative, the government has decided to provide free food grains to over 81 crore people for five years which may be the biggest welfare initiative of its kind in history.
She said from the availability of safe and adequate drinking water at home to the security of having one's own home, there have been a number of mission-mode schemes to increase the ease of living for all citizens by catering to their basic minimum requirements, not privileges.
""These matters are beyond any political or economic ideology and must be seen from a humanitarian perspective. The government has not only expanded and enhanced the welfare schemes, but it has also redefined the idea of welfare itself,"" she said.
The president said it will be a proud day for us all when India becomes one of those few countries where homelessness is a rarity.
She said there have been a series of humanitarian tragedies on a large scale, and we feel aggrieved over the human suffering.
""Let us hope that the regions embroiled in conflicts will find a peaceful way to resolve conflicts and bring about peace,"" she said.
Murmu said the National Education Policy gives adequate thrust to bridge the digital divide and create a uniform educational structure for the benefit of the underprivileged students.
""The expanding insurance cover of the Ayushman Bharat scheme aims to bring together all beneficiaries under its umbrella and provides a great reassurance to the poor and the vulnerable,"" she said.
Invoking BR Ambedkar and his role in framing the Constitution, she said democracy implies diversity of culture, beliefs and practices. Celebrating diversity implies equality, which is upheld by justice.
""Freedom is what makes it all possible. The totality of these values and principles is what makes us Indian,"" Murmu said.
Calling former Bihar chief minister Karpoori Thakur, who was awarded the Bharat Ratna, a tireless champion of social justice, she said he was one of the greatest advocates of backward classes who dedicated his life for their welfare.
The president also lauded India's quest in space through Moon mission, Solar explorer Aditya L1, deep space probe X-ray Polarimeter Satellite called XPoSat, under preparation man-mission Gaganyaan and other technological milestones.
""We have always been proud of our scientists and technology experts, but now they are aiming far higher than before and delivering too. India's space programme is aimed at expanding and deepening the role of science and technology for the benefit of the entire humanity,"" she said.
Murmu said the nation has progressed further towards the ideal of gender equality, when the Parliament passed the historic Women's Reservation Bill.
""I believe the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam will prove to be a revolutionary tool of women's empowerment. It will also go a long way in improving the processes of our governance.
""When more women will be involved in matters of collective importance, our administrative priorities will be more in tune with the needs of the masses,"" she said."

Citing the teachings of Vardhaman Mahavir, Samrat Ashoka and Mahatma Gandhi, the president said let's hope that the regions embroiled in conflicts will find a peaceful way to resolve conflicts and bring about peace.
Referring to the recent consecration rituals of Lord Ram at the newly-constructed temple at Ayodhya, she said when this event will be seen in the wider perspective, the future historians will consider it a landmark in India's continued re-discovery of its civilisational heritage.
""The construction of the temple commenced after the due judicial process and the decision of the highest court of the land. Now it stands as a grand edifice, giving a befitting expression not only of people's faith but also as a testament to people's enormous trust in the judicial process,"" she said.
Murmu said the ""magnificent"" G20 Summit hosted by India provided lessons for all in making citizens participants in strategic and diplomatic matters that are, in the final analysis, going to shape their own future.
""The G20 Summit also boosted India's emergence as the voice of the Global South, adding a necessary element to the international discourse,"" she said.
Talking about the economy of the country, she said India is moving ahead with confidence, which comes from and is also reflected by the robust health of the economy.
Emphasising that the nation is in the early years of Amrit Kaal, the period leading to the centenary of Independence, which is also the time of an epochal transformation, Murmu asked citizens to abide by fundamental duties enshrined in the Constitution.
""These duties are essential obligations of every citizen towards making Bharat a developed nation when it completes 100 years of independence. Here, I think of Mahatma Gandhi who had rightly said, 'No people have risen who thought only of rights. Only those did so who thought of duties'."" 	She said the period of Amrit Kaal is also going to be the period of unprecedented technological changes.
""Technological advances like Artificial Intelligence and machine learning have moved from headlines into our daily lives at a breathtaking speed. There are numerous areas of concern in the foreseeable future, but there are also exciting opportunities ahead, especially for the youth. They are exploring new frontiers,"" she said.
The president said we have to remove hurdles from the path of youth and let them unleash their full potential.
""What they want is equality of opportunity. What they want is not the same old rhetoric of equality, but the realisation of our cherished ideal of equality,"" she said.
Underlining the welfare schemes launched by the government, Murmu said the government has not only expanded and enhanced the welfare schemes, but it has also redefined the idea of welfare itself.
She  said there are reasons to believe that the extraordinary performance of the economy which recorded highest GDP growth among major economies will continue in the year 2024 and beyond.
Murmu said the same farsighted planning that fuels the economy has also given a push to the welfare drive to make the development inclusive in every sense of the term.
""The government had increased the scope of schemes to provide free food to the weaker sections of society during the pandemic days. These measures were later continued to extend a helping hand to the vulnerable population to come out of that crisis,"" she said.
Murmu said expanding the scope of that initiative, the government has decided to provide free food grains to over 81 crore people for five years which may be the biggest welfare initiative of its kind in history.
She said from the availability of safe and adequate drinking water at home to the security of having one's own home, there have been a number of mission-mode schemes to increase the ease of living for all citizens by catering to their basic minimum requirements, not privileges.
""These matters are beyond any political or economic ideology and must be seen from a humanitarian perspective. The government has not only expanded and enhanced the welfare schemes, but it has also redefined the idea of welfare itself,"" she said.
The president said it will be a proud day for us all when India becomes one of those few countries where homelessness is a rarity.
She said there have been a series of humanitarian tragedies on a large scale, and we feel aggrieved over the human suffering.
""Let us hope that the regions embroiled in conflicts will find a peaceful way to resolve conflicts and bring about peace,"" she said.
Murmu said the National Education Policy gives adequate thrust to bridge the digital divide and create a uniform educational structure for the benefit of the underprivileged students.
""The expanding insurance cover of the Ayushman Bharat scheme aims to bring together all beneficiaries under its umbrella and provides a great reassurance to the poor and the vulnerable,"" she said.
Invoking BR Ambedkar and his role in framing the Constitution, she said democracy implies diversity of culture, beliefs and practices. Celebrating diversity implies equality, which is upheld by justice.
""Freedom is what makes it all possible. The totality of these values and principles is what makes us Indian,"" Murmu said.
Calling former Bihar chief minister Karpoori Thakur, who was awarded the Bharat Ratna, a tireless champion of social justice, she said he was one of the greatest advocates of backward classes who dedicated his life for their welfare.
The president also lauded India's quest in space through Moon mission, Solar explorer Aditya L1, deep space probe X-ray Polarimeter Satellite called XPoSat, under preparation man-mission Gaganyaan and other technological milestones.
""We have always been proud of our scientists and technology experts, but now they are aiming far higher than before and delivering too. India's space programme is aimed at expanding and deepening the role of science and technology for the benefit of the entire humanity,"" she said.
Murmu said the nation has progressed further towards the ideal of gender equality, when the Parliament passed the historic Women's Reservation Bill.
""I believe the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam will prove to be a revolutionary tool of women's empowerment. It will also go a long way in improving the processes of our governance.
""When more women will be involved in matters of collective importance, our administrative priorities will be more in tune with the needs of the masses,"" she said."

“The consecration of Shri Ram Mandir has catalysed a flourishing trade network across the country, generating an estimated business of Rs 1.25 lakh crore. Delhi witnessed trade worth approximately Rs 25,000 crore. This economic surge is attributed to the extensive programmes organised by the trading community nationwide,” CAIT said a statement.
CAIT secretary-general Praveen Khandelwal said “this unprecedented financial inflow is the result of faith-driven economy, involving small businesses and entrepreneurs”.
Khandelwal said this is a unique opportunity and called upon entrepreneurs and start-ups to explore novel dimensions in business.
He said the CAIT is planning to conduct a seminar in New Delhi soon to delve into the potential entrepreneurial avenues emerging from this trend.
Under the “Har Shahar Ayodhya-Har Ghar Ayodhya” campaign of the CAIT, more than 30,000 trade bodies organised over 1.5 lakh programmes across the country from January 1 to January 22.
The traders conducted shobha yatras, Ram pheris and devotional musical programmes.
Sale of merchandise, including Ram Mandir models, garlands, door decoration items, flags, caps, bangles, bindi, paintings, pictures of Shri Ram Darbar, pictures of the Ram Mandir reached unprecedented levels.
Sweets and dry fruits used as offerings, clay lamps, brass lamps and fire crackers were popular items during the sale. The trend of gifting Ram Mandir models to guests at weddings has already begun."

Saikia, in a memorandum to the Governor, alleged that the present state government under Himanta Biswa Sarma is creating ''serious administrative blockade and also resorted to unleashing unruly lumpens to sabotage the peaceful Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra by brute of physical force and criminal attack against our senior leaders."" 	During the yatra on Sunday, the vehicle carrying senior AICC leader Jairam Ramesh was forcefully stopped by supporters of the ruling BJP and they verbally abused him and tore the stickers on his car, he said.
Thereafter, at Jamugurihat, Bora was physically assaulted by BJP supporters leading to a bleeding nose while about 20-25 unruly people even targeted Rahul Gandhi and at various places even journalists were not spared, Saikia said.
The Congress MLA from Nazira alleged that the police personnel remained silent spectators from a safe distance.
''Even prior to these incidents, Sarma's BJP government has been using police and civil administration to disrupt the yatra. At the meeting grounds and during padyatras, anti-yatra posters and banners were displayed under the protection of Assam Police,"" he alleged.
The Congress leader said they had complained to the DGP but he tweeted that he had arranged for all kinds of protection during the yatra.
''This is, however, a blatant lie as no such arrangement is witnessed on the ground'', he said.
The Congress had applied for necessary permission for the yatra and completed formalities but the nervous state government has indulged in administrative delays to create all possible hurdles, Saikia alleged.
''In view of this serious law and order situation prevailing in Assam at present due to the lumpens of the ruling party, we have brought the matter to your kind attention and demand a judicial inquiry into the physical attack on our PCC president'', he added.

Domestic equities took a heavy beating as valuation concerns and tensions in the Red Sea saw the benchmark Sensex bleeding 1053.10 points and investor wealth eroding Rs 8.50 lakh crore.
This came after a Bloomberg report said India’s stock market overtook Hong Kong as the world’s fourth largest by market cap as of Monday close.
According to the news agency, the combined value of shares listed on Indian exchanges touched $4.33 trillion on Monday against $4.29 trillion for Hong Kong.
By the end of the day on Tuesday, Hong Kong may have pushed India back to the fifth spot in the market capitalisation pecking order.
It was on December 5 last year that the market cap of India had crossed the $4 trillion mark.
In trading on Tuesday, even as the Sensex tanked 1.47 per cent, the Hang Seng shot up 2.63 per cent or by 392.80 points.
Due to the nearly across-the-board fall, the market capitalisation of all BSE-listed companies tanked Rs 8.50 lakh crore to Rs 365.9 lakh crore.
While the domestic markets were closed on Monday due to the consecration ceremony at Ayodhya’s Ram temple which is forecast to see huge religious tourism, equities on Monday began on a good note amid positive tidings from the event and not too adverse global conditions.
The 30-share Sensex soon advanced 615.55 points to cross the 72000 mark and touch a day’s high of 72039.20 in early morning trade. However, things started going south after 10am as selling set in and it only intensified towards noon.
Analysts said that factors such as expensive valuations, mixed set of results and hostilities in the Red Sea due to the Houthi attacks sparked the selling.
Investors were also spooked by a BMI report which said that South Asian economies could be the most affected due to the tensions in the Red Sea.
The Fitch arm said that India’s economic forecast faces a significant risk in the event of a prolonged spell of disruptions.
China race
Analysts said Indian markets are in a stronger position than China as Chinese and Hong Kong stocks have been pummelled heavily with their market capitalisation crashing more than $6 trillion since their peaks in 2021.
Chinese authorities are now considering measures to stabilise a slumping market, Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Policymakers are seeking to mobilise about 2 trillion yuan ($278.53 billion), mainly from offshore accounts of state-owned enterprises, as part of a stabilisation fund to buy shares onshore through the Hong Kong exchange.
China’s stock markets have had a wretched start to the year, with patchy economic growth and a renewed slump in home sales last week.
Global money managers — who have been sellers of Chinese stocks as the post-pandemic recovery sputtered — said it would take a long time or major stimulus to repair the property sector, which at one time accounted for a quarter of the economy, and change their minds.

Justice Subhash Chand has mentioned the replies of Yudhisthira against the questions of the Yaksha God. The “father is higher than heaven” is one of the statements of the eldest Pandava brother in the Mahabharata.
A 60-year-old man, Deoki Sao, had filed a petition before the Family Court in Koderma seeking maintenance from his younger son Manoj Sao. The court directed him to pay Rs 3000 per month to his elderly father.
Claiming that his father is money-minded and has several sources of income, Manoj filed a criminal revision in the high court challenging the order of the Family Court.
Deoki Sao, who lives with his elder son, equally divided the agricultural land he owned between his two sons.
Justice Chand observed that it is the duty of a son to look after his parents.
The court order said: “In Mahabharat, the Yaksh asked to Yudhisthira: ‘What is weightier than the earth itself? What is higher than the heavens?’ Yudhisthira answered: ‘The mother is weightier than the earth; the father is higher than the heaven.” 	Even if for the sake of argument, the father earns something; it is pious duty of a son to maintain his old aged father, Justice Chand observed in the order.
He also quoted from a scripture: “Father is your God and Mother is your Nature. They are the seed you are the Sapling.” 	While deciding the case, the court dismissed the petition filed by Manoj and upheld the order of the Family Court directing him to pay Rs 3,000 a month to his father.
In an earlier order involving a distraught wife seeking maintenance from her husband, Justice Chand cited religious texts.
Quoting from a judgment of the apex court, Justice Chand stated that a wife is expected to be with her husband's family after marriage, unless there is a strong justifiable reason for separation.
He also used excerpts from the Rigveda, Yajurveda and Manusmriti in the order.

“It's an understatement to say I’m disappointed that Greta and Margot were not nominated in their respective categories. Their work should be recognised along with the other very deserving nominees,” the La La Land actor said in a statement issued after the nominations for the 2024 Oscars ended on Tuesday.
Gosling, who himself got nominated for playing Ken in the film, went on to underline the significance of Gerwig and Robbie’s contributions to the success of the Barbie movie. “I am so happy and honored to be nominated, especially for portraying a plastic doll named Ken. But there is no Ken without Barbie, and there is no Barbie movie without Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, the two people most responsible for this history-making, globally-celebrated film,” he said.
The actor also expressed his joy for co-star America Ferrera, who received a nomination for best supporting actress for her portrayal of Gloria in the film.
Highlighting Gerwig and Robbie’s contribution in pushing the cultural boundaries of filmmaking, the La La Land actor also mentioned how the entire movie was crafted only with a couple of plastic dolls. “Gerwig and Robbie managed to create a movie that not only made audiences laugh and broke their hearts but also pushed the cultural boundaries, making history in the process,” he signed off.
Though absent from the Best Director category, Gerwig secured a nod alongside her husband, Noah Baumbach, for best adapted screenplay. Similarly, Margot Robbie missed out on a Best Actress nomination but received recognition for her role as a producer in the Best Picture category.
The 2024 Oscars ceremony is scheduled to take place on March 10 at the iconic Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles."

Gandhi later addressed party supporters on the outskirts of the city, and said, ""We have broken barricades, but will not break the law"".
The police, which had set up barricades at two places to prevent the Yatra from entering the city limits, had to use force to stop the Congress workers, reports PTI.
Gandhi was earlier accorded a boisterous welcome as he tried to enter Guwahati and addressed some varsity students on the way.
Addressing supporters, he said while BJP president J P Nadda took the same route, they were not allowed to travel on it.
""You should not think we are weak. We have broken the barricades,"" he told his workers and supporters, calling them ""babbar sher"" (lion).
""They have cancelled my programme at the university. My programme was cancelled, but the students heard me outside,"" he said.
""Congress workers do not fear anyone,"" he said, adding that ""we will defeat the BJP in Assam and form the Congress government soon."" 	He also lauded the police for doing their job well.
""We know that police officers have done a good job and followed orders, with one person coming and lying down before the (yatra) bus. We are not against you. We are against the chief minister who is most corrupt. Our fight is with him,"" Gandhi said.
He said policemen were also clapping on his speech but hastened to add that they should not.
""We have won as we have broken the barricades,"" AICC in-charge for Assam Jitendra Singh said.
Gandhi later proceeded from the designated route on the ring road.
Earlier, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had asserted that the Yatra would not be permitted to enter the city to avert potential traffic congestion. Despite this, large crowds gathered at the Guwahati Chowk in Khanapara, warmly welcoming Gandhi with spirited slogans and drum beats.
Leaders of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) had announced that the yatra led by Rahul Gandhi had decided to traverse the Guwahati bypass on Tuesday. However, the Assam government has denied permission to proceed through the main routes within Guwahati city.
The Congress said that Guwahati police asked them to take the yatra through NH27 (Khanapara- Jayanagar- Basistha- Gorchuk- Lokhra route). Bedabrata Bora, spokesperson for Assam PCC, stated, according to news reports, ""It has been decided to abandon the plan of taking the 'Nyay Yatra' through the main routes of Guwahati. The police are not allowing us. Now, we will gather at Khanapara for a protest meeting, and subsequently, the yatra will move towards the Lower Assam district through the Guwahati bypass.""
The Yatra, which entered Meghalaya on Monday, returned to Assam for its last leg. The plan, sources said, was to travel through the outskirts of the state's largest city Guwahati. But now it is uncertain. The Yatra is scheduled to be in Assam till Thursday.
On Monday, Rahul Gandhi was stopped from visiting Batadrava Than owing to “issues related to his security”. The day witnessed competing narratives of the Right-wing ecosystem and the Congress over the Ram temple consecration play out “peacefully” on the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra route in two central Assam districts of Nagaon and Morigaon.
Police said Rahul was not allowed to go because of a letter written by the Sri Sri Batadrava Than Parichalana Committee, which wanted him to visit after 3pm because a lot of devotees were expected there on the occasion of the Ram temple consecration.
Sources said a group of local youths had arranged a live screening of the Ram temple’s inaugural ceremony outside the Than. A lot of people were also expected to turn up to see Rahul. They said the Than committee did not want any kind of misunderstanding between the two groups.
The Congress brass had turned down the invite to the Ayodhya temple inauguration, prompting the Right-wing ecosystem to term them “anti-Hindu”.
Rahul tried to make it to the birthplace of saint-reformer Srimanta Sankardeva to pay his homage by reaching Haiborgaon around 8.25am but ran into barricades put up by the police."

The dispatch of such balloons, which generally disappear into the Pacific to the east, appears to be on the rise, though their purpose has not been publicly announced.
The Defence Ministry noted the balloon sightings on a list of Chinese People's Liberation Army activity in the waters and airspace around Taiwan. One passed near the southern city of Pingtung, while the others flew just north of the port of Keelung, where Taiwan has an important naval base.
It remains unclear whether the balloons have an explicit military function, but they appear to be part of a campaign of harassment against the the self-governed island, which China claims as its own territory and has vowed to reclaim by force if necessary.
In the US early last year, President Joe Biden vowed sharper rules to track, monitor and potentially shoot down unknown aerial objects after a three-week drama sparked by the discovery of a suspected Chinese spy balloon transiting much of the United States.
The US labelled the balloon a military craft and shot it down with a missile. It recovered what it said was sophisticated surveillance equipment. China responded angrily, saying it was only a weather balloon that had blown off course and called its downing a major overreaction.
Those are sometimes referred to as China's “gray area tactics” that cause consternation among its foes without sparking a direct confrontation. China has long blurred the lines between military and civilian functions, including in the South China Sea, where it operates a huge maritime militia — ostensibly civilian fishing boats that act under government orders to assert Beijing's territorial claims.
China's campaign of intimidation against Taiwan includes the regular deployment of Chinese warships and planes in waters and airspace around the island, often crossing the middle line of the 160-kilometre-wide Taiwan Strait that divides them. The two split following the seizure of power by Mao Zedong's Communists on the Chinese mainland.
Between Sunday and early Monday morning, four Chinese warplanes and four navy ships were detected around Taiwan, the Defence Ministry said. Taiwan's military monitored the situation with combat aircraft, navy vessels and land-based missile systems, the ministry said.
In the leadup to Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections January 13, China had been stepping up such activities, along with its rhetorical threats, though Beijing's threats are generally seen as backfiring.
The independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won a third straight term in the presidency, this time under current Vice President Lai Ching-te, or William Lai. The pro-unification Nationalist Party won just one more seat in the legislature than the DPP.
Both saw some votes siphoned away by the party of former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, who appealed especially to young people fed up with politics as they are."

A bench of Justices B.R. Gavai, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta allowed Chakraborty’s plea for the withdrawal of the SLP made through his counsel without citing any specific reason.
Now, only the appeal filed by NewsClick founder Prabir Purkayastha will be heard on January 30.
When the matter came up for hearing, additional solicitor-general S.V. Raju, appearing for Delhi police through video-conferencing, told the bench that the prosecution had no objection to the withdrawal of the SLP. “Let him withdraw the appeal, we have no objection,” Raju told the court.
Sections 306 and 307 of the CrPC provide an opportunity to an accused to become an “approver” or a witness for the prosecution. In such an event, the court can either grant a full “pardon” or a lesser punishment to the approver."
NAU8E20NJ6_U9BSMEW140W481G,"We are tough guys, we can handle it: Rahul on attack by BJP workers on Assam Congress chief","Sanjay K. Jha New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 06:47 AM","Sanjay K. Jha New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 06:47 AM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/we-are-tough-guys-we-can-handle-it-rahul-gandhi-on-attack-by-bjp-workers-on-assam-congress-chief/cid/1995772,"Rahul Gandhi isn’t a crybaby. Unlike Narendra Modi who imagines constant threats to his life, hypes up minor irritants and seldom misses out on playing the victim card, Rahul’s demeanour in the face of vicious and consistent attacks from the Sangh ecosystem has been: We are tough guys, we can handle it!
Rahul hasn’t only demonstrated exceptional will and courage in his public interactions, walking and jostling with unregulated crowds of thousands of people during his Yatras, he has also been open to taking questions from audiences the world over, visited troubled spots like Manipur, and remained calm in adversity — from shocking electoral losses to expulsion from Parliament.
While the ongoing Nyay Yatra has faced several violent attacks from BJP workers and threats from the Assam chief minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, he hasn't been rattled. Asked about the attacks at a media conference on Tuesday, Rahul smiled and said, “I don’t get intimidated. Threaten me, Abuse me, hit me… I am not scared.” He held the bandaged hand of his state unit chief Bhupen Borah and said, “He got injured but that’s okay. We are tough guys, we can handle it.”
The Assam Congress chief was given a bloody nose by anti-Congress hooligans a couple of days ago. That would have been enough for any leader to create a huge fuss. But Rahul kept his focus on real concerns of the people, discussing unemployment and prices, instead of indulging in any chest-thumping victimhood. He had shrugged off serious security threats in Kashmir during his Bharat Jodo Yatra and walked through militant-infested areas last year.
This equanimity is in sharp contrast to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tendency to create hype around any unpleasant situation. In January 2022, he told security men in Punjab when some farmers had blocked a flyover that he was supposed to take: “Apne CM ko thanks kehna, ki mein Bathinda airport tak zinda laut paaya (Say thanks to your CM that I was able to return to Bathinda airport alive).” He abandoned his trip and returned to Delhi even though there was no attack and he was fully secure under SPG cover.
It is difficult to count how many times reports about threats to Modi’s life have surfaced since he became chief minister of Gujarat in 2002.
Modi has on several occasions publicly complained that Opposition leaders insult him, reeling out a list of abuses, and even exploited statements of minor functionaries, emotionally telling people that Congressmen want him dead. During the Gujarat Assembly elections in 2017, he went so far as to accuse former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, former Vice-President Hamid Ansari and top retired defence officers and bureaucrats of plotting to unseat him using Pakistani help. The BJP was forced to apologise in Parliament for this false accusation.
Victim of a nasty propaganda campaign that portrayed him as a Pappu, Rahul succeeded in shaking off that false tag by pulling off what no politician in the world has achieved — walking over 4,000km from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, and freely mingling with millions of people on the way, often shrugging off high-security risks that tail him and his family. While his father Rajiv Gandhi was blown to pieces by an LTTE suicide squad during one such public interaction in Tamil Nadu in 1991, security personnel shot his grandmother Indira Gandhi to death at the prime ministerial residence in 1984.
Rahul has remained extraordinarily composed in the face of vicious campaigns based on lies, half-truths, doctored videos and unsubstantiated allegations. He once said the BJP had spent thousands of crores to ruin his image but he didn’t care as truth would triumph in the end.
Two days ago, when angry BJP workers were protesting against him in Assam, Rahul got off the bus to interact with them instead of running away. He has shown a consistent will to face the truth, even if uncomfortable, rather than relying on escapism.
Modi, on the other hand, has not ever faced questions from the media, or enlightened audiences. Unlike Rahul, there are no videos available of Modi’s meaningful conversation with global leaders and intellectuals. During the 2019 election campaign, Rahul repeatedly dared Modi to have a debate but to no avail. Modi, projected as a powerful speaker, had the opportunity to maul a rival often berated as a poor speaker, but he didn’t accept the challenge.
Another comparison being made in political circles is over the nature of public outings of the two leaders. While Rahul shares space with all Congress leaders, Modi chooses to remain alone. Rahul’s bonhomie with senior leaders of all the states during the Bharat Jodo Yatra was widely remarked upon, while Modi’s solo show at the G20 summit attracted national attention. The perception is that Modi doesn’t like anybody else in the frame while Rahul naturally merges with people.
Even in the once-in-a-lifetime ceremony of the Ram temple inauguration in Ayodhya, top BJP leaders Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari were missing; as were L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, two chief actors of the Ramjanmabhoomi movement."

The MLA, who left the ED office in South Mumbai around 10 pm, told reporters that he was cooperating with the agency which has called him again for questioning on February 1.
Earlier, NCP MP Supriya Sule and other party leaders accompanied the 38-year-old legislator as he arrived at the central agency's office at Ballard Estate around 10.30 am.
Before going to the probe agency's office, Rohit Pawar went to the NCP office's located nearby and met Sharad Pawar, touched his feet, and also interacted with other party leaders.
He also visited the Vidhan Bhavan and paid tributes at the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and a plaque of the Indian Constitution.
Before Rohit Pawar entered the ED office, Sule handed him over a copy of the Indian Constitution.
She hugged him and he touched her feet before entering the probe agency's office.
Sule was also present when Rohit Pawar stepped out of the ED office late at night, and greeted party workers.
He later headed for the NCP office where Sharad Pawar was present.
""I have cooperated with the investigation, and will continue to do so. I have been called again on February 1,"" the MLA told reporters.
In a veiled dig at his uncle and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, he said some people ""ran away to be in power.""  Sharad pawar was fighting for the ""self-respect of the state and Marathi people,"" Rohit added.
Hundreds of NCP workers, who have come here from across the state, gathered at the party office in South Mumbai. They raised slogans in support of Rohit Pawar and staged a protest against the ED.
""The officers are doing their job, whatever documents they have demanded, we have given to them. I will appear before them and whatever information they are asking I will give them,"" the NCP MLA from Karjat Jamkhed had said earlier in the day before entering the ED office.
The Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank money laundering case stems from an August 2019 FIR of the Mumbai Police’s Economic Offences Wing.
The ED conducted searches on January 5 at the premises of Baramati Agro, a company owned by Rohit Pawar, and some linked entities in Baramati, Pune, Aurangabad and some other locations.
The case was filed after the Bombay High Court issued an order to investigate the allegations of sale of sugar factories in the Maharashtra cooperative sector through alleged fraudulent means and at throwaway prices.

Sandra’s defence (Swann Arlaud) argues it is an accidental fall, while the prosecution suggests she murdered Samuel out of jealousy. The trial reveals Sandra's past affair and her tendency to weave personal conflicts into her novels. Daniel (Milo Machado Graner), their son, becomes a key witness.

Balaji New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 04:58 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/umar-khalids-bail-plea-to-supreme-court-hits-adjournment-wall-for-the-seventh-time/cid/1995974,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday for the seventh consecutive time postponed the bail plea of Umar Khalid, the former JNU student leader who had been in custody for nearly three years after being arrested under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in connection with the 2020 Delhi riots.
The matter will now be heard on January 31. A bench of Justice Bela M. Trivedi and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan adjourned the matter when it came up for hearing around 1pm on the ground that the bench would sit in a different combination post-lunch.
Khalid is seeking bail on grounds of parity with the other co-accused — Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha — who have been released.
Additionally, Khalid has filed a separate petition challenging the constitutional validity of the UAPA.
Senior advocate C.U. Singh, who appeared for Khalid, told the bench on Wednesday: “We are prepared, unfortunately this bench is rising after lunch. It’s a bail application.”
However, Justice Trivedi said the bench would sit in a different combination post-lunch. The court said in a brief order: “List on January 31, high on the board.”
At the last hearing on January 10, Khalid’s bail plea had been adjourned to January 24, which was the sixth such adjournment in a row. On January 10, the bench of Justices Trivedi and Pankaj Mithal had warned that no further adjournment would be granted.
The bench on January 10 had minced no words in expressing displeasure over the repeated adjournments, pointing out that the delay in the hearing was on account of the failure of the respective parties to argue the matter, but an impression was gaining ground that the court was not hearing it.
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Khalid, had sought adjournment by a week since he was engaged in a seven-judge constitution bench matter dealing with the minority status of Aligarh Muslim University. On Wednesday, Sibal was busy with the same constitution bench matter.
“You please argue the case, we are not going to adjourn the matter. We can’t grant you any exemption,” Justice Trivedi, heading the bench, had told Sibal at the last hearing.
Besides Khalid’s bail plea, the court was on Wednesday scheduled to take up a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the UAPA, which critics complain is being increasingly used against political opponents and journalists by parties in power.
Khalid’s bail plea had been adjourned during a hearing on November 29, 2023, as well. A bench of Justices Trivedi and Satish Chandra had done so upon a joint request made by counsels appearing on behalf of senior advocate Sibal, representing Khalid, and additional solicitor-general S.V. Raju, representing the Delhi police.
While Raju at that time was stated to be indisposed, Sibal was engaged in other courts when the matter came up for hearing.
Justice Trivedi wanted to hear the matter again on December 6, 2023, but since Sibal was not available on that date, it was adjourned to January 10.
Repeated adjournments are not uncommon."
NSIBRD3NOK_XFA473HZEWZ0A9B,Border Roads Organisation to fence major portion of India-Myanmar border,"PTI Guwahati Published 25.01.24, 01:37 PM","PTI Guwahati Published 25.01.24, 01:37 PM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/border-roads-organisation-to-fence-major-portion-of-india-myanmar-border/cid/1996102,"The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) will fence a major portion of the strategic India-Myanmar border, and a 10-km stretch in Manipur has already been covered, a senior official said.
The Ministry of Home Affairs has identified around 1,700 km of fencing that needs to be done, BRO’s Additional Director General (East) PKH Singh said.
The organisation has already finished fencing 10 km along the border in Manipur’s Moreh, which was handed over to the Assam Rifles, Singh told PTI in an interview.
Union Home Minister Amit Shah recently said the Centre has decided that the India-Myanmar border will be protected by barbed fencing like the India-Bangladesh border, and the government was rethinking the free movement agreement with Myanmar.
Four Indian states – Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram – share a 1,643-km border with Myanmar.
Singh said the next 80-km stretch in Manipur has also been identified and the detailed project report (DPR) submitted to the ministry.
Fencing the remaining 250 km, along with its approach roads, is in the planning stage with the DPR under preparation.
“The fencing of the India-Myanmar border is an important project for the BRO, which is now coming up in Moreh. The area around this border has been unfenced since long, and there was a need to check the activities around it,” the ADG said.
Singh said the BRO has a long-term roll-out plan of nearly Rs 30,000 crore in the northeast over the next five years, and out of this, almost two-thirds is focused in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.
The organisation was earlier involved in fencing the India-Bangladesh border along with the BSF, he said.

NTIUDGTH07_ZP0CL6CVS0DQTS7,The easier option,"Arghya Sengupta Published 24.01.24, 06:38 AM","Arghya Sengupta Published 24.01.24, 06:38 AM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/opinion/the-easier-option-dissecting-the-supreme-courts-ruling-on-article-370/cid/1995779,"It has barely been a month and a half since the judgment of the Supreme Court upholding the nullification of Article 370. Yet, it feels as if the judgment has already become a footnote in the relentless pursuit of the complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir into the rest of India. Politically, the refrain from August 2019 itself has been to ‘move on’, not squabble over historical constructs like ‘special status’ but chart a future for J&K that is peaceful, progressive and prosperous. Reduced terror incidents, increased tourist numbers and a cleaner Dal Lake have all been cited as evidence of such a future. While ‘moving on’ may have an instinctive appeal, it cannot cloud a dispassionate adjudication of the legality of Article 370. Yet, a careful reading of the judgment authored by the Chief Justice of India leads to the inescapable conclusion that this is precisely what has happened.
In recent times, there has been commentary on the CJI in reference to his visit to the Dwarkadhish temple in a saffron kurta and some comments he made there. This column might be mischaracterised as being in the same boat. That would be a mistake. Neither should a visit to a temple nor the donning of a saffron kurta by a CJI demonstrate his implied support for any political party, let alone an ideology. Let us not become a superficial country where one is not known by the content of one’s character but the colour of one’s kurta.
What is of greater concern than his sartorial choices or spiritual inclinations is that the reasoning employed by him in the Article 370 judgment is conceptually and logically dubious, with significant ramifications for the future of India as a federal democracy. The basic premise of the Supreme Court’s view that the nullification of Article 370 was valid is that the Article was “introduced with the purpose of enhancing constitutional integration and not disintegration.” That is why, the nullification of Article 370, which is the apogee of integration, making J&K just another part of India, fulfils this constitutional purpose.
The judgment makes a category mistake regarding this basic premise. Article 370 was a placeholder provision inserted into the Constitution because there was no substantive agreement between the leaders in Srinagar and New Delhi on the contours of the relationship between J&K and India. Till such agreement could be drawn up, Article 370 would function as a stop-gap. It had one overriding objective — all decisions relating to governance in the state would be taken collectively by the people of J&K represented by their government on the one hand and the people of India represented by the president on the other. If Article 370 had a fundamental purpose, it was neither integration nor disintegration with India but rather a scheme of collaborative decision-making. Contrary to this scheme, the actions of August 5 and 6, 2019, nullifying Article 370, despite the veneer of consulting the state (under president’s rule, those functions were being performed by Parliament) were unilateral actions by the Indian Parliament.
The court not only upheld such unilateral action but, in a twist of logic, also said that the Article fully authorised the president to act unilaterally. Consider the plain words of the Article on when the president can issue a notification to abrogate or nullify Article 370 — “Provided that the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly referred to in Clause (2) shall be necessary before the President issues such a notification.”
To anyone reading the Article, the word, “necessary”, signifies that the president cannot move ahead without a recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of J&K. In fact, this is how the Government of India interpreted the provision as well, moving to amend the requirement of recommendation by the Constituent Assembly with that of the state legislature. But the court, in two moves, found this recommendation to not be necessary. First, it said that the recommendation would not be binding on the president. Second, if the recommendation is made mandatory, it would lead to the freezing of the provision because no Constituent Assembly exists.
On the first ground, the court is right. But just because a recommendation is not binding does not mean that it should not be taken. If this logic were to be followed by the government when it receives recommendations from the collegium to select judges to the Supreme Court, then there is no need for the government to take collegium recommendations in the first place. The court should be careful in laying down propositions of law which might come back to haunt it later.
On the second ground, the provision could be made workable in a number of different ways despite the absence of the Constituent Assembly. As the government was trying, the Constituent Assembly could be replaced by the legislative assembly of J&K. Alternatively, there could be a new Constituent Assembly established in J&K for this purpose. Both of these are theoretical possibilities. Authorising the president to act unilaterally, flying in the face of the plain text of the Article and its stated intention, was not the only way to prevent a redundancy. The judgment is logically wrong on this ground.
What is most disappointing in this otherwise scholarly judgment is its reluctance to limit the powers of the president under president’s rule. While the court is right that the Constitution gives the president wide, untrammelled powers of the state government, all these powers are with a view to restore governance in the state.
But under the guise of restoring governance, can the state itself be fundamentally altered, partitioned and converted into two Union territories? If yes, should the government not have to show that no other alternative remained to bring back constitutional government to the state? By not requiring any standard of review worth the name, the court has ended up giving a free pass to future Union governments to ride roughshod over recalcitrant state governments. One may dismiss this as theoretical today but constitutional precedents have a way of springing back to life when one least expects them.
There may be a tendency to see this judgment by the CJI as a continuum stretching back to his judgment in the Ayodhya matter and, more recently, to his comparisons between the Hindu tradition and the Constitution. But that would be entirely reductionist and greatly disrespectful to an outstanding judge for over two decades. Even for such an outstanding judge, turning the clock back four years on such a sensitive matter was always going to be difficult. Moving on presented an easier alternative. As B.R. Ambedkar said in the Constituent Assembly, “but after all, the Chief Justice is a man with all the failings, all the sentiments and all the prejudices which we as common people have…” Chief Justice Chandrachud after all, is human. He will author better judgments and have better days. One hopes J&K will see better days too.

The accused also assumed that they would be let off even if they were arrested, thinking they were not committing any ""serious crime"", they said.
According to a senior police officer, the mastermind is suspected to be Manoranjan D, who had created a 'Bhagat Singh Fan Club' page on the social networking site Facebook and used it to motivate ""like-minded"" people to do ""something big"" for fame.
""The accused were known to each other for the last four years but the plan to breach parliament was hatched a year ago,"" the officer said.
However, not everyone in the fan club was on board with the idea of doing anything illegal like breaching parliament's security. As a result, several other members had left in the days leading to the December 13 incident, police said.
""Since Manoranjan had access to the BJP MP in Mysore, he decided to barge into parliament and replicate freedom fighter Bhagat Singh's act which was done in the Delhi Assembly during British rule,"" another officer said.
""They did not have enough money to hold in-person meetings, therefore they decided to remain in touch through social media and Signals app,"" the official said.
""Because of the shortage of money, they stayed at Vicky Sharma's residence in Gurugram before committing the crime on December 13, 2023,"" he said.
Vicky Sharma was also a part of the fan club on Facebook. He was released after being questioned by police.
During investigations, Manoranjan and Sagar Sharma -- who jumped into the gallery of parliament -- told investigators that there were fewer security personnel at the new parliament building as compared to the old one.
Manoranjan also told police that he carried out a reconnaissance of the old building during the monsoon session.
In a major security breach on the anniversary of the 2001 Parliament terror attack on December 13, Sagar Sharma and Manoranjan D jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber from the public gallery during the Zero Hour, released yellow gas from canisters and shouted slogans before being overpowered by the MPs.
Around the same time, two other accused -- Shinde and Azad -- also sprayed coloured gas from canisters while shouting ""tanashahi nahi chalegi"" outside the Parliament premises.
The two others Lalit Jha and Mahesh Kumawat had surrendered before the Delhi Police, a day after the incident. They had allegedly destroyed the mobile phones of self and other four accused in Rajasthan.
All the six accused have been booked under the stringent UAPA and criminal conspiracy by the Delhi Police's anti-terror unit, Special Cell.
Last, month the Delhi Police had conducted their polygraph, narco-analysis and brain mapping tests in Gujarat, to ascertain the exact reason of their act.
The accused had that they they were upset over the issues of unemployment, the Manipur crisis and farmers' agitation.

The bench of Justice Biswajit Basu also asked the WBBSE to inform it about the decision on Thursday, when the matter will be heard again.
The timing of the class 10 examinations of the West Bengal board, which will be held in February, was advanced by two hours, but no reason was cited. After the revision, the exams will begin at 9.45 am instead of the usual 11.45 am.
A teacher moved the court challenging a January 18 notification of the board rescheduling the time of commencement of the examination from 11.45 am to 9.45 am, claiming that it will inconvenience lakhs of students who will be appearing for the examinations at numerous centres across the state.
The petitioner submitted that with the examination scheduled to begin from February 2, such advancement of timing will affect the examinees.
He also stated that a decision on a January 19 representation to the president of the board seeking cancellation of the change in schedule is pending.
The court asked what prompted the WBBSE to change the timing for commencement of the examination from 11.45 am, a practice for years, to 9.45 am.
The state's counsel submitted that class 10 final examinations of several other boards begin at 10 am.
He said that all district magistrates have been asked to make special arrangements for transport and other facilities for the Madhyamik (class 10 board exam) examinees.
The board said that the first 15 minutes would be for reading the questions and students can start writing the answers from 10 am.
Stating that the court is only concerned about the convenience of the students, Justice Basu said he personally knows students who come from remote areas have to travel long distances to reach examination centres.
The examinations are held at schools other than the institution where an examinee studied.

On Monday night, a group of FTII students had arranged the screening of Anand Patwardhan’s documentary Ram Ke Naam, which traces the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.
According to a media release issued by the FTII Students Association (FTIISA), around 25 people entered the campus at 1.30pm on Tuesday, started chanting “Jai Shri Ram” and hurled abuses at the students.
FTIISA president Mankap Nokwoham, secretary Sayantan and some female students were allegedly beaten up. Mankap sustained multiple bruises. The security guards allegedly stood silent as the mob continued its rampage on the campus and reached the “wisdom tree”. Once police arrived, the mob started to disengage and the security guards took them back to the main gate. The cops allowed them to go.
“Innocent students were grievously attacked by these goons who barged into our campus while the security and staff were mere spectators. It is a blatant attack on the fundamental right to life of the students and a grave failure of law and order. FTII Students Association strongly stands against such a dire attack on our democratic rights as well as the lives of students,” said the media statement.
Patwardhan told The Telegraph that the Right-wing forces were attacking students on campuses where his documentary was being screened.
“In the last two days, there have been three incidents of attacks on students and organisers for screening the film Ram Ke Naam. It is an award-winning film and its screening cannot be stopped legally. The Right-wing forces have resorted to vandalism,” he said.
“The Right-wing forces do not want history to be told to the people. They want only Modi’s activities to be propagated,” he added.
In Kerala, CPM youth wing Democratic Youth Federation of India on Tuesday decided to screen Ram Ke Naam after Sangh Parivar activists tried to stop its screening by students of a film institute.
Students of K.R. Narayanan National Institute of Visual Science and Arts had originally scheduled the screening of the 1992 documentary at 7pm just outside the main gate of the facility in Kottayam on Monday. Sangh Parivar activists allegedly threatened to harm the students if they went ahead with the screening, prompting police to step in and defuse the tension.
The students eventually moved the screen within the campus and showed the documentary. “The Sangh Parivar activists openly threatened to chop our limbs and used misogynistic comments and actions against our female students,” the institute’s students’ council chairperson, Sreedevan K. Perumal, told The Telegraph on Tuesday.
The DYFI on Tuesday decided to screen the documentary everywhere in the state and even help anyone who wants to screen it.
V.K. Sanoj, the DYFI’s Kerala state secretary, told reporters: “The DYFI will not only withstand any threat from the Sangh Parivar but will also screen Ram Ke Naam across the state and help anyone wanting to screen it.” Sanoj added."

Later in the evening, the external affairs ministry rejected the charge and said Pakistan was reaping what it had sown. Billing the accusation as Pakistan’s latest attempt at peddling false and malicious anti-India propaganda, the Ministry’s official spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said: ``As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicentre of terrorism, organised crime, and illegal transnational activities.
India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence. Pakistan will reap what it sows. To blame others for its own misdeeds can neither be a justification nor a solution.”
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Qazi presented what he described as ``details of a sophisticated and sinister Indian campaign of extra-territorial and extra-judicial killings inside Pakistan’’. According to him, these are ""killings for hire’’ cases involving sophisticated international set-up spread over multiple jurisdictions.
``Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan. They recruited, financed and supported criminals, terrorists and unsuspecting civilians to play defined roles in these assassinations. Indian media and social media accounts immediately claimed and glorified these killings as successful retribution against enemies of India and projected their capacity to carry out these illegal acts,’’ the foreign secretary said.
At today’s press conference, Qazi shared details of two cases and said that a few more similar cases are under investigation. One of the two cases related to Shahid Latif, said to be a close aide of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar, who was killed in Sialkot on October 11, 2023. The second case pertains to Muhammad Riaz, an LeT agent, who was gunned down in Rawalakot on September 8, 2023.
According to the foreign secretary, these cases fit the pattern of similar cases which have come to light in other countries including Canada and the U.S.; referring to the accusation made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of an Indian hand in the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia and the U.S. Justice Department case of a plot to murder Sikhs of Justice leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannu in which an Indian government agent is alleged to have hired a person in New York to carry out the hitjob."

The Bordowa Than management committee joined chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in asking Rahul to postpone his visit till late afternoon, but the Congress remained firm about it taking place on Monday morning.
Tempers ran high on the Yatra route in Sonitpur district, with attacks on senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh’s car and on state Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah.
Borah, waving his blood-stained handkerchief at a meeting after the attack, said: “We will fight. We gave our blood today, we will give our life if needed.”
He said BJP goons had ""attacked"" him when he tried to stop an assault on the Yatra bus. A Congress worker, Hridaya Das, was injured, a party leader said.
A Congress leader from Sonitpur district has lodged a police complaint over the attack on Borah. The police said they had started a probe.
Chief minister Sarma has asked the police to probe the attack on Ramesh’s vehicle.
Sometime before the attack, Sarma, addressing a media conference in Guwahati, requested Rahul to go to Bordowa Than (in Nagaon district) after 2pm, by when the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya would be over.
“I will request Rahul Gandhi... he can go to Batadrava (Bordowa) Than tomorrow but it should not happen like there is a competition between the Ram temple and Batadrava,” the chief minister said.
“We will feel good or else there will be two windows on TV. We cannot stop anyone from going but those two windows on TV will go against the image of Assam. One side of the TV will show the Ram temple consecration and the other Batadrava.”
He added: “There is no competition (between the two places) and he (Rahul) should not come and create that competition.... There should be no double window (on TV). That will be very sad for the people of Assam.”
Sarma said it pained him that Rahul had chosen to go to Bordowa on Monday, and also pass through Jagiroad and Morigaon, which are “all sensitive places”.
“They should have avoided these places. I will not ask them officially because they will create a tamasha. Police will be deployed, and we will ensure that there is no conflict or clashes because in their Yatra a particular community comes out (an allusion to the ‘Miya’ or Bengali Muslim community),” he said.
“I am feeling a little perturbed why Rahul Gandhi deliberately chose Morigaon district where the 1983 Nellie massacre took place. He should have avoided Morigaon and Jagiroad because of the Nellie massacre.... From the law-and-order point of view, it should have been avoided. I would have been happy.”
A large number of Bengali-speaking Muslims were killed during the Nellie massacre.
Sarma made two requests of Rahul. “If you can avoid Morigaon, Nagaon and Jagiroad tomorrow, it will be good. They could have taken rest for one day. And don’t pitch Batadrava in competition with the Ram temple because I have crosschecked that the Batadrava Satra Samiti has not invited him.
“I saw a news (item) in the national media yesterday that while Modi will do Pran Pratistha in the Ram temple, Rahul Gandhi will be at the birthplace of Sankardeva. It is a wrong analogy because no one has invited him. He wants to go on his own.”
Soon after his media interaction, the Sri Sri Batadrava Than Parichalana Samiti said Rahul could visit after 3pm.
In a letter to the local MLA, the Samiti said it had decided at an emergency meeting to welcome Rahul but there was a possibility of a large number of devotees turning up at the Than on the occasion of the Ram temple consecration. Keeping that in mind, the Samiti told the MLA that it would not be able to allow Rahul’s visit before 3pm.
A Congress leader told The Telegraph that Rahul would go to the Than at 7am on Monday, as decided, to pay his homage to the 15th-century saint-reformer-playwright Sankardeva.
Asked about the Samiti statement that Rahul should come after 3pm, she said no permission was required to visit a temple or any place of worship. She added that the Congress had informed the administration about the visit well in advance.
Rahul’s visit to Bordowa Than is significant, a Congress leader said, as it would “send” a message to the Hindutva brigade considering it’s a pilgrimage site like Ayodhya.
“It is at Bordowa that Sankardeva founded and propagated Ekasarana Dharma, which stresses devotion to a single God and rejects the caste system and societal hierarchies,” the leader said.
She said that whether or not Rahul visited the Than, the BJP would make an issue out of it.
“They will say Rahul Gandhi did not visit the Than despite passing through Nagaon. Rahulji will be visiting in the morning; that is final,” she said.
The attack on Borah seemed to have galvanised the 15-party United Opposition Forum in Assam, which includes the Congress.
On Sunday night, the Forum said all leaders of the alliance would address a media meeting on the attack on Borah, indicating that Sunday’s developments were likely to have an impact on Monday.
Sarma has asked meat and fish shops to remain shut till 4pm on Monday, restaurants not to serve non-vegetarian food till 2.30pm, and government educational institutions to remain closed through the day, triggering much debate.
He has also requested business establishments to remain closed till 2.30pm on Monday and churches and mosques to hold special prayers. A dry day has been declared.
Bengal campaign
On Sunday, the Congress launched a campaign in the districts of Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and North Dinajpur, inviting people to join the yatra that is slated to enter Bengal on January 25."

South Africa, which brought the case, had asked for the court to order Israel to halt its operation.
The top UN Court court decided not to throw out genocide charges against Israel for its military offensive in Gaza, as part of a preliminary decision in a case that goes to the core of one of the world's most intractable conflicts.
In the highly anticipated decision made by a panel of 17 judges, the International Court of Justice decided not to throw out the case. The reading of the ruling is ongoing.
""The court is acutely aware of the extent of the human tragedy that is unfolding in the region and is deeply concerned about the continuing loss of life and human suffering,” Joan E. Donoghue, the court's president, said.
Friday's decision is only an interim one; it could take years for the full case brought by South Africa to be considered. Israel rejects the genocide accusation and had asked the court to throw the charges out.
While the case winds its way through the court, South Africa has asked the judges “as a matter of extreme urgency” to impose so-called provisional measures to protect Palestinians in Gaza — and the court could order those on Friday.
Top of the South African list is a request for the court to order Israel to “immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza.” It is also asking for Israel to take “reasonable measures” to prevent genocide and allow access for desperately needed aid.
In a statement Thursday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said he hoped the decision would “include immediate action to stop the aggression and genocide against our people in the Gaza Strip ... and a rapid flow of relief aid to save the hungry, wounded and sick from the threat of slow death that threatens them.""
On Thursday, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy had said that Israel expected the court to toss out the “spurious and specious charges.”
Israel often boycotts international tribunals and UN investigations, saying they are unfair and biased. But this time, it took the rare step of sending a high-level legal team — a sign of how seriously it regards the case and likely the fear that any court order to halt operations would be a major blow to the country's international standing.
An Israeli official said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu huddled with top legal, diplomatic and security officials on Thursday in anticipation of the ruling. He said Israel is confident in its case but discussed “all scenarios.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing confidential meetings.
Israel launched its massive air and ground assault on Gaza after Hamas militants stormed through Israeli communities on October 7 killing some 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and abducting another 250.
The offensive has decimated vast swaths of the territory and driven nearly 85% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.
More than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed, the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run enclave said on Friday. The ministry does not differentiate between combatants and civilians in its death toll, but has said about two-thirds of those killed were women and children.
The Israeli military claims at least 9,000 of those killed in the nearly four-month conflict are Hamas militants.
UN officials have expressed fears that even more people could die from disease, with at least one-quarter of the population facing starvation.
Ahead of the ruling, Marieke de Hoon, an associate professor of international law at the University of Amsterdam, said she thought the court was unlikely to throw the case out since the legal bar South Africa has to clear at this early stage is lower than the one that would be applied for ruling on the merits of the accusation.
“The standard ... is not, has there been genocide? But a lower standard,"" she said. “Is it plausible that there could have been a risk of genocide that would invoke Israel's responsibility to prevent genocide?”
But De Hoon also did not expect the world court to order an end to Israel's military operation.
“I think that they will shy away from actually calling for a full cease-fire, because I think they will find that beyond their abilities right now,” she said in a telephone interview.
Provisional measures by the world court are legally binding, but it is not clear if Israel would comply with any order.
Top Hamas official Osama Hamdan, meanwhile, said his group would abide by a cease-fire if ordered and would be ready to release the hostages it is holding if Israel releases Palestinian prisoners.
How the US, Israel's top ally, responds to any order will be key, since it wields veto power at the UN Security Council and thus could block measures there aimed at forcing Israel's compliance.
The US has said Israel has the right to defend itself, but also spoken about the need for the country to protect civilians in Gaza and allow more aid in.
The genocide case strikes at the national identity of Israel, which was founded as a Jewish state after the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II.
South Africa's own identity is key to it bringing the case. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel's policies in Gaza and the West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Black people to “homelands” before ending in 1994."
OBVYJ0ZQXA_B9G14CD76GVUQZ2,John Boyne author of The Boy in Striped Pyjamas comes to Mahadevi Birla World Academy,"Jhinuk Mazumdar Kolkata Published 25.01.24, 06:08 AM","Jhinuk Mazumdar Kolkata Published 25.01.24, 06:08 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/my-kolkata/news/john-boyne-author-of-the-boy-in-striped-pyjamas-comes-to-mahadevi-birla-world-academy/cid/1996001,"In a packed auditorium of over 300 students, barely a couple of hands went up when author John Boyne asked how many of them wanted to become writers.
The Irish author of The Boy in Striped Pyjamas told his young audience he had started writing at a “fairly very young age” and at the age of eight or nine he knew writing was what he wanted to do.
“In the ‘70s and ‘80s, we didn’t have the distractions you have today. Social media, computers, streaming... all of that. So the library was a big part of my life. Probably the biggest part,” he said.
On Wednesday, Boyne was addressing students of Classes VIII and IX at Mahadevi Birla World Academy and many other children.
The author is in town for the literary fest Kalam, being held in association with The Telegraph.
Boyne said that every Wednesday, they used to get a half-day from school and his mother would take him and his siblings to the local library.
He would take three books a week, a routine that he looked forward to.
“I would always look forward to what books I was going to choose. So while reading what I was also doing was taking characters from those books and I was writing new stories,” he said.
Borrowing books from libraries is on the decline for some years now, teachers across schools in Kolkata said.
“Even if they are forced to borrow books, most do not read,” said a high school English teacher at another school.
For Boyne, “reading and writing were completely connected”.
“I didn’t know if was going to be good enough to do it but I knew this is what I wanted to do,” he said.
During his teenage years, Boyne said he was writing two or three stories a week.
“Most of them were not good but that is okay because I was learning how to write. I was learning how to write stories... how to write dialogues... every single word that I was writing made me feel that I was getting a little bit better.”
Boyne has published 15 novels for adults, six novels for young readers, and a short story collection.
For those who want to be writers, Boyne said it was not about the first draft.
“It’s about the final draft. The first draft of a book is just a skeleton of what is going to come. It takes a lot of rewriting and rewriting and rewriting to get it to where it’s supposed to be.”
“It’s challenging and hard work but enjoyable hard work,” he said.
After his address, the floor was opened for questions and students asked him about Bruno, the character from The Boy in Striped Pyjamas, the holocaust, and about friendships in his life.
Last year, students of Mahadevi Birla World Academy had been asked to read The Boy in Striped Pyjamas as part of their English enrichment activities and they had done assignments on it, making their questions deep and insightful.
Joining them were students from two NGOs — Calcutta Social Project and Ek Tara — with whom students of the host school have a reading partnership.
Across schools, reading and writing have taken a backseat. Especially after the pandemic, when most students from middle school onwards started possessing a hand-held device, said teachers.
“It is a challenge to sustain students’ interest given that digital media has become so rampant. We are trying to revive that interest and hence author visits are important,” said principal Anjana Saha.
“When children see an author and interact, they connect with them rather than just seeing them as a name on the book’s cover,” Saha said.
The waning interest in writing or reading is because of being surrounded by moving images, sometimes also in classrooms.
“There is an overload of moving and visual images that have taken away from them the ability to visualise and imagine. Most children do not write because their imagination has been stunted with the availability of tools at their fingertips,” said Nupur Ghosh, vice-principal, Mahadevi Birla World Academy."

For Trump, it's become a familiar ritual to welcome the backing of someone who once tried to take him on. Nonetheless, it was notable at Sunday's rally in New Hampshire to see Trump praise DeSantis without calling him “DeSantimonious” or “DeSanctus,” putting an end to perhaps the most bitter rivalry of Republicans' 2024 campaign.
“I just want to thank Ron and congratulate him on doing a very good job,” Trump said at the outset of his remarks. “He was very gracious, and he endorsed me. I appreciate that, and I also look forward to working with Ron.” Trump described DeSantis as ""a really terrific person.”
Earlier in the day, DeSantis said via video that he would be ending his campaign two days before New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation GOP primary. But, Trump's glee Sunday night aside, it wasn't the warmest of endorsements.
“It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” DeSantis said, offering matter-of-fact analysis through a forced smile without adding plaudits for Trump.
“I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honour that pledge,"" he continued, before adding a dig at the remaining contender, Nikki Haley. DeSantis described the former UN ambassador and onetime South Carolina governor as a stand-in for “the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism.”
Trump seemed unbothered by DeSantis' approach, striking a tone of camaraderie as fellow political combatants. “I will tell you it's not easy,” Trump said Sunday night in Rochester. “They think it's easy doing this stuff, right? It's not easy.”
Brenda Moneypenny, a 64-year-old from Alton, waited in the cold for two hours to see Trump on Sunday night. She whipped out her driver's license to prove her last name and explained she is a registered independent who often votes Republican. Moneypenny said she has considered Haley, especially because of the chance to elect the first woman to the presidency. But she never considered DeSantis.
“Too flim-flamsy,” Moneypenny said of the governor. “He needs better campaign people. He doesn't have anybody that's doing him any favors right now.”
Ultimately, she settled on Trump: “Tried and true,” she said.
The former president seemed to revel in skewering DeSantis throughout the campaign, often making clear it was a personal grudge because he considered the governor's decision to run in the first place an act of disloyalty. Trump endorsed DeSantis, then a congressman, in a competitive 2018 GOP primary for Florida governor. DeSantis went on to win the nomination and the general election. By the time DeSantis won a landslide reelection four years later, though, he was positioning himself for his own White House campaign.
As recently as November, Trump came to Florida and addressed a boisterous crowd at a state GOP meeting standing in front of a sign that read: “Florida is Trump Country.” That evening, Trump did not mention DeSantis until more than 30 minutes into his speech. Even then, it was to brag about polls showing his advantages over the governor.
“I endorsed him, and he became a rocket ship in 24 hours,” Trump said, claiming that DeSantis had begged for his endorsement. “Now he's like a wounded falling bird from the sky.”
Trump never did debate DeSantis or any other 2024 rival. He has said he wouldn't until one proves they are a legitimate threat to him winning the nomination.
DeSantis concentrated his campaign in recent months in Iowa, where he finished in second place in last week's caucuses — 30 percentage points behind Trump and barely ahead of Haley. Haley, meanwhile, has long prioritised New Hampshire as a potential springboard ahead of her home-state South Carolina primary next month.
In Iowa, APVoteCast surveys of caucusgoers suggested DeSantis's supporters were much more likely than Haley's to consider themselves conservatives who would back Trump no matter what if he wins the nomination and faces President Joe Biden in November. If that trend holds in New Hampshire, then Trump could expect at least some boost from DeSantis dropping out, and whatever he gets could stretch out his margin and frustrate Haley's ability to claim any momentum. Indeed, Trump's aides have said they expect DeSantis' support around the country will shift heavily to Trump.
Trump noted Sunday that he won New Hampshire's 2016 primary by about 20 points. He lost the battleground state twice in general elections.
On Monday, he plans to be in New York at a civil defamation trial stemming from a columnist's claims he sexually attacked her. Then he is scheduled to return to New Hampshire for an evening rally in Laconia."

“What is the purpose of Rahul Gandhi’s programme in Bengal? His political programme would not yield any dividend here for the Congress. Trinamul is strong enough to put the BJP in a soup in this state. Rahul should concentrate on other states where they are weak,” said Udayan Guha, a Trinamul leader from Cooch Behar and the north Bengal development minister.
Rahul’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, which started from Manipur 12 days ago, will enter Bengal through Basirhat in Cooch Behar district on Thursday.
Fingers are crossed over the success of the yatra in Bengal following Mamata’s declaration that Trinamul would go it alone in the Lok Sabha polls. The Trinamul chairperson said she hadn’t been even informed that Rahul would be coming to Bengal.
Taking a cue from the chief’s statement, Guha said: “The Congress has a poor organisational base in Bengal. Some people may go to see Rahul only because he is the grandson of Indira Gandhi and the son of Rajiv Gandhi. But we doubt if the people would be joining the Congress yatra to prevent the BJP in the state.”
There are apprehensions that Mamata’s comments would trigger some unpleasant developments along the route through which the yatra passes.
“Following the announcement by the Trinamul chief, you never know if overenthusiastic Trinamul supporters will try to wave black flags at the yatra or come up with other forms of protest,” said an observer.
After a day’s walk, the yatra will pause for two days and will resume on January 28 to pass through Siliguri. The following day, the yatra will enter Kishanganj in Bihar and will return to Bengal through Malda and Murshidabad districts.
Murshidabad is the last bastion of the Congress in Bengal. The state party chief, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, is the MP of the Behrampore Lok Sabha seat in the district.
“Instead of wasting time in Bengal, Rahul should spare more time for the northern and the southern states to strengthen the battle against the BJP,” Guha said.
Mamata is scheduled to visit Cooch Behar on January 29, merely four days after Rahul’s political programme in the district.
Md. Salim, state CPM secretary, alleged that Mamata’s decision to go alone in Bengal had actually been dictated by the RSS. “She has been speaking against the Congress, the CPM and the INDIA coalition following a directive from the RSS,” said Salim.
“In Bengal, the Congress has to decide whether it wants our support for the Nyay Yatra. Our condition is that the Congress must not take the support from the corrupt Trinamul that has always thwarted nyay (justice) in the state,” the CPM state secretary said in Malda."

Basu, a senior leader of the ruling Trinamool Congress, was talking about 'Hubba', a Bengali film on Shyamal Das known as ‘Hubba Shyamal’ who was killed in a gang fight in June 2011 in Hooghly district, his base. The movie was released last week.
""My political orientation did not influence the references made in the film. My intention has not been to target the then-ruling party in the state. I just touched on the issue,"" the education minister told PTI.
The acclaimed theatre personality said many Bollywood gangster films follow a pattern showing the politician-underworld nexus.
""I don’t believe in such a formula. If you watch international gangster films like Brazilian work 'City of God' or a South African film the name of which I cannot remember at this moment, there is no reference to any such nexus. Hubba followed that tradition,"" he said.
Basu said the idea to make a film on 'Hubba Shyamal' struck him when he read a book by IPS officer Supratim Sarkar, in which he had narrated the incidents of real-life criminals whom he had come across during his career.
""I read that book in between the shoots of my earlier film 'Dictionary' and decided to make a film on the life of Hubba - his rise, his family life. Though violence has been figured to a great extent in this film, that is not all,"" he said.
Hubba Shyamal was involved in the real estate business and he was not directly associated with any political party, said Basu who had met many people for his research on the project with the help of police sources.
Basu said he thought about casting Bangladeshi superstar Mosharraf Karim in the role of the gangster immediately after he decided to do the film.
""Mosharaf Karim is a versatile actor who delivered a power-packed performance in 'Dictionary'. I thought he would fit for the role,"" Basu said.
'Hubba' was also released in Bangladesh and is getting a good response there, as well as in West Bengal, he said.
It is an encouraging sign for film producers in both countries in the wake of the rising popularity of Bangladeshi actors like Karim after OTT came in a big way during Covid time, Basu said.

“No holiday will be declared,” Siddaramaiah said while talking to reporters in Tumkur on Sunday after participating in the fifth death anniversary commemoration of Lingayat seer Sree Sivakumara Swami.
When his attention was drawn to the fact that the central government had declared a half-day break for its employees across the country to watch the event live on television, Siddaramaiah said his government had already announced a special puja at state-managed temples in Karnataka.
The confirmation came a day after Siddaramaiah said “Let’s see”, even as state BJP president Vijayendra Yediyurappa on Saturday urged the state government to declare a holiday on Monday.
Siddaramaiah further said that he would be inaugurating a Ram temple in Mahadevapura in Bangalore on Monday, while the state-managed temples would conduct special pujas.
State minister for Muzrai (temple affairs), Rambling Reddy, had on January 7 announced that more than 34,000 temples managed by his department had been instructed to offer special puja to coincide with the consecration.
Reddy’s announcement followed Siddaramaiah extending support to the temple in Ayodhya by saying: “We are very happy that it (Ram temple) is being inaugurated (consecrated)… We are not against Ayodhya, nor against the construction of the temple...”
Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, R. Ashoka, reminded Siddaramaiah that it was not just the BJP that wanted a holiday. “It’s not we, but seven crore Kannadigas are seeking a holiday. So please allow the people to celebrate this happy occasion at every home in Karnataka,” he told reporters on Sunday.
BJP leader D.V. Sadananda Gowda commented: “I don’t know why Siddaramaiah is behaving like this. This is a huge event that will give a new strength to the Indian people.”"

The swearing in function was held in the Supreme Court premises, a day after the Centre cleared his name for judgeship.
With the swearing in, the top court has attained its full strength of 34 judges, including the Chief Justice of India, and would for the first time have three sitting judges from the Dalit community. The other two sitting judges from the Scheduled Caste community are Justices B R Gavai and C T Ravikumar.
While recommending Justice Varale's name earlier this month, a five-judge SC Collegium headed by CJI Chandrachud said it took into consideration the fact that he is among the senior-most high court judges and is the only high court chief justice from the Scheduled Caste.
A vacancy arose in the apex court following the retirement of Justice S K Kaul on December 25 last year.
Justice Varale's appointment came within a week of the SC Collegium recommending his name.
""In exercise of powers conferred by clause (2) of Article 124 of the Constitution of India, the President is pleased to appoint Shri Justice Prasanna Bhalachandra Varale, Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court, to be a Judge of the Supreme Court of India, with effect from the date he assumes charge of his office,"" a law ministry notification read.
While recommending Justice Varale's name, the collegium had observed that the Supreme Court had operated almost throughout last year with full strength of 34 judges and, therefore, could achieve the distinction of recording an unprecedented rate of disposal by disposing of 52,191 cases in the calendar year 2023.
""Bearing in mind that the workload of judges has increased considerably, it has become necessary to ensure that the court has full working judge-strength at all times. The Collegium has, therefore, decided to fill up the sole existing vacancy by recommending a name,"" it had noted.
Born on June 23, 1962, Justice Varale was appointed as a judge of the High Court of Bombay on July 18, 2008, and elevated as the chief justice of the High Court of Karnataka on October 15, 2022.
Justice Varale’s elevation to the apex court would take the representation of Bombay High Court in the Supreme Court to four. The other three judges having the parent high court of Bombay are CJI Chandrachud, Justices Gavai and Abhay S Oka.

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and state Congress President and Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar said the Congress treated Shettar with respect, after he joined the party ahead of last year's Assembly polls, while the BJP had humiliated him by denying him the ticket to contest the elections in May.
Shettar, who rejoined his old party on Thursday, cited his long association with the BJP, and said many of his well-wishers wanted him to back in the outfit.
""Jagadish Shettar had told me that he was being requested (by BJP) and workers were being sent to meet him. Yesterday morning too I spoke to him. He had told me that he would not do such a thing and will not go (to BJP), as the Congress party has given him another life in politics. Keeping his words in mind, I spoke about it Mysuru, but now I got information that he is in BJP office,"" Shivakumar said.
Speaking to reporters in Bengaluru, he said the Congress party, considering Shettar as a senior leader, treated him with respect.
""He (Shettar) had said that BJP is not good, he had made several statements against the BJP....Congress had trusted the senior leader, but now you (media) are showing that that trust is being breached. I have got information that he has sent his resignation (as MLC) to the Chairman of the Legislative Council. I don't know whether he has gone or has been taken (by BJP) under any pressure..,,"" he said.
Responding to Shettar's statement that he has rejoined the BJP in the national interest, Shivakumar asked, ""did he not know about national interest, when he was not given the ticket (by BJP)? Did he not know about Congress and national interest, when Congress made him MLC for five years?""
Asked whether Shettar has fallen prey to any allurements, he said, ""he (Shettar) has to say what allurements were given to him. I can only say that Congress treated him respectfully....all of us have conscience, he too will have conscience.""
On whether Laxman Savadi (Congress MLC, who too had joined party from BJP ahead of Assembly polls) will also go back to BJP, Shivakumar said, ""no one will go, quitting the party, Shatter has gone, it's a different matter, despite people rejecting him by a margin of 35,000 votes (in May Assembly polls), Congress treated him respectfully, rest  conscience and people will decide.""
Speaking to reporters at Virajpet in Kodagu district, Siddaramaiah said he was not aware of the development, but repeatedly maintained that Congress treated Shettar respectfully and that he had assured that he would not go back to BJP.
""Jagadish Shettar came to Congress stating that BJP humiliated him and did not give a ticket, we gave him a ticket as he is an ex-Chief Minister. He lost in the Assembly election from his own constituency. We then made him MLC. So no injustice or humiliation happened to him from the Congress party, we treated him respectfully,"" Siddaramaiah said.
Shettar joined the Congress on April 17 last year, dealing a blow to the then ruling BJP ahead of Assembly elections.
The decision to part ways with the BJP came after the 68-year-old six time MLA, a former Leader of Opposition in the Assembly and ex-Speaker, was denied ticket to contest in the Hubli-Dharwad (Central) segment, which he represented in the outgoing Lower House.
The decision of Shettar, a prominent Lingayat leader from north Karnataka, to join Congress ahead of Assembly polls is one of the factors that adversely impacted the BJP's prospects in a number of segments in the region, as it built a perception that the saffron party was neglecting Lingayat leaders, according to political observers.
Shettar, whose family has been associated with the party since Jana Sangh days, is an influential leader from its bastion of Kittur Karnataka region. He had also served as state BJP president.
Shettar, who contested on a Congress ticket after the BJP denied him ticket to contest in the 2023 Assembly polls, was defeated in the Hubli-Dharwad (Central) seat by a margin of 34,289 votes, by BJP's Mahesh Tenginakai, a debutant in electoral politics.
Congress had subsequently made Shettar an MLC.

ONK1XCGUHB_9V88XI6EAB1ZWOH,Accused cannot seek default bail on ground that investigation is pending against others: Supreme Court,"PTI New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 01:28 PM","PTI New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 01:28 PM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/accused-cannot-seek-default-bail-on-ground-that-investigation-is-pending-against-others-supreme-court/cid/1996107,"An accused cannot seek default bail on the grounds that the probe is pending against other accused or the charge sheet filed by the probe agency is incomplete, the Supreme Court has said while cancelling the bail granted to former DHFL promoters Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj in the multi-crore bank loan scam case.
The top court said the benefit of proviso appended to sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the CrPC would be available to the offender only when a charge sheet is not filed and the investigation is kept pending against him.
However, once a charge sheet is filed, the said right ceases, it said.
A bench of Justices Bela M Trivedi and Pankaj Mithal said once from the material produced along with the charge sheet, the court is satisfied about the commission of an offence and takes cognizance of the offence allegedly committed by the accused, it is immaterial whether further investigation is pending or not.
""The pendency of further investigation qua the other accused or for production of some documents not available at the time of filing of charge sheet would neither vitiate the charge sheet, nor would it entitle the accused to claim right to get default bail on the grounds that the charge sheet was an incomplete charge sheet or that the charge sheet was not filed in terms of Section 173(2) of CrPC,"" the bench said.
The apex court said both, the Special Court as well as the Delhi High Court  committed serious error of law in disregarding the legal position and granting bail to Wadhawans.
""In view of the afore-stated legal position, we have no hesitation in holding that the charge sheet having been filed against the respondents-accused within the prescribed time limit and the cognisance having been taken by the Special Court of the offences allegedly committed by them, the respondents could not have claimed the statutory right of default bail under Section 167(2) on the grounds that the investigation qua other accused was pending,"" the bench said in its judgement uploaded Thursday.
The top court said there cannot be any disagreement with the well settled legal position that the right of default bail under Section 167(2) CrPC is not only a statutory right but is a right that flows from Article 21 of the Constitution.
""It is an indefeasible right, nonetheless it is enforceable only prior to the filing of the challan or the charge sheet, and does not survive or remain enforceable on the challan being filed, if already not availed of. Once the challan has been filed, the question of grant of bail has to be considered and decided only with reference to the merits of the case under the provisions relating to grant of bail to the accused after the filing of the challan,"" the bench said.
Under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), an accused becomes entitled for grant of statutory bail if the probe agency fails to file the charge sheet on conclusion of the investigation in a criminal case within 60 or 90 days period.
In this case, the CBI filed the charge sheet on the 88th day after registration of the FIR and the trial court granted default bail to the accused and the Delhi High Court upheld the order.
The Wadhawan brothers were arrested in this case on July 19 last year. The high court, however, had clarified it did not go into the merits of the case.
The charge sheet was filed on October 15, 2022 and cognisance was taken.
The FIR in the case was based on a complaint made by the Union Bank of India.
It had alleged that DHFL, its then CMD Kapil Wadhawan, the then director Dheeraj Wadhawan and other accused persons entered into a criminal conspiracy to cheat the consortium of 17 banks led by the Union Bank of India, and in pursuance of the criminal conspiracy, the accused and others induced the consortium to sanction huge loans aggregating Rs 42,871.42 crore.
Much of that amount was allegedly siphoned off and misappropriated by alleged falsification of the books of the DHFL and dishonest default in repayment of the legitimate dues of the consortium banks, the CBI has claimed.
The complainant has alleged that a wrongful loss of Rs 34,615 crore was caused to the consortium of banks in as much as such was the quantification of the outstanding dues as on July 31, 2020.

ONTT7KE34K_54RCSRUDIS8XONM,Hubba: Bangladeshi actor Mosharraf Karim is the lifeline of Bratya Basu’s gripping gangster drama,"Agnivo Niyogi Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 04:23 PM","Agnivo Niyogi Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 04:23 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/entertainment/hubba-bangladeshi-actor-mosharraf-karim-is-the-lifeline-of-bratya-basus-gripping-gangster-drama/cid/1995919,"In his fifth directorial venture, Bratya Basu delivers a gritty gangster film built around dreaded criminal Hubba Shyamal Das, who was infamous as the ‘Dawood Ibrahim of Hooghly’ in Kolkata of the early 2000s. The film is loosely based on a chapter from Supratim Sarkar’s book Goyendapeeth Lalbazar.
Shymal becomes Bimal in Basu’s film and Bangladeshi actor Mosharraf Karim undergoes a remarkable transformation into the title character of a crime lord. Shyamal’s associates Benarasi Bapi and Ritesh Mahto are Bokaro Bapi and Umesh Mahto in the film.
The film begins in 2005, with CID officer Dibakar Sen (Indraneil Sengupta) attempting to catch Hubba. A cat-and-mouse chase begins, portraying the challenges faced by the police in pinning down this uneducated but street-smart criminal. Hubba keeps playing mind games with the police and manages to give them the slip every time. When he is finally captured, his layered personality is further revealed through flashbacks, providing a nuanced understanding of his journey from an ordinary guy-next-door to a notorious criminal.
Basu, who has written the screenplay, recreates Hubba’s gangster empire with all its intricacies and complexities, showcasing the nexus between crime and politics. Hubba’s early life, family, first love and entry into the criminal world is also woven into the story that gives a nod to Bollywood gangster films like Sarkar and Vaastav.
While Hubba boasts of a line-up of strong performances, it is Mosharraf Karim who carries the film on his shoulders. He effortlessly switches between the ruthlessness of a criminal and the childlike charm of a funny man. Karim captures Bimal’s fascination with Bollywood movies too, which is evident in his clapworthy rendition of the iconic ‘Don ko pakadna na mumkin hai’ dialogue from the Amitabh Bachchan-starrer. His interactions with Indraneil Sengupta’s cop character light up the screen whenever they are together.
Loknath Dey as Bapi and Anujoy Chattopadhyay as Umesh also leave a mark. Theatre actor Gambhira Bhattacharya wins hearts as a young Bimal transitioning into a life of crime. The ferocity in his eyes in the scene where he murders a man for smiling at his girlfriend is spine-chilling.
Cinematographer Soumik Halder captures the violence permeating the film, and the judicious use of music, composed by Prabuddha Banerjee —  particularly the retro vibe in the title track sung by Silajit Majumdar — enhances the overall cinematic experience."

However, the report added that Salesforce still has 1,000 jobs open across the company, implying that the move could be more of a routine adjusting of the company's workforce, the report said, citing a source.
The job cuts follow a wave of U.S. tech layoffs after the industry hired heavily during the pandemic, including among behemoths such as Amazon, opens new tab and Google.
Salesforce did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report.
Earlier this week, eBay announced it would cut about 1,000 roles, or an estimated 9% of its current workforce, while Microsoft, opens new tab said it would let go of 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox.
Salesforce has already trimmed its workforce last year, when it cut jobs by 10% and closed some offices, after rapid pandemic hiring left it with a bloated workforce.
The workforce trimming helped the company's earnings leading it to report a rise in second and third quarter revenue and raising its annual profit forecast.
Salesforce also said in September that it would hire more than 3,000 people after cutting jobs in January last year to drive up margins."

Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister who spent days in the build up to Monday's pran-pratishtha at the under-construction Ram temple at Ayodhya, had made sure the narrative was focussed on one holy deity or the other. Leaders of most of these parties had turned down the invite to attend the grand ceremony held at Ayodhya but decided to turn up at other holy sites.
The success of the RSS, which will complete 100 years in 2025, and its political progeny the BJP lies in keeping the political narrative tied around a temple --- not the temples of modernity that the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had referred to at inauguration of the Bhakhra-Nangal dam seven decades ago.
In Calcutta, chief minister Mamata Banerjee, one of the main stakeholders in the Opposition block, visited Kalighat temple and performing aarti there, before leading a harmony march through the city streets with religious heads. She also visited a gurdwara, a church and a mosque on her way to the Park Circus Maidan where she addressed a gathering.

Earlier in the day,  Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi, on his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam’s Nagaon, was stopped from entering the Batadrava Temple, the birthplace of Srimanta Sankardeva, a 15th century scholar and saint from the north-eastern state. The Congress MP later staged a sit-in demonstration demanding he be allowed. The BJP-led state government did not budge.
“Will PM Modi now decide who can visit a temple and when? We do not want to create any problems, simply pray at the temple,” said Rahul. “I cannot go to Sankardeva’s birthplace but others can during a law and order crisis.""

Later, on his X handle Rahul wrote in Hindi: “Through devotion, Sankardeva had strung together the religious diversity in India, but I was stopped from showing my respect today. I sought his blessings from outside the temple. Our struggle for dignity against the brute show of power will continue.”
Rahul's party colleagues,  Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah and his Himachal Pradesh counterpart Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu had no such trouble.
The Karnataka chief minister inaugurated a Sita Rama Lakshmana temple in Bangalore’s Mahadevpura around the same time when Modi was leading the show at Ayodhya. The chief minister also unveiled a 33-foot statue of Rama’s devotee, Lord Hanuman, at the temple premise. Official duties called Siddaramaiah to chair a meeting at the state secretariat to discuss the upcoming state budget.

Sukhu visited the ancient Hanuman temple at Jakhu hill near the state capital Shimla and offered prayers.
“Ramayana is incomplete without Hanuman. On the occasion of pran-pratishtha of Lord Ram, visited the Jakhu temple and bowed before Lord Hanuman and recited the Hanuman Chalisa (a hymn in praise of Hanuman),” Sukhu wrote on his Facebook page signing off with Jai Jai Sita Ram. Sukhu’s official residence was illuminated for the evening, where he was joined by actor Nana Patekar.
Though Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann of the Aam Aadmi Party spent the day at his official residence in Chandigarh sector-1, his party’s convenor and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet colleagues in Delhi were busy celebrating the event, organising “shobha yatras” and “bhandaras”.
“Hearty congratulation and best wishes to all of you on this sacred occasion of the installation of Maryada Purushottam Lord Shri Ram in the grand temple. Hail Siya Ram,” Kejriwal wrote in a post on his X handle.
Former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, the head of the Shiv Sena faction, has been camping in the Maharashtra holy town of Nashik since Sunday. On Monday, Thackeray offered prayers at the Kalaram temple, where B R Ambedkar had led a satyagraha in 1930, where the Dalits were not allowed to enter. Thackeray also performed aarti on the banks of river Godavari later in the evening.
Thackeray’s visit to Nashik has a political purpose as well. On Tuesday, the 98th birth anniversary of Balasaheb Thackeray, one of the staunchest Hindutva leaders, his son the former chief minister will launch the campaign for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. Shiv Sena under Bal Thackeray was one of the oldest allies of the BJP along with the Akali Dal. Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena is in an alliance with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress party.
At least three other non-BJP chief ministers, two of them known atheists, Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan of the CPM and Tamil Nadu chief minister, the DMK’s MK Stalin, had nothing to do with any temples for the day.
On returning from Salem where the party’s youth wing conference was held on Sunday, Stalin had a government event to attend on Monday evening.
Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik could possibly be the only chief minister to have stayed in front of a television set at “Naveen Niwas”, his official residence in Bhubaneswar’s airport area, watching the proceedings at Ayodhya along with VK Pandian, his former principal secretary and now BJD leader.
“Witnessed the auspicious Ram Mandir Pran Pratishtha being held at Ayodhya. Delighted to see the nation coming together with religious fervour for the pran pratishtha,” Patnaik posted on X along with an image.
The Kerala chief minister, who was reportedly at the state secretariat, released a strongly worded video statement, calling upon India’s political fraternity to reject the majoritarianism being pushed by the Sangh parivaar. CPM was the first party to reject the invite to Monday’s event.
“Secularism is the soul of the democratic republic of India. It has been part of our identity as a nation right from the days of our national movement. Those belonging to different faiths and those who were not part of any religion had taken an active part in our freedom struggle,” Vijayan said.
“This nation belongs to all people and all sections of Indian society in equal measures. Religion is a private affair and Indian Constitution has minced no words in stating that all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and have the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion, as those who have taken an oath to uphold the constitution of India we ought to ensure that every person within our territories enjoys this right in equal measures,” the Kerala chief minister said.
“At the same time, we cannot be promoting one religion above all others or demean any religion beneath every other. As our first prime minister Pt Jawaharlal Nehru has often opined Indian secularism means the separation of religion and state. We even have a strong tradition of maintaining that separation,” Vijayan reminded.
The Kerala chief minister observed: “However, of late the line that demarcates religion and state seems to be getting thinner and thinner. This is a major departure from the times when our constitutional office bearers have been cautioned from taking part in religious events as it would cast aspersions on our credentials as a secular state. Now we have come to a point in time, when the inauguration of a religious place of worship in the country is being celebrated as a state event.”
“Most of us have been invited to participate in the rituals by the trust in charge of it. Those who have pledged to preserve and protect our constitution let us reaffirm our commitment to its secular character by declining to participate in the event upholding our constitutional responsibilities. Let this serve as an opportunity to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood among all the people of India, transcending religious, linguistic, regional or sectional diversity. May India prosper further by developing scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform,” Vijayan said in the video."

Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian will also visit the country on January 29 at the invitation of cash-strapped Pakistan’s foreign minister Jalil Abbas Jilani, the FO said.
Tensions escalated between Islamabad and Tehran after Pakistan conducted “precision military strikes” against what it called “terrorist hideouts” in Iran’s Siestan-Balochistan province that killed 9 early on Thursday.
The attack was seen as retaliation to Iranian missile and drone attacks last Tuesday on two bases of the Sunni Baloch militant group Jaish al-Adl in Pakistan’s unruly Balochistan province.
“Following the telephone conversation between the foreign ministers of Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, it has been mutually agreed that ambassadors of both countries may return to their respective posts by January 26, 2024,” the statement said.
Information minister Murtaza Solangi said Jilani “deserves all the credit for his visionary engagement and managing possibly one of the fastest de-escalations of the diplomatic history”.
The development comes amidst the reported visit of Chinese foreign minister Sun Weidong to Pakistan on a mediation mission.
China on Monday said it is maintaining close contacts with Pakistan and Iran to “bridge their differences” after the two nations conducted airstrikes against each other last week.
4 rescued from Russia  jet crash
Islamabad: Four people have been rescued and two died following the crash of a private Russian jet carrying six over the weekend in Afghanistan, the Taliban said on Monday.
The crash on Saturday took place in a mountainous area in Badakhshan province, some 250 km northeast of Kabul. Rescue teams were dispatched to the remote rural area that is home to only several thousand people.
On Monday, the chief Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, posted videos on X, previously known as Twitter, showing the four rescued crew members. He said they were given first aid and were being transferred from Badakhshan to Kabul. He said the four are in good health.

The seat next to that of Kumar was occupied by senior JD(U) leader and minister Ashok Kumar Choudhary who removed the slip said to be bearing the name of Yadav before occupying the chair.
Leader of the opposition in the assembly, Vijay Kumar Sinha of the BJP, sat next to Choudhary and he was seen exchanging pleasantries with Kumar.
The high tea was organised on the occasion of Republic Day.
Though education minister Alok Kumar Mehta, who is also a national general secretary of the RJD, was among the attendees, Yadav and many other party leaders, including Speaker Awadh Bihari Chaudhary, did not turn up.
When Kumar was approached with queries about Yadav’s absence at the function, he gave a curt reply, “Ask those who did not turn up (jo nahin aaye unse puchhiye)”, and drove back to his official residence.
Speculations are rife that Kumar was unhappy with the Mahagathbandhan, which includes the Congress and the RJD with three Left parties supporting the government from outside.
There are also rumours that he might be planning a return to the BJP-led NDA, though leaders of the saffron party have maintained that doors were “closed” for the JD(U) supremo.
JD(U) leaders have also been maintaining that the party was “firmly with"" the opposition bloc INDIA.
However, when Sinha was approached with queries by journalists after the function was over, he replied, “I am here in my capacity as the leader of the opposition. I have no knowledge about the truth behind the speculations. The BJP is a party in which decisions are taken collectively, by the leadership. We will all abide by whatever decision is taken”.
Notably, Sinha was also present at a meeting of Bihar BJP leaders held at Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s residence in Delhi late Thursday night.
He also declined to comment on the rumours of a rift in the 'Mahagathbandhan', saying “It is a question you should ask members of the coalition”."

The incident took place on Wednesday at Phillip Island, Victoria and a close relative, who was devastated on Thursday, confirmed the names of the victims to the Australian media.
The four were identified as Jagjeet Singh Anand, a 23-year-old man; students Suhani Anand and Kirti Bedi, both 20-year-old women; and Reema Sondhi, a 43-year-old Indian national who was visiting her family in Australia.
The three younger victims lived in Clyde.
Anand, a Melbourne-based nurse, was a permanent resident in Australia. Bedi and Suhani were on student visas. Sondhi, who was from Punjab, arrived in Australia two weeks ago for a holiday. All four are believed to be related, news.com.au website reported.
The victims were part of a group of about 10 people who had been enjoying a day out at the beach, the report added.
Victoria Police Eastern Region Assistant Commissioner Karen Nyholm said the victims entered the water near Forrest Caves – close to Cape Woolamai on the Bass Strait side of the Phillip Island’s south-eastern peninsula – on Wednesday afternoon.
Off-duty lifeguards surfing nearby rushed to their aid after the group got into difficulty, pulling three people from the water unresponsive.
Life Saving Victoria commander Kane Treloar said lifeguards from Cape Woolamai were called at about 3.40 pm on Wednesday and a rescue boat retrieved the fourth person. All required CPR.
Three of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene while one of the 20-year-old women was resuscitated and flown to The Alfred. She died in hospital, police said on Thursday morning.
The Indian High Commission in Canberra on Thursday posted on X, the tragic drowning.
""Heartbreaking tragedy in Australia: 4 Indians lost their lives in a drowning incident at Phillip Island, Victoria. Deepest condolences to the families of the victims.
@cgimelbourne team is in touch with friends of the deceased for all necessary assistance @MEAIndia @DrSJaishankar,"" the High Commission posted.
On Thursday, Treloar said it was the worst drowning incident the state had seen in decades.
“We all worked tirelessly to help those people,” Ambulance Victoria manager Paul James said. “It’s tragic... only a week ago we had three other separate drownings here in Gippsland.” 	Life-Saving Victoria operations general manager Liam Krige said 19 people had drowned in Victoria since December 1 – two more than during the same period last summer.
“Behind each one of these drownings there is a family; there’s a brother, there’s a sister, there’s a mother, there’s a daughter,” he said at a press conference at Forrest Caves car park on Thursday.
“It is extremely tragic and our heartfelt condolences do go out to those victims.”

With the arrest of the man, who runs an import-export business in Nashik city, around 200km from Mumbai, the Maharashtra ATS has unravelled ""international links to ISIS support and funding"", he said.
According to the official, investigations so far have revealed he had transferred funds to the dreaded global terrorist group, also called Islamic State, three times in Syria, where the outfit has a presence.
Some associates of the accused, whose identity was not revealed by the ATS, are being probed across multiple states, he said.
Based on specific information, the ATS had registered an offence under relevant sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against the accused person and a team of the state police's anti-terror wing was monitoring his activities for the last several days, said the official.
During investigations, the ATS found the accused had been continuously communicating with a foreign entity associated with ISIS, an organization banned by the Government of India, the anti-terror agency said in a statement.
The engineer-cum-businessman, who showed signs of radicalization in recent years, actively supported ISIS by transferring funds to the foreign entity, the statement added.
The ATS conducted a search and seized electronic devices, including mobile phones, SIM cards, laptop and pen drive along with incriminating documents, it said.
The terror accused was placed under arrest after interrogation and produced before a court, which sent him to ATS custody till January 31, said the official.

In a late night post on X on Sunday, Congress general secretary, organisation, K C Venugopal alleged that since the yatra's entry in Assam, ""the most corrupt chief minister in India has been carrying out relentless attacks on our convoys, properties and leaders using his goons."" 	""This is a matter that every Indian must take seriously because it exposes the BJP's fascism and hooliganism. All across India, PCCs and DCCs are instructed to hold large-scale protests tomorrow evening and expose how the Modi-led BJP is killing democracy in Assam through their corrupt CM,"" he said.
""Our fight for justice - social, economic and political - will continue undeterred!"" he said.
In his letter to all Pradesh Congress Committee chiefs, state in-charges, party secretaries, heads of frontal organisations, departments and cells, Venugopal said the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra led by Rahul Gandhi, which commenced in Manipur on January 14, has successfully journeyed through Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and now entered Assam.
""Regrettably, as you know, the BJP, particularly its most corrupt Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in Assam, is desperately trying to disrupt this peaceful Yatra,"" he said.
""Over the past two days, we have seen planned attacks on the convoys of Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra and instances of tearing down our Yatra posters by these troublemakers,"" the Congress leader said.
Today, a deliberately assembled crowd of BJP workers ""attacked"" the convoy led by Rahul Gandhi, resulting in injuries to several party leaders, including the Assam Congress chief, Venugopal alleged.
This evening, there was a fresh attack on the Nyay Yatra by the ""goons"" supported by the BJP, he said.
""This is nothing but a desperate attempt to mask the administrative failures and corruption of the Assam chief minister and the BJP government at the Centre,"" he said.
""In the face of such blatant attempts to suppress our cause, it is imperative that we stand firm and united. Our collective resistance is not just a response to these attacks; it is a declaration of our unwavering commitment to justice,"" Venugopal said in the letter.
""We cannot allow the desperate actions of a few to deter us from our mission,"" he said.
In light of these events, it is requested that massive protest demonstrations be held in state and district headquarters by the PCCs, involving our senior leaders and party functionaries Monday evening, the 22 January, Venugopal said.
""Let us come together to strongly oppose these heinous, planned violent attacks on the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,"" he said.
Assam Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah was allegedly assaulted while general secretary Jairam Ramesh's car was targeted in Assam's Sonitpur district during the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on Sunday.
The party has demanded a judicial inquiry into the attack on Borah, alleging involvement of a BJP MLA and his supporters.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was also mobbed at a roadside eatery in Assam's Nagaon district on Sunday evening.
The crowd raised slogans against the Wayanad MP and also displayed placards with messages such as 'Anyay Yatra' and 'Rakibul go back', referring to Samaguri Congress MLA Rakibul Hussain.

Israel has ordered residents to leave a swathe of downtown Khan Younis that includes Nasser and two smaller hospitals as it pushes ahead with its three-month-old offensive against Hamas.
The UN humanitarian office said the area was home to 88,000 Palestinians and was hosting another 425,000 displaced by fighting elsewhere.
The aid group Doctors Without Borders said its staff was trapped inside Nasser Hospital with some 850 patients and thousands of displaced people because the surrounding roads were inaccessible or too dangerous. Nasser Hospital is one of only two hospitals in southern Gaza that can still treat critically ill patients, the group said. Gaza’s health ministry also said the hospital had been isolated.
The Israeli military said its forces were battling militants inside Khan Younis after completing their encirclement of the city the day before. It said aircraft were striking targets as part of the operations there and had also targeted suspected militants in central and northern Gaza.
Thousands of people fled south from Khan Younis on Tuesday toward the town of Rafah. The UN says some 1.5 million people — around two-thirds of Gaza’s population — are crowded into shelters and tent camps in and around Rafah, which is on the border with Egypt.
Even there, Palestinians have found little safety, with Israel regularly carrying out strikes in and around the town. Palestinian witnesses said that in recent days Israeli soldiers and tanks had pushed into parts of Muwasi, a sandy area along the coast that Israel had declared a safe zone, where tens of thousands of people were living in tents without basic services.
In all, some 1.7 million people have been displaced within Gaza, according to the UN refugee agency. Most have fled from the north, where Israel’s air and ground offensive has reduced entire neighbourhoods to shelled-out wastelands, raising the question of whether residents will ever be able to return.
Gaza’s health ministry says the offensive has killed at least 25,490 people — the majority women and children — and wounded another 63,354. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. UN officials have expressed fears that even more people could die from the disease, with at least one-quarter of the population facing starvation.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead with the offensive until “complete victory” against Hamas, which started the war with its assault across the border on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250.
Israeli divisions
Netanyahu says Israel is also committed to returning the over 100 hostages that remain in captivity after most of the others were freed in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners during a November ceasefire.
But many Israelis, including at least one member of Netanyahu’s war cabinet, say that’s impossible without reaching another agreement with Hamas. The militant group says it won’t release any more hostages until Israel ends its offensive."

The release date is almost eight months after memes mixing visuals from the film ""Barbie"" with atomic blasts provoked anger from people in Japan - the only country hit by a nuclear bomb during war.
The outrage over the ""Barbenheimer"" memes prompted an apology from Barbie distributor Warner Brothers Japan, which said at the time they were ""extremely deplorable"".
A spokesperson for Bitters End declined to comment on the release date or say why it took over half a year for ""Oppenheimer"" to be screened in Japan.
""We decided to release this film in Japan after much debate and deliberation, as the themes covered in this film are ones that hold a very significant and special meaning for us as Japanese people,"" Bitters End said in December, according to local media, when it said Oppenheimer would be released in Japan sometime in 2024.

The permission to allow the Chinese ship comes amid strained ties between India and Maldives after its recently-elected President Mohamed Muizzu made Beijing as his first port of call early this month soon after assuming office. Traditionally, New Delhi has been the first port of call for a Maldivian President.
“The current administration appears to be making a stark pivot towards an anti-India stance. Both, the MDP and The Democrats believe alienating any development partner, and especially the country’s most long-standing ally will be extremely detrimental to the long-term development of the country,” the two opposition parties said in their assessment on “the direction in foreign policy” of the Maldivian government.
“Consecutive governments of the country must be able to work with all development partners for the benefit of the people of the Maldives, as the Maldives has traditionally done. Stability and security in the Indian Ocean is vital to the stability and security of the Maldives,” they told a joint news conference.
MDP’s chairperson and former Minister Fayyaz Ismail and the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament, MP Ahmed Saleem, along with Democrats party president MP Hassan Latheef and the Parliamentary Group Leader, MP Ali Azim addressed a joint press conference to flag the issues.
The two parties committed to work together on several governance-related issues and expressed concern on another set of issues including the foreign policy and lack of transparency.
The MPs of the two parties together hold 55 seats in the 87-member house.
The joint statement was posted on the official websites of the two parties and their official X handles too.
The other issues of concern included a lack of transparency in the financial status of the state and the lack of transparency in the MOUs and Agreements that the Government is signing, especially, with foreign parties, although no country was named in the statement.
The opposition also criticised the attempts at censoring the media and meddling with the freedom of the press.

The Bengal chief minister had on Wednesday indicated disapproval of the Yatra entering her state, and posters asking Rahul to go elsewhere had cropped up along its route on Thursday.
“The INDIA bloc will together fight the injustice in the country unleashed by the RSS and the BJP. They are spreading hatred and violence across the country and the INDIA formation will defeat them,” Rahul said in a brief speech at Boxirhat, near the Assam border, after entering Bengal at 10.45am.
His comment about a united fight came within 24 hours of Mamata publicly declaring that Trinamul would go it alone in Bengal and complaining that the Congress had not informed her about the Yatra’s plan to enter Bengal.
That her remarks had left the Congress jittery became evident when party communications chief Jairam Ramesh issued a statement on Wednesday, within a couple of hours of Mamata’s outburst, underscoring her importance to the Opposition bloc.
Rahul, who had launched the Yatra on January 14 from Manipur, arrived in Bengal after covering the northeastern states of Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam.
In his two-minute speech at Boxirhat, Rahul spoke about the hostility he and his team had faced in BJP-ruled Assam. But he spoke not a word on how Trinamul was trying to disparage the Yatra in Bengal.
After Mamata’s comments of Wednesday, Trinamul leaders such as Udayan Guha, the north Bengal development minister, had questioned the need for the Yatra entering Bengal.
As Rahul travelled from the Assam border to Cooch Behar town on Thursday, scores of people were spotted along the route carrying posters with messages such as “Bengal doesn’t need anyone other than Didi” and “Rahul should visit other states”.
The loudest among the posters was one that accused state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury of creating opportunities for the BJP in Bengal.
Unlike the previous legs of the Yatra — during which Rahul had got off the bus and walked short distances to interact with the people — his convoy raced through a 45km stretch, with the former Congress president occasionally waving at people from the bus. The Yatra reached Khagrabari, the entry point to Cooch Behar town, around 12.15pm.
Instead of addressing the people gathered at Khagrabari, Rahul got off the bus, climbed into another vehicle and headed for the Hasimara air force station from where he flew to Delhi.
“The party had already decided on a two-day break for the Yatra. As it resumes on January 28, he will arrive here and join it again,” a Congress leader said.
“There was a delay in the schedule and, therefore, some changes were made to the programme. Rahul was anyway supposed to leave for Delhi from Falakata on Friday — instead, he went today. But he will be back here for the rest of the Yatra.”
Falakata, where the Yatra will halt for two days, is 85km from Boxirhat.
Despite the efforts of Rahul’s spin doctors, his actions and words during the brief Bengal stint of the Yatra so far has led political observers to wonder whether he had tweaked his plans to placate Mamata after her comments on Wednesday.
“The Congress’s desperation to please Mamata has been showing since Jairam Ramesh’s comments yesterday (Wednesday).... Rahul took it to another level by practically doing nothing in Bengal,” an observer said.
He referred to how Adhir, a known Mamata baiter who was on the dais at Boxirhat for around two hours before Rahul arrived, was not allowed to make any speeches from the stage.
That the Congress was being extra careful in choosing its words became apparent when a state unit leader, while addressing the gathering before Rahul’s arrival, added an immediate correction to his initial pledge of fighting “the ruler” by clarifying he had meant the BJP.
While the Congress leadership maintained a low profile to please Mamata, Trinamul’s north Bengal leaders did not hide their glee and claimed that Rahul had left because he had realised that the Congress lacked support in Bengal.
Adhir attacked
Trinamul on Thursday blamed Adhir, who was uncharacteristically quiet on Thursday, for the unravelling of the INDIA combine in Bengal, pointing to his unrelenting attacks on Mamata.
The Trinamul leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, told reporters in Delhi on Thursday: “The three reasons for the INDIA alliance not working in West Bengal are, one, Adhir, two, Adhir, and three, Adhir…. Adhir is a gravedigger of the Congress….”
Asked whether this was the end of the road for the attempt to have a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress in Bengal, or whether there was a window for reconciliation, O’Brien said “we turned the page” on Wednesday.
He refused to be drawn into commenting on whether Trinamul was quitting the INDIA bloc.
“After the general election, if the Congress does its job and defeats the BJP on a substantial number of seats, the Trinamul Congress will very much be a part of the front that believes and fights for the Constitution,” he said.
The INDIA bloc, O’Brien said, has two main detractors — the BJP and Adhir.
“For the last two years, he (Adhir) has been speaking the BJP’s language,” O’Brien said, adding that the party had flagged this before the Congress leadership many times but no action had been taken.
He said that despite Adhir’s repeated attacks on Mamata, “not one TMC MP, minister or MLA said anything against the Congress party or its senior leadership”.
This, along with the repeated extensions of the deadline for a seat-sharing arrangement, demonstrated the “patience and graciousness” of Trinamul, O’Brien said.
Adhir was quoted as saying at a meeting in Siliguri on Thursday: “I am being maligned, targeted, attacked for my anti-Trinamul stand. That is to be expected. It is tolerable. But, on account of that, the level of discourtesy being accorded to Rahul Gandhi here is unacceptable. I find it very sad, personally.”"

The parade commenced with President Droupadi Murmu taking the salute shortly after she and Macron, flanked by the Indian president's bodyguards, arrived at the Kartavya Path in a 'traditional buggy'.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, several other Union ministers, the country's top military brass, foreign diplomats and senior officials were among the spectators at the biggest event on Kartavya Path, the centrepiece boulevard of the national capital.
The first Army contingent leading the mechanised column was the 61 Cavalry which was raised in 1953. It was followed by 11 mechanised columns, 12 marching contingents and a fly-past by advanced light helicopters of the Army Aviation Corps.
Tank T-90 Bhishma, NAG missile systems, infantry combat vehicles, all-terrain vehicles, weapon locating radar system 'Swathi', drone jammer system, and medium-range surface-to-air missile were among the key displays by the mechanised columns.
The all-women tri-service contingent, led by Captain Sandhya of Army Military Police, with three supernumerary officers Captain Sharanya Rao, Sub Lieutenant Anshu Yadav and Flight Lieutenant Shrishti Rao drew huge applause.
Another all-women Armed Forces Medical Services contingent, headed by Major Srishti Khullar with Captain Amba Samant of the Army Dental Corps, Surgeon Lieutenant Kanchana of the Indian Navy and Flight Lieutenant Dhivya Priya of the Indian Air Force also marched down the ceremonial boulevard.
The Army's marching contingents included the Madras Regiment, the Grenadiers, the Rajputana Rifles, the Sikh Regiment and the Kumaon Regiment.
The Indian Navy's contingent consisted of 144 men and women Agniveers, led by Lt Prajwal M as contingent commander and Lt Mudita Goyal, Lt Sharvani Supreiya and Lt Devika H as platoon commanders.
It was followed by a naval tableau, depicting the themes 'Nari Shakti' and 'Sea Power Across the Oceans Through Indigenisation'.
The first part of the tableau showcased the women in the Indian Navy in all roles and ranks, while the second part depicted the very first indigenous Carrier Battle Group, comprising aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, her highly capable escort ships Delhi, Kolkata and Shivalik and the Kalvari class submarine and Rukmani satellite among others.
The Indian Air Force contingent comprised 144 airmen and four officers, and it was led by Squadron Leader Rashmi Thakur. Squadron Leaders Sumita Yadav and Pratiti Ahluwalia and Flight Lieutenant Kirti Rohil were the supernumerary officers.
The IAF tableau was themed 'Bharatiya Vayu Sena: Saksham, Sashakt, Aatmanirbhar'.
The tableau depicted LCA Tejas and Su-30 flying over the Indian Ocean Region and a C-295 transport aircraft being flown by women aircrew in the cockpit.
The GSAT-7A positioned on the tableau represented the IAF's incorporation of space technology in its operations.
The tableau showed that IAF has been at the forefront of rendering humanitarian aid, both within and across borders.
Another highlight of the parade was the veterans' tableau on the theme 'Rashtra Nirmaan: Pehle Bhi, Ab Bhi, Aage Bhi aur Hamesha'. It showcased the bravery and sacrifices of the ex-servicemen towards the nation.
In its tableau, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) displayed many home-grown critical systems and technologies developed by it.
The tableau was based on the theme of women power in protecting the nation by providing the defence shield in all the five domains of land, air, sea, cyber and space.
Outstanding scientist Sunita Devi Jena was the contingent commander, with P Laxmi Madhavi, J Sujana Choudhary and A Bhuvaneswari also present on the tableau.
The tableau displayed a man-portable anti-tank guided missile, anti-satellite missile, Agni-5, surface-to-surface ballistic missile, very short range air defence system, naval anti-ship missile'short range (NASM-SR) and anti-tank guided missile 'HELINA'.
Quick reaction surface-to-air missile (QRSAM), Astra, Light Combat Aircraft 'Tejas', Uttam active electronically scanned array radar (AESAR), advanced electronic warfare system and Shakti Cyber Security systems were also on display.
The themes of the celebrations were -- 'Viksit Bharat' and 'Bharat -- Loktantra Ki Matruka' (India--Mother of Democracy). A 95-member marching contingent and a 30-member band contingent from France also took part in the parade.
Two Rafale fighters and an Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport aircraft of the French air force also featured in the celebrations.
The celebrations ended with a jaw-dropping flypast by 46 aircraft of the Indian Air Force.
The IAF fleet included 29 fighter jets, seven transport aircraft, nine helicopters and one heritage plane. All these aircraft operated from six different bases.
Fifteen women pilots, including six from the fighter streams, operated the IAF platforms during the fly-past.
For the first time, indigenously-built Tejas aircraft flew in a formation of four aircraft.
There was a previous occasion of one Tejas jet being part of the Republic Day parade but this was the first time that the aircraft flew in a formation."

The directive to the varsity authorities was conveyed by the Union minister through the Assam chief minister's office, he claimed.
""I wanted to come to your university and address you, listen to you, understand what you are facing. But what happened is that the Home minister of India called up the Chief Minister of Assam and the CMO called up the leadership of the university and said that Rahul Gandhi must not be allowed to speak to the students,"" Gandhi said, addressing students and others from atop his Yatra bus in the Assam-Meghalaya border.
Gandhi was scheduled to hold separate interactions with students, civil society members and party leaders at the University of Science and Technology, Meghalaya, (USTM) in Meghalaya's Ri Bhoi district, bordering Assam, on Tuesday morning.
The programmes at the private varsity were announced by the Congress on Monday afternoon but were re-scheduled to a hotel, also in Ri Bhoi district, later after the university withdrew the permission.
Gandhi is leading a Manipur-to-Mumbai Nyay Yatra of the party, which entered Assam from Meghalaya on Tuesday for the second and final leg of its travel through the state. It will travel through Assam till January 25.
""It is not important if Rahul Gandhi comes or not. What is important is that you are allowed to listen to anybody you want,"" he said.
""Rahul Gandhi coming here is the least important thing happening here. It is about you having an imagination, being allowed to do what you want,"" he said, appreciating the students and youth who lined the road to listen to him.
""You have come here because you do not agree with what the chief minister is trying to do. You are not ready to accept an enslaved Assam and I am extremely proud of that,"" he added.
""They want to turn you into slaves but I know that nobody, no power in the universe can do it,"" Gandhi asserted, while attacking the BJP.
He also maintained that ""this is happening not only in Assam but in every school, college, university of India"", where the students are ""being not allowed to have their own imagination"".
""You are the future of the country and the most important thing for the country is that all of you are allowed to think freely, to believe freely, to imagine freely, to live the life you want and not somebody else wants,"" the MP added.
He maintained that there are attempts to make the youth ""blindly obedient"".
Gandhi asserted that the youth must be able to follow their own imagination and ""nobody should be allowed to prevent you from imagining and thinking about the India that you want"".
""Nobody should be able to stop you from reading and writing any language you want, nobody should be able to stop you from listening, reading your tradition, culture or history"", the Congress leader added.

“What is the purpose of Rahul Gandhi’s programme in Bengal? His political programme would not yield any dividend here for the Congress. Trinamul is strong enough to put the BJP in a soup in this state. Rahul should concentrate on other states where they are weak,” said Udayan Guha, a Trinamul leader from Cooch Behar and the north Bengal development minister.
Rahul’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, which started from Manipur 12 days ago, will enter Bengal through Basirhat in Cooch Behar district on Thursday.
Fingers are crossed over the success of the yatra in Bengal following Mamata’s declaration that Trinamul would go it alone in the Lok Sabha polls. The Trinamul chairperson said she hadn’t been even informed that Rahul would be coming to Bengal.
Taking a cue from the chief’s statement, Guha said: “The Congress has a poor organisational base in Bengal. Some people may go to see Rahul only because he is the grandson of Indira Gandhi and the son of Rajiv Gandhi. But we doubt if the people would be joining the Congress yatra to prevent the BJP in the state.”
There are apprehensions that Mamata’s comments would trigger some unpleasant developments along the route through which the yatra passes.
“Following the announcement by the Trinamul chief, you never know if overenthusiastic Trinamul supporters will try to wave black flags at the yatra or come up with other forms of protest,” said an observer.
After a day’s walk, the yatra will pause for two days and will resume on January 28 to pass through Siliguri. The following day, the yatra will enter Kishanganj in Bihar and will return to Bengal through Malda and Murshidabad districts.
Murshidabad is the last bastion of the Congress in Bengal. The state party chief, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, is the MP of the Behrampore Lok Sabha seat in the district.
“Instead of wasting time in Bengal, Rahul should spare more time for the northern and the southern states to strengthen the battle against the BJP,” Guha said.
Mamata is scheduled to visit Cooch Behar on January 29, merely four days after Rahul’s political programme in the district.
Md. Salim, state CPM secretary, alleged that Mamata’s decision to go alone in Bengal had actually been dictated by the RSS. “She has been speaking against the Congress, the CPM and the INDIA coalition following a directive from the RSS,” said Salim.
“In Bengal, the Congress has to decide whether it wants our support for the Nyay Yatra. Our condition is that the Congress must not take the support from the corrupt Trinamul that has always thwarted nyay (justice) in the state,” the CPM state secretary said in Malda."

On Sunday, the Congress launched a campaign in the districts of Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and North Dinajpur, inviting people to join the yatra. The party, however, bypassed questions about Trinamul, which, like the Congress, is a constituent of the INDIA bloc.
“AICC is looking into the issue. We want people from all walks of life, who believe in the Congress’s ideology and activities, to join the yatra. They can be from any political party,” said Pinaki Sengupta, the Jalpaiguri district Congress president.
On January 28, Rahul will attend a road show in Dhupguri. He will also walk in Jalpaiguri town and in the afternoon, will leave for Siliguri.
Ever since the Congress has announced the yatra, there is no clarity as to whether it will invite Trinamul. In the Trinamul camp, leaders have maintained that they have not received any invitation. Also, a section of leaders in Mamata Banerjee’s party have said that they will not join the yatra unless a decision is reached among the parties over the sharing of seats in Bengal.
In Bengal, Trinamul has offered two Lok Sabha seats — Malda South and Berhampore — to the Congress which the party had won in 2019. The  Congress, however, wants more seats like Darjeeling, Raiganj and Purulia.
A senior Congress functionary in Siliguri asserted that considering the strict stand taken by Trinamul against them in Bengal, most Congress leaders and workers don't want Trinamul to be a part of the yatra.
“Even a couple of days back, chief minister Mamata Banerjee has instructed her party leaders in Murshidabad to intensify political activities ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. This clearly shows that they are not ready to relent or leave any space for us. This is why many leaders and workers of our party don’t want Trinamul in the yatra. We also want to assess our organisational strength and support base through the event, especially in north Bengal,” said the leader.
On Sunday, the Congress also released the detailed itinerary of Rahul Gandhi in north Bengal. There will be a break in the yatra on January 26 and 27, they confirmed, while adding that it would resume from Falakata in Alipurduar district on January 28.
“On January 29, the yatra will enter Bihar via Kishanganj. It will again enter Bengal (in Malda district) from Bihar on January 31,” said a Congress leader."

“Tonight’s results confirm Donald Trump has all but locked up the Republican nomination, and the election denying, anti-freedom MAGA movement has completed its takeover of the Republican Party,” Biden-Harris 2024 Campaign Manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement.
Rodriguez said Trump is offering Americans the same extreme agenda that has cost Republicans election after election: promising to undermine American democracy, reward the wealthy on the backs of the middle class, and ban abortion nationwide.
“Joe Biden sees things differently. He’s fighting to grow our economy for the middle-class, strengthen our democracy, and protect the rights of every single American. While we work toward November 2024, one thing is increasingly clear today: Donald Trump is headed straight into a general election matchup where he’ll face the only person to have ever beaten him at the ballot box: Joe Biden,” she said.
“We acknowledge the outcome of the New Hampshire primary, where Donald Trump has seemingly secured the Republican nomination. It reflects the prevailing influence of the MAGA movement within the Republican Party,"" said Democratic community leader Ajay Bhutoria in a separate statement.
""In contrast to Trump's agenda, which has faced criticism for undermining democracy and prioritising the wealthy over the middle class, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have demonstrated a commitment to economic growth, job creation, and restoring American leadership on the world stage,"" he said.
""It is increasingly evident today that Donald Trump is poised for a general election showdown. He will face the only individual who has previously triumphed over him at the ballot box: Joe Biden. And Indian Americans and South Asians remain steadfast in our support for the Biden-Harris campaign and their vision for a stronger, more inclusive America,"" he said.

QBALSZ1CDN_XB50O4DVT5S7LFU,I cannot go to Sankardeva's birthplace but others can during a law and order crisis: Rahul Gandhi,"PTI Nagaon (Assam) Published 22.01.24, 02:09 PM","PTI Nagaon (Assam) Published 22.01.24, 02:09 PM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/i-cannot-go-to-sankardevas-birthplace-but-others-can-during-a-law-and-order-crisis-rahul-gandhi/cid/1995464,"During a law and order crisis, everyone can go to the birthplace of Vaishnav saint Srimanta Sankardeva, only ''Rahul Gandhi cannot go'', the Congress leader said in Assam's Nagaon on Monday.
Gandhi was stopped at Haibargaon en route to the sattra (Sankardeva's birthplace) where he along with senior Congress leaders and supporters staged a dharna while party MP Gaurav Gogoi and Batadrava MLA Sibamoni Bora proceeded to the birthplace to resolve the issue.
After they returned, Gandhi told reporters that just like Sankardeva, ''we also believe in bringing people together and not spreading hatred''.
''He is like a guru to us and gives us direction. So I had thought when I came to Assam, I should offer my respects to him'', he said.
He said they had received an invitation on January 11 but ''on Sunday we were told that there is a law and order situation'', he added.
''This is strange as there is a law and order situation in the area, but Gaurav Gogoi and all can go but only Rahul Gandhi cannot go'', Gandhi said.
''There may be some reason but I will go to Batadrava when I get an opportunity. It is my belief that both Assam and the entire nation should follow the path shown by Sankardeva'', he said.
The managing committee of the Sri Sankardeva Sattra on Sunday had announced that they will not allow the Congress leader to visit the sattra before 3pm on January 22 after Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier in the day said at a press conference that he requested Gandhi not to visit before the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.
Gogoi, who visited the sattra along with Bora, said that there was no crowd in and around the premises and ''it was absolutely empty''.
''A lie and rumour was spread that a law and order situation could have risen if Gandhi had visited the place. The chief minister has stamped a black spot in the history of Batadrava and the legacy of Sri Sankardeva'', the Congress MP from Kaliabor said.
''We offered prayers of peace and harmony on behalf of Rahulji and all the 'pujaris' who were present on the premises extended their blessings to him'', he said.
The pujaris told ''us that they were told that a law and order situation may arise as many organisations have planned events on the premises on the occasion of the consecration of Ram temple but we found it absolutely empty'', Gogoi added.
''The situation was absolutely peaceful in the area but the administration spread a lie regarding the crowd and the law and order condition'', he said.
Gogoi said as they were coming out of the sattra, a woman member came and presented them with a 'gamosa' (scarf) for Rahul Gandhi ''which we have handed over to him while the 'pujaris' said that they will send the 'prasad' (offerings) after they finish their prayers''.
Gandhi and his entourage had started for the sattra in the morning but were stopped at Haibargaon with Nagaon SP Navaneet Mahanta and additional district commissioner Lakhyajyoti Das explaining why he could not be allowed to visit the sattra.
Gandhi questioned police on why he was being stopped from visiting the sattra.
""Will PM Modi now decide who will visit a temple and when,"" Gandhi said.
""We do not want to create any problems, simply pray at the sattra,"" Gandhi told police.
Tight security arrangements, deployment of a huge police force and blockade of roads was in force around the sattra.
AICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh said the authorities had told Gandhi that there could be a law and order problem and when he (Gandhi) offered to go alone, the request was turned down.
''It is clear that it is their deliberate policy to prevent him from going to the holy place which occupies a place of social, cultural and religious importance for all'', Ramesh said.
Following this, a lot of phone calls were made by the authorities and then Gogoi and Bora were allowed to proceed to the sattra to talk with the members of the managing committee to resolve the issue and ensure Gandhi's visit to the sacred place.
Ramesh asserted Modi exerted pressure on the Assam government to prevent Gandhi from visiting the birthplace of Sankardeva to pay his obeisance.
''We were given permission to visit the sattra on January 11 and the managing committee had welcomed the visit but suddenly on January 20, we were told that he could visit only after the consecration of Ram temple was over'', he said.
It is clear that ''the arrogant powers want the entire focus of the camera on them and pressure was exerted on the Assam government to take this step'', he said.
Ramesh said that the yatra will resume on the planned route from 2pm.

QEEUEQEX6H_PLV05HFRLW7FQPP,Insurance reimbursements fail to protect breast cancer patients from financial hardship,"G.S. Mudur New Delhi Published 22.01.24, 06:46 AM","G.S. Mudur New Delhi Published 22.01.24, 06:46 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/insurance-reimbursements-fail-to-protect-breast-cancer-patients-from-financial-hardship/cid/1995337,"The reimbursements that government-funded and private health insurance schemes now provide do not protect breast cancer patients in India from financial hardship associated with the treatment and related costs, health researchers have said.
This is particularly so because non-medical expenses on accommodation, food or travel directly related to treatment — but not covered under insurance schemes — made up 44 per cent of the overall costs, the researchers found. Medical costs account for the remaining 56 per cent.
The researchers have found that reimbursement levels ranged from 92 per cent of medical costs from private insurance schemes to 63 per cent of medical costs from government-funded schemes.
Their study — which scrutinised the expenses incurred by a sample of 429 patients under treatment at the Tata Memorial Centre (TMC) — is the first in the country to measure costs through the duration of treatment, which lasted over a year for some patients.
“Our results underline the need for higher caps in the insurance packages for breast cancer,” said Tabassum Wadasadawala, professor of radiation oncology at the TMC’s Advanced Centre for Treatment Research and Education in Cancer, Navi Mumbai.
For the full sample of patients, the average out-of-pocket expenditure incurred — that is, the non-medical costs plus the un-reimbursed medical costs — was Rs 186,000. It was lower for patients covered by government-funded schemes and higher for patients covered by private insurance.
Only eight per cent of the patients received full reimbursement. The study has been published in The Lancet Regional Health Southeast Asia.
The large proportion of non-medical costs appears to reflect the need for patients to travel for treatment.
About 55 per cent of the patients who had sought treatment at the TMC came from other states, mainly Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
The researchers found that the average medical treatment costs ranged from Rs 94,000 for patients covered by government-funded insurance to Rs 258,000 for patients covered by employee insurance schemes and Rs 336,000 for patients under private insurance.
The average reimbursement levels were Rs 59,000 (63 per cent of the medical costs) for patients covered by government-funded insurance, Rs 196,000 (76 per cent) for patients covered by employee insurance schemes, and Rs 308,000 (92 per cent) for patients with private insurance.
“The reason for such large differences in the reimbursement levels across different schemes is unclear,” said Suraj Maiti, a project scientist at the International Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, and a member of the study team. “This could be a subject of future research.”
The sample of patients included 11 covered by the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PMJAY), a flagship scheme launched by the Narendra Modi government that offers poor households up to Rs 500,000 annually to cover hospitalisation costs.
Doctors say the treatment costs for breast cancer in other large private hospitals could be higher than those documented by the TMC study. One indicator comes from the relatively higher medical treatment costs for the richest households in the TMC sample.
“The findings suggest that the higher the patients’ ability to pay, the larger the costs they’ll incur,” Maiti said.
The other team members were Sudeep Gupta, Tejaswi Kanala, Namita Puchali, Rajiv Sarin and Vani Parmar from the TMC and Sanjay Mohanty and Soumendu Sen from the IIPS."

“The fear of BJP is surfacing because they have now called NCP’s Rohit Pawar for questioning,” Patole told reporters here.
Karjat Jamkhed MLA Rohit Pawar, the grand nephew of NCP founder Sharad Pawar, appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) here on Wednesday for questioning in connection with its money laundering probe into the alleged Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank scam, an official said earlier.
The probe stems from an August 2019 FIR of the Mumbai Police’s Economic Offences Wing. The ED had conducted searches on January 5 on the of Baramati Agro, a company owned by Rohit Pawar, and some linked entities in Baramati, Pune, Aurangabad and some other locations.
The opposition has repeatedly accused the BJP of misusing agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ED to target rivals.
The NCP faction under Sharad Pawar, Congress and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) are partners in the opposition bloc Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Maharashtra.
Patole said the Congress is holding division-wise review meetings in the state ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.
“Our organisation is strong till the booth level. We will fix lacunae, if any, during these meetings. Maha Vikas Aghadi will win the most number of seats in the Lok Sabha polls,” he said.
Maharashtra sends 48 MPs to the Lok Sabha, second after UP’s 80.
In the 2019 general elections, the BJP had won in 23 constituencies, followed by the undivided Shiv Sena, which bagged 18 seats. While the NCP had won four seats, one seat each went to Congress, AIMIM and an independent candidate.

“It is an opportunity for our workers to work in another country. They will get over Rs 1.30 lakh per month as salary besides other benefits. We want a large number of people of the state to grab this chance to earn better,” state labour minister Anil Rajbhar said.
The minority cell of the Uttar Pradesh Congress has written to governor Anandiben Patel, demanding an immediate halt to the recruitment drive because “it is a bad practice to provide manpower to a country which is at war with another country”.
“It is also a proof that India is unable to provide employment to its poor people and luring them to go to a country which is engulfed in strife,” said Shahnawaz Alam, a leader of the minority cell.
The Israeli construction companies had asked its government to allow them to hire about one lakh Indian workers to replace the 90,000 Palestinians whose work permits had been cancelled since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7.
Rajbhar said candidates turned up in large numbers on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The skills of 629 shortlisted workers from Agra, Kanpur and Lucknow weretested on Tuesday and 585 workers from Banda and Azamgarh districts on Wednesday at the Industrial Training Institute in Aliganj, the minister said.
On Thursday, 563 workers from Devipatan, Bareilly, Jhansi, Moradabad and Noida will be interviewed. On Friday, 565 workers from Varanasi, Mirzapur, Meerut and Ghaziabad will be evaluated. A total of 877 applicants from Gorakhpur and 739 from Ayodhya and Saharanpur will be interviewed on January 29. On January 30, 603 aspirants of Aligarh, Basti and Prayagraj are to be tested.
Rajbhar said it was a central scheme executed through the National Skill Development Corporation and the Uttar Pradesh government had decided to send 10,000 workers, mostly masons, carpenters and iron welders, to Israel."

The creative artwork signifies how the ceremonial parade would have been seen on screens across these decades.
India became independent in 1947 and a republic on January 26, 1950.
From big TV sets with cathode ray tubes to smaller ones and eventually, to smartphones, a lot has changed in India in these years.
The doodle depicts two TV sets and a mobile phone, with the letter 'G' on the left face of the first analogue television set, and the screens of the sets forming the two 'O's of 'GOOGLE'.
The remaining three letters 'G', 'L' and 'E' of the Google logo are displayed on the screen of the mobile handset placed in that order.
The first TV screen depicts scenes of the parade in black and white while the second one shows a camel contingent in colour, signifying the transition in technology.

“It is an opportunity for our workers to work in another country. They will get over Rs 1.30 lakh per month as salary besides other benefits. We want a large number of people of the state to grab this chance to earn better,” state labour minister Anil Rajbhar said.
The minority cell of the Uttar Pradesh Congress has written to governor Anandiben Patel, demanding an immediate halt to the recruitment drive because “it is a bad practice to provide manpower to a country which is at war with another country”.
“It is also a proof that India is unable to provide employment to its poor people and luring them to go to a country which is engulfed in strife,” said Shahnawaz Alam, a leader of the minority cell.
The Israeli construction companies had asked its government to allow them to hire about one lakh Indian workers to replace the 90,000 Palestinians whose work permits had been cancelled since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7.
Rajbhar said candidates turned up in large numbers on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The skills of 629 shortlisted workers from Agra, Kanpur and Lucknow weretested on Tuesday and 585 workers from Banda and Azamgarh districts on Wednesday at the Industrial Training Institute in Aliganj, the minister said.
On Thursday, 563 workers from Devipatan, Bareilly, Jhansi, Moradabad and Noida will be interviewed. On Friday, 565 workers from Varanasi, Mirzapur, Meerut and Ghaziabad will be evaluated. A total of 877 applicants from Gorakhpur and 739 from Ayodhya and Saharanpur will be interviewed on January 29. On January 30, 603 aspirants of Aligarh, Basti and Prayagraj are to be tested.
Rajbhar said it was a central scheme executed through the National Skill Development Corporation and the Uttar Pradesh government had decided to send 10,000 workers, mostly masons, carpenters and iron welders, to Israel."

Israel has ordered residents to leave a swathe of downtown Khan Younis that includes Nasser and two smaller hospitals as it pushes ahead with its three-month-old offensive against Hamas.
The UN humanitarian office said the area was home to 88,000 Palestinians and was hosting another 425,000 displaced by fighting elsewhere.
The aid group Doctors Without Borders said its staff was trapped inside Nasser Hospital with some 850 patients and thousands of displaced people because the surrounding roads were inaccessible or too dangerous. Nasser Hospital is one of only two hospitals in southern Gaza that can still treat critically ill patients, the group said. Gaza’s health ministry also said the hospital had been isolated.
The Israeli military said its forces were battling militants inside Khan Younis after completing their encirclement of the city the day before. It said aircraft were striking targets as part of the operations there and had also targeted suspected militants in central and northern Gaza.
Thousands of people fled south from Khan Younis on Tuesday toward the town of Rafah. The UN says some 1.5 million people — around two-thirds of Gaza’s population — are crowded into shelters and tent camps in and around Rafah, which is on the border with Egypt.
Even there, Palestinians have found little safety, with Israel regularly carrying out strikes in and around the town. Palestinian witnesses said that in recent days Israeli soldiers and tanks had pushed into parts of Muwasi, a sandy area along the coast that Israel had declared a safe zone, where tens of thousands of people were living in tents without basic services.
In all, some 1.7 million people have been displaced within Gaza, according to the UN refugee agency. Most have fled from the north, where Israel’s air and ground offensive has reduced entire neighbourhoods to shelled-out wastelands, raising the question of whether residents will ever be able to return.
Gaza’s health ministry says the offensive has killed at least 25,490 people — the majority women and children — and wounded another 63,354. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. UN officials have expressed fears that even more people could die from the disease, with at least one-quarter of the population facing starvation.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead with the offensive until “complete victory” against Hamas, which started the war with its assault across the border on October 7, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250.
Israeli divisions
Netanyahu says Israel is also committed to returning the over 100 hostages that remain in captivity after most of the others were freed in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners during a November ceasefire.
But many Israelis, including at least one member of Netanyahu’s war cabinet, say that’s impossible without reaching another agreement with Hamas. The militant group says it won’t release any more hostages until Israel ends its offensive."

Haley, 52, has attacked Trump, 77, and questioned his ""mental competency"".
“The other day, Donald Trump accused me of not providing security at the Capitol on January 6th. I’ve long called for mental competency tests for politicians over the age of 75. Trump claims he’d do better than me on one of those tests. Maybe he would, and maybe he wouldn’t. But if he thinks that, then he should have no problem standing on a debate stage with me!” Haley said in her speech after the results started coming in.
On Tuesday, Trump won the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary with 53.1 per cent of the votes and Indian-American Haley trailed with 45.8 per cent when over 40 per cent of the votes polled were counted.
Haley performed better than expected but she lost to Trump. The Republican primary now moves to South Carolina, the home State of Nikki Haley. However, Trump is polling ahead of Haley.
Haley told her supporters that with Trump, Republicans have lost almost every competitive election.
“We lost the Senate. We lost the House. We lost the White House. We lost in 2018, in 2020 and in 2022. The worst-kept secret in politics is how badly the Democrats want to run against Trump. They know Trump is the only Republican in the country who Biden can defeat,” she said.
“You can’t fix the mess if you don’t win the election. A Trump nomination is a Biden win and a Kamala Harris presidency. I defeat Biden handily,” she claimed.
“With Donald Trump, you have one bout of chaos after another. This court case, that controversy, this tweet, that senior moment. You can’t fix Joe Biden’s chaos with Republican chaos,” she said.
“But if he thinks that, then he should have no problem standing on a debate stage with me!  Most Americans do not want a rematch between Biden and Trump. The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to win this election. I say it should be the Republicans! So our fight is not over, because we have a country to save,” Haley said.
Haley said in the next two months, millions of voters in over twenty states will have their say.
“We should honour them and allow them to vote. And guess what, in the next two months, Joe Biden isn’t going to get any younger or any better. We’ll have all the time we need to beat Biden,” she said.
In his speech, Trump told his supporters that Haley would never get the nomination and if she did, she would be under investigation.

Yadav New Delhi Published 22.01.24, 06:08 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/before-heading-to-ayodhya-pm-modi-visits-the-starting-point-of-the-ram-setu/cid/1995339,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday visited Arichal Munai in Tamil Nadu, the “starting point of the Ram Setu”, a day before he heads to Ayodhya for the Ram temple consecration, signalling the centrality of Modi and Ram to the BJP’s general election campaign in the north and south.
“Had the opportunity to be at Arichal Munai, which holds a special significance in Prabhu Shri Ram’s life. It is the starting point of the Ram Setu,” Modi posted on X with pictures of him praying against the background of the Indian Ocean.
As in Arichal Munai, Modi will be the cynosure at the Ayodhya spectacle on Monday with the veteran campaigners of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, BJP stalwarts L.K. Advani (96) and Murli Manohar Joshi (90), pushed to the sidelines.
Neither Advani, who led the Somnath-to-Ayodhya Rath Yatra in 1990, nor Joshi — a witness to the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 along with Advani — will attend the consecration ceremony in Ayodhya despite being invited.
“Advaniji has cancelled his trip in view of the severe cold weather and fog,” Deepak Chopra, secretary to Advani, told The Telegraph.
Sources at Joshi’s home said he would not go, either, but cited no reason. “Only Joshiji can say why he is not going,” the person who took the call said, without identifying himself.
Amid the fanfare over Monday’s event, the BJP kept up its attack on the Opposition.
“Identify these unrighteous people! Those who oppose Ram temple, insult Sanatan Dharma,” the party wrote on X, posting images of almost all the main Opposition leaders.
The Congress was singled out for a separate, more scathing, salvo.
“Congress has refused to attend the consecration of Ram Lalla on Jan 22, but did not shy away from visiting the grave of Babar, under whose leadership the Ram temple of Ayodhya was demolished,” the party posted on X.
Accompanying the post was a video with a voiceover that claimed that Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi had visited Babar’s grave in Afghanistan.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman too joined in, accusing the DMK government in Tamil Nadu of being “anti-Hindu”.
She claimed the state government had “banned watching live telecast” of the Ram temple inauguration – a charge denied as “false information” by P.K. Sekar Babu, DMK leader and Tamil Nadu minister for Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HC&CE).
“TN govt has banned watching live telecast of #AyodhaRamMandir programmes of 22 Jan 24. In TN there are over 200 temples for Shri Ram. In HR&CE managed temples no puja/ bhajan/ prasadam/ annadanam in the name of Shri Ram is allowed. Police are stopping privately held temples also from organising events,” Sitharaman posted on X.
Babu issued a statement saying: “Strongly condemn the spreading of false information.... The HR & CE department hasn’t introduced any limitations on devotees freedom to offer food, conduct poojas in the name of Shri Ram....”
He accused Sitharaman of “purposefully propagating the erroneous information”.
Modi, who has undertaken an 11-day “special ritual” to prepare himself for the temple consecration, has been leading a campaign to turn Ram into a national deity with special focus on the Opposition-ruled southern states.
“Frankly, we are amazed by the fervour generated over the Ram temple Pran Pratistha. The euphoria in the southern states has particularly excited us. It’s beyond our expectations,” a BJP leader said, giving the sole credit to Modi.
“The way Modiji has used Ram and the Ram temple to spread the Hindutva spirit in the southern states, we are confident of reaping benefits in the elections.”
Most southern states, barring Karnataka and to some extent Telangana, have so far resisted the appeal of Modi.
Party managers said this was just the beginning and, after Monday’s consecration, the BJP would exploit the euphoria over the Ram temple to the hilt in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, expected in April-May.
The BJP and other Sangh Parivar outfits have decided to ferry thousands of people to Ayodhya daily on special trains for “Ram Lalla darshan”.
The railways have announced 200 “Aastha Special” trains to Ayodhya from across the country after January 22.
“The special trains will run for nearly a month. Our target is to ensure that by the time the elections are announced, crores of people have already visited Ayodhya,” a BJP leader said.
He said the pilgrims who return from Ayodhya would be expected to amplify the BJP agenda ahead of the general election."
QOHFENV5DS_2ZJVP0UQMZV3KQP,PM Narendra Modi seeks youngsters' suggestions for BJP manifesto for 2024 Lok Sabha polls,"PTI New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 05:10 PM","PTI New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 05:10 PM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/prime-minister-narendra-modi-asks-young-voters-to-defeat-parivarwadi-parties-seeks-suggestions-for-bjp-manifesto-for-2024-lok-sabha-polls/cid/1996153,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi Thursday pitched for electing a stable government with a strong majority and asked young voters to defeat family-run parties in the Lok Sabha polls, asserting that their votes will decide the course of India's direction and approach.
In a virtual address to young voters organised by the youth wing of the ruling BJP, Modi said his government took the country out of the darkness staring at youngsters 10-12 years back. The young generation at that time had given up hope on the possibilities being created now, he said.
Modi asked the youngsters to send their suggestions for the BJP's manifesto for the elections, expected in April-May, to him through the NaMo app, saying he would meet with some of them whose ideas are good and workable.
The prime minister presented a grim assessment of the Congress and other opposition parties without naming them and highlighted the changes effected by his government after coming to power in 2014. He said corruption and scams used to make the headlines back then but the talk these days is about credibility and success stories in different sectors.
""It is Modi's guarantee that your dreams are my resolve,"" he said, asserting that youngsters have always been his priority and that a host of development schemes like 'Digital India', 'Start-up India' and reforms in various fields besides the massive spending in infrastructure have created limitless opportunities for them.
His government has been working day and night to fulfil their dreams and boost their capabilities, Modi said, stressing that he has always had trust in them. First-time voters support the BJP's development agenda, he added.
Taking a swipe at opposition parties, Modi said youngsters are against corruption and ""parivarwaad"" (nepotism), adding that family-run parties never allow other youngsters to move ahead.
""The mindset of the leaders of these parties is anti-youth. You have to defeat these family parties with the strength of your votes,"" he said in the address on the occasion of the National Voters' Day.
The presence of a stable and strong-majority government at the Centre in the last 10 years led to big decisions and the resolution of issues pending for decades, Modi said, citing the abrogation of Article 370, GST roll-out, reservation for women in the Lok Sabha and assemblies and the end to the practice of instant triple talaq among Muslims.
In this context, he also mentioned the recent consecration ceremony at the Ram temple in Ayodhya.
With young voters listening in from over 5,000 locations across the country, Modi said they have the responsibility of making India a developed nation in the next 25 years in the same way the young generation fought for its freedom during the 25 years before Independence.
Due to the presence of a stable and strong government, India's prestige has reached a new high globally, he said. ""India stands strong and resilient, more than ever before. This is the power of a majority government,"" the prime minister said.
""Your one vote and the direction of the country's development are intertwined. Your one vote will make India the third-largest economy in the world. Your one vote will bring a stable government enjoying a big majority. Your one vote will further speed up reforms and land India in a space on its own."" 	Noting that India will celebrate its 75th Republic Day on Friday, the prime minister told the young voters that theirs and the country's next 25 years were very important as he asked them to make choices that would guide it towards development.
India's strong infrastructure today is proving to be the biggest driver for growth, he said.
""From regional connectivity to communication, from mobile towers to optical fibre network, from semi-conductors mission to Mission Hydrogen, from aviation sector to tourism sector – every transformation taking place in the country is for the youth of the nation, for you,"" Modi added.
This is perhaps the first time, Modi said, that any leader in the world has connected with such a large number of young voters.
The prime minister said it was his government that implemented the new education policy and also protected the interests of SCs, STs and OBCs while ensuring 10 per cent reservation for the poor among the general class.

The Trinamul Congress (TMC) is open to ""courtesy back-channel"" talks but there is hardly any hope left for reaching a pact, they said.
Maintaining that TMC had offered two Lok Sabha seats to the Congress in West Bengal, a senior party leader said it is open to discussing a third seat, provided Congress agrees to give the TMC seats in Meghalaya and Assam.
The TMC leader accused the Congress of causing ""unreasonable delay"" in seat-sharing discussions, saying no communication has happened in the last two weeks.
The leader also alleged that the Congress was making unreasonable demands in terms of the number of seats without acknowledging the ground reality of Bengal.
The TMC had suggested a formula for deciding seat sharing based on the results of previous elections, and the offer the party made to Congress was based on that criteria.
Much damage was also done due to the statements made by Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who had recently called the West Bengal chief minister an 'opportunist' and also said that the Congress would fight the polls on its own, the sources said.
While the TMC has not announced exiting the INDIA grouping, the leader added that there is very little chance of seat sharing in the state with the Congress.
The TMC is also skipping the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra of the Congress, even as the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is likely to attend it.
A TMC source claimed that they were not invited by Congress to attend the Yatra.
The INDIA bloc received twin setbacks on Wednesday with chief ministers Mamata Banerjee and Bhagwant Mann ruling out an alliance with the Congress in their respective states of West Bengal and Punjab for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
“I had given them (Congress) a proposal (on seat sharing) but they refused it at the outset. Our party has now decided to go alone in Bengal,” Banerjee said amid the seat-sharing tussle between the Congress and the TMC.
The CM also asserted that she has not spoken to anyone in the Congress on the seat-sharing issue.

John, too, was excited about the prospect of teaming up with “the incredibly talented Shruti on an emotional rollercoaster of a story set in Chennai and Cardiff”.
“With the support of BFI, this film brings a whole new collaboration to international film production while also bringing a fresh, underexplored Wales and India to the big screen,” the filmmaker said.
Based on Timeri N. Murari’s 2004 book The Arrangements of Love, Chennai story is co-produced by Guru Films (India), Ripple World Pictures (UK) and ie ie Productions (Wales). The film will be made under the bilateral UK-India co-production treaty.
John has co-written the screenplay of the movie with Nimmi Harasgama. BAFTA-winning cinematographer Graham Frake is also a part of the project."

While a border fence has long been sought by security agencies, the move to build it now poses questions on New Delhi’s responsibilities towards its own citizens, its relationship with the military junta that rules Myanmar, and Indian federalism. The free movement regime has allowed people to cross the border up to 16 kilometres for a day without any documents, and up to 72 hours with permits issued by the authorities. It has particularly benefited the Kuki-Zo community that lives on both sides of the border. But as New Delhi has failed to stem the violence that has raged in Manipur since May last year, the government of the state has repeatedly accused illegal Kuki-Zo immigrants from Myanmar of stoking tensions between the ethnic community’s local population and the majority Meitei community. The Manipur government has backed the plan to fence the border. Yet, there is little evidence to suggest that such a move would stop the violence in Manipur at a time when the state and central governments refuse to acknowledge and correct their own documented biases and failures in dealing with the crisis.
Even as India plans to seal its border with Myanmar, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears content to continue with a business-as-usual attitude towards the rulers of the neighbouring nation. If, indeed, Myanmar is failing to help India maintain security along their 1,643 km border, New Delhi needs to rethink that relationship with a regime whose brutal crackdown on the Opposition, dissenters and multiple ethnic minorities is amplifying a refugee crisis that, in turn, affects India. Within India, Mr Modi’s government must also recognise that a fence will compound the humanitarian challenges for communities on both sides of the border. The governments of Mizoram and Nagaland, states that have significant Kuki-Zo populations, have opposed the fence. Mr Modi’s regime must consult and convince the impacted states about the need for a fence before proceeding with it. If the aim of the initiative is to strengthen India’s security, the government must avoid any step that deepens not only internal fissures along ethnic or state lines but also the stress on federalism."

Addressing a Republic Day function in Ludhiana, Mann said the tableaus which were ""rejected"" by the Centre were on Friday included as part of the parade in the state.
Mann also took on the Centre on some other issues and said Punjab is a very loyal state and a situation should not be created where this loyalty is mistrusted.
Recently, the chief minister had said the Narendra Modi government rejected the tableau of his state because of its ""anti-Punjab syndrome"".
The Centre has rejected as ""baseless"" Mann's criticism of the BJP-led government for not including the state's tableau in the Republic Day parade and his allegations of discrimination.
In a statement following Mann's allegations, the Ministry of Defence earlier said, ""The tableau proposal of Punjab was considered in the first three rounds of a meeting of the expert committee. After the third round... the tableau of Punjab could not be taken forward... for not aligning to the broader themes of this year's tableau."" 	At the Ludhiana Republic Day event, where he unfurled the national flag, Mann said Punjabis have made countless sacrifices for the motherland, fought wars and were at the forefront of the country's freedom struggle.
""But it is sad when Punjab's tableaus were not included in the Republic Day parade. Just now, we have taken out these tableaus here before you. Is there anything in them which is odd? These tableaus show photos of our prominent freedom fighters, our rich culture, sacrifices of our valiant heroes. Then how can you celebrate and imagine a Republic Day without them,"" he told the gathering.
Mann said Punjab meets the food needs of the nation. ""Our water table has gone down. And then they take cudgels, they tell us they won't give MSP,"" he said, attacking the Centre.
The chief minister said Punjab shares a 553-km-long border with Pakistan and ""drones, drugs, weapons keep coming in from there. We have to pay attention on that front too"".
""Punjab is a very loyal state. Kindly don't create such a situation, don't mistrust our loyalty,"" he added.
Mann also said that he was anguished with the Army not giving a guard of honour during the last rites of Agniveer Amritpal Singh, who died in Jammu and Kashmir on October 11 last year.
The chief minister later shared the news on the personal front too, saying, ""I want to make a personal announcement. In my home too, I am expecting the birth of a child in March. My wife Dr Gurpreet is seven-month pregnant... Our only wish is that be it a girl or a boy, the child should be healthy."" 	He further said his government was taking several steps to empower women. ""We believe in 'kaam ki rajneeti' and not 'naam ki rajneeti'. We have adopted the model of the Kejriwal government in Punjab too,"" Mann added.

RD7UO3E32R_NY9FMDLJFVGC4EH,‘Mass casualties’: Israeli tanks strike United Nations compound sheltering Palestinians,"Reuters Published 26.01.24, 07:17 AM","Reuters Published 26.01.24, 07:17 AM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/mass-casualties-israeli-tanks-strike-united-nations-compound-sheltering-palestinians/cid/1996248,"Israeli tanks struck a huge UN compound sheltering displaced Palestinians on Wednesday, causing “mass casualties”, the UN said, as Israeli forces battled their way into crowded parts of Gaza without letting people out first.
The attack, which the UN said hit a vocational training compound housing 30,000 displaced people in Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s main city, prompted rare outright condemnation from the US of an apparent Israeli military action.
“Mass casualties have taken place, some buildings are ablaze and there are reports of deaths. Many people are trying to flee the scene, but unable to do so,” UN humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territory, James McGoldrick, said.
Thomas White, director of Gaza affairs for the UN agency, UNRWA, said at least 12 people were killed and 75 wounded in a building housing 800. The agency’s head Philippe Lazzarini, reposting that statement, said the death toll was probably higher.
“The compound is a clearly marked UN facility and its coordinates were shared with Israeli Authorities as we do for all our facilities. Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,” Lazzarini said.
In Washington, the US state department spokesperson Vedant Patel said: “We deplore today’s attack on the UN’s Khan Younis training centre.” “Civilians must be protected, and the protected nature of UN facilities must be respected, and humanitarian workers must be protected so that they can continue providing civilians with the life-saving humanitarian assistance that they need,” Patel said.
Washington has raised concerns and asked Israel for information over incidents during the conflict, but has rarely been openly critical of a specific Israeli action.
Hours after the attack as night fell, UN staff were still unable to reach the area and all communications were shut down.
Israeli forces have launched their biggest ground offensive in at least a month, encircling the city which is housing hundreds of thousands of people who fled fighting elsewhere in Gaza. Residents say that unlike in previous Israeli assaults, announcements warning them to leave came only after the operation was underway and the main road out already shut.
The bulk of the 2.3 million-strong population of Gaza is now penned into Khan Younis and the towns just north and south of it. Palestinian officials say the Israelis have cut off and besieged the city’s main hospitals, making it impossible for rescuers to reach many of the wounded."

The bench of Justice Biswajit Basu also asked the WBBSE to inform it about the decision on Thursday, when the matter will be heard again.
The timing of the class 10 examinations of the West Bengal board, which will be held in February, was advanced by two hours, but no reason was cited. After the revision, the exams will begin at 9.45 am instead of the usual 11.45 am.
A teacher moved the court challenging a January 18 notification of the board rescheduling the time of commencement of the examination from 11.45 am to 9.45 am, claiming that it will inconvenience lakhs of students who will be appearing for the examinations at numerous centres across the state.
The petitioner submitted that with the examination scheduled to begin from February 2, such advancement of timing will affect the examinees.
He also stated that a decision on a January 19 representation to the president of the board seeking cancellation of the change in schedule is pending.
The court asked what prompted the WBBSE to change the timing for commencement of the examination from 11.45 am, a practice for years, to 9.45 am.
The state's counsel submitted that class 10 final examinations of several other boards begin at 10 am.
He said that all district magistrates have been asked to make special arrangements for transport and other facilities for the Madhyamik (class 10 board exam) examinees.
The board said that the first 15 minutes would be for reading the questions and students can start writing the answers from 10 am.
Stating that the court is only concerned about the convenience of the students, Justice Basu said he personally knows students who come from remote areas have to travel long distances to reach examination centres.
The examinations are held at schools other than the institution where an examinee studied.

The historic 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony will be attended by representatives of all major spiritual and religious sects of the country, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said.
People from all walks of life including representatives of various tribal communities will also attend the ceremony, it said.
Earlier in October, 2023, the prime minister had received the invitation from Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Trust for the 'Pran Pratishtha'  ceremony.
The prime minister will interact with 'shramjeevis' (workers) associated with the construction of Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir. He will also visit the Kuber Tila, where an ancient Shiv temple has been restored. He will also perform 'pooja' and 'darshan' at the restored temple, the statement said.
The Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir is constructed in traditional Nagara style – 380 feet in length (east-west), 250 feet wide and 161 feet tall.
The temple is supported by a total of 392 pillars and 44 doors. The pillars and walls of the temple showcase intricately sculpted depictions of Hindu deities, gods, and goddesses.
“In the main sanctum sanctorum at ground floor, the childhood form of Bhagwan Shri Ram (the idol of Shri Ramlalla) has been placed,” the statement said.
The main entrance to the temple is situated on the eastern side, which can be approached by ascending 32 stairs through the ‘Singh Dwar’.
There are a total of five halls in the temple - Nritya Mandap, Rang Mandap, Sabha Mandap, Prathana Mandap and Kirtan Mandap.
Near the temple is the Sita Koop, a historic well dating back to the ancient era, the statement said.
In the southwestern part of the temple complex, at Kuber Tila, the ancient Shiv temple has been restored along with the installation of a statue of Jatayu.
The foundation of the temple has been constructed with a 14-metre-thick layer of roller-compacted concrete (RCC), giving it the appearance of artificial rock. No iron is used anywhere in the temple, according to the statement.
For protection against ground moisture, a 21-foot-high plinth has been constructed using granite.
The temple complex has a sewage treatment plant, water treatment plant, water supply for fire safety and an independent power station.
The temple has been constructed employing the country's traditional and indigenous technology, the statement said.

Ambedkar that sparked violent protests in parts of the north Karnataka city of Gulbarga on Tuesday.
A resident had early on Tuesday found a garland of footwear placed around the bust of Ambedkar in Kotnur village on the outskirts of Gulbarga.
District police commissioner Chetan R. on Wednesday told a media conference in Gulbarga that the four arrested men were booked under various penal provisions for trying to spark a riot and hurting the sentiments of a community, and remanded in judicial custody.
The accused have been identified as Kiran, Hanumanth, Bhanu and Sangamesh. Efforts are on to trace a fifth accused who has been absconding since the incident. “The preliminary investigation points to a larger plan to trigger violence,” Chetan said.
Hundreds of locals rushed to the spot as the news of the desecration spread. Eventually, more people joined in a protest that brought life to a standstill in the area.
Protesters burnt tyres and allegedly forced shops to down shutters and vehicles to stay off the roads, demanding the arrest of the culprits. Many resorted to stone-pelting at shops.
State minister for IT, biotechnology and rural development, Priyank Kharge, who is in charge of Gulbarga and was present at the media conference, said it was not clear if the desecration had anything to do with the sentiments surrounding the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.
“I don’t know. The investigation is on,” he said.
But he added such acts of desecration were usually the handiwork of “Manuvadis”. Manuvadis are followers of the Manu Smriti, which the Sangh Parivar espouses.
“Whether it is a statue of Babasaheb Ambedkar or Basavanna (12th-century social reformer), it is usually the Manuvadis who engage in such acts. It’s not about which party they belong to. But Manuvadis are Manuvadis,” said Priyank, who had camped in the district after the desecration and the protests that followed.
The police commissioner said that the accused were identified and arrested by the three special teams formed to crack the case. “We will interrogate them again to get to the bottom of the case and arrest the conspirators behind this incident (of desecrating the statue),” said the officer.
Both Priyank and Chetan pledged appropriate action against those who had resorted to violence and destroyed public property.
“The first task was to arrest those behind this desecration. Now we would take action on those who took the law into their hands,” said the minister."

A division bench comprising justices Chitta Ranjan Dash and Partha Sarathi Sen also directed him to surrender before the trial court within a fortnight.
Pramanik moved the Circuit Bench on a direction of the Supreme Court, before which he had filed a prayer for protection earlier.
The division bench directed him to cooperate with the investigators in the case.
An attempt to murder case was registered against Pramanik at Dinhata police station in West Bengal's Cooch Behar district in 2018, when a group of people had allegedly fired on several workers of the ruling Trinamul Congress. One person was allegedly injured in the firing.
A warrant was issued against Pramanik by a lower court in connection with the case, following which he moved the anticipatory bail before the Circuit Bench.
After the high court adjourned the hearing till January 22 without giving him interim protection, the minister had moved the Supreme Court seeking the same.
The apex court had asked the West Bengal police not to take coercive action against Pramanik in connection with the case and directed the high court to hear his anticipatory bail plea.
Pramanik's lawyer claimed before the division bench that a false case alleging complicity in the incident was registered against the minister owing to political reasons.
Pramanik, who was earlier with the TMC, had joined the BJP in February 2019. He had contested the parliamentary polls in 2019 on a BJP ticket and won the Cooch Behar Lok Sabha seat.

A 30-member band contingent from France also drew attention at the grand parade.
It was the second time the French armed forces participated in India's Republic Day celebrations. In 2016, French troops became the first foreign military contingent to participate in the biggest ceremonial event of the country.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the guest of honour at the prestigious Bastille Day Parade in Paris in July last year.
The Indian Air Force's Rafale fighter jets and a tri-services marching contingent took part in the Bastille Day parade.
""This reciprocal invitation to national day celebrations is unprecedented, and shows the deep mutual trust and unwavering friendship underpinning Indo-French ties,"" a French readout said on India inviting Macron to the Republic Day celebrations.
The French military contingent that participated in the parade comprised six Indians. It was led by Captain Noel Louis.
The contingent belonged to the Corps of French Foreign Legion.
The French Foreign Legion is an elite military corps that is open to foreigners who want to serve in the French Army.
Set up in 1831, the French Foreign Legion is an integral part of the French Army.
At present, it has almost 9,500 officers and legionnaires.
The defence and strategic ties between India and France have been on an upswing in the last few years.
The two strategic partners have been looking at co-development and co-production of advanced defence technologies, including for the benefit of third countries.
The two sides are also expanding cooperation in the maritime domain including in the Indian Ocean Region.

The Congress has described the FIR lodged on Tuesday against leaders who are part of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra as a “political FIR”.
Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had on Tuesday night written to Union home minister Amit Shah about the “serious” security issues faced by Rahul and the Yatra in Assam over the last few days.
Assam police chief G.P. Singh on Wednesday wrote on X that the FIR was registered under various sections of the IPC and PDPP (Prevention of Damage to Public Property) Act and handed over to the CID for a “thorough and in-depth investigation” through an SIT to be constituted by the additional director-general of police.
Early in the day, Congress general secretary in charge of communications, Jairam Ramesh, had told reporters that Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had lodged the FIR against Rahul, K.C. Venugopal, Jitendra Singh, Gaurav Gogoi, Bhupen Borah, Debabrata Saikia and other leaders, including him. He termed it a political FIR with no link to reality and added that they were not scared.
Ramesh asserted that the party would face any legal procedure without fear and the Yatra would continue.
“PM Modi goes around the world and says that India is the Mother of Democracy. But this is not Mother of Democracy but Murder of Democracy,” he said.
After a night halt in Dhubri on Wednesday, the Yatra will enter Bengal on Thursday.
The Assam Congress also hit out at Sarma by tweeting: “Thank you @himantabiswa Ji for helping us with publicity. BTW, it seems you yourself filed the FIR, such cowardice doesn’t suit you. And rather than wasting so much energy in disrupting the yatra, you could’ve done some real work. No wonder why Assam is spiralling down to the bottom in every aspect.”
Congress leaders and workers had on Tuesday forcibly removed barricades put up by the administration to prevent the Rahul-led Yatra from entering Guwahati as a “mark of protest”.
In his letter to Shah on Tuesday, Kharge said that the Congress had taken out the Yatra to “promote” the message of justice and harmony among the people of India.
“Unfortunately, since the Yatra has entered Assam on the 18th of January, 2024 there have been several instances where the Assam Police has been found wanting in providing adequate security that Shri. Rahul Gandhi who is entitled to as a Z+ security.”
Kharge cited instances of alleged police lapses, including how the cops were “found” protecting the posters of the BJP at Amguri in Sibsagar district “instead of ensuring safe passage for the Yatra” on January 18, the first day of the travel through Assam. On the second day, “miscreants associated with the BJP were caught defacing and taking down posters and hoardings” of the Yatra in Lakhimpur district, Kharge alleged.
He also mentioned the “outrageous attack” on the Yatra in Sonitpur district on January 21."

In a recent message to all the district police heads, the home department instructed that spots where giant screens will be set up — for live telecast of the consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya — must have adequate police presence and there should be special watch on areas with mixed population.
The superintendents of police have been told to assess intelligence feedback about certain congregations and rallies under their respective jurisdiction and ensure that even the smallest of incidents are immediately attended to by the local police, sources said.
""Events involving pujas to mark the occasion and the distribution of bhog at the end of the rituals must have adequate police presence so that there is no flaring up of emotions at the slightest instigation,"" said a senior official in the home department.

The BJP decided to set up LED screens in several parts of the state to telecast live the inauguration of the Ram temple by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
""A preliminary mapping of the trouble-prone and sensitive areas has been completed in each district.... The deployments will start from early morning on Monday,"" said a senior officer in charge of a zone.
Against the backdrop of last year's violence on the occasion of Ram Navami processions in Howrah and Hooghly and the violence at Basirhat in North 24-Parganas a few years back, the police superintendents of all districts were told to remain alert.
""Tact is the word. Since a situation can't be predicted, senior police officers have been asked to use their skills and experience in handling a situation that might tend to flare up,"" the officer said.
Several police superintendents said the thrust was on the use of lathis and tear gas shells to disperse mobs in case of violence. But to avert that, the focus will be on intense patrolling.
""Separate teams of motorcycle mobile and RT mobile vans will be doing their rounds across subdivisions and blocks. Even senior officers will be on their mobile rounds throughout the day,"" said Avijit Banerjee, superintendent of police, Purulia, the south Bengal district which had erupted a week back following the alleged assault on three Ganga Sagar-bound sadhus.
The police superintendents were also asked to ensure that the timings and the routes of rallies for interfaith harmony, one of which chief minister Mamata Banerjee would lead in Calcutta, didn't clash with those of other processions.
""No procession should be allowed to move without adequate police coverage,"" the home department official said."

While spearheading the TMC’s ‘Sanhati Rally’, which coincided with the Ram temple consecration in Ayodhya, the party supremo underscored Bengal's pivotal role in preserving the principles of secularism and inclusiveness in the country.
“I don't believe in politicising religion ahead of elections. I am against such practice. I have no objection against those worshipping Lord Ram, but object to interference with the food habits of people,"" she said in her concluding remarks at the rally.
The feisty TMC boss, accompanied by religious leaders of various faiths and party leaders, began the 'all-faith harmony' march from Hazra More and it concluded at Park Circus crossing here.
""They (BJP) talk about Lord Ram, but what about Goddess Sita? She was all along with Lord Ram during his exile. They don't speak about her as they are anti-women. We are worshippers of Goddess Durga, so they should not try to lecture us about religion,"" the CM asserted.

The police had to use force to stop the Congress supporters from moving forward.
Earlier, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had asserted that the Yatra would not be permitted to enter the city to avert potential traffic congestion. Despite this, large crowds gathered at the Guwahati Chowk in Khanapara, warmly welcoming Gandhi with spirited slogans and drum beats, reports PTI.
""We have won as we have broken the barricades,"" AICC in-charge for Assam Jitendra Singh said.

On Monday, leaders of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) announced that the yatra led by Rahul Gandhi had decided to traverse the Guwahati bypass on Tuesday. However, the Assam government has denied permission to proceed through the main routes within Guwahati city.
The Congress said that Guwahati police asked them to take the yatra through NH27 (Khanapara- Jayanagar- Basistha- Gorchuk- Lokhra route). Bedabrata Bora, spokesperson for Assam PCC, stated, according to news reports, ""It has been decided to abandon the plan of taking the 'Nyay Yatra' through the main routes of Guwahati. The police are not allowing us. Now, we will gather at Khanapara for a protest meeting, and subsequently, the yatra will move towards the Lower Assam district through the Guwahati bypass.""
The Yatra, which entered Meghalaya on Monday, returned to Assam for its last leg. The plan, sources said, was to travel through the outskirts of the state's largest city Guwahati. But now it is uncertain. The Yatra is scheduled to be in Assam till Thursday.
On Monday, Rahul Gandhi was stopped from visiting Batadrava Than owing to “issues related to his security”. The day witnessed competing narratives of the Right-wing ecosystem and the Congress over the Ram temple consecration play out “peacefully” on the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra route in two central Assam districts of Nagaon and Morigaon.
Police said Rahul was not allowed to go because of a letter written by the Sri Sri Batadrava Than Parichalana Committee, which wanted him to visit after 3pm because a lot of devotees were expected there on the occasion of the Ram temple consecration.
Sources said a group of local youths had arranged a live screening of the Ram temple’s inaugural ceremony outside the Than. A lot of people were also expected to turn up to see Rahul. They said the Than committee did not want any kind of misunderstanding between the two groups.
The Congress brass had turned down the invite to the Ayodhya temple inauguration, prompting the Right-wing ecosystem to term them “anti-Hindu”.
Rahul tried to make it to the birthplace of saint-reformer Srimanta Sankardeva to pay his homage by reaching Haiborgaon around 8.25am but ran into barricades put up by the police."

A bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta, while hearing a plea seeking quashing of an ""oral order"" dated January 20 banning live telecast of the consecration ceremony at Ayodhya in temples across Tamil Nadu, said no one is bound to abide with the oral orders.
The bench took on record the statement of senior advocate Amit Anand Tiwari for Tamil Nadu that there are no restrictions on 'puja archana’ in temples or live telecast of consecration ceremony at Ayodhya.
He said the plea is “politically motivated”.
The bench asked the authorities to put on record the reasons and maintain the data of applications which has been allowed for ‘Puja archana’ and live telecast of consecration ceremony in temples and those which have been disallowed.
The bench also sought response of the Tamil Nadu government on the plea by January 29. The plea has been filed by one Vinoj in which it has been submitted that the Tamil Nadu government run by the DMK has banned live telecast of the ""pran prathishta"" of Lord Ram at Ayodhya in all temples across Tamil Nadu.
It is being alleged that the government has also banned all kinds of prayers, and 'annadanam' (poor feeding) 'bhajans' on the occasion.
However, Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Minister, P K Sekar Babu had said on Sunday that the HR and CE Department has not imposed any kind of ban for conduct of puja for Shri Ram. Also, there is no bar to distribute 'Annadhanam' and 'Prasadam.' He dismissed the claim as false news with ulterior motives.

Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said 21 soldiers were killed when two buildings they had mined for demolition exploded after militants fired at a nearby tank. Earlier, three soldiers were reported killed in a separate attack in southern Gaza.
“Yesterday we experienced one of our most difficult days since the war erupted,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. “In the name of our heroes, for the sake of our lives, we will not stop fighting until absolute victory.”
The deaths came amid the heaviest fight of 2024 so far, as the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) stormed the remaining parts of Khan Younis, the main city in the south of the enclave sheltering hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians.
“Over the past day, IDF troops carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Younis and deepened the operation in the area. The area is a significant stronghold of Hamas’ Khan Younis Brigade,” the military said. “Ground troops engaged in close-quarters combat, directed (air) strikes, and used intelligence to coordinate fire, resulting in the elimination of dozens of terrorists.”
Gazans say the Israeli forces, advancing west across the crowded city towards the Mediterranean coast since Monday, have blockaded and stormed hospitals, leaving the wounded and dead beyond the reach of rescuers.
At least 195 Palestinians were killed in the previous 24 hours, raising the documented toll to 25,490, according to Palestinian health officials, who say thousands more dead are feared lost in the rubble.
Bodies were being buried in the grounds of Khan Younis’s main Nasser hospital because it was unsafe to go to the cemetery. Another Khan Younis hospital, Al-Khair, was stormed by Israeli troops who arrested staff there, and a third, Al-Amal, run by the Palestinian Red Crescent, was unreachable, according to Palestinian officials. The Red Crescent said a tank shell had hit its headquarters on Amal’s fourth floor, a civilian had been killed at the entrance, and Israeli forces were firing from drones on anyone who moved nearby, making it impossible to dispatch ambulances for the entire Khan Younis area.
Israel says Hamas fighters operate in and around hospitals, making them targets.
Palestinians celebrated the Israeli losses as a victory, while Israelis spoke of them as a necessary sacrifice in a war against Hamas fighters who attacked Israeli towns on October 7, killing 1,200 people and capturing some 250 hostages, around half of whom remain in Gaza."

Dawshom Awbotaar
Srijit Mukherji’s Dawshom Awbotaar, a prequel to the 2011 thriller Baishe Srabon, marks the return of Prosenjit Chatterjee as the fierce cop Probir who specialises in investigating serial murders. It also brings back Anirban Bhattacharya’s Bijoy Poddar from Srijit’s 2019 thriller Vinci Da as Probir’s apprentice. When serial killer Biswaroop, played by Jisshu Sengupta, enters the scene, a cat-and-mouse chase begins between the murderer and the two cops.
What makes the film interesting is that it reveals the identity of the killer in the very first scene, making it an exciting whydunnit rather than a whodunnit. While maintaining the essence of his previous film in this prequel, Srijit has also incorporated rebellious poetry and Anupam Roy’s music. Also starring Jaya Ahsan, Dawshom Awbotaar released in theatres on October 19 last year.

Blue Beetle
2023 was as much a treat for DC fans as it was for Marvel stans. Following the box-office disappointments of the recent additions to the DC franchise like Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash, a new superhero of Latin origins was introduced with Angel Manuel Soto’s Blue Beetle. As he suddenly finds himself in possession of an ancient alien relic called the Scarab, Jaime Reyes aka Blue Beetle’s life turns upside down. The Scarab, an AI created by an alien race of conquerors named Reach, chooses Jaime as its host, providing him with incredible powers and strength, which help him emerge as a superhero.
Blue Beetle, which ultimately highlights the importance of family, proved to be a milestone for DC with its exceptional representation of Latino people on screen. Released last year on August 18, the superhero movie is currently streaming on Amazon Prime Video where it was previously only available for rent.

Balaji New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 05:28 AM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/rage-at-adani-deletion-in-supreme-court-case-on-top-of-list-after-dushyant-dave-protest/cid/1995744,"The Supreme Court will take up on Wednesday an application moved by Adani Power Rajasthan Limited over a Rs 1,376-crore dispute, after senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a state government undertaking, objected to the alleged abrupt deletion of the matter from Tuesday’s list.
The Rajasthan government’s Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd had earlier taken exception to the miscellaneous application moved by the Adani group company in January last year for a direction to Jaipur Vidyut to pay a late-payment surcharge (LPS) of Rs 1,376.35 crore to the private firm. The state had objected to the application since the apex court had already dismissed the Adanis’ plea on the issue in August 2020.
The government undertaking had in January last year objected to the application on the ground that it was illegal and “raises an extraordinarily serious question going to the very root of the institutional integrity of the Registry of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India”. In a letter signed by Kartik Seth, counsel for Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd, the Adani application was improper as a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court had in a judgment dated August 31, 2020, rejected the surcharge demand.
The Adanis’ miscellaneous application had been listed for hearing on Tuesday, but was abruptly deleted according to Dave, who wanted to question the maintainability of the plea.
Dave told the bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and P.V. Sanjay Kumar that in terms of an earlier judicial order, the matter was to be listed for hearing on Tuesday, but had been deleted suddenly.
The senior counsel said that when his instructing advocate Kartik Seth’s law firm enquired with the Supreme Court registry, an assistant registrar informed them on Tuesday that the matter had been deleted as he had instructions not to list the case.
“When we enquired, the assistant registrar very boldly says, ‘I am under instructions not to list it,’” Dave told the court. He did not name the official.
Dave said when a judicial order had been passed by the court, the registry cannot delete it at the administrative level.
“It is very disturbing. It is contempt if the government does it. But when the registry defies court orders, it should be viewed seriously,” the senior counsel said. Dave pointed out that in another case (not related to the Adanis), a bench headed by Justice A.S. Oka had pulled up the registry for deleting the matter from the hearing list despite a judicial order for listing it on a particular day.
After Dave made the claim, Justice Bose, heading the bench, summoned the assistant registrar concerned and held an in-chamber discussion. Returning to the court, Justice Bose informed Dave that the Adani matter would be listed on “top of the board” as the first item to be heard on Wednesday.
Another PIL petitioner’s advocate also complained on Tuesday to the same bench that his matter, too, had not been listed despite a judicial order. The counsel submitted that the PIL, whose contents were not disclosed, related to an issue that concerned the lives of 20 people. The advocate said the matter had been earlier directed to be listed after two weeks, but had not been done even after eight weeks.
“Why is this happening despite listing date? We will hear it next Wednesday,” Justice Bose said.
On January 5 last year, the Chambers of Kartik Seth on behalf of Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd had shot off a letter to the Supreme Court secretary-general, saying the registry’s decision to clear the miscellaneous application filed by the Adani firm “raises an extraordinarily serious question going to the very root of the institutional integrity of the Registry of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India”.
The application moved by the Adanis on July 19, 2022, had sought a direction to the Rajasthan government undertaking to make a payment of Rs 1,376.35 crore towards late-payment surcharge.
The Rajasthan government had then pointed out that a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court had on August 31, 2020, expressly held that Adani Power Rajasthan Limited was not entitled to the payment of surcharge in terms of Article 8.3.5 of the Power Purchase Agreement dated January 28, 2010, signed between the two parties.
“In terms of the judgment, we have paid the entire amount payable and the same has been accepted by APRL without any protest. Therefore, the present MA (miscellaneous application) is a clear attempt to review the aforesaid judgment after a lapse of more than 2 years and that too without moving any application for condonation of delay…,” the Rajasthan government’s letter through its legal counsel stated."

“Modi is expected to revisit much of what he said in Ayodhya on Monday. He had said Ram is India’s thought, law, norm and policy. He declared in his own fashion that Ram is the chief deity of India and Indians and indicated that he has given a magnificent Ram temple to the country. In fact, he has successfully merged religion and State and this is bound to reflect in the election campaign over the next two-three months,” a senior BJP leader said in Ayodhya on the condition of anonymity.
Chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited Bulandshahr on Wednesday and reviewed the arrangements at the Chandmari Ground, where Modi will address the rally. Adityanath also reviewed the security measures.
Government sources said the Special Protection Group had visited the spot and taken control of it while the local administration has declared the area a no-flying zone. Commandoes of the National Security Guard and over 80 administrative officers also reached Bulandshahr on Wednesday.
Shlok Kumar, senior superintendent of police of Bulandshahr, said: “We are deploying 5,000 policemen and 11 companies of paramilitary forces to maintain law and order. Over 80 administrative officers will be here to manage the security during the Prime Minister’s presence in the district.”
The 5,000 policemen will include 800 head constables, 500 woman police personnel, 100 inspectors and 1,000 sub-inspectors, he added.
Modi will also lay the foundation stone of Major Dhyan Chand University in Meerut and Kalyan Singh Government Medical College in Aligarh from Bulandshahr.
Munshi Lal, the assistant regional transport officer, said 2,000 private buses had been arranged to ferry those who would attend the Prime Minister’s meetings. “We have acquired 900 buses of schools and colleges in Bulandshahr and brought about 1,100 more from adjoining districts,” he said.
Vikas Chauhan, the district president of the BJP, said: “We are always in election mode but this time it is more important because Modi is coming here three days after opening the Ram temple in Ayodhya. It is obviously going to help the BJP win many seats from the east to the west.”
Dharm Pal, general secretary of the Uttar Pradesh unit of the BJP, said: “The people trust the BJP even more after the Ayodhya event. Our ancestors had sacrificed their lives for the Ram temple. Besides constructing the temple, the BJP government is also doing development work.”
Ayodhya woes
Devotees continued to have a tough time in Ayodhya on the second day of the opening of the shrine. The police blocked all the roads to Ram Path, where the temple is located, and prevented the devotees from reaching there.
“We have deployed 8,000 policemen near the temple today (Wednesday) to manage the situation. The crowd is less than yesterday and the arrangements are better. We have made four queues of pilgrims and are requesting them to have patience,” said Prashant Kumar, director-general of police (law and order).
President of the International Hindu Parishad, Praveen Togadia, visited the temple on Wednesday and claimed that Modi and home minister Amit Shah would pave the way for bigger temples in Mathura and Kashi (Varanasi).
“The PM and the home minister have the potential to scrap the Places of Worship Act, 1991, and build bigger temples in Mathura and Kashi,” said Togadia, a former Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader.
The Act ensures the maintenance of status quo at religious structures as they existed on August 15, 1947."

The directive to the varsity authorities was conveyed by the Union minister through the Assam chief minister's office, he claimed.
""I wanted to come to your university and address you, listen to you, understand what you are facing. But what happened is that the Home minister of India called up the Chief Minister of Assam and the CMO called up the leadership of the university and said that Rahul Gandhi must not be allowed to speak to the students,"" Gandhi said, addressing students and others from atop his Yatra bus in the Assam-Meghalaya border.
Gandhi was scheduled to hold separate interactions with students, civil society members and party leaders at the University of Science and Technology, Meghalaya, (USTM) in Meghalaya's Ri Bhoi district, bordering Assam, on Tuesday morning.
The programmes at the private varsity were announced by the Congress on Monday afternoon but were re-scheduled to a hotel, also in Ri Bhoi district, later after the university withdrew the permission.
Gandhi is leading a Manipur-to-Mumbai Nyay Yatra of the party, which entered Assam from Meghalaya on Tuesday for the second and final leg of its travel through the state. It will travel through Assam till January 25.
""It is not important if Rahul Gandhi comes or not. What is important is that you are allowed to listen to anybody you want,"" he said.
""Rahul Gandhi coming here is the least important thing happening here. It is about you having an imagination, being allowed to do what you want,"" he said, appreciating the students and youth who lined the road to listen to him.
""You have come here because you do not agree with what the chief minister is trying to do. You are not ready to accept an enslaved Assam and I am extremely proud of that,"" he added.
""They want to turn you into slaves but I know that nobody, no power in the universe can do it,"" Gandhi asserted, while attacking the BJP.
He also maintained that ""this is happening not only in Assam but in every school, college, university of India"", where the students are ""being not allowed to have their own imagination"".
""You are the future of the country and the most important thing for the country is that all of you are allowed to think freely, to believe freely, to imagine freely, to live the life you want and not somebody else wants,"" the MP added.
He maintained that there are attempts to make the youth ""blindly obedient"".
Gandhi asserted that the youth must be able to follow their own imagination and ""nobody should be allowed to prevent you from imagining and thinking about the India that you want"".
""Nobody should be able to stop you from reading and writing any language you want, nobody should be able to stop you from listening, reading your tradition, culture or history"", the Congress leader added.

""While en route, both ships reported seeing explosions close by and the US Navy accompaniment also intercepted multiple projectiles,"" Maersk said in a statement, adding it was suspending Red Sea transits by vessels of the US subsidiary.
A spokesperson for Yemen's Houthi military forces said they fired ballistic missiles at several US warships that were protecting two US commercial vessels.
Both commercial vessels are operated by Maersk Line, Limited (MLL), its US subsidiary that carries cargo for the Department of Defense, Department of State, USAID, and other US government agencies.
Both are enrolled in the Maritime Security Program (MSP) and Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA) with the US government, which is why they were escorted through the strait by US Navy vessels, Maersk said.
MSP and VISA are programmes run by the US Defense Department to transport forces, supplies and equipment during times of war or national emergency.
The vessels and crew were unharmed and were being escorted back to the Gulf of Aden by the US Navy, Maersk said. Bab al-Mandab is the outlet of the Red Sea, between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula, and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast.
The Houthi military spokesperson, Yahya Sarea, said in a statement that Houthi forces targeted a number of US warships with ballistic missiles on Wednesday in a ""clash"" that lasted more than two hours and led to a U.S. warship being directly hit and the two commercial vessels having ""to withdraw and return.""
""Several of our ballistic missiles struck their targets despite warships' attempts to intercept them,"" the statement said.
A US official said no ships were hit. ""No U.S. warships or commercial vessels were struck by Houthi missiles today,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Houthi forces fired three anti-ship ballistic missiles toward the U.S.-flagged container ship Maersk Detroit on Wednesday as it was transiting the Gulf of Aden, the U.S. Central Command said separately.
There were no reports of injuries or damage to the ship, it added in a statement.
'Escalation of risk'
On Jan. 5, Maersk said it would divert its container vessels away from the Red Sea for the foreseeable future. Until Wednesday, MLL ships were the exception, but that would no longer be the case, Maersk said.
""Following the escalation of risk, MLL is suspending transits in the region until further notice,"" it said on Wednesday.
Seafarers remain in the firing line, and have signed agreements to receive double pay when entering the high-risk zones.
""There's a feeling of vulnerability,"" Stephen Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport Workers' Federation, the leading union for seafarers, told Reuters.
""The feedback from the (ship) captains is certainly on the container trades, they are much happier to go around the Cape.""
US maritime labour organizations have been separately concerned about the impact on US flagged ships, which in recent weeks have been subjected to what nine unions called ""the most significant attacks on the United States Merchant Marine in more than half a century"".
""It is critically important that US-flag vessels carrying commercial, military and foreign aid cargoes are provided the necessary protection from the United States military as they transit the increasingly treacherous waters of the Red Sea,"" the unions wrote in a Jan. 19 letter to the US Transport Command."
SQPL79S37E_Z3UKFESQFESMGS3,"Israel braces for World Court ruling, focuses attack on south Gaza","Reuters Jerusalem, Doha, The Hague Published 26.01.24, 12:47 PM","Reuters Jerusalem, Doha, The Hague Published 26.01.24, 12:47 PM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/israel-braces-for-world-court-ruling-focuses-attack-on-south-gaza/cid/1996315,"UN judges in The Hague will rule on Friday whether to order Israel to suspend its military campaign in Gaza as officials push ahead with efforts to negotiate a new deal for a ceasefire and release of more Israeli hostages.
On the ground in the seaside enclave, Gaza officials said on Thursday that Israeli strikes killed 20 Palestinians queuing for food aid in Gaza City, six people in a house in central Gaza's Al-Nusseirat refugee camp and at least 50 people in the prior 24 hours in Gaza's main southern city Khan Younis, where Israel is currently focusing the brunt of its might.
Reuters could not independently verify the details while Israel said it was either looking into the reports or did not immediately comment on the incidents.
The judges of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also called the World Court, are due to rule on Friday on South Africa's request for emergency measures against Israel in a case accusing it of state-led genocide in the Gaza Strip.
In more than three months of war, Israel's campaign has leveled much of the enclave, displaced some 1.9 million Palestinians and killed at least 25,900 people, according to Gaza officials. Israel launched its offensive in October after militants from Hamas, which rules Gaza, stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages.
The court will issue its ruling at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT) in a hearing expected to last about an hour. While the judges will not rule on the merits of the genocide allegations, which may take years to decide, South Africa asked the court to issue an interim order compelling Israel to suspend its military operations.
Israel has called South Africa's allegations false and ""grossly distorted,"" and said it makes the utmost efforts to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza.
The court's rulings are final and without appeal, but it has no way of enforcing them. Israel on Thursday expressed confidence that the ICJ would ""throw out these spurious and specious charges."" Hamas said it would abide by an ICJ ceasefire order if Israel reciprocates.
Diplomatic efforts seek new truce deal
Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts to negotiate a break in the conflict continued. U.S. and Israeli intelligence chiefs were due to meet Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Europe this weekend, one official told Reuters. A second source said Egypt's intelligence chief would also participate.
The White House has been trying to facilitate the release of the more than 100 remaining Israeli hostages taken during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which ignited the war in Gaza, although there remains a considerable distance between the two sides' demands.
A third source with knowledge of the talks said that Israel has proposed a 60-day pause in the fighting during which hostages would be released in phases, beginning with civilian women and children.
Previously, three sources told Reuters that shuttle diplomacy over the past month involving the U.S., Qatar and Egypt has sought to hammer out a new deal for a ceasefire of about one month. But progress has been held up by differences between Hamas and Israel over how to bring a permanent end to the Gaza war.
In Gaza on Thursday, tanks hit areas around two hospitals in Khan Younis, forcing displaced people into a new desperate scramble for safety, residents said.
Israel's military said early on Friday that its intelligence found that Hamas was operating from inside and around the two hospitals, Nasser and Al-Amal, in Khan Younis. Hamas and medical workers have denied Israeli claims that militants in Gaza use hospitals as cover for bases.
The Israeli military said it was coordinating with hospital staff to ensure they remain ""operational and accessible"" and there is a safe corridor for people to leave the hospitals.
""The facts on the ground disprove the blatant misinformation that has been disseminated over the last 72 hours falsely claiming that the hospitals are under siege or attack,"" it said in a statement.
Fleeing to Rafah
On Thursday, thousands of homeless people sheltering in Khan Younis sought to flee to Rafah, 15 km (nine miles) away, the U.N. relief agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) said.
Video posted on X by Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, showed a crowd of people walking en masse on Thursday on a dirt road. ""A sea of people forced to flee Khan Younis, ending up at the border with Egypt. A never ending search for safety that #Gaza is no longer able to give"", Lazzarini wrote.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said less than 20% of the narrow enclave - around 60 square kilometres (23 square miles) - now harboured over 1.5 million homeless people in the south."

The Yatra, which entered Meghalaya on Monday, will return to Assam for its last leg and travel through the outskirts of the state's largest city Guwahati.
As per the schedule shared by the party, Gandhi will hold a meeting with the North East Congress Committee at a hotel in Jorabat in Meghalaya's Ri Bhoi district.
It will be followed by separate interactions with students and civil society members in Guwahati.
Gandhi will make a public address as the entourage will make their way through the national highway that bypasses the main city.
The party claimed that it was denied permission to hold a roadshow or 'padyatra' (foot march) in the main city by the police.
Gandhi will address a press conference at Damdama in Kamrup district, about 75 km from Guwahati, where the Yatra will have its lunch break.
A 'padyatra' is scheduled from the Goremari petrol pump in the Barpeta district to Kukarpar, followed by a public address. The night halt is scheduled at Bishnupur.
The Yatra, which started from Manipur on January 14, will culminate in Mumbai on March 20 or 21.

Gandhi also said he was happy and wanted the BJP to disrupt the yatra as it was helping it in getting publicity.
The remarks by Gandhi, who once again accused Sarma of being ""one of the most corrupt chief ministers"" in the country, came after the Assam chief minister said he has instructed the Director General of Police (DGP) to register a case against Gandhi for ""provoking the crowd"" to break barricades, and called their actions ""Naxalite tactics"".
The Rahul Gandhi-led yatra was stopped from entering the city, triggering protests from Congress workers who broke barricades and raised slogans. Gandhi also claimed that he was ""not allowed"" to interact with students of a private university in Meghalaya as part of the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' at the ""instructions"" of the Union Home Minister Amit Shah.
""BJP had the experience of the earlier yatra, it started from Kanyakumari and they maintained that it would not have any impact. Slowly its impact started being felt and a crescendo was formed in Jammu and Kashmir. Now their thinking is to disrupt it first. The problem for them (BJP) is that by disrupting the yatra, they end up helping it,"" he said at a press conference here.
""So frankly, I want them to disrupt the yatra, stop me from going into colleges. They stopped us from going into a college, we spoke to students outside, and it was seen by the whole country. So I am happy, do it (disrupt the yatra) as much as you (BJP) want, we are enjoying it. It is for our benefit,"" Gandhi said.
Asked about the hindrances and alleged violence against the yatra, Gandhi said at the presser, ""I would not call it violence. He (pointing to the state Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah) got slightly hurt. We are tough people. We can take all this."" 	On the BJP workers disrupting the yatra, Gandhi said they don't try to attack and even if they do, it does not affect him.
""I don't get scared of these things. I don't get intimidated. Abuse me, disturb me, or target me, I don't get intimidated. I fight for my truth and even if the whole world stands on the other side, it does not matter to me. Once I make up my mind and fight for my ideology, I do not get intimidated,"" the former Congress chief asserted.
The Congress is benefiting from what the Assam Chief Minister and the Union Home Minister are doing and the yatra has become the main issue in Assam, Gandhi said.
""As far as stopping me from visiting a temple, university and also preventing the 'padyatra' here is concerned, it is their style, it is part of intimidation tactics; we don't get intimidated by these people, we are not scared of them,"" the Congress leader said.
Elaborating on BJP workers lining up to protest against the yatra, Gandhi claimed that they were holding party flags in one hand and with the other they were waving at him.
""What kind of protest is this? Mr Himanta thinks it is a protest, it is no protest that is taking place, they are lining up to shout slogans, we are perfectly happy for them to line up there,"" he said.
Gandhi said,""There is a clear problem in the state...The chief minister of the state is one of the most corrupt chief ministers in the country. Wherever I move in the state, people tell me -- that there is massive unemployment, massive corruption, massive price rise, farmers are struggling and no youth can get a job in this state. These are the issues we are raising."" 	He said the yatra is about five pillars of justice that will give strength to the country -- participation, justice for youth, labourers, women and farmers.
The Congress party will put forward its programme for the five pillars of justice over the next one or one-and-a-half month, he said.
Asked about the consecration ceremony at the Ram temple in Ayodhya and how he would counter the wave it has generated in the country, Gandhi said, ""It is nothing like that, that there is a wave...this is the BJP's political programme and Narendra Modi ji did a function and a show there, it's good, but we have told you, we have clarity about our programme which is about five justices to strengthen the country.""  	Talking about the opposition Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), Gandhi said on one side, there is Narendra Modi and the RSS and on the other is the INDIA bloc, which is an ideology and has 60 per cent of the country's votes.

They also said the two female Namibian cheetahs who recently gave birth to a total of seven cubs will be released in the wild only when the weather conditions improve.      	 An official said that a South African delegation will visit India in February for an assessment of the preparations at the Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.
""Thereafter, a call on bringing the next batch of cheetahs will be taken,"" the official said.           	 SP Yadav, Additional Director General of Forests at the Environment Ministry, had earlier told PTI that the next batch of cheetahs will be imported from South Africa and introduced into the Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.
Another official told the news agency that 90 per cent of the work to prepare the wildlife sanctuary for cheetahs has been completed.
Gandhi Sagar is about a six-hour drive from Kuno. It is spread across 368 square kilometres and has an additional 2,500 sq km area surrounding it.
The official quoted above also said the mother cheetahs and their cubs will not be released into the wild until weather conditions in the Kuno National Park improve.
Officials reported on Tuesday that Namibian cheetah Jwala gave birth to four cubs on January 20. In early January, another Namibian cheetah, Asha, gave birth to three cubs.
This is Jwala's second litter and comes after a gap of 10 months.
The officials said that compared to other female cheetahs, Jwala is a wilder animal. She avoids humans and remains alert even when resting, a typical cheetah behaviour of remaining careful of bigger and stronger predators all the time.
Jwala (Namibian name Siyaya) had given birth to four cubs last March. Three of the cubs succumbed to extreme heat while the sole survivor is being raised under human care for future wilding.
The official said the mother cheetahs and their cubs are being kept in larger enclosures to avoid extreme weather and for better monitoring, which is difficult in the wild.
""We will release them in the wild as soon as weather conditions improve,"" the official said.
The recent births have taken the number of cubs at the Kuno National Park to eight at present, with seven being born this month.
The total number of cheetahs at the Kuno National Park currently stands at 21 (six males, seven females and eight cubs).
While January recorded the birth of seven cubs, it also witnessed the death of Shaurya -- an adult Namibian cheetah -- on January 16.
Officials said they do not know the reason for Shaurya's death as they have not yet received his post-mortem report.
Since last March, seven adult cheetahs, including Shaurya, have died due to various reasons.
The seven adult cheetahs -- three females and four males -- that died include Sasha, Uday, Daksha, Tejas, Suraj, Dhatri and Shaurya. The first six fatalities occurred in a six-month period between March and August 2023.
Jwala and Aasha are among the cheetahs translocated to India from Namibia under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Project Cheetah, aimed at re-introducing the only large carnivore species that went extinct in independent India.
The first batch of eight cheetahs was introduced in India in September 2022. The second batch of 12 cheetahs was flown in from South Africa last February.
The much-vaunted cheetah conservation project, however, has drawn sharp criticism over the animals' deaths.
According to officials, one of the biggest challenges faced in the first year of managing the cheetahs in India was the unexpected development of winter coats by some of the animals during the Indian summer and monsoon, in anticipation of the African winter (June to September).
The winter coat, combined with high humidity and temperatures, caused itching, prompting the animals to scratch their necks on tree trunks or the ground. This led to bruising and exposing the skin, where flies laid eggs, resulting in maggot infestations and, ultimately, bacterial infections and septicemia, leading to the deaths of three cheetahs, an official explained.
India plans to import cheetahs that do not develop thicker winter coats, Yadav said earlier.
For the cheetahs already in Kuno, he said the plan is to administer prophylactic medicine before the arrival of monsoon to prevent infection.      	 The project's focus in its second year would be on breeding these animals, he added.

Khan also said that institutions of higher education need to be autonomous and free of outside interference that could lead the youth to take part in activities that ""pollute the academic environment."" His statements come in the wake of vehement protests against him by the CPI(M)'s student wing SFI, over appointments made by him to senate of some universities, and his displeasure with the ruling Left in the state over alleged political interference in the functioning of varsities by the government.
Khan, leading the Republic Day celebrations at the Central Stadium in the state capital, said that society should not allow group rivalries or internal struggles for power to affect governance as it would set a bad example for the future generations.
The Governor further said that education was the chief means by which a society is transformed and it is the only effective method to purge the mind of old prejudices.
""The future depends on what we are in our thoughts and actions. For this, we need institutions of higher education which are truly autonomous and free from any outside interference that leads the youth to engage in activities which pollute the academic environment,"" he said at the event also attended by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.
Cooperative federalism requires support from all stakeholders including the states of the union, he added.
Khan also referred to the various accomplishments and laurels achieved by Kerala in various sectors, including startups, health and tourism.
The laurels and achievements of Kerala he referred to were -- becoming one of the best performers in the Start-up Ranking among the states, securing the first position in the National Food Safety Index, success in eradicating extreme poverty, winning the National Healthcare and Arogya Manthan awards and coming second in the Performance Grading Index (PGI) report for school education.
The Governor said that the people of a state which has made the country proud through such accomplishments were obligated to nurture a healthier democracy that encourages constructive public discourse in a spirit of mutual respect and deeper understanding.
""Dissent and differences of opinion are essential ingredients of democratic functioning. But dissent degenerating into violence, be it physical or verbal, is a betrayal of democracy and symbol of human failure.
""As a society, we should not allow group rivalries or internal struggles for power to affect governance, thereby setting a bad example for the youth."" Khan said.
He said that the need of the hour was to foster in society a culture of greater civility, empathy, and dialogue that ""reposes faith in the power of argument and not in the argument of power."" Khan also stressed upon the need to be more humane.
He said that through right education and austerities a man can become a ""superman"" and a mind can turn into a ""super-mind"" which can ""see One in many and many in One"".
""When one realises that the state of diversity of living things is rooted in the One, and that their manifestation is also from That One, then one becomes identified with the Supreme Soul.
""That realisation alone can infuse energy and wealth of spirit into our activities as we await the dawn of a greatly progressive and extraordinarily powerful India."" the Governor said, referring to the verses from the Bhagavad Gita.
He highlighted the strides made by the country in various sectors, including defence, healthcare, drug manufacturing, agriculture, infrastructure development, start-ups and welfare of the poor.
The Governor said that this spurt in production, growth and export was due to the spirit of 'Aatmanirbharta' which had helped the country surmount the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Today, we as a nation take immense pride in the soft-landing of India's Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft on the Moon's South Pole, a feat which no other country could achieve before. Mission Gaganyaan and the success of Aditya L-1, the first space based Indian mission to study the Sun, have also added to our national prestige,"" he further said.
India's presidency of the G-20, the Parliament passing the Nari Shakti Vandan Act, the country's upsurge as the world's preeminent nation in terms of real-time payments, our exports surpassing the USD 400 billion mark and overtaking Europe in terms of 5G user base were accomplishments that signal our potential for greater progress, Khan said.
He said that the 'Make in India' strategy was a success and the same was visible in the indigenous semi-high-speed train Vande Bharat as well as the Kochi Water Metro, the first of its kind in India, operating on electric hybrid mode.
Khan further said that genuine concern for the welfare of the citizens has been the highlight of the country's journey towards the goal of Viksit Bharat 2047.
""The Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra which reached even the remotest corners of the nation created awareness about the Government’s welfare schemes and ensured access to clean cooking fuel, Ayushman Health Cards and insurance to lakhs of people,"" he said.
After unfurling the national flag and inspecting the parade, the Governor received the salute from the various police and armed forces contingents who vigorously marched past the podium.
Amidst a running feud between the Pinarayi Vijayan-led Kerala government and the Raj Bhavan, Khan in an unusual move on Thursday had read out only the concluding paragraph of the government's customary policy address in the Assembly.

The legislators claimed that in several areas, the Assam Rifles was ""not responsive"" and remained ""mute spectators"" when unarmed civilians, mostly farmers, came under attack by armed men.
""SoO agreements with the militant groups and the immunity it provides to them from central forces are the main cause of the never-ending cycle of violence. Thus SoO... should be abrogated immediately. It should not extended beyond its expiry date of February 29, 2024,” the MLAs said in a statement.
The SoO was signed with the Centre, the Manipur government and two conglomerates of Kuki militant outfits – the Kuki National Organisations and United Peoples Front. The pact was first inked in 2008 and extended periodically.
""These forces (Assam Rifles) and their leadership (chain of command) need to give strict instructions and be held accountable, and replace with forces that have the ability to act by returning suppressive fires when they observe that unarmed civilians are being fired upon,” it said.
The MLAs have also called for ""complete disarmanent of illegal arms in the possession of unauthorised persons” in the state at the earliest.
The legislators asserted that if the Union government is “unable to take any positive action as per these demands”, the MLAs will take “appropriate action in consultation with the public”.

The 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,' led by Gandhi, entered West Bengal from Assam through Bakshirhat in Cooch Behar district.
State Congress president Adhir Chowdhury extended a warm welcome to Gandhi upon his arrival.
Addressing reporters in Cooch Behar, Gandhi accused the BJP and RSS of spreading hatred and violence across the country.
He said, ""The word 'Nyay' (justice) has been attached to the yatra because injustice is prevailing across the country. The INDIA bloc will fight against injustice across the country."" 	Gandhi's remark exuding confidence in the INDIA bloc came a day after Mamata Banerjee's decision to go solo in the Parliamentary elections in West Bengal caused ripples in the opposition bloc.
Banerjee's sudden comments forced the Congress to adopt a conciliatory approach with party spokesperson Jairam Ramesh asserting that the opposition bloc INDIA ""cannot be imagined without Mamata Banerjee.""  	The CPI(M) and Left parties, allies of the Congress within the state and the INDIA bloc at the national level, are expected to join the march.
However, the TMC has chosen to abstain, citing a lack of information about the yatra.
The Bengal leg of the yatra covers 523 km across six districts and six Lok Sabha constituencies — Darjeeling, Raigunj, North and South Malda, and two in Murshidabad — spanning five days. This is Gandhi's first visit to the state since the April-May 2021 assembly polls.

Later in the evening, the external affairs ministry rejected the charge and said Pakistan was reaping what it had sown. Billing the accusation as Pakistan’s latest attempt at peddling false and malicious anti-India propaganda, the Ministry’s official spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said: ``As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicentre of terrorism, organised crime, and illegal transnational activities.
India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence. Pakistan will reap what it sows. To blame others for its own misdeeds can neither be a justification nor a solution.”
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Qazi presented what he described as ``details of a sophisticated and sinister Indian campaign of extra-territorial and extra-judicial killings inside Pakistan’’. According to him, these are ""killings for hire’’ cases involving sophisticated international set-up spread over multiple jurisdictions.
``Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan. They recruited, financed and supported criminals, terrorists and unsuspecting civilians to play defined roles in these assassinations. Indian media and social media accounts immediately claimed and glorified these killings as successful retribution against enemies of India and projected their capacity to carry out these illegal acts,’’ the foreign secretary said.
At today’s press conference, Qazi shared details of two cases and said that a few more similar cases are under investigation. One of the two cases related to Shahid Latif, said to be a close aide of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar, who was killed in Sialkot on October 11, 2023. The second case pertains to Muhammad Riaz, an LeT agent, who was gunned down in Rawalakot on September 8, 2023.
According to the foreign secretary, these cases fit the pattern of similar cases which have come to light in other countries including Canada and the U.S.; referring to the accusation made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of an Indian hand in the killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia and the U.S. Justice Department case of a plot to murder Sikhs of Justice leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannu in which an Indian government agent is alleged to have hired a person in New York to carry out the hitjob."

Troops advanced for the first time into the al-Mawasi district near the Mediterranean Coast, west of Khan Younis, the main city in southern Gaza. There, they stormed the Al-Khair hospital and were arresting medical staff, Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al Qidra told Reuters.
There was no immediate word from Israel on the situation at the hospital. The military spokesperson’s office had no comment.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said tanks had also surrounded another Khan Younis hospital, al-Amal, headquarters of the rescue agency, which had lost contact with its staff there. Qidra said at least 50 people were killed overnight in Khan Younis, while the sieges of medical facilities meant dozens of dead and wounded were beyond the reach of rescuers.
“The Israeli occupation is preventing ambulance vehicles from moving to recover bodies of martyrs and the wounded from western Khan Younis,” he said.
The Israeli military spokesperson’s office had no immediate comment on the situation at Al-Khair hospital.
Israel says Hamas fighters operate from in and around hospitals, which Hamas and medical staff deny.
“Hamas embeds its operation within and under hospitals and other medical facilities,” said Elad Goren of COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry branch that coordinates with the Palestinians. “A particular effort led by a dedicated team has been put on making sure that civilians have access to medical care.”
Residents said bombardment from air, land and sea was the most intense in southern Gaza since the war began in October, as Israeli tanks surged across Khan Younis from the east towards the Mediterranean coast.
Video filmed from afar showed scattered civilians wandering a ghost city, crowded with tents with abandoned laundry flapping on lines, as gunfire rattled and columns of smoke rose into the sky.
Israel launched an offensive last week to capture Khan Younis, which it now says is the principal headquarters of the Hamas militants responsible for the October 7 attacks on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies."

A seven-judge constitution bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud, which is hearing arguments on the vexed question regarding the minority status of AMU, observed Parliament is an ""eternal, indestructible body"" under the Indian Union.
""How can you not accept an amendment by Parliament?"" the CJI asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was arguing for the Centre.
""Mr Solicitor, Parliament is an eternal, indestructible body under the Indian Union, and irrespective of which government represents the cause of the Union of India, Parliament's cause is eternal, indivisible and indestructible and we can't hear the Government of India say that amendment which the Parliament made is something I don't stand by. You have to stand by it,"" Justice Chandrachud observed.
The bench, which also comprised Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Surya Kant, J B Pardiwala, Dipankar Datta, Manoj Misra and Satish Chandra Sharma, said the government has the option of taking the amendment route and amend the law again.
""This is an amendment by the Parliament (in 1981). Is the government accepting the amendment?"" Justice Khanna asked.
""I am not,"" Mehta responded.
The law officer said he was not arguing a matter of ""A versus B"" and that he was before a seven-judge constitution bench answering constitutional questions.
""The amendment in question was subjected to challenge before the (Allahabad) high court and there is a judgement declaring that it is unconstitutional for A, B, C, D grounds, and as a law officer, it is my right as well as my entitlement and duty to say that this view appears to be correct,"" he asserted.
The Allahabad High Court had in January 2006 struck down the provision of the AMU (Amendment) Act, 1981 by which the varsity was accorded minority status.
The CJI said this would be ""radical"" because a law officer would be then telling the court that ""I don't abide by what Parliament has done"".
""You have to stand by what Parliament has done. Parliament is supreme. Parliament is undoubtedly supreme in its law making function. Parliament can always amend a statute, in which case a law officer can say I have an amended statute,"" Justice Chandrachud observed.
""Can we hear any organ of the Union government say that notwithstanding a parliamentary amendment, I don't accept this amendment,"" the CJI said, adding  Parliament is an eternal, indivisible and indestructible entity under democracy.
Mehta said he was supporting the 2006 high court verdict. 	 	""How can you say I don't accept the validity of an amendment?"" the bench asked him.
Responding to the query, the solicitor general said, ""Would a law officer be expected to say that whatever amendments were made in the Constitution of India during Emergency were true only because they were made by the Parliament"".
The CJI observed that is why the 44th amendment Act, 1978 came in.
""The 44th amendment came in only for that. The 44th amendment came to redress the evils which were perpetrated in the name of a constitutional amendment,"" he said, adding, ""The power to decide that is in the elected body of the people which is Parliament. Parliament can always say that what we did during  Emergency was wrong and we are rectifying it by the 44th amendment"".
The 44th Amendment Act was brought in by the Janata Party government against the background of Emergency.
It proposed certain changes to the Constitution that would have the effect of undermining its secular or democratic character, abridging or taking away fundamental rights, and prejudicing or impeding free and fair elections on the basis of adult suffrage.
It said the right to property, which has been the subject of several constitutional amendments, would cease to be a fundamental right and become just a legal right. The elimination of property from the list of fundamental rights would, however, ensure that minorities’ freedom to create and govern educational institutions of their choosing would not be harmed, the 44th amendment said.
Mehta referred to the high court verdict and said the 1981 Amendment Act was set aside and therefore, it was not in the statute book now.
""There is an affidavit filed by the government. It's not my stand…,"" he said.
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for one of the parties in favour of AMU's minority status, referred to how the then attorney general had defended the Emergency provision.
""I was sitting in the court when the then Attorney General of India Niren De was standing here and arguing what is being done is right. I (attorney general) defend the Emergency provision. Why? Because he could not say otherwise,"" Sibal said.
Mehta said the distinction is that the then attorney general was not in a situation where one high court has struck it (1981 amendment) down and the provision no longer exists in the statute book.
The arguments in the matter remained inconclusive and would resume on January 30.
The top court had on February 12, 2019 referred to a seven-judge bench the hugely contentious issue for adjudication. A similar reference was made earlier.
A five-judge constitution bench had in the S Azeez Basha versus Union of India case in 1967 held that since AMU was a central university, it cannot be considered a minority institution.
However, it got back its minority status when Parliament passed the AMU (Amendment) Act in 1981.
The Congress-led UPA government at the Centre moved in appeal against the 2006 high court order. The university also filed a separate petition against it.
The NDA government spearheaded by the BJP told the apex court in 2016 that it will withdraw the appeal filed by the erstwhile UPA dispensation."

On the same day, an “anti-fascist” conference of Left outfits — which are not aligned with the CPM-led Front — and Mamata’s Trinamul Congress tore into Prime Minister Modi and the saffron ecosystem for allegedly trying to monopolise Hinduism with the Hindi-Hindu-Hindustan vision of the Sangh parivar and using communal polarisation to divide, to serve its political purpose. Several social activists also took part in the conference.
The Bengal unit of the Congress asserted that it had nothing against Ram or the temple in Ayodhya, but was against turning the deity into a “political product” for the sake of elections.
“We all respect Ram. But the BJP’s marketing of Ram… even upstaging the god for the sake of Narendra Modi’s publicity is most unfortunate. This is event management for the sake of winning elections, not much else,” said the Congress’s chief spokesperson for Bengal, Soumya Aich Roy.
“The way they went about it, disregarding the legit concerns raised by the Shankaracharyas, cannot be condoned,” he added in an apparent reference to the criticism from three of four Sankaracharyas because the consecration of an unfinished temple flouts the scriptures and the resultant controversy.
He was equally unsparing of the Trinamul chief.
“Likewise, Trinamul had to select this specific day, none other, for its so-called integration events. The real pro-people issues, the corruption, the governance failure, the unemployment, the state of the economy, those are being relegated to the sidelines by both her here and him there,” said Aich Roy, whose party is in a precarious situation with regard to the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance in Bengal.
The Congress, Trinamul and the CPM are constituents of the INDIA bloc. In Bengal, the Congress and the CPM have been at daggers drawn with Trinamul. In her Park Circus Maidan address in the evening, Mamata was belligerent in her references to both the CPM and the Congress.
“They (Mamata and Modi) are both trying to use the armour and shield of religion to get through electoral battles, shoving the genuine concerns under the carpet. They are both adhering to the RSS script,” added Aich Roy. “This won’t succeed in the court of the people.”
CPM state secretary Md. Salim said Mamata was no different from Modi.
“Bearing the footwear of the RSS here, Mamata Banerjee is pretty much running the same form of governance and politics here. She, too, is trying to make the real issues take the backseat by bringing to centre stage temples, mosques, gurdwaras and churches. Why?” he asked at a press conference.
“All key parameters with regard to the economy, poverty, hunger, civil liberties, press freedom, India doing abysmally. They are both trying to make January 22 bigger than January 23,” added Salim, referring to the nation’s one of the greatest icons, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, whose birth anniversary is on January 23.
In the “anti-fascist” conference, which followed a rally between Wellington Square and the Netaji Indoor Stadium, 200-odd mass organisations adhering to Trinamul and the wider Left — such as CPI-ML (Liberation) — and human rights defenders like Teesta Setalvad and Harsh Mander participated. Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen was invited to join, but he was unable to on account of ill-health.
“The situation is very peculiar. What the government should do is done by the corporate world and the government is doing something that is the job of the people,” said Dipankar Bhattacharya, national general secretary of CPI-ML (Liberation).
Actor-playwright-filmmaker Bratya Basu, also Bengal’s education minister, said the Modi government was trying to create divisions on the basis of religion to win elections while selling off the nation’s vital resources on the side.
Setalvad said no party could be the custodian of the Hindu religion. “Hindu religion has many different facets, but here, a single party is trying to force something on the people. This is unacceptable,” she said."

A special messenger from the chief minister’s office handed over a sealed letter at the ED zonal office in Ranchi on Thursday afternoon.
Sources in the ED office who are connected with the probe in the alleged money laundering charges over a land scam in Ranchi informed that the chief minister has only written that “he would communicate about his availability for their summon in due course of time” indicating that he would not be available for their summons between January 27 and 31.
The same source also confided that during the questioning on Saturday at the chief minister’s residence when ED officials said that they might require his cooperation again when needed and Soren had said that he would be tied up till March 31.
Sources in the chief minister’s secretariat confirmed that apart from the budget session which will begin in mid-February there will be a series of launching of welfare schemes in view of the code of conduct which can be imposed any moment after the announcement of the Lok Sabha polls expected any moment in the next month.
Barely 48 hours after quizzing Soren, the ED had on Monday summoned him (ninth time) for questioning.
The ED letter had asked Soren to appear for questioning between January 27 and 31. The letter has also given the chief minister the option of answering the ED questions either at his official residence in Kanke Road or at the ED office on Hinoo Road in Ranchi.
Incidentally, ED officials had interrogated Soren for over seven hours on Saturday at his official residence.
Soren had earlier been quizzed by the ED in November 2022 in Ranchi in connection with an illegal mining case for nearly nine hours.
“ED officials had prepared a list of 50 questions out of which nearly 30 have been asked and the remaining questions need to be asked based on documentary evidence in the land scam case about change of ownership of an army land in Ranchi,” an ED source had earlier revealed."

The creative artwork signifies how the ceremonial parade would have been seen on screens across these decades.
India became independent in 1947 and a republic on January 26, 1950.
From big TV sets with cathode ray tubes to smaller ones and eventually, to smartphones, a lot has changed in India in these years.
The doodle depicts two TV sets and a mobile phone, with the letter 'G' on the left face of the first analogue television set, and the screens of the sets forming the two 'O's of 'GOOGLE'.
The remaining three letters 'G', 'L' and 'E' of the Google logo are displayed on the screen of the mobile handset placed in that order.
The first TV screen depicts scenes of the parade in black and white while the second one shows a camel contingent in colour, signifying the transition in technology.
""This Doodle celebrates India's Republic Day, which commemorates the day in 1950 when the Constitution of India was adopted and the nation declared itself a sovereign, democratic, and republic state,"" read a note on this doodle.
""Today's Doodle, illustrated by guest artist Vrinda Zaveri, features the Republic Day parade as it would have been seen on different screens over the decades,"" it said.
India is all set to celebrate its 75th Republic Day on Friday with an impressive display of military might and rich cultural heritage at the majestic Kartavya Path here.
The grand celebrations, with an overarching theme of projecting the nation's women power and democratic values, will be graced by French President Emmanuel Macron as the chief guest.
President of India Droupadi Murmu will lead the nation in celebrating the 75th Republic Day during a 90-minute parade at the ceremonial boulevard. Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by The Telegraph Online staff and has been published from a syndicated feed."

Hindu petitioners claim the mosque was built after demolishing parts of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple — the mosque now shares a compound with the reconstructed temple — and want the Varanasi district court to hand over the entire site to Hindus. Muslims have opposed the plea.
“The ASI has said that the western wall, some pillars and some stone scriptures were parts of a Hindu temple that were partially destroyed, with the same materials reused in the existing structure,” lawyer Vishnu Shankar Jain said, read out from a bunch of papers. He claimed these papers had been handed over by the district court to all the petitioners and respondents on Thursday evening.
Jain said the ASI had found the names of Hindu gods inscribed on the pillars and walls, including those of Janardana and Rudra.
Members of the Anjuman Intezamia Committee, the managing body of the mosque, said they too had received copies of the report but declined comment.
“The ASI report is a matter of interpretation and we don’t want to get into it the way the Hindu petitioners are doing,” a member of the committee told reporters on the condition of anonymity.
“Let us see how the case proceeds. We know that the tide is against us for several reasons, and will wait and watch the developments.”
The district court had asked the ASI early last year to conduct a scientific survey of the mosque, except for the Wazukhana. The agency submitted its report last December, appealing that the court keep it a secret. On Wednesday, the court rejected this request.
“The ASI says it has recovered 34 stone scriptures, of which 32 mention Hindu names of gods and places. Now we will move the court for the survey of the Wazukhana, which we consider a Shivalinga,” Jain said.
The mosque committee claims the purported Shivalinga is just a fountain meant for the faithful to wash their hands and legs before offering namaz."
TSGKX8KB37_4Q1QWL42J8YL3WA,Temple fever,"Sevanti Ninan Published 22.01.24, 07:12 AM","Sevanti Ninan Published 22.01.24, 07:12 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/temple-fever-the-medias-blitzkrieg-on-the-ram-mandir-inauguration/cid/1995344,"Even as the prime minister and ruling party orchestrate unprecedented religious fervour around the construction of the Ram mandir, there seems to be a broad media consensus on the huge public receptivity to the temple building project. That this is something most readers and viewers will want to read about and watch endlessly, that it will bring in the advertising, create jobs and markets. Few journalists, if any, are being judgmental about the government declaring half-day’s holiday to enable people to light lamps for a temple, or about a cabinet minister telling journalists that practically every organisation from the Uttar Pradesh government to the highway, telecom and the railway system is prepared for the demands that the temple will bring.
The business press has been abuzz with stories of spiritual merchandise sales on e-commerce platforms and temple fever driving the travel business. Spiritual tourism as a category has grown by 35% in a year, says one travel company, and is poised to become much bigger. EaseMyTrip has introduced EasyDarshan, even as Ayodhya dominates searches on travel platforms. Reliance Jio is putting in mobile towers, an Adani firm plans to distribute bhog and jalebis to thousands, Uber is introducing electric autos to run in the city.
At the trader end of the commerce boom, there are reports of a kirtan, havan and a rath yatra by Khan Market traders in New Delhi, and thousands of metres of running flags being ordered by another traders’ association to cover the entire Connaught Place area, not to mention more than 100,000 diyas to be lit here. Traders all across the country have joined the party — one is told that even Calcutta, which is not into Jai Shri Ram flags and festoons, is selling a large number of them. There is a tireless search for story angles — Amitabh Bachchan has bought a plot in Ayodhya; lamps will be lit on January 22 at the Davos meet and so on.
From the beginning of this year the Dainik Jagran has been running a full page, sometimes two, every day on the mandir countdown. But the pran pratistha is the culmination of a movement that has unfolded over centuries. So the Dainik Bhaskar has run, over three weeks, a 20-part front-page series called “Main Ayodhya Hun” beginning with the first mention of the town in the Atharva Veda. It dates Ayodhya’s origin to 6673 BC and incorporates mythology as early history. By the fourth episode, you are done with Dashratha, Kaikeyi, Rama, Sita, Ravana and Hanuman and are into what is described as a 450-year Ram janmabhoomi andolan.
From then on, it is narrated, without overtly saying so, as a history of the injustice done since Babur’s senapati destroyed the Ram temple and built the Babri masjid on its ruins. There is a quick leap to 1986 and the unlocking of the masjid, by which time, the series notes, the word secularism had become an irritant for Hindus and a symbol of Muslim appeasement. Each episode has a telling headline: “Ek taale ke bheetar Ayodhya ki aag dabi hui thi” (One padlock had suppressed the fire of Ayodhya). The paper says that the government took less than an hour to implement the order of a Faizabad court to open the locks of the masjid to pacify what it describes as “despondent Hindus”.
Thereafter, the mandir andolan got a major fillip with the telecast of Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan on Doordarshan and the launching of the shila poojan, wherein a brick made of local soil from each village was wrapped in saffron and despatched for Ayodha and worshipped by hundreds and thousands on the way. In April 1989, the Vishva Hindu Parishad held its Dharma Sansad to announce the Ram mandir shilanyas, by May, there was a Rs 25-crore plan to construct the temple. Meanwhile, the home minister, Buta Singh, had begun talks with parties in the Ram mandir dispute.
In 1988, the Bofors story had broken, V.P. Singh had left the government, and elections were less than a year away. Rajiv Gandhi was advised to do the shilanyas on what was believed to be the temple site. As the paper puts it, the prime minister was convinced that this would help him in the elections. The headline says, “Devraha Baba se milne Vrindavan daure Rajiv Gandhi” (Rajiv Gandhi ran to Vrindavan to meet Devraha Baba). The Babri Masjid Action Committee stepped up its opposition, describing the temple location as contested. But another location in Faizabad was described as uncontested and a shilanyas took place there in Nov­ember 1989.
According to the Dainik Bhaskar, Rajiv Gandhi began his election campaign from Ayodhya, but when the elections took place it was the Bharatiya Janata Party which took its seat tally from 2 to 85. In 1990, described as the karseva year, the distance between V.P. Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav is described as having been greater than the distance between the VHP and the Babri Masjid committee. “Mulayam Singh went and sat with the Babri Masjid lobby.” If society in Uttar Pradesh and then in the rest of the country began to be divided between the mandir and masjid, and the communal situation deteriorated in the state, it was entirely on account of Mulayam Singh’s pro-masjid stand, according to the Dainik Bhaskar.
In September 1990, L.K. Advani set out from Somnath for the rath yatra. The rath yatra plan for Guja­rat was made by Narendra Modi, who was then in the state BJP, and marked his rise in the national consciousness as a BJP politician. He masterminded the rath yatra’s ‘roop-rekha’, we are told. And, as the first karseva yatra began moving, people worshipped the rath and picked up the earth beneath it to put on their heads. The chronology of the political negotiations continues till the masjid is brought down in December 1992. This newspaper series is potted history, useful for younger readers in the Hindi heartland.
Court cases took over thereafter and the Archaeological Survey of India was asked by the court for whatever evidence it could get of what stood below the masjid. The Dainik Jagran, earlier this month, profiled the Muslim archaeologist who was part of the team which found evidence of a temple’s ruins beneath the masjid — evidence on which the Supreme Court based its 2019 judgment.
The Wire’s newsletter, India Cable, meanwhile offered the nugget that the five Supreme Court judges who had delivered the judgment on the Babri masjid site had posed for a group photograph and celebrated their verdict at the Taj Mansingh hotel, according to the memoirs of the former Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi. The good jud­ges have now been invited as state guests for the consecration ceremony of the mandir today. The Wire tells you, indignantly, that this is unprecedented.

The Tamil Nadu Government will then take necessary action on the disposal of these gold and diamond jewellery which were part of the material evidence in the disproportionate assets case against Jayalalithaa and others.
The trial was held in Karnataka on the direction of the Supreme Court and therefore all material evidence is in the Karnataka treasury now under the custody of the court.
Judge H A Mohan presiding over the XXXII Additional City Civil & Sessions court passed the order on Monday.
The court had earlier held that the kins of Jayalalithaa were not entitled for the properties which are confiscated by the State. The Special CBI Court had thus rejected the petition filed by J Deepa and J Deepak, the niece and nephew of Jayalalithaa, respectively.
Ordering the transfer of the jewels to the Tamil Nadu Government, the Special Court judge said: “Instead of auctioning the jewels, it is better to transfer the same to Tamil Nadu by handing over the same through the Department of Home, State of Tamil Nadu.""         The Court then issued the direction that the Tamil Nadu Home Department authorise  ""competent persons preferably in the rank of Secretary along with police to come and collect the jewels.”        In the same order, the Special Court ordered the payment of Rs five crore to Karnataka for the expenses of the trial conducted in the State. The payment will be made from a fixed deposit in an account related to Jayalalithaa in the State Bank of India branch in Chennai.
The disproportionate assets trial against Jayalalithaa, her former close aide V Sasikala, V N Sudhakaran, who is the disowned foster son of Jayalalithaa, and Sasikala's sister-in-law J Ilavarasi was conducted by the Special Court in Bengaluru.

TTS9G86X8D_5GUPGI80W26M5GS,Mamata Banerjee injured as her car stops to avert collision,"Snehamoy Chakraborty, Kinsuk Basu Calcutta Published 25.01.24, 06:10 AM","Snehamoy Chakraborty, Kinsuk Basu Calcutta Published 25.01.24, 06:10 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/west-bengal/bengal-chief-minister-mamata-banerjee-injured-as-her-car-stops-to-avert-collision/cid/1995989,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday afternoon suffered a “minor” forehead injury as the driver of her car applied emergency brakes to avoid a collision with another vehicle that suddenly came in front of her convoy in Burdwan town.
Mamata had gone to Burdwan for the state government’s benefit distribution programme. The accident took place when her convoy approached GT Road in Burdwan on her way back to Calcutta.
Although the chief minister went to Burdwan by chopper, she had to return to Calcutta by road because of bad weather.
“I could have died today (Wednesday) if the driver of my car did not apply the brakes immediately. While I was approaching the main (GT) road from a lane, a car driven at high speed came in front of my car. As my driver applied the brakes, my head hit the dashboard. I survived because of the blessings of people,” Mamata said in front of Raj Bhavan, four hours after meeting with the accident.
“There was minor bleeding and the portion of my head (that hit the dashboard) is swollen. However, I worked despite the injury,” Mamata, a Z-plus category protectee, told reporters.
The left side of her forehead was covered with medicinal tape.
A senior police officer said the accident was deemed a breach of security by the chief minister and the East Burdwan district police chief asked to start a probe.
However, the police haven’t traced the car that appeared in front of the convoy around 2pm.
“The road from the venue in Burdwan to GT Road takes an upward climb. As the chief minister’s car was taking the ascent, a car from the opposite direction came. The (chief minister’s) driver slammed the brakes and the VIP suffered an injury,” said a senior officer of East Burdwan district police. “We have started a probe to find out how exactly this security breach occurred.”
A police source said the vehicle that came across the chief minister’s convoy could be of police or district officials.
“We will interrogate all police personnel on duty,” another officer added.
Usually, the road a Z-plus security protectee takes to attend an event is sanitised hours ahead of the arrival, senior officers said. The deployment of forces remains intact along the route till the protectee leaves the venue. Members of the Special Security Unit (SSU) covering the chief minister ensure that the protocols listed in the blue book for Z-plus protectee are fully followed.
“Apart from her car’s driver, we will speak to the senior officer in charge of manning the VIP’s line of route,” the officer said. “A preliminary report has been made for Peeyush Pandey, director of security.”"
TWGB2LKDOA_N0R48CLGY32RRYS,The easier option,"Arghya Sengupta Published 24.01.24, 06:38 AM","Arghya Sengupta Published 24.01.24, 06:38 AM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/the-easier-option-dissecting-the-supreme-courts-ruling-on-article-370/cid/1995779,"It has barely been a month and a half since the judgment of the Supreme Court upholding the nullification of Article 370. Yet, it feels as if the judgment has already become a footnote in the relentless pursuit of the complete integration of Jammu and Kashmir into the rest of India. Politically, the refrain from August 2019 itself has been to ‘move on’, not squabble over historical constructs like ‘special status’ but chart a future for J&K that is peaceful, progressive and prosperous. Reduced terror incidents, increased tourist numbers and a cleaner Dal Lake have all been cited as evidence of such a future. While ‘moving on’ may have an instinctive appeal, it cannot cloud a dispassionate adjudication of the legality of Article 370. Yet, a careful reading of the judgment authored by the Chief Justice of India leads to the inescapable conclusion that this is precisely what has happened.
In recent times, there has been commentary on the CJI in reference to his visit to the Dwarkadhish temple in a saffron kurta and some comments he made there. This column might be mischaracterised as being in the same boat. That would be a mistake. Neither should a visit to a temple nor the donning of a saffron kurta by a CJI demonstrate his implied support for any political party, let alone an ideology. Let us not become a superficial country where one is not known by the content of one’s character but the colour of one’s kurta.
What is of greater concern than his sartorial choices or spiritual inclinations is that the reasoning employed by him in the Article 370 judgment is conceptually and logically dubious, with significant ramifications for the future of India as a federal democracy. The basic premise of the Supreme Court’s view that the nullification of Article 370 was valid is that the Article was “introduced with the purpose of enhancing constitutional integration and not disintegration.” That is why, the nullification of Article 370, which is the apogee of integration, making J&K just another part of India, fulfils this constitutional purpose.
The judgment makes a category mistake regarding this basic premise. Article 370 was a placeholder provision inserted into the Constitution because there was no substantive agreement between the leaders in Srinagar and New Delhi on the contours of the relationship between J&K and India. Till such agreement could be drawn up, Article 370 would function as a stop-gap. It had one overriding objective — all decisions relating to governance in the state would be taken collectively by the people of J&K represented by their government on the one hand and the people of India represented by the president on the other. If Article 370 had a fundamental purpose, it was neither integration nor disintegration with India but rather a scheme of collaborative decision-making. Contrary to this scheme, the actions of August 5 and 6, 2019, nullifying Article 370, despite the veneer of consulting the state (under president’s rule, those functions were being performed by Parliament) were unilateral actions by the Indian Parliament.
The court not only upheld such unilateral action but, in a twist of logic, also said that the Article fully authorised the president to act unilaterally. Consider the plain words of the Article on when the president can issue a notification to abrogate or nullify Article 370 — “Provided that the recommendation of the Constituent Assembly referred to in Clause (2) shall be necessary before the President issues such a notification.”
To anyone reading the Article, the word, “necessary”, signifies that the president cannot move ahead without a recommendation of the Constituent Assembly of J&K. In fact, this is how the Government of India interpreted the provision as well, moving to amend the requirement of recommendation by the Constituent Assembly with that of the state legislature. But the court, in two moves, found this recommendation to not be necessary. First, it said that the recommendation would not be binding on the president. Second, if the recommendation is made mandatory, it would lead to the freezing of the provision because no Constituent Assembly exists.
On the first ground, the court is right. But just because a recommendation is not binding does not mean that it should not be taken. If this logic were to be followed by the government when it receives recommendations from the collegium to select judges to the Supreme Court, then there is no need for the government to take collegium recommendations in the first place. The court should be careful in laying down propositions of law which might come back to haunt it later.
On the second ground, the provision could be made workable in a number of different ways despite the absence of the Constituent Assembly. As the government was trying, the Constituent Assembly could be replaced by the legislative assembly of J&K. Alternatively, there could be a new Constituent Assembly established in J&K for this purpose. Both of these are theoretical possibilities. Authorising the president to act unilaterally, flying in the face of the plain text of the Article and its stated intention, was not the only way to prevent a redundancy. The judgment is logically wrong on this ground.
What is most disappointing in this otherwise scholarly judgment is its reluctance to limit the powers of the president under president’s rule. While the court is right that the Constitution gives the president wide, untrammelled powers of the state government, all these powers are with a view to restore governance in the state.
But under the guise of restoring governance, can the state itself be fundamentally altered, partitioned and converted into two Union territories? If yes, should the government not have to show that no other alternative remained to bring back constitutional government to the state? By not requiring any standard of review worth the name, the court has ended up giving a free pass to future Union governments to ride roughshod over recalcitrant state governments. One may dismiss this as theoretical today but constitutional precedents have a way of springing back to life when one least expects them.
There may be a tendency to see this judgment by the CJI as a continuum stretching back to his judgment in the Ayodhya matter and, more recently, to his comparisons between the Hindu tradition and the Constitution. But that would be entirely reductionist and greatly disrespectful to an outstanding judge for over two decades. Even for such an outstanding judge, turning the clock back four years on such a sensitive matter was always going to be difficult. Moving on presented an easier alternative. As B.R. Ambedkar said in the Constituent Assembly, “but after all, the Chief Justice is a man with all the failings, all the sentiments and all the prejudices which we as common people have…” Chief Justice Chandrachud after all, is human. He will author better judgments and have better days. One hopes J&K will see better days too.

The grand celebrations, with an overarching theme of projecting the nation's women power and democratic values, will be graced by French President Emmanuel Macron as the chief guest.
President Droupadi Murmu will lead the nation in celebrating Republic Day with a 90-minute parade on the ceremonial boulevard -- Kartavya Path.
The armed forces will display an array of home-grown weaponry and military equipment such as missiles, drone jammers, surveillance systems, vehicle-mounted mortars and BMP-II infantry combat vehicles at the parade.
For the first time, an all-women tri-services contingent will be part of the event.
Also, the parade will be heralded by over 100 women artistes playing Indian musical instruments such as Sankh, Naadswaram, and Nagada for the first time instead of the traditional military bands.
Around 15 women pilots will also enthral the audience during the Indian Air Force's fly-past, representing 'Nari Shakti'. The contingents of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) will also consist of only women personnel.
The Republic Day parade is slated to commence at 10:30 am and will be held for around 90 minutes.
The ceremony will start with the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the National War Memorial, where he will lead the nation in paying solemn tributes to the fallen heroes by laying a wreath.
Minutes later, President Murmu and her French counterpart Macron will arrive in the 'traditional buggy', a practice that is making a comeback after a gap of 40 years, the defence ministry said.
The national flag will be unfurled followed by the national anthem with a 21-gun salute to be given with indigenous gun system 105-mm Indian Field Guns.
Four Mi-17 IV helicopters of the 105 Helicopter Unit will shower flower petals on the audience present at Kartavya Path. This will be followed by 'Aavaahan', a band performance by over 100 women artistes playing various types of percussion instruments.
The parade will then commence with President Murmu taking the salute. It will be commanded by Lieutenant General Bhavnish Kumar, General Officer Commanding, Delhi Area.
The Kartavya Path will also be witness to a march past by a combined band and marching contingent of the French Armed Forces.
A total of 16 tableaux from states and Union territories and nine from central ministries and departments will roll down the Kartavya Path during the parade.
The states and Union territories from where the tableaux will take part in the parade are Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Ladakh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana.

TYIAM8WANB_O4WXIJ3Y5RJ8OT3,"We will remain united and stay together, it’s my promise: Mamata Banerjee","Devadeep Purohit Calcutta Published 23.01.24, 05:27 AM","Devadeep Purohit Calcutta Published 23.01.24, 05:27 AM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/we-will-remain-united-and-stay-together-its-my-promise-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee/cid/1995556,"Mamata Banerjee on Monday tried to allay the biggest fear in the minds of the minorities, promising she would not let the saffron ecosystem persecute them, as she addressed a public meeting after an all-faith unity march.
“If you think that only you people (an allusion to Hindutva adherents) will live (in the country), that will not happen.... We will remain united and stay together, it’s my promise,” the Bengal chief minister said, appearing to project herself as the biggest protector of India’s secular ethos.
As she spoke these words, Mamata stole a glance at the group of religious heads from the Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Jain and Buddhist communities who were on the dais from where she was addressing a gathering of around 40,000 people.
The meeting was held after a 5km unity march through parts of south Calcutta, during which the Trinamul leader offered prayers at seven religious shrines popular among Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Muslims.
At the gathering, representatives of various religions explained why Mamata’s leadership was crucial if the country were to retain its pluralistic fabric.
Their short speeches made three main points — that India’s history is one of inclusion, that the minorities fear persecution, and that Mamata alone can protect the country’s secular character and the minorities’ rights.
Mamata, who listened to them with rapt attention and occasionally complimented the speakers after their speeches, tried her best to rise to the occasion.
“The battle has begun; it’s a battle for life…. The battle may be difficult, but victory will not elude us,” she said.
As her speech triggered discussions within Trinamul about whether it was one of her best, this newspaper asked her how she rated her performance at the Park Circus Maidan.
“I did not give any speech,” Mamata replied, implying what she said was not a political statement but rather a response to the minorities’ concerns and an effort to offer them a sense of security.
Ayodhya
In her 40-odd minute address, Mamata did not mention the consecration ceremony in Ayodhya or Prime Minister Narendra Modi even once, but her speech was peppered with oblique references to the pomp surrounding the inauguration of the Ram temple.
“I don’t have any problems if people pray to Ram, Shyam or Rahim.... You can always perform puja at home. I do it, too,” she said, making it clear that she respected all religions.
Since announcing the all-faith unity march, Mamata has been trying to get the message across that the initiative was not aimed at countering or opposing the Ram temple inauguration.
“My problem is with this (display) in a country where there are so many unemployed and poor people,” she said.
Mamata accused the BJP of organising the event ahead of the Lok Sabha elections to try and reap political dividends. “Please don’t do such politics before an election.... Don’t sacrifice the poor in the name of religion.”
It was clear she wasn’t only criticising the Prime Minister’s participation in the consecration but also flagging the elaborate arrangements — such as the installation of giant LED screens across the country to beam the inauguration live — to create a frenzy around the event.
She questioned the media coverage of the developments in Ayodhya.
“Have you seen what they are doing? It’s as if the freedom struggle is going on,” Mamata said, disapproving of the round-the-clock beaming of footage from Ayodhya.
She flagged the Ayodhya show’s downplaying of Sita. “I am not against Ram, but I also respect Sita. There was no mention of Sita…. Are you anti-women? Without Kaushalya, who would have given birth to Ram?” the chief minister said.

Fighting BJP
Mamata said she had the ability to take the BJP on and complained she was not being allowed to put up a fight.
“I have the ability to fight (the BJP)… but they don’t let me fight,” she said, signalling her disappointment with the INDIA bloc of Opposition parties, formed last year to put up a united fight against the BJP.
Mamata has been upset with the workings of the fledgling alliance for several reasons, such as the delay in sealing a seat-sharing arrangement and the regular attacks on her by the CPM leadership and a section of the Bengal Congress.
“I suggested the name INDIA, but when I attend its meetings I see the CPM trying to dictate to others. I don’t get the respect I deserve. I will not take any advice from those against whom I have fought all my life,” she said, implying she was uninterested in any truck with the communists.
She said the delay in reaching a seat-sharing formula — something she has been pitching for right from the alliance’s first meeting in Patna — was ending up helping the BJP.
“I had told them (the Congress) to fight in 300 seats and leave the regional players to fight the BJP in their respective states…. But they say they will do whatever they want. I warn them not to do anything that will end up strengthening the BJP,” Mamata said.
Mamata accused the Congress also of failing to organise any major nationwide programme coinciding with the consecration.
“I organised this unity rally.... I am the only one who visited a temple, a gurdwara, a church, a mazar and a mosque today,” she said.
“How many political parties took the BJP head-on today? Somebody went to one temple and thought it was sufficient, but it doesn’t work like that,” she said in what seemed an allusion to Rahul Gandhi’s unsuccessful effort to visit the Batadrava Than in Assam.
Battle cry
Although Mamata deliberately had politicians playing second fiddle to the religious leaders at the unity march and the meeting that followed, her speech was a deeply political one. She explained why the BJP was a threat to India’s inclusive culture.
She spoke at length about the divergent food habits and sartorial preferences among Indians, depending on culture and geography.
“They will not allow fish and meat.... They will not allow even a pregnant woman to have eggs. They will dictate what to eat and what to wear. I won’t let that happen,” the chief minister said.
She aired one of her biggest complaints against the BJP-led Centre — that it was denying Bengal its financial dues, thus depriving scores of the poor who had worked under the 100 days’ job scheme.
Mamata said work under the rural housing and rural road schemes had stopped because the Centre had frozen the funds.
“They want us to paint government buildings in saffron…. There are so many colours in the rainbow and we can select any of them, but they want us to opt for their party colour. Why should I allow this?” she said.
Mamata referred to the BJP’s efforts to use a section of Muslims to drive a wedge in the community.
“There are some touts who split Muslim votes…. This should not be allowed. I vow, in the name of God, that if anyone helps the BJP I will not spare them,” she said."
U3J2676CR0_8N6RFO3JUY4W438,Congress leader Rahul Gandhi welcomes Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur,"PTI New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 01:31 PM","PTI New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 01:31 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/congress-leader-rahul-gandhi-welcomes-bharat-ratna-to-karpoori-thakur/cid/1995859,"A caste census will be a true tribute to Karpoori Thakur as the country now needs ""real justice"" and not ""politics of symbolism"", Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Wednesday, even as he welcomed the decision to confer Bharat Ratna on the socialist leader.
Two-time Bihar chief minister Thakur has been named for the country's highest civilian award Bharat Ratna posthumously.
""I pay respectful tribute to Jannayak Karpoori Thakur ji, an incomparable warrior of social justice, on his birth centenary. He is certainly a precious gem of India and the decision to award him Bharat Ratna posthumously is welcome,"" Gandhi said in a post in Hindi on X.
The former Congress chief alleged that the BJP government's ""concealment"" of the results of the social and economic caste census conducted in 2011 and their ""indifference"" towards a nationwide census is an attempt to weaken the movement for social justice.
""'Justice of equal participation', one of the five justices of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, is at the centre of justice and social equality, which can begin only after the caste census,"" Gandhi said.
""In the true sense, this step will also be a true tribute to Jannayak Karpoori Thakur ji and his struggles for the rights of the backward and the deprived,"" he said.
""The country now needs 'real justice' not 'politics of symbolism',"" Gandhi asserted.
Thakur, who was born on this day in 1924 and passed away in 1988, was the first non-Congress socialist leader who became chief minister twice -- first for seven months in December 1970 and later for two years in 1977.
Thakur, known affectionately as 'Jan Nayak' (people's leader), is the 49th recipient of the country's highest civilian award. The award was last conferred on late president Pranab Mukherjee in 2019.
Born on January 24, 1924 in Nai samaj (barber society), Thakur is credited in Bihar politics for enforcing total prohibition of alcohol in 1970. The village where he was born in Samistupur district was renamed after him as Karpuri Gram.
He was inspired by heavyweights like Ram Manohar Lohia who spearheaded the socialist movement in post-Independent India. He was also close to Jayaprakash Narayan.

Ram Path -- the main thoroughfare -- was choked as devotees flooded the streets of the temple town, which has been gripped by religious fervour over the inauguration of the grand mandir.
The entry of devotees to the temple complex began at 6 am and about 2.5 lakh people are likely to have visited the temple by 2 pm, Ayodhya Divisional Commissioner Gaurav Dayal told PTI.
It is estimated that about five lakh devotees will have visited by the end of the day, another official said.
Waiting in serpentine queues outside the temple were people who had been camping in Ayodhya since before the consecration ceremony, having made long and difficult journeys to reach the temple town.
An idol of the new Ram Lalla was consecrated at the Ayodhya temple on Monday, a landmark event led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
On Tuesday, 'Ram dhun' played in the streets as security personnel kept guard and sought to control the crowd even as many chanted ""Jai Shri Ram"" and attempted to enter through the gateway.
For a couple hours in the afternoon, the crowd became so huge that the security personnel scrambled to maintain order.
The entire section of the Ram Path facing the gateway was blocked as many devotees, some of whom landed with suitcases and backpacks, wanted to have a 'darshan'.
At the main gateway, the commotion in the crowd led to one devotee fainting and having to be taken for medical treatment.
There was a ""sudden massive rush"" in the morning and the people were continuously streaming in, seeking to visit the temple and have a darshan of Ram Lalla, Dayal said.
The administration is taking measures to keep the crowd in order, ""with proper holding (area), queuing and proper barricading"", he added.
Uttar Pradesh information director Shishir said more than 8,000 policemen are deployed at the temple and ""everything is under control"".
Director General, Law Order, Prashant Kumar and Principal Secretary, Home, Sanjay Prasad are inside the temple and overseeing the arrangements.
Ayodhya police, in a post on X, also refuted rumours that the temple was temporarily closed due to the heavy rush.
Suresh Kumar and his friend from Chhattisgarh stood in the milling crowd, eager to have a 'darshan' but had little hope of getting in as they both carried suitcases.
""We have come from Durg. We took a train to Kanpur and then a bus to Lucknow and another bus to Ayodhya and reached Ayodhya at 10.30 am,"" he told PTI.
The pair said they made a ""sudden plan"" to visit Ayodhya.
""We have come just for the 'darshan'. We will go back today,"" he said.
Security guards later made a semi-circular human fence to manage the crowd as other personnel made announcements on loudspeakers to keep order.
A large number of devotees had gathered outside the main gates for hours since late Monday night, waiting to enter the premises.
Carrying flags bearing the visages of Lord Ram and chanting ""Jai Shri Ram"", the devotees waited for hours in the biting cold before the doors of the grand temple opened early in the morning.
""Felt so delighted, my life's aim has been fulfilled. Our ancestors struggled for this and it has been brought to fruition,"" said Manish Verma, a devotee from Punjab.
Nitish Kumar, a resident of Bihar's Madhepura district, cycled more than 600 kilometres to reach Ayodhya.
""There is a massive rush but I am hopeful I will get a chance to have 'darshan' today. I will start my journey back once my wish is fulfilled. Though I couldn't go to the temple on Monday, what a day it was to be in Ayodhya,"" he told PTI.
Anurag Sharma from Rajasthan's Sikar was seen walking around with a model of the temple on the day of the consecration ceremony.
""I brought this model with me from my hometown. I arrived on the inaugural flight to Ayodhya and I have been here since then. I will go back only after having a 'darshan' of Ram Lalla,"" he told PTI.
Groups of people could also be seen marching towards the temple, passing through the decked-up Ram Path.
""Ram Lalla gave us the strength to walk all the way from Chhattisgarh and now He only will get us through this crowd so we can take His blessings,"" said Sunil Madho, part of an eight-member group that undertook a 'padyatra' to Ayodhya.
Maharashtra native Gopal Krishna, who arrived in Ayodhya a few days ago, also jostled in the thick crowd as it moved towards the security check.
""We came here a few days ago as Lord Ram called us. People were telling us to not travel as police would impose restrictions on travel and rooms would not be available in hotels. We are staying at an ashram and this is the day we waited for,"" he told PTI.
The devotees chanted ""Jai Shri Ram"" as they walked in and out of the temple complex. Inside the main temple, ""Jai Shri Ram"" chants reverberated in its grand halls.
The temple complex, built in the traditional Nagara style, is 380 feet long from the east to the west, 250 feet wide and will eventually rise to 161 feet at the 'shikhar'.
Lakhs of people watched the 'pran pratishtha (consecration)' ceremony on television in their homes and neighbourhood temples, savouring the historic moment on Monday.
""January 22, 2024, is not merely a date in the calendar but heralds the advent of a new era,"" Modi said after he performed a series of rituals in the 'garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum)'.
The prime minister also prostrated himself before the 51-inch idol that depicts the child Ram.
""Today, our Ram has arrived. After a long wait for ages, our Ram has arrived. Our Ram Lalla will no longer live in a tent. Our Ram Lalla will stay in a magnificent temple,"" Modi said in his address to the invitees.

The MLA, who left the ED office in South Mumbai around 10 pm, told reporters that he was cooperating with the agency which has called him again for questioning on February 1.
Earlier, NCP MP Supriya Sule and other party leaders accompanied the 38-year-old legislator as he arrived at the central agency's office at Ballard Estate around 10.30 am.
Before going to the probe agency's office, Rohit Pawar went to the NCP office's located nearby and met Sharad Pawar, touched his feet, and also interacted with other party leaders.
He also visited the Vidhan Bhavan and paid tributes at the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and a plaque of the Indian Constitution.
Before Rohit Pawar entered the ED office, Sule handed him over a copy of the Indian Constitution.
She hugged him and he touched her feet before entering the probe agency's office.
Sule was also present when Rohit Pawar stepped out of the ED office late at night, and greeted party workers.
He later headed for the NCP office where Sharad Pawar was present.
""I have cooperated with the investigation, and will continue to do so. I have been called again on February 1,"" the MLA told reporters.
In a veiled dig at his uncle and Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, he said some people ""ran away to be in power.""  Sharad pawar was fighting for the ""self-respect of the state and Marathi people,"" Rohit added.
Hundreds of NCP workers, who have come here from across the state, gathered at the party office in South Mumbai. They raised slogans in support of Rohit Pawar and staged a protest against the ED.
""The officers are doing their job, whatever documents they have demanded, we have given to them. I will appear before them and whatever information they are asking I will give them,"" the NCP MLA from Karjat Jamkhed had said earlier in the day before entering the ED office.
The Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank money laundering case stems from an August 2019 FIR of the Mumbai Police’s Economic Offences Wing.
The ED conducted searches on January 5 at the premises of Baramati Agro, a company owned by Rohit Pawar, and some linked entities in Baramati, Pune, Aurangabad and some other locations.
The case was filed after the Bombay High Court issued an order to investigate the allegations of sale of sugar factories in the Maharashtra cooperative sector through alleged fraudulent means and at throwaway prices.

Kramer New York Published 25.01.24, 08:16 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/military-jet-crashes-in-russia-65-ukraine-prisoners-of-war-killed-moscow-blames-kyiv/cid/1996029,"A large Russian military transport plane crashed on Wednesday in the Belgorod region near the border with Ukraine, killing everyone on board, the Russian defence ministry said in a statement, accusing Ukraine of shooting down the plane with missiles.
The defence ministry said the plane had been carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were being transferred to the region from a military airport near Moscow to be exchanged for Russian service personnel. It accused Ukrainian forces of launching two missiles from the nearby Kharkiv region of Ukraine that struck the aircraft. The plane was also carrying six crew members and three other individuals, the ministry said.
The Russian claims could not be independently verified.
Officials in Ukraine did not comment directly on Moscow’s accusations that Ukraine shot down the plane but the military’s general staff headquarters issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon asserting a right to target Russian military transport airplanes in the border region.
The statement, posted on the military command’s Facebook page, did not deny shooting down the plane. It said that repeated Russian missile strikes on the city of Kharkiv and the surrounding region had in the past week killed 16 people and wounded another 78 people and that Ukraine had responded by targeting missile launch sites and the logistics for missile deliveries.
“The armed forces of Ukraine will continue to take measures to destroy delivery vehicles and control the airspace to eliminate the terrorist threat,” the statement said.
The Belgorod region of Russia has a long border with Ukraine. Over the past few weeks, it has been the scene of frequent Ukrainian attacks, including a missile bombardment in December. It was also the staging ground for Moscow’s full-scale invasion in 2022 and for further Russian strikes against Ukrainian territory during the war.
The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said on social media that the plane had crashed in a field near a settlement in the Korochansky district. He said that emergency services were at the site. A video posted to Telegram and verified by The New York Times showed a large plane crashing and exploding in Yablonovo, a town in the Korochansky district. Tass, a Russian state news agency, published a video of the scene of the crash showing debris littering a snowy field.

Avigyan Kishor Das, 16, a student of Hooghly Collegiate School, has been invited by the Centre to grace the historic 75th Republic Day celebration as a “distinguished” patent holder, which is a recognition of his “substantial contribution in the field of science and technology” and for raising the “stature of India globally”.
Avigyan, a science student, holds a patent for a touch-free portable automatic hand sanitising system. Approval for patents for eight other inventions of his is pending.
Sources said the teenager received the prestigious National Intellectual Property Award in October last year. It paved the way for his invitation to the historic occasion as one of the youngest dignitaries.
“Being invited to be a distinguished guest by the country’s government is a huge honour. It will be the experience of my lifetime to watch the parade on the 75th Republic Day celebration in New Delhi seated with other dignitaries. This invitation will inspire me to undertake more new endeavours,” Avigyan said.
A communication on invitations to patent holders issued by the Controller General of Patents, Designs and Trademarks, a wing of the Union ministry of commerce and industry, states: “The inventors and patent holders play a very significant role in the economic development of a country. To acknowledge the contribution and ingenuity of Indian inventors, the Government of India has decided to invite to the Republic Day parade the distinguished patent holders.""
Avigyan was chosen for the National Intellectual Property award for his work on “the development of a real-time automobile and industrial pollution monitoring and controlling device, as well as for the touch-free sanitizing system in the below 18 years category titled “Top Indian Individual for patents”.
Avigyan's father Anindya Kishor Das is an employee of the Indian Audit and Accounts Department. His mother Priyanka Das is a homemaker. Both said their son was ""innovative since his childhood"".
His father Anindya said: “The central government's invitation to my son to witness the Republic Day parade is a great honour for our family also.""
When he was only 11, one of Avigyan's innovations was adjudged the best in a competition organized by the International Science Festival in Calcutta. For the science festival, Avigyan developed a real-time pollution control device that when fitted to the engine of a vehicle can eventually disable its movement permanently once its pollutant capacity rose beyond the permissible level.
In 2019, the then Class VII student developed a device to automatically stop a running train to avert possible accidents in case the driver suffered a cardiac arrest or became unconscious. The young inventor used a pulse oximeter to develop his device. The innovation earned him the first prize in the “Best Innovative Project” category at a competition organised by a private engineering college.
Asked about his future plans, Avigyan said he wanted to do research in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
“I want to develop tools and systems using basic science and technology to provide solutions to domestic needs in daily life,"" said the gifted teen."

The Israeli military says it was looking into the reports.
Meanwhile, the death toll from a strike the day before on a crowded shelter in Gaza rose to 12, with over 75 wounded, according to Thomas White, a senior official with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.
The agency did not directly blame Israel, which is the only party to the conflict that has tanks.
The Israeli military said it has “currently ruled out” that the strike was carried out by its aircraft or artillery but was still investigating. It says the building might ha
ve been hit by a Hamas rocket.
The fighting in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis has isolated its two main hospitals, stranding hundreds of patients and thousands of displaced people inside.
A third hospital was evacuated overnight, White said. Thousands of people rushed to escape farther south in recent days, crowding into shelters and tent camps near the border with Egypt."

The posters not only helped police identify the man but also led them to his killers, who have been arrested, according to police.
Police said the body was found near the Geeta Colony flyover on January 10 and an investigation was launched.
""For us, it was a blind murder case as no documents were found in the victim's pocket that could help us identify him. The body was taken into custody and... after 72 hours, doctors conducted an autopsy which revealed that he was strangled to death,"" a senior police officer said on Wednesday.
A team of 30 police personnel was formed to work on the case. The first challenge for the team was to establish the identity of the man.
""Utilising AI, we digitally reconstructed the victim's face with open eyes and changed the background. The same photo was uploaded on CCTN (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network) website, which connects police of different eight states, and more than 400 posters were distributed strategically in the national capital and shared digitally via WhatsApp groups till January 12,"" the officer said.
A breakthrough in the case was made when a man who saw a poster outside a police station identified the victim as his brother Hitendra.
During the investigation, it was found that Hitendra had a fight with two persons over a woman around two months ago. The accused persons met him on January 9 and strangled him to death. The accused were in an inebriated condition at the time of the incident, police said.
Four people, including a woman and a cab driver, have been arrested in connection with the case, police said.

URWBXQGYY2_Z5BFQRVFVGMERYB,Tata Steel UK takes fresh guard after spending £6.8 billion over 16 years to cover losses,"Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 22.01.24, 10:35 AM","Sambit Saha Calcutta Published 22.01.24, 10:35 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/business/tata-steel-uk-takes-fresh-guard-after-spending-6-8-billion-over-16-years-to-cover-losses/cid/1995391,"The two blast furnaces at Port Talbot, scheduled to be shut forever later this year, are the last remnants of a sprawling primary steel-making operation in the UK that Tata Steel had inherited when it acquired the Anglo-Dutch Corus Group Plc for £6.2 billion in 2007.
In the 16 years since then, it has been mostly a struggle for the Indian management to keep the hearth aglow as the UK operations, spread principally over three locations — Port Talbot, Scunthorpe and Teesside — at the time of the takeover, managed to post profit only twice on the strength of the business.
In the process, Tata Steel UK suffered close to £5 billion in losses, excluding an exceptional non-cash gain of £1.64 billion from the restructuring of the British Steel Pension Schemes (BSPS) in 2017-18.
The company on Friday disclosed that it had sunk £6.8 billion to cover losses, improvements in steel-making sites, pension restructuring costs and in capital support to service Tata Steel UK’s share of debt. In other words, it spent more to keep the UK business running than it paid to acquire the UK and Netherlands operations.
The chronology
Records kept by Tata Steel UK show it posted a profit in 2007-08, the very first year of operations under the Tata management and before the Lehman Brothers crash sent the world economy into a tailspin.
The first signs of strain were visible as early as 2009 when the company began consultation to mothball Teesside Cast Products (TCP) in north England as four international slab buyers declined to honour off-take agreements. The plant was mothballed at the end of February 2010 and sold to SSI of Thailand in March 2011. In the process, it posted a profit in 2010-11 on the back of the gain from the sale.
The next wave of restructuring hit the company in 2014 when the long product business based in Scunthorpe was hived off to a separate entity. On May 31, 2016, the Scunthorpe operations and other long products group companies were sold to Greybull Capital, reportedly for a token £1. Consequently, it was left with only one primary steel-making capacity in Port Talbot, Wales.
A year later, TSUK’s speciality steel and bar products business, principally located at Rotherham using an electric arc furnace (EAF), was sold to Liberty Speciality Steels Ltd (Liberty House).
In September 2017, Tata Steel Europe also signed a memorandum of understanding with thyssenkrupp AG (TK) Germany to forge an equal (50:50) joint venture to combine the steel business of the two behemoths. However, the plan was abandoned a year later after it failed to receive merger control approval from the European Commission.
While operational restructuring was ongoing, TSUK also took steps to insulate itself from the liabilities of BSPS and in September 2017, it received approval from the UK pension regulator to separate the pension scheme.
On the back of the restructuring of the BSPS, TSUK booked a notional gain of £1.64 billion in 2017-18 and reported book profit. Without the same, it would have made a loss of £260 million in that fiscal.
The company’s profitable outing on the back of operations came in 2021-22 as steel mills across the globe experienced an unprecedented margin expansion in the aftermath of the pandemic. It swung to red again in 2022-23 with a loss of £674 million.
Way ahead
The Tata Steel management believes the closure of the BFs at Port Talbot and the subsequent erection of an EAF can be game changer for the business which has been a drag on the more profitable Indian operations for years.
The transition is expected to reverse years of losses and be environmentally sustainable as the plant will use scrap and electric as raw materials, instead of coal and iron ore, reducing TSUK’s CO2 emissions by 5 million tonnes per year and overall UK country emissions by about 1.5 per cent.
The investment of £1.25 billion includes a £500 million grant from the UK government and the EAF is going to be ready by 2027. In the process, TSUK’s steelmaking capacity would be at 3mt, down from 14.4mt at the time of acquisition.
TSUK is hoping to be self-sufficient in raw materials use as it plans to source scrap compared to now when almost all of the raw materials for the current blast furnaces are imported.
In the interim period, Tata Steel has developed plans which would enable it to secure continuity of supply through its existing downstream and steel processing sites for UK and overseas customers, utilising imported semi-finished steel including from Tata Steel plants in the Netherlands and India as well as other select strategic suppliers until the commencement of EAF production.
In order to be able to deliver the proposed EAF in 2027, the company has begun engineering design work and construction planning.
It is in advanced planning discussions with National Grid about enabling infrastructure and has also begun engagement with the local authority and regulators."

The release of the documents, copies of which were reviewed by The New York Times, follows a petition to the International Court of Justice by South Africa, which has accused Israel of genocide. Much of South Africa’s case hinges on inflammatory public statements made by Israeli leaders that it says are proof of intent to commit genocide.
Part of Israel’s defence is to prove that whatever politicians may have said in public was overruled by executive decisions and official orders from Israel’s war cabinet and its military’s high command.
The court, the UN’s highest judicial body, began hearing arguments in the case this month and is expected to provide an initial response to South Africa’s petition — in which it could call for a provisional ceasefire — as soon as Friday.
Since October, Israel has pounded Gaza in a campaign that has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, or roughly 1 in 100 residents of the territory, according to health officials in Gaza; displaced nearly 2 million people; and damaged the majority of the buildings, according to the UN. The campaign is a response to a Hamas-led assault that led to the deaths and abductions of roughly 1,400 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials.
The Genocide Convention of 1948, which South Africa has accused Israel of violating, does not define genocide solely as killing members of a particular ethnic or national group. Crucially, it says the killings must be committed “with intent to destroy” that group.
“Everything hinges on intent,” said Janina Dill, a professor at Oxford University and co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict.
To that end, both South Africa and Israel are focused not only on what leaders and soldiers have done but also on what they have said. The roughly 400-page defence includes what Israel says is evidence that it sought a legal war with Hamas and not a campaign of genocide against the Palestinians.
Among the declassified Israeli documents are summaries of Cabinet discussions from late October, in which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered supplies of aid, fuel and water to be sent to Gaza. He also instructed the government to examine how “external actors” might set up field hospitals to treat Palestinians, as well as consider mooring a hospital ship off the coast of the territory.

In an apparent swipe at Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, the opposition party said many chief ministers can fall to any level of sycophancy to ""make Delhi happy"".
Congress leader Kanhaiya Kumar said the country needs ""five types of justice"" in the current scenario -- justice for youth, women, farmers, labourers, and participation of all.
Only the restoration of these justices will give strength to the country. The majority of the population of our country is still outside its ambit, Kumar said at a press conference at the AICC headquarters here.
""It seems the rulers are afraid of the success of struggle,"" he said, adding that while Bharat Jodo Yatra did not face any major hindrances, obstacles were being created for the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
He said it started with the denial of permission to start the Yatra from an Imphal ground.
""They (BJP governments) give the excuse of security every time to disrupt our Yatra and the unjust forces are creating obstacles in this fight for justice,"" Kumar said.
""This is not an electoral yatra but a yatra of struggle for the country. Efforts are being made repeatedly to stop the Yatra and permissions are withdrawn at the last moment,"" the Congress leader alleged.
""The question is that due to our Yatra, a law and order situation arises but on the same route when ministers or (BJP chief J P) Nadda ji's programme is there, it is allowed. So the government is standing with injustice,"" Kumar said.
The Congress party ""which defeated the British, which was not afraid of their cannons, why would they be afraid of the barricades"", he said in a reference to the Yatra being stopped from entering Guwahati on Tuesday.
""Many CMs can fall to any level of sycophancy in order to make Delhi happy... 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' is being organised only to establish social, economic and political justice in the country.
""FIRs on false allegations and false cases have been filed against Congress workers and leaders and we will not be scared of such tactics, we will not be cowed down,"" the Congress leader said.
Rahul Gandhi was booked on Tuesday for ""wanton acts of violence"" by the Assam Police as the political confrontation between the Congress leader and state Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma escalated on the tenth day of the Yatra.
""Concerning wanton acts of violence, provocation, damage to public property and assault on police personnel today by Congress members, an FIR has been registered against Rahul Gandhi, KC Venugopal, Kanhaiya Kumar and other individuals...,"" the chief minister posted on X.
Sarma had earlier in the day instructed Director General of Police G P Singh to register a case against Gandhi for ""provoking the crowd"".
Gandhi said Sarma was ""scared"" and asserted that his actions were only helping the Yatra in getting publicity.
The state police didn't allow the Gandhi-led yatra to enter the capital city, triggering protests from Congress workers who removed barricades, resulting in a clash in which some Congress leaders, including state party president Bhupen Borah, suffered minor injuries.
At the presser on Wednesday, Kumar said unemployment in the country is at a ""45-year high"" and, therefore, justice for youths means employment for them.
""We have to ensure participation of people, irrespective of the sector,"" he said and asserted that there was a need to build a safe and free society for women.
""Farmers should get fair prices for their crops... workers are not getting fair wages. Congress government will ensure fair wages,"" he said, elaborating on what he called the ""five pillars of justice"" needed in the country.
Kumar's remarks come a day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the idea behind his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is to provide justice to people and the party will present a five-point blueprint of 'nyay' that will also help strengthen the country.
Gandhi said it will be based on five pillars which are justice to youth, women, farmers, labourers and achieving equal participation.

V5BKO9IP88_IC02NAML0WDYSRV,Ideas and fancy take wings at Kolkata Children’s Literature Festival inaugural edition,"Vedant Karia Kolkata Published 24.01.24, 12:47 PM","Vedant Karia Kolkata Published 24.01.24, 12:47 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/my-kolkata/events/ideas-and-fancy-take-wings-at-kolkata-childrens-literature-festival-inaugural-edition/cid/1995864,"Growing up in Kolkata is synonymous with growing up around books. Be it the often-dusty covers peering at you through every shop on College Street, or the new-book smell that greets you when you walk into an iconic Park Street bookstore, it’s hard not to love literature here. To reinforce this, SPK Jain Futuristic Academy organised the inaugural Kolkata Children’s Literature Festival on January 13 and 14, on its New Town campus. My Kolkata was there.
The event was inaugurated on January 12 by NKDA chairman Debashis Sen, coinciding with the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda. Sen has been known to encourage reading at the elementary level with several projects, including the New Town library. “The teachings of Swami Vivekananda deeply resonate with this festival’s purpose. I strongly believe that children should be encouraged to write for children, and events like this give a platform to both young authors and readers,” he said.
Children found themselves drawn to the (left) Harry Potter corner, when they weren’t playing word and art games.
The event began on January 13 with a marquee session by Mumbai-based mythologist and writer Devdutt Pattanaik, who drew from the philosophy in ancient shastras to provide valuable insights about violence. Pattanaik reflected on how every contemporary kids’ story, including Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Superman, glorifies war, insinuating that the winner is a ‘victor’, while the loser is a ‘martyr’. “Stories like these teach kids that they must wage war to get ahead. Even the Ramayana and Mahabharata have war, but both Ram and Krishna are cursed for employing violence. Irrespective of how noble their motivations are, they always have to deal with the consequences of using violence,” he explained.
He also beckoned people to exercise empathy while talking to people and try to understand the other’s perspective. “Today’s debate culture is very violent and hinges on proving someone wrong. We must keep our pride aside, and believe that we don’t know everything. If there are 200 people in this room, there are also 200 truths,” he added.
The event was inaugurated by NKDA chairman Debashis Sen.
The second marquee session involved a panel discussion on ‘Children’s Literature in Bangla Cinema’ with Abir Chatterjee, Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guha as the speakers. Roy cited how Satyajit Ray adapted his grandfather Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury’s story into the 1969 film Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne, adding that it was the gold standard of transitioning literature into cinema. “When Feluda was written, the mobile wasn’t invented, but today even he uses a smartphone. A children’s film should go beyond the text and adapt to the demands of the time and form. You can’t just rely on the story, and cut corners in presentation. Literature must be made attractive for kids,” she said.
Chatterjee drew from his own experiences in playing both Feluda and Byomkesh, and incorporated feedback he had received from children. “A child today isn’t experiencing childhood the way we used to. I feel like filmmakers often thump their sense of childhood on today’s children. Time has evolved, and we need to incorporate the unique experience of growing up today while making cinema for children,” he said.
While (L-R) Monica Santos enthralled kids with a clowning show, Kunal Motling left everyone speechless with his mime act.
Guha beckoned the audience to find the child within themselves, arguing that children’s cinema wasn’t just meant for people under 18. “The emotions children feel are present within all of us. While making a film centred around kids, a filmmaker must treat the subject with maturity and innocence without looking down upon them. Only then will it stir the emotions within viewers,” Guha explained.
The two days were packed with unique workshops for children of all ages. These pertained to storytelling, news reporting, clowning, creative writing, miming and comics.
“We believe that every child is born with a special skill. In order to bring it out, we must ignite them with freedom, and fuel them with the right environment. This festival is our way of fuelling the thirst children have for knowledge, where everyone can learn and have fun,” said Jaideep Patwa, honorary secretary, SPK Jain Futuristic Academy."

The idea of India is going through fire to be further strengthened, Gandhi recently told a group of students in Meghalaya during his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
Publishing a video on social media on Friday of the interaction with the students, Gandhi said, ""Universities, once bastions of free thought and expression, have now been converted to breeding grounds of fear, suppression, and blind obedience.""  	""Can the future of India spread its wings within a cage? This is why politics and resistance matters for Indian students,"" he said.
In his interaction with the students along with Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Kanhaiya Kumar, Gandhi asked the students, ""What is a slave?"" 	""What the RSS is trying to do to India is trying to make sure everybody is blindly obedient to what they say. Can a country function like that?"" he can be heard saying in the video.
Gandhi claimed he wanted to meet the students in their university and not in a closed room.
He alleged that Home Minister Amit Shah ""gave an order"" to the owner of the university that his conversation with the students was not allowed because he would say things to those students that would make them think about what was going on in India.
""And the answer to this blind obedience is resistance,"" Gandhi told the students.
""Resistance because as an individual I have my own view of the world,"" he added.
Sharing a link to the video of the interaction, Ramesh -- the Congress general secretary -- said in a post in Hindi on X, ""Recently, during the Bharat Jodo Nyaya Yatra, Rahul Gandhi interacted with students in Meghalaya on many issues, including youth politics, atmosphere of fear and pressure spread in universities."" 	During this, Rahul Gandhi openly answered the questions of the students, he said.
Ramesh further said the things Gandhi said are applicable not only to the northeast but to universities of the entire country.
He also posted a short clip from the same interaction in which a student asked a question to Gandhi and Kumar regarding the entry of youngsters into politics, to which both said those dissuading them from entering politics tell them it is dirty and not worth it when changes in the country are brought about only through politics.
The Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra has taken a pre-planned break after 12 continuous days and will resume on January 28 with a padyatra in West Bengal's Jalpaiguri.
Having passed through Manipur, Nagaland, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Cooch Behar in West Bengal, the yatra stopped for a pre-planned break on Thursday afternoon.
The yatra will resume at 2 pm on January 28 with a padyatra in Jalpaiguri, followed by a padyatra and a public address in Siliguri.
Gandhi is undertaking the over 6,700-kilometre Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra from Manipur to Mumbai.
The yatra entered Cooch Behar early on Thursday where Gandhi was accorded a rousing welcome by party workers. The yatra flag was handed over to the Congress' West Bengal chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury by the Assam Congress.

The AAP is organising shobha yatras and bhandaras in different parts of the national capital to celebrate the 'Pran Pratistha (consecration)' ceremony.
In a post in Hindi on X, Kejriwal said he participated in bhandaras organised in different areas of Delhi.
""Hearty congratulations and best wishes to all of you on this sacred occasion of the installation of Maryada Purushottam Lord Shri Ram in the grand temple. Hail Siya Ram,"" he said in another post.
The new Ram Lalla idol was consecrated at the Ayodhya temple on Monday, an event led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and watched by lakhs of people on television at their homes and in temples across the country.
""Our Ram has come,"" Modi said in his address that followed the consecration, which also marked the temple's inauguration.
In Delhi, Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj participated in a 'Sundar Kand' recital at Sheikh Sarai.
""On the auspicious occasion of the 'Pran Prathistha' at the Ram temple, I had the privilege of attending the 'Sundar Kand' recital organised at Sheikh Sarai 2. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has organised shobha yatras and 'Sundar Kand' recitals in every ward of Delhi. Jai Siya Ram,"" he said in a post in Hindi on X.
His Cabinet colleague Atishi participated in a puja and havan on the occasion.
In a post in Hindi on X, she said, ""On the auspicious occasion of the 'Pran Pratishtha', I performed a puja and havan of Lord Shri Ram. Shri Ram is present in every particle of this world and in the mind of every human being. If we adopt the ideals of Maryada Purushottam (Lord Ram) in our personality, then life will be blessed. Jai Shri Ram."" 	Other party leaders will also hold events during the day.
The Delhi government's three-day Ramlila at ITO's Pearey Lal Bhawan will culminate in the evening.
Modi on Monday said Lord Ram will no longer live in a tent but reside in a magnificent temple.
Addressing a gathering after the consecration ceremony, Modi said, ""Today, our Ram has arrived. After a long wait for ages, our Ram has arrived."" 	The prime minister said he could still feel the divine vibrations he experienced during the ceremony inside the temple's sanctum sanctorum.
""Our Ram Lalla will no longer live in a tent. Our Ram Lalla will stay in a magnificent temple,"" Modi said.
The AAP has planned a series of events -- from shobha yatras to bhandaras, 'Sundar Kand' recitals to aartis -- across Delhi's 70 assembly constituencies to mark the consecration ceremony.

He also questioned why senior BJP leaders such as JP Nadda, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh did not attend the ceremony.
""It is also a mystery that JP Nadda, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh were not present at the consecration. Why did the leaders of their own party not go? It means that the method adopted was not right,"" he told reporters.
""The (consecration) programme was like a political event. The consecration of Ram Lalla could have been accomplished in a completely religious, cultural and religious manner. Shankaracharyas were ignored and that is not a good tradition,"" Gehlot added.
An idol of the new Ram Lalla was consecrated at the Ayodhya temple on Monday, a landmark event led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who also gave a clarion call to go beyond the grand mandir's construction to build the foundation of a ""strong, capable and divine"" India of the next 1,000 years.
Gehlot also claimed that the speeches delivered after the ceremony were dangerous and intellectuals are worried about the direction that these would take the country.
""We all, the countrymen, should be worried about this,"" he said.
Lakhs of people watched the 'pran pratishtha (consecration)' ceremony on television in their homes and neighbourhood temples, becoming part of the historic event held just months before the Lok Sabha elections.
""January 22, 2024, is not merely a date in the calendar but heralds the advent of a new era,"" Modi said after he performed a series of rituals in the 'garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum)'.
The prime minister also prostrated himself before the 51-inch idol that depicts the child Ram.
""Today, our Ram has arrived. After a long wait for ages, our Ram has arrived. Our Ram Lalla will no longer live in a tent. Our Ram Lalla will stay in a magnificent temple,"" Modi said in his address to the invitees.
Gehlot also attacked the BJP government in Assam for allegedly disrupting the Congress' Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
""The Assam chief minister ordered to file an FIR whereas no chief minister or the prime minister has the right to directly tell the police or an officer to file one,"" Gehlot said.
""This work is done by the SHO under the CrPC. They decide by looking at the incident that happened, in what form it happened, why it happened and the sections to be invoked,"" he added.
The veteran leader also alleged a conspiracy to stop the yatra.
""The yara will be successful. Rahul Gandhi is not going to be scared,"" he added.

The Assam police suo motu registered the FIR against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and several other leaders for “wanton acts of violence” here during the party's 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' on Tuesday.
''We have filed an FIR. A Special Investigation Team (SIT) will conduct the investigation and he (Gandhi) will be arrested after the Lok Sabha elections'', Sarma said on the sidelines of a programme at Nazira in Sibsagar district.
The Lok Sabha elections are due within a few months in the country.
Director General of Police G P Singh said that the case has been transferred to the Assam CID for a thorough investigation through an SIT to be constituted by the Additional Director General of Police (CID).
Sarma had instructed the DGP to register a case against Gandhi for provoking the crowd to break barricades in an attempt to enter Guwahati city during the Yatra on Tuesday leading to a scuffle with the police in which some senior Congress leaders, including the state party President Bhupen Bora and leader of opposition in the state assembly, and four police personnel were injured.
The FIR was filed against Congress leaders under IPC sections that deal with criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, rioting, assault or criminal force to deter public servants from discharging their duty, damaging public property and others.

Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly V D Satheesan said that reading out only the last paragraph of the policy address amounted to ""contempt"" towards the Assembly.
""It was also a contempt and neglect towards the Constitutional directives and rules of the Assembly. We are indicating our strong protest against the same. It was a pitiful ending to the political drama of the state government and the Governor,"" Satheesan told the media after the conclusion of the policy address.
Deputy LoP P K Kunhalikutty and senior Congress leader Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan too spoke to the media along similar lines.
They both said that what transpired in the House was a mockery of the Assembly and democracy.
In an unprecedented move which also indicated his displeasure with the ruling Left front in the state, Khan quickly concluded the government's customary policy address in the Assembly by only reading out the last of 136 paragraphs.
Khan, who reached the Assembly at around 9 am, concluded the policy address before 9.02 am and left the House by 9.04 am.
Khan and the Left government have been at loggerheads over several issues, primarily about the functioning of universities in the state and his non-signing of certain bills passed by the Assembly.
It also resulted in his facing widespread protests across the state from the CPI(M), its youth wing -- Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) -- and its student outfit -- Students Federation of India (SFI).

The matter will now be heard on January 31. A bench of Justice Bela M. Trivedi and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan adjourned the matter when it came up for hearing around 1pm on the ground that the bench would sit in a different combination post-lunch.
Khalid is seeking bail on grounds of parity with the other co-accused — Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha — who have been released.
Additionally, Khalid has filed a separate petition challenging the constitutional validity of the UAPA.
Senior advocate C.U. Singh, who appeared for Khalid, told the bench on Wednesday: “We are prepared, unfortunately this bench is rising after lunch. It’s a bail application.”
However, Justice Trivedi said the bench would sit in a different combination post-lunch. The court said in a brief order: “List on January 31, high on the board.”
At the last hearing on January 10, Khalid’s bail plea had been adjourned to January 24, which was the sixth such adjournment in a row. On January 10, the bench of Justices Trivedi and Pankaj Mithal had warned that no further adjournment would be granted.
The bench on January 10 had minced no words in expressing displeasure over the repeated adjournments, pointing out that the delay in the hearing was on account of the failure of the respective parties to argue the matter, but an impression was gaining ground that the court was not hearing it.
Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Khalid, had sought adjournment by a week since he was engaged in a seven-judge constitution bench matter dealing with the minority status of Aligarh Muslim University. On Wednesday, Sibal was busy with the same constitution bench matter.
“You please argue the case, we are not going to adjourn the matter. We can’t grant you any exemption,” Justice Trivedi, heading the bench, had told Sibal at the last hearing.
Besides Khalid’s bail plea, the court was on Wednesday scheduled to take up a batch of petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the UAPA, which critics complain is being increasingly used against political opponents and journalists by parties in power.
Khalid’s bail plea had been adjourned during a hearing on November 29, 2023, as well. A bench of Justices Trivedi and Satish Chandra had done so upon a joint request made by counsels appearing on behalf of senior advocate Sibal, representing Khalid, and additional solicitor-general S.V. Raju, representing the Delhi police.
While Raju at that time was stated to be indisposed, Sibal was engaged in other courts when the matter came up for hearing.
Justice Trivedi wanted to hear the matter again on December 6, 2023, but since Sibal was not available on that date, it was adjourned to January 10.
Repeated adjournments are not uncommon."

The dispatch of such balloons, which generally disappear into the Pacific to the east, appears to be on the rise, though their purpose has not been publicly announced.
The Defence Ministry noted the balloon sightings on a list of Chinese People's Liberation Army activity in the waters and airspace around Taiwan. One passed near the southern city of Pingtung, while the others flew just north of the port of Keelung, where Taiwan has an important naval base.
It remains unclear whether the balloons have an explicit military function, but they appear to be part of a campaign of harassment against the the self-governed island, which China claims as its own territory and has vowed to reclaim by force if necessary.
In the US early last year, President Joe Biden vowed sharper rules to track, monitor and potentially shoot down unknown aerial objects after a three-week drama sparked by the discovery of a suspected Chinese spy balloon transiting much of the United States.
The US labelled the balloon a military craft and shot it down with a missile. It recovered what it said was sophisticated surveillance equipment. China responded angrily, saying it was only a weather balloon that had blown off course and called its downing a major overreaction.
Those are sometimes referred to as China's “gray area tactics” that cause consternation among its foes without sparking a direct confrontation. China has long blurred the lines between military and civilian functions, including in the South China Sea, where it operates a huge maritime militia — ostensibly civilian fishing boats that act under government orders to assert Beijing's territorial claims.
China's campaign of intimidation against Taiwan includes the regular deployment of Chinese warships and planes in waters and airspace around the island, often crossing the middle line of the 160-kilometre-wide Taiwan Strait that divides them. The two split following the seizure of power by Mao Zedong's Communists on the Chinese mainland.
Between Sunday and early Monday morning, four Chinese warplanes and four navy ships were detected around Taiwan, the Defence Ministry said. Taiwan's military monitored the situation with combat aircraft, navy vessels and land-based missile systems, the ministry said.
In the leadup to Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections January 13, China had been stepping up such activities, along with its rhetorical threats, though Beijing's threats are generally seen as backfiring.
The independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won a third straight term in the presidency, this time under current Vice President Lai Ching-te, or William Lai. The pro-unification Nationalist Party won just one more seat in the legislature than the DPP.
Both saw some votes siphoned away by the party of former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, who appealed especially to young people fed up with politics as they are."

Radhakrishnan on Thursday said that registering an FIR against senior CRPF officers, a day after the Enforcement Directorate’s questioning of chief minister Hemant Soren, is a government’s “mistake”.
The local administration on January 21 lodged an FIR against senior CRPF officers for “violating” prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC during the ED questioning of Soren in connection with a money laundering case linked to an alleged land scam.
Speaking to the reporters, on the sideline of the celebration of National Voters’ Day here, Radhakrishnan said: “Unnecessarily, a large gathering in front of the CM’s house had been organised. That is why CRPF had to come. This was the government’s mistake. This type of attitude should be stopped.”
The Ranchi district administration had imposed prohibitory orders near Soren’s official residence, where he faced the ED questioning on January 20 from 7am to 11pm, disallowing any demonstration and public meetings.
An FIR was also lodged against JMM workers and “Bhim Army” supporters for violating the orders.
Reacting to the governor’s statement, the ruling JMM termed it “unexpected and unnecessary”. The party said the governor should express his concern in a procedural manner and not on a public platform. “Otherwise, it will be understood that this statement is motivated by political motive, which is strongly condemnable,” the party said in the release issued by JMM general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya.
The ruling JMM on Sunday had alleged that around 500 CRPF personnel tried to enter Soren’s residence without “any permission” when he was being questioned. The JMM had sought an investigation over the deployment of central forces.
The party claimed it was illegal and aimed at provoking Soren’s supporters demonstrating nearby so that they attack the CRPF personnel. PTI"

The births, first reported on Tuesday, came just weeks after three cubs were born to another Namibian cheetah, Aasha.
Yadav said in a post on X, ""Wildlife wonders! As frontline wildlife warriors managed to get closer to Jwala, they found she has given birth to four, not three, cubs. This has increased our joy several times over. Congratulations all. We pray the cubs thrive and prosper at their home in India.""  	According to officials, the cubs were born to Jwala on January 20.
This is Jwala's second litter and comes after a gap of 10 months.
Jwala (Namibian name Siyaya) had given birth to four cubs last March. Three of the cubs succumbed to extreme heat while the sole survivor is being raised under human care for future wilding.
Yadav had on January 3 also shared information about the birth of three cubs to Aasha.
The recent births have taken the number of cubs at the Kuno National Park to eight at present, with seven being born this month.
The total number of cheetahs at the Kuno National Park currently stands at 21 (six males, seven females and eight cubs).
This has been a mixed month for India's cheetah project. While January recorded the birth of seven cubs, it also witnessed the the death of Shaurya -- an adult Namibian cheetah -- on January 16.
Since last March, seven adult cheetahs, including Shaurya, have died due to various reasons.
The seven adult cheetahs -- three females and four males -- that died include Sasha, Uday, Daksha, Tejas, Suraj, Dhatri and Shaurya. While the first six fatalities occurred in a six-month-period between March and August 2023, Shaurya died last week.
Jwala and Aasha are among the cheetahs translocated to India from Namibia under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Project Cheetah, aimed at re-introducing the only large carnivore species that went extinct in independent India.
The first batch of eight cheetahs was introduced in India in September 2022.
The second batch of 12 cheetahs was flown in from South Africa last February.
The much-vaunted cheetah conservation project, however, has drawn sharp criticism over the animals' deaths.
According to officials, one of the biggest challenges faced in the first year of managing the cheetahs in India was the unexpected development of winter coats by some of the animals during the Indian summer and monsoon, in anticipation of the African winter (June to September).
The winter coat, combined with high humidity and temperatures, caused itching, prompting the animals to scratch their necks on tree trunks or the ground. This led to bruising and exposing the skin, where flies laid eggs, resulting in maggot infestations and, ultimately, bacterial infections and septicemia, leading to the deaths of three cheetahs, an official explained.
""The mortalities under Project Cheetah so far have been within the expected limits. As per Cheetah Action Plan, we anticipated approximately 50 per cent mortality. Right now, 14 imported cheetahs are surviving, besides one cub born on Indian soil,"" SP Yadav, additional director general of forests in the Union Environment Ministry, said earlier.
He had said the project's focus in its second year would be on breeding these animals.
Yadav, also the chief of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, had said the next batch of cheetahs would be imported from South Africa and introduced into Madhya Pradesh's Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.

VRCFLTHBAE_97TUO6I5NE606P5,"In strife-torn Manipur, Meitei ‘oath’ in Kuki-Zo crosshairs","Umanand Jaiswal Guwahati Published 26.01.24, 05:22 AM","Umanand Jaiswal Guwahati Published 26.01.24, 05:22 AM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/north-east/in-strife-torn-manipur-meitei-oath-in-kuki-zo-crosshairs/cid/1996199,"Kuki-Zo organisations have expressed concern over Imphal valley-based MLAs and MPs taking an oath to protect the integrity of strife-torn Manipur at a meeting convened by the Arambai Tenggol, a Meitei socio-cultural organisation.
Kuki-Zo organisations have long accused the Arambai Tenggol of carrying out attacks on their community during the ethnic strife that began in the state on May 3 and is still continuing.
The Kuki Inpi Manipur, the apex body of Kuki tribes, referred to the oath-taking ceremony, held inside the Kangla Fort in Imphal, to condemn the ""demise and subsequent burial of democracy in the heart of Imphal city"".
The organisation found it ""alarming"" that the state government had “openly” accorded “state patronage to non-state actors, namely the Arambai Tenggol”. It alleged that “all Meitei-elected representatives (had) succumbed” to the diktat of the outfit.
The Kuki Inpi reiterated that having separate administrations for the largely valley-based Meiteis and mostly hill-based Kuki-Zo was the only means “for our survival, as we can no longer coexist with a community that... (is) hell-bent on wiping out the Kuki-Zo people”.
Police said the Arambai Tenggol had “summoned” the MLAs and MPs to the meeting, held at 10am on Wednesday. It was called to discuss the worsening of law and order over the past month, during which 26 Meiteis were allegedly “killed by Kuki-Zo militants”, and to take steps to protect the state’s integrity.
Other Kuki-Zo groups expressed sentiments similar to the Kuki Inpi’s.
On Wednesday, the Churachandpur-based Kuki-Zo organisation, the Indigenous Tribal Leaders’ Forum (ITLF), had castigated the Kangla meeting. It posted on X that “never before we have seen” MLAs and ministers “cower before a radicalised insurgent group in the heart of Imphal”.
An ITLF statement said the oath-taking took place “right under the watchful eyes” of the Union home ministry officials who had arrived a few days earlier and met the “insurgent group”.
The Committee on Tribal Unity, another leading Kuki-Zo organisation, on Wednesday questioned the “rationality” of the three-member home ministry team meeting “the majoritarian Meitei community”, including the Arambai Tenggol, on Tuesday.
It said the “restoration of normalcy” could be achieved only if the Centre “first ban(s) the Arambai Tenggols” and other “illegal” armed outfits, imposes the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act on the 19 valley police stations currently exempted from its ambit, and ultimately “recognise the physical and geographical separation between the Kuki-Zo and the Meiteis”.
The Kangla meeting is being seen as a response to the demand from Kuki-Zo organisations and the state’s 10 Kuki-Zo MLAs for a separate administration for the community, or a separation from Manipur.
The Kuki-Zo contend there is already an unofficial separation of populations: the Kuki-Zo cannot travel to the valley, nor can Meiteis to the hill districts.
The valley is home to 40 MLAs while the hill districts, where the Kuki-Zo and the Nagas are the leading tribes, have 20 MLAs.
Reports suggested that 36 Meitei MLAs and two MPs took a collective oath “administered” by the Arambai Tenggol to safeguard the integrity of the state.
Later, the Arambai Tenggol chief told a public meeting that the Meitei MLAs and MPs had endorsed the organisation’s six demands.
These include the scrapping of the Suspension of Operations pact between Kuki-Zo militants and the Centre, implementation of the National Register of Citizens with 1951 as the cut-off year, removing the Assam Rifles from Manipur, fencing the Myanmar border to check influx, and delisting illegal Kuki immigrants from the Scheduled Tribe list.
The Arambai Tenggol said the lawmakers had promised they would take steps on these demands within 15 days or else would join the people’s movement in support of these demands.
While Kuki-Zo organisations have spoken against the Kangla development, the non-government Meitei Alliance said in a statement on Thursday that it “endorsed” the Kangla resolutions signed by the MLAs and MPs who attended the meeting.
It lauded the choice of the Kangla Fort as venue, saying it was the centre of power of indigenous governance, which had ceased since the British invasion of 1891. The princely Manipur state merged with the Indian Union on September 21, 1949.
“Second, the joint congregation of the elected representatives across parties and Arambai Tenggol leaders, and the support shown by various other organisations is an unprecedented event marked by placing patriotism, nationalism, and collective will above all other loyalties,” it said.
“Third, the contents of the resolutions exemplify a higher level of political maturity and commitment to address the common grievances of the indigenous people of Manipur. Meitei Alliance strongly feels that the above demands are timely, lawful, and democratic.”
The ongoing strife has left at least 204 people dead and displaced over 67,000."

The agreement was signed during French President Emmanuel Macron's ongoing state visit to India, he said.
Tata and Airbus are already cooperating to make the C-295 transport aircraft in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat.
""Industrial partnership (signed) between Tata and Airbus helicopters for production of H125 helicopters with a significant indigenous and localisation component,"" Kwatra said at a media briefing on Friday.
Tata and Airbus did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Further cooperation in the defence sector was also discussed during Macron's state visit, officials said, including the possibility of French engine maker Safran assisting in manufacture of fighter jet engines in India.
France is already India's second largest arms supplier and the South Asian nation has relied on its fighter jets for four decades now.
""Safran is fully willing to do it with a 100% transfer of technology in design, development, certification, production and so on,"" India Ambassador to France Jawed Ashraf said, adding that discussions will continue on the matter.
France, both prior to and during Macron's visit, also raised the issue of New Delhi-based French journalist Vanessa Dougnac being served a notice by the Indian government regarding possible cancellation of her visa, Kwatra said.
The government termed her work ""malicious"" and said it may ""provoke disorder and disturb peace"", according to local media reports. Dougnac denied all the allegations in a statement released on Wednesday."

Ram Path -- the main thoroughfare -- was choked as devotees flooded the streets of the temple town, which has been gripped by religious fervour over the inauguration of the grand mandir.
The entry of devotees to the temple complex began at 6 am and about 2.5 lakh people are likely to have visited the temple by 2 pm, Ayodhya Divisional Commissioner Gaurav Dayal told PTI.
It is estimated that about five lakh devotees will have visited by the end of the day, another official said.
Waiting in serpentine queues outside the temple were people who had been camping in Ayodhya since before the consecration ceremony, having made long and difficult journeys to reach the temple town.
An idol of the new Ram Lalla was consecrated at the Ayodhya temple on Monday, a landmark event led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
On Tuesday, 'Ram dhun' played in the streets as security personnel kept guard and sought to control the crowd even as many chanted ""Jai Shri Ram"" and attempted to enter through the gateway.
For a couple hours in the afternoon, the crowd became so huge that the security personnel scrambled to maintain order.
The entire section of the Ram Path facing the gateway was blocked as many devotees, some of whom landed with suitcases and backpacks, wanted to have a 'darshan'.
At the main gateway, the commotion in the crowd led to one devotee fainting and having to be taken for medical treatment.
There was a ""sudden massive rush"" in the morning and the people were continuously streaming in, seeking to visit the temple and have a darshan of Ram Lalla, Dayal said.
The administration is taking measures to keep the crowd in order, ""with proper holding (area), queuing and proper barricading"", he added.
Uttar Pradesh information director Shishir said more than 8,000 policemen are deployed at the temple and ""everything is under control"".
Director General, Law Order, Prashant Kumar and Principal Secretary, Home, Sanjay Prasad are inside the temple and overseeing the arrangements.
Ayodhya police, in a post on X, also refuted rumours that the temple was temporarily closed due to the heavy rush.
Suresh Kumar and his friend from Chhattisgarh stood in the milling crowd, eager to have a 'darshan' but had little hope of getting in as they both carried suitcases.
""We have come from Durg. We took a train to Kanpur and then a bus to Lucknow and another bus to Ayodhya and reached Ayodhya at 10.30 am,"" he told PTI.
The pair said they made a ""sudden plan"" to visit Ayodhya.
""We have come just for the 'darshan'. We will go back today,"" he said.
Security guards later made a semi-circular human fence to manage the crowd as other personnel made announcements on loudspeakers to keep order.
A large number of devotees had gathered outside the main gates for hours since late Monday night, waiting to enter the premises.
Carrying flags bearing the visages of Lord Ram and chanting ""Jai Shri Ram"", the devotees waited for hours in the biting cold before the doors of the grand temple opened early in the morning.
""Felt so delighted, my life's aim has been fulfilled. Our ancestors struggled for this and it has been brought to fruition,"" said Manish Verma, a devotee from Punjab.
Nitish Kumar, a resident of Bihar's Madhepura district, cycled more than 600 kilometres to reach Ayodhya.
""There is a massive rush but I am hopeful I will get a chance to have 'darshan' today. I will start my journey back once my wish is fulfilled. Though I couldn't go to the temple on Monday, what a day it was to be in Ayodhya,"" he told PTI.
Anurag Sharma from Rajasthan's Sikar was seen walking around with a model of the temple on the day of the consecration ceremony.
""I brought this model with me from my hometown. I arrived on the inaugural flight to Ayodhya and I have been here since then. I will go back only after having a 'darshan' of Ram Lalla,"" he told PTI.
Groups of people could also be seen marching towards the temple, passing through the decked-up Ram Path.
""Ram Lalla gave us the strength to walk all the way from Chhattisgarh and now He only will get us through this crowd so we can take His blessings,"" said Sunil Madho, part of an eight-member group that undertook a 'padyatra' to Ayodhya.
Maharashtra native Gopal Krishna, who arrived in Ayodhya a few days ago, also jostled in the thick crowd as it moved towards the security check.
""We came here a few days ago as Lord Ram called us. People were telling us to not travel as police would impose restrictions on travel and rooms would not be available in hotels. We are staying at an ashram and this is the day we waited for,"" he told PTI.
The devotees chanted ""Jai Shri Ram"" as they walked in and out of the temple complex. Inside the main temple, ""Jai Shri Ram"" chants reverberated in its grand halls.
The temple complex, built in the traditional Nagara style, is 380 feet long from the east to the west, 250 feet wide and will eventually rise to 161 feet at the 'shikhar'.
Lakhs of people watched the 'pran pratishtha (consecration)' ceremony on television in their homes and neighbourhood temples, savouring the historic moment on Monday.
""January 22, 2024, is not merely a date in the calendar but heralds the advent of a new era,"" Modi said after he performed a series of rituals in the 'garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum)'.
The prime minister also prostrated himself before the 51-inch idol that depicts the child Ram.
""Today, our Ram has arrived. After a long wait for ages, our Ram has arrived. Our Ram Lalla will no longer live in a tent. Our Ram Lalla will stay in a magnificent temple,"" Modi said in his address to the invitees.

VVC4ZA21BX_P8FCACV37KEJKTC,Mamata Banerjee injured as her car stops to avert collision,"Snehamoy Chakraborty, Kinsuk Basu Calcutta Published 25.01.24, 06:10 AM","Snehamoy Chakraborty, Kinsuk Basu Calcutta Published 25.01.24, 06:10 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/bengal-chief-minister-mamata-banerjee-injured-as-her-car-stops-to-avert-collision/cid/1995989,"Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday afternoon suffered a “minor” forehead injury as the driver of her car applied emergency brakes to avoid a collision with another vehicle that suddenly came in front of her convoy in Burdwan town.
Mamata had gone to Burdwan for the state government’s benefit distribution programme. The accident took place when her convoy approached GT Road in Burdwan on her way back to Calcutta.
Although the chief minister went to Burdwan by chopper, she had to return to Calcutta by road because of bad weather.
“I could have died today (Wednesday) if the driver of my car did not apply the brakes immediately. While I was approaching the main (GT) road from a lane, a car driven at high speed came in front of my car. As my driver applied the brakes, my head hit the dashboard. I survived because of the blessings of people,” Mamata said in front of Raj Bhavan, four hours after meeting with the accident.
“There was minor bleeding and the portion of my head (that hit the dashboard) is swollen. However, I worked despite the injury,” Mamata, a Z-plus category protectee, told reporters.
The left side of her forehead was covered with medicinal tape.
A senior police officer said the accident was deemed a breach of security by the chief minister and the East Burdwan district police chief asked to start a probe.
However, the police haven’t traced the car that appeared in front of the convoy around 2pm.
“The road from the venue in Burdwan to GT Road takes an upward climb. As the chief minister’s car was taking the ascent, a car from the opposite direction came. The (chief minister’s) driver slammed the brakes and the VIP suffered an injury,” said a senior officer of East Burdwan district police. “We have started a probe to find out how exactly this security breach occurred.”
A police source said the vehicle that came across the chief minister’s convoy could be of police or district officials.
“We will interrogate all police personnel on duty,” another officer added.
Usually, the road a Z-plus security protectee takes to attend an event is sanitised hours ahead of the arrival, senior officers said. The deployment of forces remains intact along the route till the protectee leaves the venue. Members of the Special Security Unit (SSU) covering the chief minister ensure that the protocols listed in the blue book for Z-plus protectee are fully followed.
“Apart from her car’s driver, we will speak to the senior officer in charge of manning the VIP’s line of route,” the officer said. “A preliminary report has been made for Peeyush Pandey, director of security.”"

Acharya had used derogatory language against Kumar, also the ruling JD(U) president, in several posts on X, which were deleted later, Bihar BJP leader Nikhil Anand claimed.
Sharing a screenshot of the purported deleted posts, Anand said, ""These are like an arrow released from the bow.” 	The BJP leader said if Acharya regrets having used words like ‘badtameez’ (ill-mannered) against the chief minister in the post, she should publicly express regret and apologise.
A section of the media claimed that Acharya had reacted to Kumar's statement against dynastic politics at a JD(U) rally commemorating former state chief minister and socialist icon Karpoori Thakur's birth anniversary on Wednesday. Thakur was conferred with the Bharat Ratna posthumously earlier this week.
While addressing the rally here, Kumar criticised dynastic politics, stating that JD(U) followed the path shown by the late leader by not promoting anyone from the family in the party ranks.
A section of the media claimed that his statement was indirectly aimed at the RJD, an ally of the JD(U) in Bihar's Mahagathbandhan government in which sons of Prasad are ministers.
Prasad’s younger son and heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav is the Deputy chief minister of the Bihar government, while his elder son Tej Pratap Yadav is a minister in the state cabinet. The RJD president’s eldest daughter Misa Bharti is a Rajya Sabha member.
Responding to Kumar's comments on dynastic politics, Acharya attacked the chief minister in posts on X but she deleted them later, according to BJP leader Anand.

W8QOTU9YSH_M2AS1Z6Q7ZZKR7Q,Angry Mamata says Trinamul will go it alone in Bengal in the coming Lok Sabha polls,"Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 12:59 PM","Arnab Ganguly Calcutta Published 24.01.24, 12:59 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/angry-mamata-banerjee-says-trinamul-will-go-it-alone-in-bengal-in-the-coming-lok-sabha-polls/cid/1995872,"Accusing the Congress of keeping her and her party in the dark about the schedule of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Bengal on Wednesday, an irate Mamata Banerjee said she would go it alone in Bengal in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.
“I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we will alone defeat BJP,” Mamata said before leaving for Burdwan.
Mamata’s comments come a day before Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra is scheduled to reach Bengal’s Cooch Behar.
On Tuesday, while in Assam Rahul had said that talks were on with the Trinamul (on seat-sharing) and he shared a good rapport with Mamata. “We have good ties with Mamata and her party, talks for seat-sharing are on,” Rahul said during an interaction with mediapersons Tuesday. “Sometimes our leaders say something, sometimes their leaders say things. None of it will have any impact on the alliance,”he added.
But on Wednesday morning, Mamata issued a firm denial.
“Nobody has spoken with me. My proposal was rejected on the very first day,” Mamata said while replying to a query. “Nobody has discussed anything with me. This is an absolute lie. Ei je amader rajye aaschhe amake ek baar o boleni (That he is coming to our state, I was not informed).”
“I had told them they can contest in 300 seats across the country and leave the remaining to regional parties. But they would not listen. Congress has no stake in Bengal. We will decide what to do after the elections are over,” Mamata said.
The chief minister’s comments appear to have sealed the fate of the possibility of an electoral adjustment in Bengal between the two parties. It is not clear whether the Congress high command will make any further attempts to cajole the Trinamul chief or go with the party's Bengal unit proposal to go to polls alone or in alliance with the Left.
Rahul will be entering Bengal through Boxirhat in Cooch Behar on Thursday as a part of his yatra on Thursday. After a two-day break on January 26 and 27, he will pass through the North Bengal districts on Sunday and Monday and then proceed to Bihar.
On February 1, in the second leg of the Yatra in Bengal, Rahul will be in Murshidabad, the only Congress bastion in Bengal, from where state Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury is an MP.
There is indeed some truth in Mamata’s claim that she was kept in the dark about the yatra. From Delhi, Congress leaders had issued an open invite to all constituents of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) to join the yatra as it passes through  different states.
On Tuesday, the Trinamul’s Assam state unit members were seen in Rahul’s yatra bearing the party flags. Trinamul leaders in Calcutta claimed it was not a party decision, though the Assam unit stuck to it.
According to insiders in both the Trinamul and the Congress, no call was actually made to Mamata about the yatra, though individual leaders in Delhi may have been informed.“Some of our MPs in Delhi were told but no one said a word to Mamata di. She is the undisputed leader in Bengal,” said a Trinamul leader.
On the other hand, the CPM state secretary Mohammad Salim was invited to join the yatra.
After her peace march on Monday, Mamata had aired grievances on not being given due respect in the alliance.  “I suggested the name INDIA, but when I attend its meetings I see the CPM trying to call the shots. I am not given the respect I deserve. I will not take orders from those against whom I fought all my life,” Mamata had said at Calcutta’s Park Circus maidan.
Mamata’s comments raised a loud cheer in the saffron camp. BJP Bengal co-minder and the party’s IT cell head Amit Malviya said Mamata’s decision to go alone was a sign of desperation. “Unable to hold her political ground, she wants to fight all seats in the hope that she can still be relevant, after the polls. Much against her desire, to emerge as the face of the Opposition alliance, no one ever proposed her name. Her several trips to Delhi, to build a national profile, didn’t work,” Malviya wrote on X.
Malviya said, “She just couldn’t hide the blood of post poll violence and rid herself of the nauseating stink of appeasement politics. An embarrassed Mamata, to save face, pitched for Mallikarjun Kharge, ruling herself out in the process. She realised, despite her bluster, she had no currency in the Opposition camp and had been building ground to snap out for long.”
Following Mamata’s decision the CPM is most likely to join the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Bengal. Earlier, it had expressed reservations on being seen together with the Trinamul, though both Mamata and CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury have attended several meetings of the alliance, including a public meeting in Patna last year."

Gandhi’s Manipur-Mumbai Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra crossed over from Assam to Bengal at Baxirhat in Cooch Behar on Thursday morning where the leader was welcomed by Pradesh Congress chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. “I feel overjoyed to come to Bengal and I am here to listen to what you have to say, to stand with you in your troubles. I thank my leaders and workers in Bengal to have showered such love in welcoming me,” Gandhi said, ahead of a brief tour of the district in his bus.
Gandhi will take a two-day break from his Yatra on account of the Republic day celebrations, and is scheduled to resume his travels from the same venue on January 28 covering some 637 kilometers across eight districts and 10 Lok Sabha constituencies of Bengal.
“We have added the word ‘Nyay’ (Justice) to this Yatra since there is ‘Anyay’ (Injustice) taking place in this country,” the leader said and maintained: “The BJP and RSS are spewing hate, violence and injustice. That’s why the INDIA coalition is going to fight against injustice together.”
Gandhi’s statement assumes significance in the wake of Mamata Banerjee declaring that she would consider her role in the alliance only post Lok Sabha elections and that she would not want the Congress to interfere in the regional party strongholds like Bengal.
It was also interesting to witness Gandhi making that confidence-in-Opposition-unity statement while being flanked by Chowdhury who has consistently opposed electoral ties with the Trinamul and whose sharp criticisms of the Trinamul supremo in the wake of unity messages from the party high-command has been seen as the deal breaker for the Trinamul leadership.
Gandhi’s convoy, however, met with protestors at the Jorai More near the Assam-Bengal who stood by the roads holding placards which read “Didi is enough for Bengal '' and rhymed slogans against Adhir Chowdhury. Though the protestors carried no flags or any visible identification marks of a political party, they made little attempts to hide that they were local Trinamul workers.
“We have no opposition to Rahul Gandhi’s Nyay Yatra. In fact, we believe that this Yatra is necessary to strengthen the Opposition INDIA bloc across the country. But we also think that Adhir Chowdhury’s comments against the Bengal chief minister are detrimental to the cause of unity,” said Indrajit Pal, a Trinamul Congress worker leading the protesters.
“We are trying to give a message to Adhir babu that he should mend his attitude towards our leader and accept an alliance in Bengal under Mamata Banerjee’s leadership,” Pal said.
Congress general secretary in charge of communications Jairam Ramesh, on the other hand, countered Banerjee’s allegation that the Congress failed in its courtesy to even inform her about the Yatra passing through Bengal despite Trinamul being an integral part of the INDIA bloc. “Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge had both written to her and e-mailed her informing her of Rahulji’s schedule in Bengal,” Ramesh said.
“She had been invited. Our leaders - Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi - all of them want leaders from TMC to come and participate in Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. We especially want CM Banerjee to come, even if it means managing to take 10-15 minutes out of her busy schedule. Her joining the Yatra will enhance its pride and impact,” Ramesh insisted.
“Mamata Banerjee is one of the most important pillars of the INDIA coalition. She is one of the tallest and most experienced leaders of this country. The Congress and its top leadership respects Mamata Banerjee and we all know that he holds a special place and recognition in the political landscape of this country,” the Congress spokesperson said and added: “We will find a solution to this impasse.”"

WFOVV85BLY_2WWER2ZML98WUMM,90 per cent ready: Wildlife experts from South Africa to review preparations for Cheetah's second home in India in February,"PTI New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 04:28 PM","PTI New Delhi Published 25.01.24, 04:28 PM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/90-per-cent-ready-wildlife-experts-from-south-africa-to-review-preparations-for-cheetahs-second-home-in-india-gandhi-sagar-wildlife-sanctuary/cid/1996144,"A South African delegation, including wildlife experts, will arrive in February to assess the conditions at Madhya Pradesh's Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary which is slated to become the second home of cheetahs in India, officials said on Thursday.
They also said the two female Namibian cheetahs who recently gave birth to a total of seven cubs will be released in the wild only when the weather conditions improve.      	 An official said that a South African delegation will visit India in February for an assessment of the preparations at the Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.
""Thereafter, a call on bringing the next batch of cheetahs will be taken,"" the official said.           	 SP Yadav, Additional Director General of Forests at the Environment Ministry, had earlier told PTI that the next batch of cheetahs will be imported from South Africa and introduced into the Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.
Another official told the news agency that 90 per cent of the work to prepare the wildlife sanctuary for cheetahs has been completed.
Gandhi Sagar is about a six-hour drive from Kuno. It is spread across 368 square kilometres and has an additional 2,500 sq km area surrounding it.
The official quoted above also said the mother cheetahs and their cubs will not be released into the wild until weather conditions in the Kuno National Park improve.
Officials reported on Tuesday that Namibian cheetah Jwala gave birth to four cubs on January 20. In early January, another Namibian cheetah, Asha, gave birth to three cubs.
This is Jwala's second litter and comes after a gap of 10 months.
The officials said that compared to other female cheetahs, Jwala is a wilder animal. She avoids humans and remains alert even when resting, a typical cheetah behaviour of remaining careful of bigger and stronger predators all the time.
Jwala (Namibian name Siyaya) had given birth to four cubs last March. Three of the cubs succumbed to extreme heat while the sole survivor is being raised under human care for future wilding.
The official said the mother cheetahs and their cubs are being kept in larger enclosures to avoid extreme weather and for better monitoring, which is difficult in the wild.
""We will release them in the wild as soon as weather conditions improve,"" the official said.
The recent births have taken the number of cubs at the Kuno National Park to eight at present, with seven being born this month.
The total number of cheetahs at the Kuno National Park currently stands at 21 (six males, seven females and eight cubs).
While January recorded the birth of seven cubs, it also witnessed the death of Shaurya -- an adult Namibian cheetah -- on January 16.
Officials said they do not know the reason for Shaurya's death as they have not yet received his post-mortem report.
Since last March, seven adult cheetahs, including Shaurya, have died due to various reasons.
The seven adult cheetahs -- three females and four males -- that died include Sasha, Uday, Daksha, Tejas, Suraj, Dhatri and Shaurya. The first six fatalities occurred in a six-month period between March and August 2023.
Jwala and Aasha are among the cheetahs translocated to India from Namibia under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Project Cheetah, aimed at re-introducing the only large carnivore species that went extinct in independent India.
The first batch of eight cheetahs was introduced in India in September 2022. The second batch of 12 cheetahs was flown in from South Africa last February.
The much-vaunted cheetah conservation project, however, has drawn sharp criticism over the animals' deaths.
According to officials, one of the biggest challenges faced in the first year of managing the cheetahs in India was the unexpected development of winter coats by some of the animals during the Indian summer and monsoon, in anticipation of the African winter (June to September).
The winter coat, combined with high humidity and temperatures, caused itching, prompting the animals to scratch their necks on tree trunks or the ground. This led to bruising and exposing the skin, where flies laid eggs, resulting in maggot infestations and, ultimately, bacterial infections and septicemia, leading to the deaths of three cheetahs, an official explained.
India plans to import cheetahs that do not develop thicker winter coats, Yadav said earlier.
For the cheetahs already in Kuno, he said the plan is to administer prophylactic medicine before the arrival of monsoon to prevent infection.      	 The project's focus in its second year would be on breeding these animals, he added.

""Upon returning from Ayodhya Dham after witnessing the most unforgettable moments of my life, I am writing this letter to you. I have returned with an Ayodhya in my heart, an Ayodhya which can never be separated from me,"" Modi said. 	  	He was responding to Murmu's letter to him a day before the January 22 consecration ceremony of the new idol of Ram Lalla at the temple.
In her letter to the prime minister, Murmu had said the nationwide celebratory atmosphere around the inauguration of the grand Ram temple was an uninhibited expression of India's eternal soul and the start of a new cycle in the country's resurgence.
Noting that he received Murmu's letter a day before leaving for Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, Modi said he is very grateful for her good wishes and affection. ""Every word of your letter expressed your compassionate nature and your immense happiness at organisation of the consecration ceremony,"" he said.
Modi said when he received Murmu's letter, he was in a different state of mind and her letter gave him immense support and strength in handling these feelings and in coming to terms with them.
""I visited ayodhya Dham as a pilgrim. My mind was overwhelmed with many emotions after going to the holy land where such a confluence of faith and history has taken place,"" he said.
""To witness such a historic occasion is both a privilege and a responsibility. You had also discussed about my 11-day religious exercise and the 'Yama-Niyams' related to it. Our country has been the witness to countless people who kept many vows for centuries so that Ram Lalla once again resides at his birthplace,"" Modi said.
""Being the medium of the fulfilment of these centuries-long resolves was a very emotional moment for me and I consider it my good fortune,"" the prime minister said.
Along with 140 crore people, seeing Ram Lalla and welcoming him was amazing, Modi said.
""That moment was possible only with the blessings of Lord Shri Ram and the people of India, and I will always be grateful for it,"" he said.
""As you said, we not only worship Lord Shri Ram but also take inspiration from him in every aspect of life, especially in the social sphere,"" Modi said.
The prime minister noted that President Murmu in her letter had discussed the impact of the scheme PM-JANMAN and the empowerment of extremely backward people in the tribal society.
""Being associated with the tribal society, who can understand this better than you? Our culture has always taught us to work for the most deprived sections of the society. Many campaigns like PM-JANMAN are bringing a big change in the lives of the people of the country today,"" Modi said.
The ideals of Lord Ram ""give us constant energy for the welfare works and empowerment campaigns for the poor"", he said.
""It is Lord Shri Ram who has given the inspiration for 'sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishvas aur sabka prayas' in every chapter of his life,"" the prime minister said.
The results of this mantra are visible everywhere today, and in the last decade, the country has succeeded in bringing about 25 crore people out of poverty, he said.
The eternal thoughts of Lord Ram are the basis of India's glorious future, Modi said.
""The power of these ideals will pave the way for all the people of the country to create a developed India by the year 2047,"" Prime Minister Modi said.
He said the grand temple of Lord Ram will ""continue to inspire us to create new paradigms of development and success"".
President Murmu on Sunday had complimented Prime Minister Modi ahead of the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony.
In a two-page letter to him, the president had said that ""as you prepare yourself to go for 'Pran Pratishtha' of Prabhu Shri Ram's 'murti' (idol) at the new temple built at his birthplace in Ayodhya, I can only contemplate the unique civilisational journey that will be accomplished with each step taken by you in the hallowed precincts"".
Referring to the 11-day rigorous 'anushthan' that the prime minister has undertaken, Murmu said it is not only a sacred ritual but also a supreme spiritual act of sacrifice and submission to Lord Ram.
Sending heartfelt wishes, the president said that the nationwide celebratory atmosphere around the inauguration of the grand temple of Prabhu Shri Ram in Ayodhya Dham is an uninhibited expression of the eternal soul of India. ""We all are fortunate to witness the commencement of a new cycle in the resurgence of our nation,"" she had said.

According to Alexei Kulemzin, the city’s Russian-installed mayor, Ukrainian forces bombarded a busy area where shops and a market are located. Pushilin said the city was shelled by Ukrainian artillery. There was no immediate Ukrainian comment.
Reuters photos and video taken at the scene showed crying people, some of whom said they had lost their relatives, and bodies lying on blood-soaked snow near one of the city’s markets.
Pushilin said emergency services were working at the scene and that forensic specialists were trying to collect fragments of the weapons used in the attack.
In Moscow, the Russian foreign ministry issued a statement calling the attack “a barbaric act of terrorism” committed by Ukraine, saying it was carried out “with the use of weapons supplied by the West”.
“The Russian side categorically condemns this treacherous strike against the civilian population,” the ministry said.
Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago, has voiced outrage in the past when Ukrainian attacks have killed civilians in Donetsk and other areas.
Russia’s own campaign of air strikes and heavy shelling, however, has killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians.
Donetsk is one of four regions in Ukraine’s east and south that Russia claimed to have annexed in late 2022 in a move condemned as illegal by most countries at the UN General Assembly. Russia does not fully control any of the four regions.
Separately on Sunday, Russia’s defence ministry said Russian forces had taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region.
A Ukrainian military spokesman confirmed that Kyiv’s forces had withdrawn from the area, but said the lost territory was of no consequence for the overall military situation."

The company has sold 54,000 EVs till the third quarter of the fiscal, with sales shooting up from 1,900 units in the first year to 19,000 in the second to over 50,000 units in the third year.
The company on Sunday said it will increase prices of its entire passenger vehicle range, including EVs, by an average of 0.7 per cent with effect from next month.This increase will be effective February 1, 2024, and is being taken to partially offset the rise in input cost, Tata Motors said in a statement.
The company sells a range of passenger vehicles including Punch, Nexon and Harrier.
“EV adoption is taking off in the small towns which already have the experience of the electric two-wheeler. The inherent benefits such as no dearth of parking space and adoption of solar power make EV adoption in smaller cities a breeze,” said Vivek Srivatsa, chief commercial officer of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility (TPEM) Limited.
He said buyers in smaller towns are charging their vehicles through the solar grid.
The Punch EV will accelerate adoption because it is suitable for rural roads. The two battery options, with 315km and 421km range, will boost adoption, Srivatsa said.
The company is introducing a separate sales channel for its EVs, with two running in Gurgaon.
“We will roll out our EV dealerships in the rest of the country soon. The behaviour of EV buyers is different from ICE (internal combustion engine) buyers. The approach of EV buyers is like buying a tech gadget. They are very community-oriented, they want to hang out with each other and share feedback with us and among themselves. There is no cross-shopping of EV and ICE vehicles. That is why we decided to have exclusive EV outlets,” said Srivatsa.
Asked about the pace of adoption and the range anxiety, Srivatsa said: “Battery sizes will increase and a range over 400km is a reality. Larger battery sizes and different options for battery sizes will help in enhancing adoption.”"

A thick blanket of snow normally covers the mountainous passes connecting the Valley with PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir), acting as a natural barrier against infiltration during the initial winter months.
But winter so far has gone snowless in Kashmir this year, although the Srinagar meteorological centre has forecast the possibility of a wet spell from January 25 to February 1 — breaking nearly two months of dry spell.
The army on Wednesday said senior officers, led by Valley army chief Rajiv Ghai, visited the forward areas in the Gurez sector of Bandipora district on January 23 to review the counter-infiltration grid and operational preparedness.
The visit has come three days ahead of Republic Day. Security has been beefed up across Jammu and Kashmir to ensure incident-free celebrations. The security forces are also not taking any chances in letting Pakistan resort to any early infiltration attempts on the borders.
The army officers’ visit came on the same day director-general of police R.R. Swain said the security situation was under control in Jammu and Kashmir, but infiltration remained a challenge.
Officials said Lt Gen. Ghai exhorted soldiers to remain “in a high state of operational readiness” despite the bone-chilling night temperatures.
“Naturally, there are concerns that there could be early infiltration attempts this year due to the near absence of snow. Security has been beefed up across the LoC,” a police officer in Kupwara said.
Adding to the woes of security forces this year have been multiple forest fires in the border areas of Jammu’s Rajouri and Poonch districts — attributed again to the dry spell — prompting an increased vigil to prevent sabotage by the other side.
The army last week said a major fire broke out in the Dera ki Gali area of Poonch. The local army unit helped forest officials douse the flames.
Several landmines also blew up in another forest fire in the Mendhar and Balakote areas of Poonch.
“Despite the overall stability, the persistent challenge is posed by a handful of terrorists infiltrating from Pakistan, attempting to disrupt the hard-earned peace in the region,” Swain said.
“Our youths are not involved with them. While a few individuals may support these terrorists, the majority stand against them, indicating that the situation is under control.”
Swain said a person “sitting outside” who was not from “Jammu and Kashmir” was infiltrating or digging up tunnels to fight the security forces. “It is a challenge. Though their numbers are now less, this is a challenge,” he said."

“The consecration of Shri Ram Mandir has catalysed a flourishing trade network across the country, generating an estimated business of Rs 1.25 lakh crore. Delhi witnessed trade worth approximately Rs 25,000 crore. This economic surge is attributed to the extensive programmes organised by the trading community nationwide,” CAIT said a statement.
CAIT secretary-general Praveen Khandelwal said “this unprecedented financial inflow is the result of faith-driven economy, involving small businesses and entrepreneurs”.
Khandelwal said this is a unique opportunity and called upon entrepreneurs and start-ups to explore novel dimensions in business.
He said the CAIT is planning to conduct a seminar in New Delhi soon to delve into the potential entrepreneurial avenues emerging from this trend.
Under the “Har Shahar Ayodhya-Har Ghar Ayodhya” campaign of the CAIT, more than 30,000 trade bodies organised over 1.5 lakh programmes across the country from January 1 to January 22.
The traders conducted shobha yatras, Ram pheris and devotional musical programmes.
Sale of merchandise, including Ram Mandir models, garlands, door decoration items, flags, caps, bangles, bindi, paintings, pictures of Shri Ram Darbar, pictures of the Ram Mandir reached unprecedented levels.
Sweets and dry fruits used as offerings, clay lamps, brass lamps and fire crackers were popular items during the sale. The trend of gifting Ram Mandir models to guests at weddings has already begun."

Paswan, who had come to the Bihar capital on Thursday evening, spoke to journalists at the airport, saying he has “cancelled” engagements in the state to hold deliberations over the “crucial next few days” in Delhi.
“I have been in constant touch with the top BJP leadership. I spoke to them before coming here last evening when I held a meeting of party workers. I am going back to Delhi. I have cancelled my trip to late Karpoori Thakur’s village in Samastipur and to Sitamarhi, which I had been wanting to visit after having paid obeisance at Ayodhya”, he said.
Paswan, who now heads Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), said his party is a ""committed NDA ally in Bihar"".
""Therefore, we are keeping a watch on the situation in the state where the next two or three days may be crucial. The BJP, which is the largest constituent of the alliance, is keeping me in the loop. We will be holding more talks in Delhi,"" he said.
The young Jamui MP, who is known to have no love lost for Nitish Kumar and whose rebellion during the 2020 assembly polls has been blamed by the ruling JD(U) for its debacle, was also asked whether he would now be comfortable with the Bihar chief minister as an alliance partner.
“These are hypothetical questions which I would not like to answer. There can be no end to such speculations”, said Paswan.
He also scoffed at reports in a section of the media speculating that if Kumar made a return to the NDA, Paswan could switch sides and seek an alliance with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, the current Deputy CM.
""These are baseless reports which erode the credibility of the fourth estate,"" fumed Paswan.
Paswan’s comments came amidst a strong buzz that Kumar, a key figure in the opposition bloc INDIA, was now done with the anti-BJP coalition and exploring possibilities with his old ally which he had dumped less than two years ago.
However, neither Kumar’s JD(U) nor the BJP has dropped a clear hint in this direction.
JD(U)’s political advisor and spokesperson K C Tyagi has been asserting that his party saw itself as “the architect of INDIA” and wanted to remain a part of the coalition though developments in West Bengal and Punjab were a cause for concern.
State BJP president Samrat Choudhary, who met Union Home Minister Amit Shah, the party’s principal strategist, in Delhi on Thursday, asserted that the talks centred around Lok Sabha polls.
“Our top leaders like Amit Shah and national president J P Nadda have said, in public, that the doors of BJP were closed. As a party worker, I abide by the stand. Nitish Kumar, to us, is a politician who changes his allies like clothes”, said Choudhary.

Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta directed the Tamil Nadu government to ensure legal permission for processions, pujas and ceremonies related to the consecration ceremony. The order followed a complaint by a local BJP leader, Vinoj P. Selvan, alleging a ban on festivities by the state.
The Supreme Court expressed dissatisfaction with the reported blanket restrictions imposed by Tamil Nadu police, emphasising that religious activities could only be restricted in the case of genuine law and order concerns.
Solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, representing the Union government, supported the petitioner, asserting that such broad directives should not have been issued by the state. The bench, headed by Justice Khanna, criticised the rejection of permission based on the religious composition of certain areas and emphasised that applications should not be rejected arbitrarily. “If there is any law-and-order situation, the application (permission for procession) may be rejected. But this is not the way…,” Justice Khanna observed."

""The idol of Lord Ram, whose consecration was done on January 22, has been named as 'Balak Ram'. The reason for naming the idol of Lord Ram as 'Balak Ram' is that he resembles a child, whose age is five years,"" Arun Dixit, a priest associated with the consecration ceremony told PTI.
""The first time I saw the idol, I was thrilled and tears started rolling down my face. I cannot explain the feeling I experienced then,"" he added.
The Varanasi-based priest, who has conducted nearly 50-60 consecrations, said, ""Of all the consecrations (I have) performed so far, this is the most 'alaukik (divine)' and 'sarvoch' (supreme) for me.""
Dixit said he had the first glimpse of the idol on January 18.
The idol was consecrated on Monday in a grand ceremony led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said it marked the advent of a new era. The old idol of Ram Lalla, which was earlier kept in a makeshift shrine, has been placed in front of the new idol.
Lakhs of people watched the 'pran pratishtha (consecration)' ceremony on television in their homes and neighbourhood temples, becoming part of the historic event held just months before the Lok Sabha elections.
According to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, the ornaments for the idol have been prepared after extensive research and study of texts such as the Adhyatma Ramayana, Valmiki Ramayana, Ramcharitmanas and the Alavandar Stotram.
The idol is adorned in Banarasi fabric, featuring a yellow dhoti and a red 'pataka' or 'angavastram'. The 'angavastram' are embellished in pure gold 'zari' and threads, featuring auspicious Vaishnav symbols -- 'shankh', 'padma', 'chakra' and 'mayur'.
While the ornaments have been crafted by Ankur Anand's Lucknow-based Harsahaimal Shiamlal Jewellers, the garments were created by Delhi-based textile designer Manish Tripathi, who worked from Ayodhya Dham for the project.
The 51-inch idol chiselled by Mysuru-based sculptor Arun Yogiraj has been carved out of a three billion-year-old rock. The azure-coloured Krishna Shile (black schist) was excavated from Gujjegowdanapura at Jayapura Hobli in HD Kote Taluk of Mysuru. It is a fine-to-medium-grained, sky-blue metamorphic rock, generally called soapstone because of its smooth surface texture and is ideal for sculptors to carve idols.
The Krishna Shile was found while levelling the agricultural land of Ramdas (78) and a local contractor, who assessed the quality of the stone, drew the attention of the temple trustees in Ayodhya through his contacts.
Yogiraj, who has received effusive praise for his work, told PTI, ""I have always felt that Lord Ram has been shielding me and my family from all the bad times and I strongly believe that it was Him who chose me for the auspicious task.""
""I spent sleepless nights working on the idol with precision but it was all worth it. I feel I am the luckiest person on Earth and today is the best day of my life. I learnt the art of sculpting from my father. He would have been very proud to see my idol here today,"" he added.
Rama Lalla idols for the grand temple were made by three sculptors -- Ganesh Bhatt, Yogiraj and Satyanarayan Pandey. The temple trust said that of the three, one would be placed in the sanctum sanctorum while the other two kept in other parts of the mandir."

Vanessa Dougnac, who writes for a French publication, is married to an Indian and has been living in India for the past 22 years. She came to India on a journalist visa and later got the OCI card.
The notice was issued to Dougnac on January 19, days before the visit of French President Emmanuel Macron who is the chief guest at the Republic Day parade this year.
“The journalist has been asked to reply by February 2. Action will be taken after going through her response,” said a ministry official.
Home ministry sources said Dougnac had been under the scanner of the government agencies for the past few years. “Through her malicious reporting she has spread negative perceptions about India,” said a ministry official.
Besides, she had violated visa norms, including travelling to Ladakh, in the past. “A foreign journalist is required to take special permits to go to Ladakh,” the official said.
Sources said she had in the past visited Maoist-hit areas in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh and filed negative and biased stories highlighting the atrocities against Christians and tribals."

The Yatra led by Gandhi, which began on January 14 from Manipur, entered the Coochbehar district of West Bengal from Assam in the morning.
After leading a roadshow in Coochbehar, Gandhi went to New Delhi as the Yatra took a two-day break. In the meanwhile, the Yatra proceeded to Falakata in Alipurduar for a halt.
""Gandhi left for New Delhi from the Hasimara air base in Alipurduar on a special flight. He had some urgent work,"" state Congress leader Subhankar Sarkar said.
""After the recess, the Yatra will resume on January 28. Gandhi will come back by then and join it,"" he said.  After the break, the Yatra will navigate through Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Uttar Dinajpur and Darjeeling districts of West Bengal before entering Bihar on January 29.
The Yatra is scheduled to re-enter West Bengal on January 31 via Malda and it will pass through Murshidabad, both Congress stronghold districts, before departing the state on February 1.
This is Gandhi's first visit to the state since the 2021 assembly elections.
The Yatra is scheduled to cover 6,713 km in 67 days while passing through 110 districts in 15 states before culminating in Mumbai on March 20 or 21.

In his letter to Shah on Tuesday night, Kharge said there have been several instances where the Assam Police has been found wanting in providing adequate security to Gandhi, who is entitled to Z+ security. Z+ is the highest level of security in India with a team of 55 armed personnel.
The letter comes after Congress leaders were booked for ""wanton acts of violence"" by the Assam Police.  On Tuesday, Assam Police registered a case against Gandhi and other Congress leaders for instigating a crowd to launch an attack on Guwahati police.
Police on Tuesday didn't allow the Gandhi-led Yatra to enter the city, triggering protests from irate Congress workers  who removed security barricades on the outskirts of the city.
Listing out the incidents during which security issues were faced by Gandhi, Kharge said on the first day of the Yatra in the state, Assam Police was found protecting the posters of the BJP in Amguri, Sibsagar district instead of ensuring safe passage for the Yatra.
The next day, “miscreants associated with the BJP” were caught defacing and taking down posters and hoardings of the Yatra in Lakhimpur district, he said.
Later, when the Yatra returned from Arunachal Pradesh, there was “another outrageous attack” on the Yatra in Sonitpur district, where the local Superintendent of Police happens to be the brother of Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Kharge said.
""He watched to see that BJP workers attacked and manhandled the Indian National Congress Social Media team, along with our General Secretary Shri. Jairam Ramesh. Shri Ramesh's car was attacked, while miscreants shouting anti-BJNY (Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra) slogans, tearing off the BJNY sticker on the vehicle, and attempting to throw water on the passengers inside,” the Congress chief said.
""On the same day in Sonitpur district, the BJP's district party workers approached and blocked Shri. Rahul Gandhi's convoy. The BJP's workers then physically assaulted the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee President Shri.Bhupen Borah, resulting in him bleeding profusely,"" he said.
On January 22, in Nagaon district, BJP workers blocked Gandhi's convoy, coming extremely close to him, and creating an extremely unsafe situation, Kharge alleged.
""In all of the troubling events mentioned above, the Assam Police has systematically stood by and/or allowed BJP workers to come closer and closer to the convoy of Shri. Rahul Gandhi, breaching his security cordon, and endangering his physical security and that of his team,"" Kharge said.
The Congress chief said none of the miscreants have been arrested even when there was ample evidence for all listed incidents, and added that in many instances investigation has not been initiated.
""As the risk increases, and as the Yatra proceeds as planned, we request your intervention to ensure that the Chief Minister of Assam and the Director General of Police, Assam ensure that no such untoward incident takes place which may lead to grave personal injury to Shri. Rahul Gandhi or any members of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,"" he said in his letter to Shah.
Sharing Kharge's letter, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said in a post on X, ""Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge ji wrote to the Union Home Minister last night on the serious security issues faced by @RahulGandhi and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam over the past few days"".
The police case against Gandhi came after Sarma instructed Director General of Police G P Singh to register a case against the Congress leader for ""provoking the crowd"".
The bitter political duel between Sarma, once a staunch Congressman, and Gandhi, was out in the open with both leaders firing salvos at each other and the Congress blaming the state government for deliberately hindering its ex-chief’s yatra.
Sarma had quit the Congress in 2015, blaming Rahul Gandhi for his exit. The two have since clashed on many issues.
The Yatra would be in Assam till Thursday.

This is the second time in a week that the regulator has penalised Air India.
The regulator had received a complaint from a former Air India pilot alleging that the airline operated Boeing 777 planes to the US without having the required system of emergency oxygen supply.
A comprehensive investigation into the matter was carried out by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which also issued a show cause notice to the airline.
""Since the said operations of the leased aircraft were not in line with regulatory/ OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) performance limits, DGCA has initiated enforcement action and imposed a penalty of Rs 1.10 crore on Air India,"" DGCA said in a release on Wednesday.
There was no immediate comment from Air India on the penalty.
According to the release, the regulator carried out a detailed probe after receiving a voluntary safety report from an airline employee alleging safety violations of flights operated by Air India on certain long range terrain critical routes.
Since the investigation prima facie revealed non-compliance by the airline, DGCA said a show cause notice was issued to Air India, it added.
Specific details were not disclosed in the release.
DGCA analysed the airline's response to the show cause notice with respect to the laid down stipulations under the relevant statutory provisions and the performance limits stipulated in critical documentations laid down by the OEM before taking the enforcement action, the release said.
On October 29, 2023, the pilot, who had served as a B777 commander, complained about the airline's practice of not carrying the required system of emergency oxygen supply.
At that time, sources had said the complaint was that Air India has been operating flights with leased B777 aircraft that carry a chemically-generated oxygen system which lasts around 12 minutes, and hence should not be used for the airline's direct flights to and from San Francisco.
The airline has to factor in that in case of an emergency situation of depressurisation, there should be sufficient oxygen supply to all the crew and the passengers for any period that is more than 12 minutes.
As per the complaint, in the case of depressurisation, it is mandatory for the aircraft to descend to a flight altitude of 10,000 feet or lower.
When flying over high mountainous terrain that could be more than 9,000 to 10,000 feet, it might not be possible to descend to 10,000 feet within 12 minutes.
This is because of the requirement of maintaining the minimum flight altitude of more than 10,000 feet for more than 12 minutes to be clear of vast stretches of high mountainous terrain below extending for hundreds of miles, the complaint had said.
""The matter in question is multi-dimensional and has already been examined by Air India and external experts. We will restrain from offering any comment on this specific case but we wish to reiterate that the safety of our passengers and crew is our foremost priority and there is no compromise on the same,"" an Air India spokesperson said on November 3 last year about the complaint.
Meanwhile, on January 17, DGCA had imposed a fine of Rs 30 lakh on Air India for lapses in rostering of pilots for operating flights in low visibility conditions.

Three days on, he appeared to redefine secularism, as well as social justice, as government welfare reaching all beneficiaries without “partiality”.
“My government does what it says; it completes the projects it starts. My effort is to take the government’s schemes to every beneficiary,” the Prime Minister told a government programme turned election rally in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh.
“Modi is giving you the guarantee of saturation, of covering 100 per cent people under the schemes. There is no room for partiality when the government reaches 100 per cent beneficiaries. There is no room for corruption when the government reaches cent per cent beneficiaries. And this is true secularism, true social justice.”
The Muslim population in Bulandshahr and other western Uttar Pradesh districts is higher (25 to 45 per cent) compared with eastern districts like Ayodhya.
Elaborating on the new definition of secularism, Modi continued: “The needs of any community are the same; the needs and dreams of the farmers of any community are the same; the needs and dreams of the women of every community are also the same. The dreams and challenges of the youths of any community are the same. This is why Modi wants to reach every needy person without any discrimination.”
He went on to attack political opponents while referring to a slogan used successfully by Indira Gandhi over half a century ago.
“After Independence, some coined the slogan ‘Garibi hatao’ (eradicate poverty) and some others lied in the name of social justice,” Modi said.
“But the poor of the country saw that good fortune reached only a few families.... The poor, Dalits and backwards were afraid of criminals and riots. But the situation is changing now because Modi is honestly engaged in their service.”
Modi on Thursday remotely laid the foundation stones for about Rs 19,000 crore worth of projects in Bulandshahr including new railway lines, water supply and sewer lines, a petroleum pipeline and road connectivity with industrial cities.
Although he was travelling to attend a government programme, Modi stood in an open jeep during the last 20km of his 90km road journey from New Delhi to Bulandshahr, flanked by chief minister Yogi Adityanath and state BJP president Bhupendra Chaudhary.
He entered the rally venue — the Chandmari Ground in Chola area of the district — waving to the crowd and began his speech by invoking Ram and Ayodhya.
“I had an auspicious sight of Lord Ram in Ayodhya Dham on January 22,” he said.
He reminded the people of western Uttar Pradesh that “this area belongs to Kalyan Singh, who dedicated his life to the service of Ram and the nation”.
Kalyan was BJP chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when a mob of kar sevaks demolished the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, demanding a Ram temple at the site. Kalyan, an OBC politician, died in 2021.
“He (Kalyan) must be elated to see Ayodhya Dham from wherever he is. It’s our good fortune that we fulfilled his and others’ dream,” Modi said.
“I had said in the proximity of Ram Lalla in Ayodhya that while the Pran Pratistha is complete, now is the time to take the glory of the nation to new heights. We have to build a path from the god (dev) to the country (desh); from Ram to rashtra. Our target is to make India a developed country by 2047.”
On the dais, Adityanath handed Modi a Ram idol and a marble plaque carrying an artist’s sketch of Ayodhya town. He said the Prime Minister had visited Bulandshahr to bless the people after inaugurating the Ram temple."

However, the report added that Salesforce still has 1,000 jobs open across the company, implying that the move could be more of a routine adjusting of the company's workforce, the report said, citing a source.
The job cuts follow a wave of U.S. tech layoffs after the industry hired heavily during the pandemic, including among behemoths such as Amazon, opens new tab and Google.
Salesforce did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report.
Earlier this week, eBay announced it would cut about 1,000 roles, or an estimated 9% of its current workforce, while Microsoft, opens new tab said it would let go of 1,900 employees at Activision Blizzard and Xbox.
Salesforce has already trimmed its workforce last year, when it cut jobs by 10% and closed some offices, after rapid pandemic hiring left it with a bloated workforce.
The workforce trimming helped the company's earnings leading it to report a rise in second and third quarter revenue and raising its annual profit forecast.
Salesforce also said in September that it would hire more than 3,000 people after cutting jobs in January last year to drive up margins."

Gandhi was prevented from visiting the venue this morning and stopped at Haiborgaon where he along with senior Congress leaders, party workers and supporters have sat on a dharna.
The managing committee of Sri Sankardeva Sattra on Sunday had announced that they will not allow the Congress leader to visit the sattra before 3pm on January 22 after Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier in the day said at a press conference that he requested Gandhi not to visit before the consecration of Ram Temple in Ayodhya.
''We were given permission to visit the Sattra on January 11. But suddenly on January 20, we were told that Gandhi can visit only after the consecration of Ram temple'', he said.
It is clear that ''the arrogant powers want the entire focus of the camera on them and pressure was exerted on the Assam government to take this step'', he said.
''After the authorities had told Rahulji that there could be a law and order problem, he (Gandhi) offered to go alone but this, too, was refused. It is clear that it is their deliberate policy to prevent him from going to the holy place which occupies a place of social, cultural and religious importance for all'', Ramesh said.
The authorities said there are many Ram Bhakts in the Bardrava sattra premises and there could be a law and order situation but ''we assured them that no one except Rahulji will go'', he said.
Following this a lot of phone calls were made by the authorities and Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi and local Congress MLA Sibamoni Bora were allowed to proceed to the sattra to talk with the members of the managing committee to resolve the issue and ensure Gandhi's visit to the sacred place.
''Gandhi will continue to stage the dharna till Gogoi and Bora return from the sattra'', he said.
The managing committee has said they can visit after 3pm but ''what guarantee is there that Himanta Biswa Sarma will say at 2:30 pm that due to law and order situation, he will not be allowed to visit at all'', the Congress general secretary said.
The yatra will continue on its usual route after the issue is resolved, Ramesh added.

The disaster struck the Liangshui village of Zhaotong city at 5:51 am Beijing time, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Over 500 residents were evacuated from the landslide-hit areas as the provincial commission for disaster reduction activated a Level-III emergency response for disaster relief, state-run CCTV reported.
Efforts were ongoing to rescue the people trapped under the landslide, official media reported, adding that two of the missing people found dead.
The 47 buried people were from 18 different households, rescue officials said.
More than 200 rescuers, along with 33 firefighting vehicles and 10 loading machines, were mobilised to search for the missing.
Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered an all-out search and rescue of the people missing in a landslide.
[We should] promptly organise rescue teams, make all-out efforts to search for missing individuals, and minimise casualties to the greatest extent possible,” Xi said, according to the report.
Xi, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, called on party cadres to watch out for other natural disaster risks and hidden dangers “to effectively ensure the safety of people’s lives and property” as a result of the wave of cold weather that swept across southern China just three weeks before the Lunar New Year.
Chinese Premier Li Qiang, too, ordered an all-out rescue effort in Liangshui and emphasised the need to maintain social stability, in light of the area’s high altitude and ethnic diversity.
“It is necessary to promptly evacuate the threatened population, handle resettlement properly, effectively ensure the safety of people’s lives and property, and maintain overall social stability,” he said, official media reported.
The cause of the landslide was not immediately known.
The local weather forecast said there will be light snow in the town on Tuesday, with the lowest temperature expected to reach -3 degrees Celsius, the report said.

With the presentation of interim Budget on February 1, Sitharaman will surpass the records of her predecessors like Manmohan Singh, Arun Jaitley, P Chidambaram, and Yashwant Sinha,  who had presented five budgets in a row.  Desai, as Finance Minister, had presented five annual Budgets and one interim Budget between 1959-1964.
The interim Budget 2024-25 to be presented by Sitharaman on February 1, will be a vote-on-account that will give the government authority to spend certain sums of money till a new government comes to office after the April-May general elections.
As the Parliamentary elections are due, Sitharaman's interim Budget may not contain any major policy changes.
Speaking at an industry event last month, Sitharaman had ruled out any ""spectacular announcement"" in the interim Budget, saying it would just be a vote-on-account before the general elections.
A vote-on-account, once approved by Parliament, will authorise the government to withdraw money from the Consolidated Fund of India on pro-rata basis to meet expenditure for the April-July period.
The new government, which is likely to be formed around June, will come up with a final Budget for 2024-25 sometime in July.
Usually, interim Budgets do not contain major policy announcements, but nothing stops the government from taking steps which are necessary to deal with the urgent issues facing the economy.
After the Modi government came to power in 2014, Arun Jaitley took charge of the finance ministry and presented five Budgets in a row from 2014-15 to 2018-19.  It was in 2017, that Jaitley departed from the colonial-era tradition of presenting Budget on the last working day of February to 1st of the month.
Piyush Goyal, who was holding the additional charge of the ministry due to ill health of Jaitley, presented the interim Budget for 2019-20 on February 1, 2019.  Goyal had hiked standard deduction for salaried taxpayers by Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000. Also, the tax rebate for taxpayers whose annual taxable income did not exceed Rs 5 lakh was increased from Rs 2,500 to Rs 12,500.
After the 2019 general elections, in the Modi 2.0 Government, Sitharaman was given the charge of the finance portfolio. She became the second woman to have presented Budget after Indira Gandhi, who had presented the Budget for financial year 1970-71.
That year, Sitharaman did away with the traditional budget briefcase and instead went for a 'bahi-khata' with the National Emblem to carry the speech and other documents.
Under Sitharaman, India has weathered the Covid pandemic with an array of policy measures announced for the poor and continued its tag of the fastest growing major economy and a 'bright spot' in the world economy.
India is racing to become a USD 5 trillion economy by 2027-28 and a USD 30 trillion by 2047.
Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai who holds the tag of presenting 10 Budgets -- the maximum by any finance minister -- had presented six of them, including one interim, in a row.
The first Budget of Independent India was presented by the first finance minister R K Shanmukham Chetty.
Sitharaman, who will be presenting her sixth Budget in a row, is expected to come up with some measures, especially to boost the rural sector as the agriculture sector growth in 2023-24 is estimated to decelerate to 1.8 per cent, from 4 per cent, in the preceding year.
Rakesh Nangia, Chairman, Nangia Andersen India said given the proximity to the elections, the Budget is expected to focus on immediate fiscal needs rather than introducing broad long-term economic reforms.
In the last interim budget for FY 2019-20, while the overall tax structure remained unchanged, there were certain specific tax rebate and standard deduction concessions.
""While major announcements may be deferred until after the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections, the Budget is expected to address ongoing concerns and lay the foundation for future economic growth. This strategic approach aims to balance immediate fiscal responsibilities with long-term economic objectives in a pre-election context,"" Nangia said.

Thakur was a champion of social justice and conducting a nationwide caste census would be an appropriate tribute to him, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said.
""Even though it reflects the Modi Govt's desperation and hypocrisy, the Indian National Congress welcomes the posthumously awarded Bharat Ratna to the champion of social justice Jannayak Karpoori Thakurji,"" Ramesh said in a post on X.
""'Bhagidari Nyay' is one of the five pillars of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. It will need a nation-wide caste census as a starting point.
""Rahul Gandhi has been consistently advocating this but the Modi Government has all along refused to release the results of the Socio Economic Caste Census 2011 and also refused to commit itself to conduct an updated nation-wide caste census which will be the most appropriate tribute to Jannayak Karpoori Thakurji,"" he said.
Two-time Bihar chief minister Karpoori Thakur has been named for the country's highest civilian award Bharat Ratna posthumously, a Rashtrapati Bhawan communique said on Tuesday on the eve of the birth centenary of the fountainhead of OBC politics in Bihar.
Thakur, who passed away in 1988, was the first non-Congress socialist leader who became chief minister twice -- first for seven months in December 1970 and later for two years in 1977.
""The President has been pleased to award Bharat Ratna to Shri Karpoori Thakur (posthumously),"" the communique said.
Thakur, known affectionately as 'Jan Nayak' (people's leader), is the 49th recipient of the country's highest civilian award. The award was last conferred on late president Pranab Mukherjee in 2019.
Born on January 24, 1924 in Nai samaj (barber society), Thakur is credited in Bihar politics for enforcing total prohibition of alcohol in 1970. The village where he was born in Samistupur district was renamed after him as Karpuri Gram.

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and state Congress President and Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar said the Congress treated Shettar with respect, after he joined the party ahead of last year's Assembly polls, while the BJP had humiliated him by denying him the ticket to contest the elections in May.
Shettar, who rejoined his old party on Thursday, cited his long association with the BJP, and said many of his well-wishers wanted him to back in the outfit.
""Jagadish Shettar had told me that he was being requested (by BJP) and workers were being sent to meet him. Yesterday morning too I spoke to him. He had told me that he would not do such a thing and will not go (to BJP), as the Congress party has given him another life in politics. Keeping his words in mind, I spoke about it Mysuru, but now I got information that he is in BJP office,"" Shivakumar said.
Speaking to reporters in Bengaluru, he said the Congress party, considering Shettar as a senior leader, treated him with respect.
""He (Shettar) had said that BJP is not good, he had made several statements against the BJP....Congress had trusted the senior leader, but now you (media) are showing that that trust is being breached. I have got information that he has sent his resignation (as MLC) to the Chairman of the Legislative Council. I don't know whether he has gone or has been taken (by BJP) under any pressure..,,"" he said.
Responding to Shettar's statement that he has rejoined the BJP in the national interest, Shivakumar asked, ""did he not know about national interest, when he was not given the ticket (by BJP)? Did he not know about Congress and national interest, when Congress made him MLC for five years?""
Asked whether Shettar has fallen prey to any allurements, he said, ""he (Shettar) has to say what allurements were given to him. I can only say that Congress treated him respectfully....all of us have conscience, he too will have conscience.""
On whether Laxman Savadi (Congress MLC, who too had joined party from BJP ahead of Assembly polls) will also go back to BJP, Shivakumar said, ""no one will go, quitting the party, Shatter has gone, it's a different matter, despite people rejecting him by a margin of 35,000 votes (in May Assembly polls), Congress treated him respectfully, rest  conscience and people will decide.""
Speaking to reporters at Virajpet in Kodagu district, Siddaramaiah said he was not aware of the development, but repeatedly maintained that Congress treated Shettar respectfully and that he had assured that he would not go back to BJP.
""Jagadish Shettar came to Congress stating that BJP humiliated him and did not give a ticket, we gave him a ticket as he is an ex-Chief Minister. He lost in the Assembly election from his own constituency. We then made him MLC. So no injustice or humiliation happened to him from the Congress party, we treated him respectfully,"" Siddaramaiah said.
Shettar joined the Congress on April 17 last year, dealing a blow to the then ruling BJP ahead of Assembly elections.
The decision to part ways with the BJP came after the 68-year-old six time MLA, a former Leader of Opposition in the Assembly and ex-Speaker, was denied ticket to contest in the Hubli-Dharwad (Central) segment, which he represented in the outgoing Lower House.
The decision of Shettar, a prominent Lingayat leader from north Karnataka, to join Congress ahead of Assembly polls is one of the factors that adversely impacted the BJP's prospects in a number of segments in the region, as it built a perception that the saffron party was neglecting Lingayat leaders, according to political observers.
Shettar, whose family has been associated with the party since Jana Sangh days, is an influential leader from its bastion of Kittur Karnataka region. He had also served as state BJP president.
Shettar, who contested on a Congress ticket after the BJP denied him ticket to contest in the 2023 Assembly polls, was defeated in the Hubli-Dharwad (Central) seat by a margin of 34,289 votes, by BJP's Mahesh Tenginakai, a debutant in electoral politics.
Congress had subsequently made Shettar an MLC.

The small plane had arrived here to take back the Myanmarese soldiers who crossed over to India last week, following gunfights with an ethnic insurgent group, they said.
There were 14 people on the plane and eight of them were injured in the accident, which happened around 10.20 am, officials said.
While landing, it overshot the tabletop runway of the Mizoram government-run airport and crashed. The impact of the accident was such that the plane split into two, they said.
The injured persons were taken to the Lengpui primary health centre for treatment, they added.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has ordered an investigation into the crash, a state government official said.
""All incoming flights have been diverted. When flight services, incoming and outgoing, will resume is yet to be known. Hoping all passengers would be able to either fly in or fly out as soon as possible, especially people with medical emergency,"" she said.
A total of 276 Myanmarese soldiers had entered Mizoram last week, and of them, 184 were sent back on Monday, officials said.
The remaining 92 soldiers were to be repatriated on Tuesday, they said.
The plane was supposed to take them to Sittwe in Myanmar's Rakhine state.

The 276 Myanmarese soldiers entered Bandukbanga village, located at the India-Myanmar-Bangladesh trijunction, in southernmost Mizoram's Lawngtlai district with arms and ammunition on 17 January and approached the Assam Rifles.
They fled to Mizoram after their camp was overrun and captured by 'Arakan Army' fighters.
The Myanmarese soldiers were taken to the nearby Assam Rifles camp at Parva, and later the majority of them were shifted to Lunglei, the official said.
They have been under the supervision of the Assam Rifles since then, the official said.
These 276 soldiers were brought to Aizawl over Saturday and Sunday, for their transport to Myanmar from the Lengpui airport.
The group, headed by a colonel, has 36 officers and 240 lower-rank personnel, officials said.
With the 276 soldiers who entered last week, as many as 635 Myanmar soldiers have fled to Mizoram after their camps were overrun and captured by ethnic armed organisations and pro-democratic forces over the last few months, officials said.
In November, 104 Myanmar army personnel were sent to the border town of Moreh in Manipur from different places in Mizoram by Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters, and then repatriated. Earlier this month, 255 soldiers were sent back via the Lengpui airport by Myanmar air force planes.
Mizoram shares a 510-km-long border with Myanmar."

The incident took place on Wednesday at Phillip Island, Victoria and a close relative, who was devastated on Thursday, confirmed the names of the victims to the Australian media.
The four were identified as Jagjeet Singh Anand, a 23-year-old man; students Suhani Anand and Kirti Bedi, both 20-year-old women; and Reema Sondhi, a 43-year-old Indian national who was visiting her family in Australia.
The three younger victims lived in Clyde.
Anand, a Melbourne-based nurse, was a permanent resident in Australia. Bedi and Suhani were on student visas. Sondhi, who was from Punjab, arrived in Australia two weeks ago for a holiday. All four are believed to be related, news.com.au website reported.
The victims were part of a group of about 10 people who had been enjoying a day out at the beach, the report added.
Victoria Police Eastern Region Assistant Commissioner Karen Nyholm said the victims entered the water near Forrest Caves – close to Cape Woolamai on the Bass Strait side of the Phillip Island’s south-eastern peninsula – on Wednesday afternoon.
Off-duty lifeguards surfing nearby rushed to their aid after the group got into difficulty, pulling three people from the water unresponsive.
Life Saving Victoria commander Kane Treloar said lifeguards from Cape Woolamai were called at about 3.40 pm on Wednesday and a rescue boat retrieved the fourth person. All required CPR.
Three of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene while one of the 20-year-old women was resuscitated and flown to The Alfred. She died in hospital, police said on Thursday morning.
The Indian High Commission in Canberra on Thursday posted on X, the tragic drowning.
""Heartbreaking tragedy in Australia: 4 Indians lost their lives in a drowning incident at Phillip Island, Victoria. Deepest condolences to the families of the victims.
@cgimelbourne team is in touch with friends of the deceased for all necessary assistance @MEAIndia @DrSJaishankar,"" the High Commission posted.
On Thursday, Treloar said it was the worst drowning incident the state had seen in decades.
“We all worked tirelessly to help those people,” Ambulance Victoria manager Paul James said. “It’s tragic... only a week ago we had three other separate drownings here in Gippsland.” 	Life-Saving Victoria operations general manager Liam Krige said 19 people had drowned in Victoria since December 1 – two more than during the same period last summer.
“Behind each one of these drownings there is a family; there’s a brother, there’s a sister, there’s a mother, there’s a daughter,” he said at a press conference at Forrest Caves car park on Thursday.
“It is extremely tragic and our heartfelt condolences do go out to those victims.”

The Bengal chief minister had on Wednesday indicated disapproval of the Yatra entering her state, and posters asking Rahul to go elsewhere had cropped up along its route on Thursday.
“The INDIA bloc will together fight the injustice in the country unleashed by the RSS and the BJP. They are spreading hatred and violence across the country and the INDIA formation will defeat them,” Rahul said in a brief speech at Boxirhat, near the Assam border, after entering Bengal at 10.45am.
His comment about a united fight came within 24 hours of Mamata publicly declaring that Trinamul would go it alone in Bengal and complaining that the Congress had not informed her about the Yatra’s plan to enter Bengal.
That her remarks had left the Congress jittery became evident when party communications chief Jairam Ramesh issued a statement on Wednesday, within a couple of hours of Mamata’s outburst, underscoring her importance to the Opposition bloc.
Rahul, who had launched the Yatra on January 14 from Manipur, arrived in Bengal after covering the northeastern states of Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam.
In his two-minute speech at Boxirhat, Rahul spoke about the hostility he and his team had faced in BJP-ruled Assam. But he spoke not a word on how Trinamul was trying to disparage the Yatra in Bengal.
After Mamata’s comments of Wednesday, Trinamul leaders such as Udayan Guha, the north Bengal development minister, had questioned the need for the Yatra entering Bengal.
As Rahul travelled from the Assam border to Cooch Behar town on Thursday, scores of people were spotted along the route carrying posters with messages such as “Bengal doesn’t need anyone other than Didi” and “Rahul should visit other states”.
The loudest among the posters was one that accused state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury of creating opportunities for the BJP in Bengal.
Unlike the previous legs of the Yatra — during which Rahul had got off the bus and walked short distances to interact with the people — his convoy raced through a 45km stretch, with the former Congress president occasionally waving at people from the bus. The Yatra reached Khagrabari, the entry point to Cooch Behar town, around 12.15pm.
Instead of addressing the people gathered at Khagrabari, Rahul got off the bus, climbed into another vehicle and headed for the Hasimara air force station from where he flew to Delhi.
“The party had already decided on a two-day break for the Yatra. As it resumes on January 28, he will arrive here and join it again,” a Congress leader said.
“There was a delay in the schedule and, therefore, some changes were made to the programme. Rahul was anyway supposed to leave for Delhi from Falakata on Friday — instead, he went today. But he will be back here for the rest of the Yatra.”
Falakata, where the Yatra will halt for two days, is 85km from Boxirhat.
Despite the efforts of Rahul’s spin doctors, his actions and words during the brief Bengal stint of the Yatra so far has led political observers to wonder whether he had tweaked his plans to placate Mamata after her comments on Wednesday.
“The Congress’s desperation to please Mamata has been showing since Jairam Ramesh’s comments yesterday (Wednesday).... Rahul took it to another level by practically doing nothing in Bengal,” an observer said.
He referred to how Adhir, a known Mamata baiter who was on the dais at Boxirhat for around two hours before Rahul arrived, was not allowed to make any speeches from the stage.
That the Congress was being extra careful in choosing its words became apparent when a state unit leader, while addressing the gathering before Rahul’s arrival, added an immediate correction to his initial pledge of fighting “the ruler” by clarifying he had meant the BJP.
While the Congress leadership maintained a low profile to please Mamata, Trinamul’s north Bengal leaders did not hide their glee and claimed that Rahul had left because he had realised that the Congress lacked support in Bengal.
Adhir attacked
Trinamul on Thursday blamed Adhir, who was uncharacteristically quiet on Thursday, for the unravelling of the INDIA combine in Bengal, pointing to his unrelenting attacks on Mamata.
The Trinamul leader in the Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien, told reporters in Delhi on Thursday: “The three reasons for the INDIA alliance not working in West Bengal are, one, Adhir, two, Adhir, and three, Adhir…. Adhir is a gravedigger of the Congress….”
Asked whether this was the end of the road for the attempt to have a seat-sharing arrangement with the Congress in Bengal, or whether there was a window for reconciliation, O’Brien said “we turned the page” on Wednesday.
He refused to be drawn into commenting on whether Trinamul was quitting the INDIA bloc.
“After the general election, if the Congress does its job and defeats the BJP on a substantial number of seats, the Trinamul Congress will very much be a part of the front that believes and fights for the Constitution,” he said.
The INDIA bloc, O’Brien said, has two main detractors — the BJP and Adhir.
“For the last two years, he (Adhir) has been speaking the BJP’s language,” O’Brien said, adding that the party had flagged this before the Congress leadership many times but no action had been taken.
He said that despite Adhir’s repeated attacks on Mamata, “not one TMC MP, minister or MLA said anything against the Congress party or its senior leadership”.
This, along with the repeated extensions of the deadline for a seat-sharing arrangement, demonstrated the “patience and graciousness” of Trinamul, O’Brien said.
Adhir was quoted as saying at a meeting in Siliguri on Thursday: “I am being maligned, targeted, attacked for my anti-Trinamul stand. That is to be expected. It is tolerable. But, on account of that, the level of discourtesy being accorded to Rahul Gandhi here is unacceptable. I find it very sad, personally.”"

President Joe Biden’s Middle East coordinator at the White House, Brett McGurk, will travel to Cairo to meet with Gen. Abbas Kamel, chief of Egypt’s General Intelligence Service and widely considered the nation’s second most powerful official, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of diplomatic talks. McGurk will later head to Doha, Qatar, to meet with Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.
Egyptian and Qatari leaders have been important players in hostage talks and helped broker a cease-fire in November during which Hamas released more than 100 people from captivity.
McGurk’s trip comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said once again that he would not meet Hamas’ demands of a withdrawal of Israeli forces in return for the release of hostages. “Let it be clear: I utterly reject the Hamas monsters’ capitulation terms,” Netanyahu said in a statement Sunday.
Israeli officials say about 240 people were taken hostage during the Oct. 7 attack on Israel led by Hamas, which also killed about 1,200 people. But divisions have emerged in Israel over the path forward, with some citizens protesting the government’s failure to secure the hostages’ release, including a group that gathered near Netanyahu’s Jerusalem home on Sunday, according to Israeli media. Doubts have also emerged among military leaders that fighting alone could achieve their safe return. Gadi Eisenkot, a former army chief who is serving in the war Cabinet, said in a television interview last week that it was an “illusion” to believe the hostages could be safely secured through military operations.
McGurk’s trip, which was previously reported by Axios, comes just days after Israel and Hamas agreed through Qatari intermediaries to allow medicine to be delivered to hostages in exchange for additional medicine and aid for civilians in Gaza.
But U.S. officials have said a new hostage release has been complicated by Hamas’ evident desire for a permanent cease-fire, rather than the kind of temporary pause that accompanied the releases in November.
Administration officials said the hostages were just one of several topics arising from the Israel-Hamas war that McGurk will address on his travels to the region. Netanyahu has also grown increasingly vocal in pushing back against Biden’s insistence that Israel ultimately negotiate the creation of a Palestinian state in exchange for guarantees of its own security.
Netanyahu publicly rejected the idea again this weekend, after speaking with Biden on Friday about the issue of a two-state solution, saying Sunday that all territory west of the Jordan River must be under “full Israeli security control.”

Macron, who is the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations in Delhi on January 26, will spend several hours here, visiting iconic sites, including the hilltop Amber Palace nearby, and participating in a roadshow with Modi.
The two leaders will hold official talks at Rambagh Palace hotel in the evening.
The French delegation was received by Governor Kalraj Mishra and Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma at the airport. Modi, who was on a visit to Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr, was to reach Jaipur later.
Macron was scheduled to visit Amber Fort, Jantar Mantar and Hawa Mahal.
It will also be Modi’s first visit to Rajasthan after the recent assembly polls, in which his Bharatiya Janata Party ousted the Congress government in the state.
The Macron-Modi roadshow will will begin from Jantar Mantar and end at Hawa Mahal. According to details made available by officials earlier, the French leader is also expected to do some shopping in that touristy area.
There is no official word on it, but a trader, who runs the Sahu teashop, said the leaders will stop for a cup of his masala tea. He told PTI Videos that he would be paid digitally through UPI.
Cutouts and hoardings were put up at several locations in Jaipur around the sites Modi and Macron were set to visit.
Security has been tightened in the city and some traffic diversions put in place.

ED sources said the letter had been sent on Monday evening asking Soren to appear for questioning between January 27 and 31.
The letter has also given the chief minister the option of answering the ED questions either at his official residence in Kanke Road or at the ED office on Hinoo Road in Ranchi.
Incidentally, ED officials had interrogated Soren for over seven hours on Saturday at his official residence in a separate closed room.
Soren had earlier been quizzed by the ED in November 2022 in Ranchi in connection with an illegal mining case for nearly nine hours.
“ED officials had prepared a list of 50 questions out of which nearly 30 have been asked and the remaining questions need to be asked to the chief minister based on documentary evidence in the land scam case on change of ownership of an army land in Ranchi,” an ED source said.
Soren had agreed to interrogation after eight summons and asked the ED to record his statement on January 20 afternoon.
There were reports that the ED had written a letter to Soren on Saturday and given him five days (January 16-20) to record his statement and was asked to inform the time and place for recording his statement within two days.
Earlier this year, Soren in reply to the seventh summons of the ED had criticised the federal agency terming its probe as “baseless and biased”.
The letter of the chief minister also accused the ED of engaging in a media trial against him and hinted at taking legal recourse against the summons.
After the Saturday questioning, Soren while meeting party supporters near his residence had alleged the questioning as a conspiracy by the BJP-led Centre to disturb his government.
“Since the formation of our government, they (read the BJP) is hatching a conspiracy. We have never bowed down or been afraid. I want to tell you Hemant Soren will always stand with each of the party workers. I promise you. We will continue to work for the state’s development by shredding their conspiracies to pieces. It is time to put a final nail in their coffin. If need arose I will take bullets but will not bow down,” said Soren.
“Under no circumstances, we will let the state fall into the hands of such conspirators. When these people are unable to deal with us politically they are trying to disturb the government from behind. But the time has come to give a befitting reply to such people,” said Soren."

This is Shah's first visit to the state after the inauguration of the Ram temple at Ayodhya and his third in the past three months. In December, he was in Calcutta, along with national BJP president J.P. Nadda, to form an election management committee for the Bengal unit.
Confirming Shah's visit to Calcutta later this month, a BJP leader said: ""The Union home minister is scheduled to arrive in the city on Sunday and will put up at a five-star hotel in New Town. During his stay, he plans to convene a meeting with prominent BJP leaders, including state president Sukanta Majumdar, leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari and MP Dilip Ghosh.""
The leader added that when Shah and Nadda had reached Calcutta the last time, they had given a series of instructions to the state leadership. ""With polls likely to be announced anytime soon, this time, he (Shah) will hold a series of meetings to find out what the leaders have done since the poll management committee was formed last month.""
After meeting party leaders in Calcutta on January 28, Shah is expected to host a party workers' meeting at Mecheda in East Midnapore district. Before leaving the city, Shah is scheduled to participate in a meeting with intellectuals aligned with the BJP at the Science City auditorium.
The BJP has been attacking the Mamata Banerjee government on charges of corruption and a senior leader said Shah's visit was likely to see the saffron camp intensifying its fight against the ruling Trinamul."
Y1P2LXBCXC_HPNWXL7AAWAHC9Z,"Four cubs born to Namibian cheetah 'Jwala' at Kuno National Park, not three: Union minister Bhupender Yadav","PTI New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 01:34 PM","PTI New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 01:34 PM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/four-cubs-born-to-namibian-cheetah-jwala-at-kuno-national-park-not-three-union-environment-minister-bhupender-yadav/cid/1995885,"Namibian cheetah Jwala has given birth to four cubs at the Kuno National Park in Madhya Pradesh and not three, as reported previously, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said on Wednesday.
The births, first reported on Tuesday, came just weeks after three cubs were born to another Namibian cheetah, Aasha.
Yadav said in a post on X, ""Wildlife wonders! As frontline wildlife warriors managed to get closer to Jwala, they found she has given birth to four, not three, cubs. This has increased our joy several times over. Congratulations all. We pray the cubs thrive and prosper at their home in India.""  	According to officials, the cubs were born to Jwala on January 20.
This is Jwala's second litter and comes after a gap of 10 months.
Jwala (Namibian name Siyaya) had given birth to four cubs last March. Three of the cubs succumbed to extreme heat while the sole survivor is being raised under human care for future wilding.
Yadav had on January 3 also shared information about the birth of three cubs to Aasha.
The recent births have taken the number of cubs at the Kuno National Park to eight at present, with seven being born this month.
The total number of cheetahs at the Kuno National Park currently stands at 21 (six males, seven females and eight cubs).
This has been a mixed month for India's cheetah project. While January recorded the birth of seven cubs, it also witnessed the the death of Shaurya -- an adult Namibian cheetah -- on January 16.
Since last March, seven adult cheetahs, including Shaurya, have died due to various reasons.
The seven adult cheetahs -- three females and four males -- that died include Sasha, Uday, Daksha, Tejas, Suraj, Dhatri and Shaurya. While the first six fatalities occurred in a six-month-period between March and August 2023, Shaurya died last week.
Jwala and Aasha are among the cheetahs translocated to India from Namibia under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Project Cheetah, aimed at re-introducing the only large carnivore species that went extinct in independent India.
The first batch of eight cheetahs was introduced in India in September 2022.
The second batch of 12 cheetahs was flown in from South Africa last February.
The much-vaunted cheetah conservation project, however, has drawn sharp criticism over the animals' deaths.
According to officials, one of the biggest challenges faced in the first year of managing the cheetahs in India was the unexpected development of winter coats by some of the animals during the Indian summer and monsoon, in anticipation of the African winter (June to September).
The winter coat, combined with high humidity and temperatures, caused itching, prompting the animals to scratch their necks on tree trunks or the ground. This led to bruising and exposing the skin, where flies laid eggs, resulting in maggot infestations and, ultimately, bacterial infections and septicemia, leading to the deaths of three cheetahs, an official explained.
""The mortalities under Project Cheetah so far have been within the expected limits. As per Cheetah Action Plan, we anticipated approximately 50 per cent mortality. Right now, 14 imported cheetahs are surviving, besides one cub born on Indian soil,"" SP Yadav, additional director general of forests in the Union Environment Ministry, said earlier.
He had said the project's focus in its second year would be on breeding these animals.
Yadav, also the chief of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, had said the next batch of cheetahs would be imported from South Africa and introduced into Madhya Pradesh's Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary.

""While en route, both ships reported seeing explosions close by and the US Navy accompaniment also intercepted multiple projectiles,"" Maersk said in a statement, adding it was suspending Red Sea transits by vessels of the US subsidiary.
A spokesperson for Yemen's Houthi military forces said they fired ballistic missiles at several US warships that were protecting two US commercial vessels.
Both commercial vessels are operated by Maersk Line, Limited (MLL), its US subsidiary that carries cargo for the Department of Defense, Department of State, USAID, and other US government agencies.
Both are enrolled in the Maritime Security Program (MSP) and Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA) with the US government, which is why they were escorted through the strait by US Navy vessels, Maersk said.
MSP and VISA are programmes run by the US Defense Department to transport forces, supplies and equipment during times of war or national emergency.
The vessels and crew were unharmed and were being escorted back to the Gulf of Aden by the US Navy, Maersk said. Bab al-Mandab is the outlet of the Red Sea, between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula, and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast.
The Houthi military spokesperson, Yahya Sarea, said in a statement that Houthi forces targeted a number of US warships with ballistic missiles on Wednesday in a ""clash"" that lasted more than two hours and led to a U.S. warship being directly hit and the two commercial vessels having ""to withdraw and return.""
""Several of our ballistic missiles struck their targets despite warships' attempts to intercept them,"" the statement said.
A US official said no ships were hit. ""No U.S. warships or commercial vessels were struck by Houthi missiles today,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Houthi forces fired three anti-ship ballistic missiles toward the U.S.-flagged container ship Maersk Detroit on Wednesday as it was transiting the Gulf of Aden, the U.S. Central Command said separately.
There were no reports of injuries or damage to the ship, it added in a statement.
'Escalation of risk'
On Jan. 5, Maersk said it would divert its container vessels away from the Red Sea for the foreseeable future. Until Wednesday, MLL ships were the exception, but that would no longer be the case, Maersk said.
""Following the escalation of risk, MLL is suspending transits in the region until further notice,"" it said on Wednesday.
Seafarers remain in the firing line, and have signed agreements to receive double pay when entering the high-risk zones.
""There's a feeling of vulnerability,"" Stephen Cotton, General Secretary of the International Transport Workers' Federation, the leading union for seafarers, told Reuters.
""The feedback from the (ship) captains is certainly on the container trades, they are much happier to go around the Cape.""
US maritime labour organizations have been separately concerned about the impact on US flagged ships, which in recent weeks have been subjected to what nine unions called ""the most significant attacks on the United States Merchant Marine in more than half a century"".
""It is critically important that US-flag vessels carrying commercial, military and foreign aid cargoes are provided the necessary protection from the United States military as they transit the increasingly treacherous waters of the Red Sea,"" the unions wrote in a Jan. 19 letter to the US Transport Command."

A division bench comprising justices Chitta Ranjan Dash and Partha Sarathi Sen also directed him to surrender before the trial court within a fortnight.
Pramanik moved the Circuit Bench on a direction of the Supreme Court, before which he had filed a prayer for protection earlier.
The division bench directed him to cooperate with the investigators in the case.
An attempt to murder case was registered against Pramanik at Dinhata police station in West Bengal's Cooch Behar district in 2018, when a group of people had allegedly fired on several workers of the ruling Trinamul Congress. One person was allegedly injured in the firing.
A warrant was issued against Pramanik by a lower court in connection with the case, following which he moved the anticipatory bail before the Circuit Bench.
After the high court adjourned the hearing till January 22 without giving him interim protection, the minister had moved the Supreme Court seeking the same.
The apex court had asked the West Bengal police not to take coercive action against Pramanik in connection with the case and directed the high court to hear his anticipatory bail plea.
Pramanik's lawyer claimed before the division bench that a false case alleging complicity in the incident was registered against the minister owing to political reasons.
Pramanik, who was earlier with the TMC, had joined the BJP in February 2019. He had contested the parliamentary polls in 2019 on a BJP ticket and won the Cooch Behar Lok Sabha seat.

The chartered plane was carrying six people and disappeared from the radar screens over Afghanistan on Sunday, according to a Reuters report. Two Taliban officials in Badakhshan said on Sunday that two passengers were killed in a plane crash, but four others had survived.
Khan Mohammad, head of the provincial governor’s office, said the four surviving passengers were now with Taliban administration representatives. Zabihullah Amiri, Badakhshan’s provincial spokesman, confirmed the death toll and that four had survived.
Since the aircraft had taken off from Gaya in Bihar after refuelling, most reports initially suggested that this was an Indian carrier.
Amid conflicting reports about the ownership of the aircraft, the civil aviation ministry in its first statement clarified that “the unfortunate plane crash that has just occurred in Afghanistan is neither an Indian Scheduled Aircraft nor a Non-Scheduled (NSOP)/Charter aircraft. It is a Moroccan-registered small aircraft. More details are awaited”.
Later, the ministry said the DF-10 (Dassault Falcon) aircraft was registered in Morocco and was serving as an air ambulance. It was flying from Thailand to Moscow and had refuelled at Gaya airport.
An official told PTI that the plane departed the Gaya airport after refuelling at 4.02pm on Saturday. There were six passengers onboard, including a female patient, the official added.
The Russian news agency TASS had initially reported that an Indian jet flying to Moscow had crashed in Afghanistan’s northeast, quoting the Aamaj News agency. It was apparently transporting a Russian citizen who needed hospitalisation from Pattaya to Moscow.
A manifest list for the plane, which named everyone on board and which was published by the SHOT news outlet appeared to show that the crew were Russian nationals too.
According to Reuters, the Taliban-run Afghan aviation ministry said in a statement on X that the plane’s planned route did not include passing through Afghanistan’s air space and that “probably due to technical issues” the plane had diverted from its planned route.
The statement said a ministry technical team was investigating the matter. “Afghanistan police had received reports of a plane crash in a remote, mountainous region of Badakhshan,” a provincial police spokesperson said on Sunday."

In a three-paragraph statement, the Maldives government said China had requested, “the necessary clearances to make a port call” but added that: “The vessel would not be conducting any research while in Maldivian waters.”
The Maldivian foreign ministry statement came after international reports that the Xiang Yang Hong 3 was coming to carry out extensive research in the Indian Ocean region. The Maldives statement clarified that the ship would make the port call for, “rotation of personnel and replenishment.”
However, it’s still not clear how long the ship would stay in the Indian Ocean/Arabian Sea area and what  research it carries out. Sri Lanka announced on January 1 that it would not allow Chinese research vessels like the Xiang Yang Hong 3 to dock at its port through 2024. Earlier indications were that the ship planned to stay in the Indian Ocean region for around four months.
The new Maldives government which was elected late last year has tilted strongly towards China and away from India. A Chinese foreign ministry vice minister, Sun Haiyan, was in the Maldives for a two-day visit that ended yesterday. Her visit came hard on the heels of Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu’s five-day visit to China during which he received red carpet treatment and held a meeting with China’s powerful leader Xi Jinping.
Muizzu made his first foreign visit to Turkey and then went to China. Traditionally, Maldivian leaders have always made their first visit to India but Muizzu has pointedly not done that. He has also not received an invitation from India.
The Maldivian foreign ministry stressed in its message that the country had always welcomed both civilian and military vessels “for peaceful purposes”.
India has been very concerned about the increasing number of Chinese research ships that have been making prolonged stays in the Indian Ocean area. Last October, another ship, the Shi Yan 6 had docked in Colombo and carried out research for two days on Sri Lanka’s west coast. The Sri Lankans are thought to have shortened its stay after pressure from the Indian government.
Another Chinese research ship, the Yuan Wang 5, docked in Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port in August 2022. These ships are thought to be mapping the seabed and also keeping an eye on Indian naval activity.
Such activities are part of what international analysts term China’s two-ocean strategy."

Hair white and cheeks wrinkled, she sang the full song without missing a word.
Not surprising, because around eight decades ago, she would sing the song with the INA soldiers marching towards the borders of India to wrest freedom for the country from the British.
Lt Bharati “Asha” Sahay Choudhry, who joined the Rani of Jhansi Regiment of the INA at the age of 17, was part of a session on Wednesday on Day II of Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet, in association with Victoria Memorial Hall and The Telegraph.
One of the most moving moments of the festival came when the entire audience — numbering more than 600 — at the Son-et-Lumiere gave a standing applause to Choudhry as she sang.
The session was titled “The War Diary of Asha-San”, the title borrowed from Sahay Choudhry’s memoirs.
Sahay Choudhry was born in Kobe, Japan, in 1928 and joined the INA in 1945.
Her father, Anand Mohan Sahay, was a minister in the cabinet of the Azad Hind Government and a political adviser to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in Japan. After the war, she was held under camp arrest before being released and reunited with her father in 1946.
“Written in Japanese between 1943 and 1947, The War Diary of Asha-san, is a memoir of courage, honour and love by a young girl who had to grow up quickly in the midst of war,” read a note from the organisers.
The book was translated to Hindi by Sahay Choudhry after she came to India. The Hindi translation was published in 1973. An English translation of the book, done by Tanvi Srivastava, was unveiled at the festival on Wednesday.
Srivastava had a brief chat with Sahay Choudhry.
“Where and when did you meet Netaji for the first time,” she asked the nonagenarian.
“When he came to Tokyo. India and Japan wanted to cooperate. Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was invited to Japan. How to win the war was consulted. It was a very proud thing that I could fight for India’s Independence,” said Sahay Choudhry.
“Netaji used to call all of us in the regiment ranis. War was going on. Every day, there were bombings. We all could fight, all Indians in Southeast Asia — Bangkok, Singapore, Burma. We reached the India-Burma border. By that time, the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The war was over. We were kept in jail. We were so happy. We used to sing ‘Kadam kadam badhaye ja’ and ‘Delhi chalo’,” she recalled before Srivastava requested her to sing.
Srivastava read an excerpt from the book. The excerpt was set in February 1945, a few weeks before she went to join the Rani of Jhansi regiment.
It was a detailed and poignant account of World War II in Japan, which was, by then, staring at defeat.
She wrote about sirens warning of air raids and “swarms of American B29 bombers” — called “mosquitoes for the buzzing sound they made — in the sky.
She also wrote how her mother “bartered cotton sheets for rice” amid a food crisis caused by the war.
Historian Sugata Bose, the grand-nephew of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, was present at the unveiling of the book."

Hindu petitioners claim the mosque was built after demolishing parts of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple — the mosque now shares a compound with the reconstructed temple — and want the Varanasi district court to hand over the entire site to Hindus. Muslims have opposed the plea.
“The ASI has said that the western wall, some pillars and some stone scriptures were parts of a Hindu temple that were partially destroyed, with the same materials reused in the existing structure,” lawyer Vishnu Shankar Jain said, read out from a bunch of papers. He claimed these papers had been handed over by the district court to all the petitioners and respondents on Thursday evening.
Jain said the ASI had found the names of Hindu gods inscribed on the pillars and walls, including those of Janardana and Rudra.
Members of the Anjuman Intezamia Committee, the managing body of the mosque, said they too had received copies of the report but declined comment.
“The ASI report is a matter of interpretation and we don’t want to get into it the way the Hindu petitioners are doing,” a member of the committee told reporters on the condition of anonymity.
“Let us see how the case proceeds. We know that the tide is against us for several reasons, and will wait and watch the developments.”
The district court had asked the ASI early last year to conduct a scientific survey of the mosque, except for the Wazukhana. The agency submitted its report last December, appealing that the court keep it a secret. On Wednesday, the court rejected this request.
“The ASI says it has recovered 34 stone scriptures, of which 32 mention Hindu names of gods and places. Now we will move the court for the survey of the Wazukhana, which we consider a Shivalinga,” Jain said.
The mosque committee claims the purported Shivalinga is just a fountain meant for the faithful to wash their hands and legs before offering namaz."

Speaking to PTI, he also said that now everyone should listen to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's advice to shun habit of fighting on small disputes.
Ansari said he attended the consecration ceremony of Ram Lalla on Monday and his experience was good.
""When my father (Hashim Ansari) was alive, he kept telling everyone that the Congress got the statue placed inside the Babri Masjid, the party got the mosque demolished, and it laid the foundation stone of the temple,"" he alleged.
""In the BJP rule, only the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya took place...nothing else has happened. The BJP has ended the Ram Mandir issue,"" he said.
On the issue of Kashi and Mathura being taken up now, Ansari said, ""All this will keep happening due to politics in the country. What did the Congress do? Whatever is happening today, the Congress also kept doing the same (during its rule)."" 	 Praising the speech of RSS chief Bhagwat at the consecration ceremony, he said, ""Bhagwat ji was saying the right things. Whatever he was saying should happen.
In his speech, Bhagwat had urged people to end 'kalah' (dispute) and shun habit of fighting on small disputes.
The RSS chief said Ram Lalla has returned home after 500 years because of the penance of a lot of people and he salutes their hardwork and sacrifices.
""But why did he (Ram) leave? He left because there were disputes (kalah) in Ayodhya. Ram Rajya is coming and we have to shun all disputes and stop fighting among ourselves over petty issues. We will have to shun ego and stay united,"" he had said.
Ansari said the Muslims of the country want peace.
""This community is not very educated. It does not want a government job. It does its own small business. When there is no riot, they will live peacefully,"" he added        ""Ram has not come to Ayodhya yesterday, he has been there since December 1949,"" he said, referring to the appearance of a Ram Lalla idol in the Babri Masjid on December 22, 1949.
On Monday, the consecration of the new Ram Lalla idol was performed under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the grand Ram temple in Ayodhya.

“It's an understatement to say I’m disappointed that Greta and Margot were not nominated in their respective categories. Their work should be recognised along with the other very deserving nominees,” the La La Land actor said in a statement issued after the nominations for the 2024 Oscars ended on Tuesday.
Gosling, who himself got nominated for playing Ken in the film, went on to underline the significance of Gerwig and Robbie’s contributions to the success of the Barbie movie. “I am so happy and honored to be nominated, especially for portraying a plastic doll named Ken. But there is no Ken without Barbie, and there is no Barbie movie without Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, the two people most responsible for this history-making, globally-celebrated film,” he said.
The actor also expressed his joy for co-star America Ferrera, who received a nomination for best supporting actress for her portrayal of Gloria in the film.
Highlighting Gerwig and Robbie’s contribution in pushing the cultural boundaries of filmmaking, the La La Land actor also mentioned how the entire movie was crafted only with a couple of plastic dolls. “Gerwig and Robbie managed to create a movie that not only made audiences laugh and broke their hearts but also pushed the cultural boundaries, making history in the process,” he signed off.
Though absent from the Best Director category, Gerwig secured a nod alongside her husband, Noah Baumbach, for best adapted screenplay. Similarly, Margot Robbie missed out on a Best Actress nomination but received recognition for her role as a producer in the Best Picture category.
The 2024 Oscars ceremony is scheduled to take place on March 10 at the iconic Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles."

Haley, the former ambassador to the UN under President Donald Trump, rattled off the size of the Chinese navy, warned of China's advances in artificial intelligence and hypersonic missiles, and worried about the development of ""neurostrike"" weapons that can scramble the brains of military commanders in the field.
China has been preparing for war with the US for years, Haley told the crowd of about 100 people gathered on an icy night in Rochester. It needed to be treated like an ""enemy"", not a ""competitor,"" and the US was not ready, she said.
""We've barely gotten started,"" she said.
Trump, who leads Haley in the Republican presidential nominating battle, has taken an entirely different tack in New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Tuesday. At rallies across the state, he tells voters that he alone can keep the nation out of “World War Three” and defends his relationships with some of the world’s most authoritarian rulers, including China’s Xi Jinping.
With just two candidates left in the Republican race, the New Hampshire vote pits the most hawkish in Haley against the more isolationist Trump, who would rather avoid foreign entanglements in keeping with an ""America First"" approach. Trump is favoured to win the primary, while Haley is hoping to draw enough support to argue that she is a viable threat to Trump going forward. The nominee will face President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 general election. Foreign policy normally does not assume a large role in US presidential elections, where domestic concerns are at the forefront of voters' minds. But with the war in Ukraine still raging, Israel battling Hamas in Gaza, and China signalling a more aggressive posture in Asia, these are not normal times.
“The world is on fire,” Haley likes to say at her events."
YM410EDRUI_UFPH95R7EV7DSJW,Fighter soars on superb aerial action and Hrithik Roshan-Deepika Padukone’s combined swag,"Chandreyee Chatterjee Calcutta Published 25.01.24, 04:33 PM","Chandreyee Chatterjee Calcutta Published 25.01.24, 04:33 PM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/entertainment/fighter-soars-on-superb-aerial-action-and-hrithik-roshan-deepika-padukones-combined-swag/cid/1996150,"When Tom ‘Maverick’ Cruise first did his fly-by in his jet in 1986’s Top Gun, he knocked us off our feet and took our collective breath away. No one came close to matching that aerial thrill till 2022, when Cruise strapped into the cockpit once more for Top Gun: Maverick. Hrithik Roshan’s Shamsher ‘Patty’ Pathania might not have taken our breath away when he pulled a similar stunt on his entry in Siddharth Anand’s Fighter, but he certainly made us sit up and go wide-eyed.
The Fighter trailer would have clued most people into what to expect from the film, and they would be right. Built around the Pulwama and Balakot attacks, it follows the usual template of Pakistani terrorists vowing to bring the Indian defence forces to their knees, spouting anti-Indian vitriol, and Indians hitting back and defeating the enemy while spouting dialogues on what it means to be Indian. The plot is pretty predictable when it comes to patriotic actioners.
What elevates Fighter beyond the predictable is the swag of its two leading actors. Hrithik Roshan and Deepika Padukone make the runway look like the ramp every time they walk slo-mo to and from their planes, helmet at hip. While individually they are commanding, together they are great at playing off each other, whether on ground or in air. Only their budding romance seems a bit forced. Deepika’s awestruck look at Hrithik’s OTT entry rankles even more, given that she herself got a stellar aerial intro sequence.
Hrithik’s Patty is an ace fighter pilot with a maverick streak who is grappling with personal tragedy hidden behind a cocky facade. Deepika’s Minal ‘Minni’ Rathore is breaking the glass ceiling as a female squadron leader flying choppers. Both of them embody a certain seriousness that their posts demand amid all the camaraderie with the others in their newly-formed unit Air Dragons. And both are superb in the aerial combat sequences.
The two leads are ably buoyed by a stellar supporting cast — Karan Singh Grover as Sartaj ‘Taj’ Gill and Akshay Oberoi as Basheer ‘Bash’ Khan, both Air Dragons team members led by Anil Kapoor’s Rakesh ‘Rocky’ Jai Singh, the Group Captain. Kapoor delivers once again, every inch the commanding officer. Some of the most emotionally charged scenes are between Patty and Rocky, who are connected by a past tragedy.
Fighter’s star attraction are its aerial sequences; everything else is really just a distraction. Whether it is the fun training scenes with pilots showing off their skills or tense aerial battles with the enemy, when the birds are in air everything else pales in comparison. It is not a copy of the aerial moves in Top Gun, so there is enough originality to keep you on the edge of your seat. The pulsating music and the echoing melody of Vande Mataram accompanying the visuals just enhance the experience.
No wonder there is a distinct drop in pace when the birds are on the ground, especially when that time is filled with jingoism and a little bit of forced patriarchy bashing.
The film’s lowest point is its villain — terrorist Azhar Akhtar, played by Rishabh Sawhney, who, with his ironed hair and puckered lips, seems to run Pakistan’s military operations instead of just a terrorist outfit. He feels more like a caricature of the Terminator than a flesh-and-blood bad guy. So does the climactic on-ground (in air, it is once again full-thrust thrill) hero-on-villain one-twos.
But the action and the star power far outweigh these drawbacks, and Fighter is also a smartly shot and tightly edited film. If the jingoism is cut out, Fighter: Patty is a film we wouldn’t mind waiting to see sometime in the future."

The incident occurred at the bank branch at the ADB Chowk in the town, 320km northeast of the state capital. Incidentally, the place is hardly a couple of hundred metres from the residence of the local sub-divisional police officer.
The miscreants entered the bank branch and fired twice to terrorise the people present inside before moving ahead to collect the cash kept there.
“They (the miscreants) entered the branch a little after noon, gathered everyone present inside, including bank employees and customers, at gunpoint and locked them inside the ‘chest’ room (strong room). They grabbed the money that was available inside and escaped,” Axis Bank Araria branch manager Neeraj Kumar told reporters.
Sources said that the miscreants decamped with around Rs 90 lakh and also fired a couple of bullets from their weapons while looting the bank. However, there was no official statement from the bank about the amount looted till the time of filing the report. The police rushed to the spot after getting information about the incident.
Araria superintendent of police (SP) Ashok Kumar Singh told The Telegraph: “Six unknown miscreants arrived at the bank branch on three motorcycles and robbed it in 15 to 20 minutes. They took around Rs 90 lakh with them. We are trying to identify and arrest them.”
Singh added that the bank robbers had to flee due to the prompt action of the police.
“Nobody has been killed in the incident. We will soon arrest the people involved in the loot,” the Araria SP said.
The police were also going through footage from CCTV cameras at the bank and the neighbourhood installations."
YSNO6EAP0Y_VGW285O469FT0GY,Jharkhand High Court quotes religious texts in judgment on husband-wife relationship,"PTI Ranchi Published 25.01.24, 11:49 AM","PTI Ranchi Published 25.01.24, 11:49 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/jharkhand-high-court-quotes-religious-texts-in-judgment-on-husband-wife-relationship/cid/1996081,"The Jharkhand High Court has cited religious texts while delivering a recent order involving a distraught wife seeking maintenance from her husband.
The judgment not only addresses interpersonal relationship between a husband and wife, but also discusses the rights and responsibilities of married couples.
In a 25-page order, Justice Subhash Chand quotes the Supreme Court to illustrate how women in India are received into the husband's family after marriage. Chand also uses excerpts from the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Manusmriti, and a book by Teresa Chacko titled 'Introduction of Family Life Education' in the order.
Unlike the Western world, where a son separates from his family upon marriage, this is not the case in India, according to Justice Chand.
Quoting from a judgment of the apex court, Justice Chand states that a wife is expected to be with her husband's family after marriage, unless there is a strong justifiable reason for separation.
The wife becomes an integral part of the husband's family, and it is uncommon for her to insist on living separately.
To further explain this concept, Justice Chand references excerpts from the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Manusmriti, and a book by Teresa Chacko titled 'Introduction of Family Life Education.' 	Quoting from Chacko's book, the judge mentions that there are cultural and social expectations regarding appropriate behaviour for both males and females in marriage. The goals and functions of marriage can only be achieved when each family member fulfills their specific role.
The order also enumerates the role of a husband, stating that he should be a sex partner, companion, confidant, decision maker, and accountant. The husband should also be observant and provide emotional support to his wife, the order.
On the other hand, the wife is expected to be an affectionate companion, a good sex partner, confidant, and social secretary for her husband.
She should take charge of the couple's social life, show interest in her husband's work, understand his activities, and provide intellectual companionship.
The matter had come up in a recent case filed by one Rudra Narayan Ray challenging the order of maintenance granted to his wife and minor son by a family court in Dumka.
Justice Chand passed the judgment on January 22 and modified the order to the extent that the maintenance awarded to Ray’s wife was set aside while his minor son’s maintenance amount was enhanced from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000.

The laser beam was transmitted and reflected between the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and an Oreo-sized device on Vikram lander, opening the door to a new style of precisely locating targets on the Moon's surface, NASA said.
The lander was 100 kilometers away from LRO, near Manzinus crater in the Moon's south pole region, when LRO transmitted laser pulses toward it on December 12 last year.
After the orbiter registered light that had bounced back from a tiny NASA retroreflector aboard Vikram, NASA scientists knew their technique had finally worked.
Sending laser pulses towards an object and measuring how long it takes the light to bounce back is a commonly used way to track the locations of Earth-orbiting satellites from the ground.
However, using the technique in reverse—to send laser pulses from a moving spacecraft to a stationary one to determine its precise location—has many applications at the Moon, scientists said.
""We've showed that we can locate our retroreflector on the surface from the Moon's orbit,"" said Xiaoli Sun, who led the team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, that developed the retroreflector on Vikram as part of a partnership between NASA and Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).
""The next step is to improve the technique so that it can become routine for missions that want to use these retroreflectors in the future,"" Sun said in a NASA statement.
Only 2 inches, or 5 centimeters, wide, NASA's tiny but mighty retroreflector, called a Laser Retroreflector Array, has eight quartz-corner-cube prisms set into a dome-shaped aluminum frame.
The device is simple and durable, scientists say, requiring neither power nor maintenance, and can last for decades. Its configuration allows the retroreflector to reflect light coming in from any direction back to its source, NASA said.
Retroreflectors can be used for many applications in science and exploration and have been in use at the Moon since the Apollo era.
By reflecting light back to Earth, the suitcase-size retroreflectors revealed that the Moon is moving away from our planet at a rate of 3.8 centimeters per year, the US space agency added.
Reacting to the development, ISRO said the Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA) on the Chandrayaan-3 lander has begun serving as a fiducial point (precisely located markers for reference) on the Moon.
""NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) achieved a laser range measurement using the LRA by successfully detecting signals reflected by it on December 12, 2023. The ranging utilized the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) on the LRO. The observation occurred during lunar night time, with the LRO ascending to the east of Chandrayaan-3,"" the Indian space agency added.

On the same day, an “anti-fascist” conference of Left outfits — which are not aligned with the CPM-led Front — and Mamata’s Trinamul Congress tore into Prime Minister Modi and the saffron ecosystem for allegedly trying to monopolise Hinduism with the Hindi-Hindu-Hindustan vision of the Sangh parivar and using communal polarisation to divide, to serve its political purpose. Several social activists also took part in the conference.
The Bengal unit of the Congress asserted that it had nothing against Ram or the temple in Ayodhya, but was against turning the deity into a “political product” for the sake of elections.
“We all respect Ram. But the BJP’s marketing of Ram… even upstaging the god for the sake of Narendra Modi’s publicity is most unfortunate. This is event management for the sake of winning elections, not much else,” said the Congress’s chief spokesperson for Bengal, Soumya Aich Roy.
“The way they went about it, disregarding the legit concerns raised by the Shankaracharyas, cannot be condoned,” he added in an apparent reference to the criticism from three of four Sankaracharyas because the consecration of an unfinished temple flouts the scriptures and the resultant controversy.
He was equally unsparing of the Trinamul chief.
“Likewise, Trinamul had to select this specific day, none other, for its so-called integration events. The real pro-people issues, the corruption, the governance failure, the unemployment, the state of the economy, those are being relegated to the sidelines by both her here and him there,” said Aich Roy, whose party is in a precarious situation with regard to the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance in Bengal.
The Congress, Trinamul and the CPM are constituents of the INDIA bloc. In Bengal, the Congress and the CPM have been at daggers drawn with Trinamul. In her Park Circus Maidan address in the evening, Mamata was belligerent in her references to both the CPM and the Congress.
“They (Mamata and Modi) are both trying to use the armour and shield of religion to get through electoral battles, shoving the genuine concerns under the carpet. They are both adhering to the RSS script,” added Aich Roy. “This won’t succeed in the court of the people.”
CPM state secretary Md. Salim said Mamata was no different from Modi.
“Bearing the footwear of the RSS here, Mamata Banerjee is pretty much running the same form of governance and politics here. She, too, is trying to make the real issues take the backseat by bringing to centre stage temples, mosques, gurdwaras and churches. Why?” he asked at a press conference.
“All key parameters with regard to the economy, poverty, hunger, civil liberties, press freedom, India doing abysmally. They are both trying to make January 22 bigger than January 23,” added Salim, referring to the nation’s one of the greatest icons, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, whose birth anniversary is on January 23.
In the “anti-fascist” conference, which followed a rally between Wellington Square and the Netaji Indoor Stadium, 200-odd mass organisations adhering to Trinamul and the wider Left — such as CPI-ML (Liberation) — and human rights defenders like Teesta Setalvad and Harsh Mander participated. Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen was invited to join, but he was unable to on account of ill-health.
“The situation is very peculiar. What the government should do is done by the corporate world and the government is doing something that is the job of the people,” said Dipankar Bhattacharya, national general secretary of CPI-ML (Liberation).
Actor-playwright-filmmaker Bratya Basu, also Bengal’s education minister, said the Modi government was trying to create divisions on the basis of religion to win elections while selling off the nation’s vital resources on the side.
Setalvad said no party could be the custodian of the Hindu religion. “Hindu religion has many different facets, but here, a single party is trying to force something on the people. This is unacceptable,” she said."

“The fear of BJP is surfacing because they have now called NCP’s Rohit Pawar for questioning,” Patole told reporters here.
Karjat Jamkhed MLA Rohit Pawar, the grand nephew of NCP founder Sharad Pawar, appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) here on Wednesday for questioning in connection with its money laundering probe into the alleged Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank scam, an official said earlier.
The probe stems from an August 2019 FIR of the Mumbai Police’s Economic Offences Wing. The ED had conducted searches on January 5 on the of Baramati Agro, a company owned by Rohit Pawar, and some linked entities in Baramati, Pune, Aurangabad and some other locations.
The opposition has repeatedly accused the BJP of misusing agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and ED to target rivals.
The NCP faction under Sharad Pawar, Congress and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT) are partners in the opposition bloc Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) in Maharashtra.
Patole said the Congress is holding division-wise review meetings in the state ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.
“Our organisation is strong till the booth level. We will fix lacunae, if any, during these meetings. Maha Vikas Aghadi will win the most number of seats in the Lok Sabha polls,” he said.
Maharashtra sends 48 MPs to the Lok Sabha, second after UP’s 80.
In the 2019 general elections, the BJP had won in 23 constituencies, followed by the undivided Shiv Sena, which bagged 18 seats. While the NCP had won four seats, one seat each went to Congress, AIMIM and an independent candidate.

During the time the dispute surged and ebbed, Independent India had 14 Prime Ministers and Uttar Pradesh, 21 chief ministers.
The runup to the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992, was politically volatile; it often plunged parts of the nation into violence, dozens of flashpoints of rioting and clashes. Alongside raged a monumental courtroom battle.
Witness statements comprised some 14,000 pages; 1,000 reference books and related documents filled out 21 steel cupboards. Through the course of the discord, the BJP, the political arrowhead of the Ayodhya temple movement, flourished. From 2 seats in the Lok Sabha in 1984 to 88 in 1989, 120 in 1991, 161 in 1996, 182 in 1998, 181 in 1999, 138 in 2004, 116 in 2009, 282 in 2014 and 303 in 2019.
A TIMELINE OF HOW WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THIS DAY
1858
Over two dozen Nihang Sikhs storm into Babri Mosque in Ayodhya and perform ‘havan’ (ritual), according to a police record. This is the first recorded attempt to stake a claim to the birthplace of Ram. Before this Hindus used to worship a spot outside the mosque as the birthplace of Ram. Post Nihang storming, Hindus began entering the mosque to worship.
1885
Mahant Raghubar Das, a monk of the Nirmohi Akhara sect, files a plea in Faizabad district court seeking permission to build a temple on the platform in the outer courtyard of the Babri Mosque. Court rejects the plea.
1949
Idols of Ram Lalla surreptiously placed under the central dome of the mosque. A large group of Hindus appears at the mosque on the intervening night of Dec 22-23, 1949, to place the idols. Many claim the appearance to be a ‘miracle’.
A Faizabad court attaches the mosque, bans entry of both Muslims and Hindus and hands over the site to an official receiver. The idols placed by the Hindu groups, however, are not removed.
1950
One suit filed in Faizabad district court by one Gopal Simla Visharad, seeking permission to worship the idols.
1959

1984–86
Vishwa Hindu Parishad launches movement for construction of Ram temple at the disputed site.
1986 February
Babri Mosque locks opened. A local court orders the government to open the site to Hindu worshippers. Politically, however, the then Rajiv Gandhi government was believed to have played a key role in getting the Babri mosque locks opened for Hindus.
Rajiv Gandhi
It was a bid to counter criticism over his government bowing to the demands of orthodox Muslims and getting a law passed to dilute the Supreme Court verdict in the Shah Bano case.
1986–87
RSS urges the government to transfer the disputed site as well as the adjacent land to the Ram Janmabhoomi Trust and demands a grand Ram temple to be built like the Somnath temple in Gujarat.
1989 August
Allahabad High Court orders status quo with respect to the disputed structure.
1989
A fresh suit is filed by a VHP leader in the name of Lord Ram for declaration of the title and possession in its favour at the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court. All the suits pending before the Faizabad district court transferred to a special bench of the high court.
1989 November
VHP performs shilanyas of the temple on land adjacent to the disputed site. Rajiv Gandhi opens poll campaign from Faizabad.
1989
The BJP for the first time joins the Ram temple movement. Party passes a political resolution at its Palampur session saying the dispute should be resolved through mutual dialogue between the two communities or, if this was not possible, through an enabling legislation. Asserts it is a matter of faith for Hindus and so litigation is in no way a solution for this matter.
1990 September
BJP stalwart L.K. Advani launches yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya, demanding construction of Ram temple.
L.K. Advani
1990 October 22
Advani arrested in Samastipur of Bihar. Despite Advani’s absence, the yatra proceeded with kar sevaks (VHP, RSS and BJP cadres) marching to Ayodhya.
1990 October 30
The police under the then Mulayam Singh Yadav government fired on the kar sevaks as they tried to scale the domes of the Babri Mosque in an attempt to raze it. Mosque remains intact.
1992 December 6
Babri Mosque demolished. Then a BJP government led by Kalyan Singh was in power. On the day thousands of kar sevaks had gathered for an event at a site adjoining the mosque. Top BJP leaders, Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Nritya Gopal Das and Sadhvi Ritambara gave fiery speeches, vowing to build a Ram temple at the site where the mosque stood.
The kar sevaks later stormed the Babri Mosque and demolished the entire structure within a few hours, despite an assurance by the Kalyan Singh government to the Supreme Court that the mosque would not be harmed. The police did not fire on the kar sevaks.
1992 December
Two FIRs are filed in the case. One against unknown kar sevaks for the demolition and the other against BJP leaders Advani, Joshi, Uma Bharati and others for giving communal speeches before the demolition. All are later acquitted of charges.

2003
Archaeological Survey of India begins excavation of the disputed site.
2009

The surprise announcement by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee that caught the Congress off guard came on the back of the growing tussle between the Trinamul Congress(TMC) and the grand old party over sharing of seats to be contested in the key eastern state. It also came just a day ahead of the scheduled entry of the Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra into West Bengal.
""I had given them (Congress) a proposal (on seat sharing) but they refused it at the outset. Our party has now decided to go it alone in Bengal,"" Banerjee told reporters at Dumurjala helipad in Howrah district.
“Now, we have decided that there will be no relations with the Congress in Bengal,"" the chief minister said in remarks that has dented opposition unity efforts. A total of 28 parties have come together to form the INDIA grouping to take on the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections.
According to sources, the TMC had offered only two seats to the Congress based on its 2019 Lok Sabha polls performance. This was not acceptable to the Congress causing strains between the two parties in West Bengal which accounts for 42 parliamentary seats.
A rattled Congress appeared to underplay the rift with the TMC on the seat-sharing issue in West Bengal, asserting that no one can imagine the existence of the INDIA bloc without Mamata Banerjee and that her party is an ""important pillar"" of the opposition alliance.
""We cannot imagine the INDIA bloc without Mamata ji. The INDIA bloc will fight the Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal and all (partners) will participate,"" Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh told a press conference at North Salmara in Assam as part of Rahul Gandhi's ongoing yatra 	 ""Banerjee said that defeating BJP is the priority and prime responsibility of all of us. With this sentiment, our 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' will enter West Bengal tomorrow,"" Ramesh said when asked about the TMC supremo's statement on seat-sharing talks.
The BJP also waded into the TMC-Congress tussle, claiming that Banerjee's decision is a sign of her desperation and it will be a “death knell” for the INDIA bloc.
In Chandigarh, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann said his party will not enter into an alliance with the Congress in the state, reiterating that the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party(AAP) will win all 13 seats at stake.
Denying reports that the TMC and Congress are in talks for seat-sharing, Banerjee asserted that she has not spoken to anyone in the grand old party on the issue.
""Let the Congress fight 300 seats on its own (in the country). The regional parties are together and can contest the rest. However, we will not tolerate any interference by them (Congress) in Bengal,"" she said.
The TMC supremo also stressed that her party would prepare its strategies at the national-level after the elections are over.
""At the national level, we, as part of the INDIA grouping, will decide our strategy after the elections. We will do whatever it takes to defeat BJP,"" she added.
Dwelling on the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra', Banerjee expressed her displeasure over the Congress not informing her about the visit of Rahul Gandhi to West Bengal.
""As a gesture of courtesy, did they (Congress) let me know that they are coming to Bengal for the Yatra? I am not aware of it,"" she said.
West Bengal's Congress state president Adhir Chowdhury, a vocal TMC critic, has maintained that it wouldn't ""beg"" for seats from Bengal’s ruling party.
In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal, TMC bagged 22 seats and the Congress won two while the BJP got 18 seats.
The TMC had recently skipped the recent INDIA bloc virtual meeting and highlighted the necessity for the Congress to recognise its limitations in Bengal, and allow the regional party to spearhead the state's political battle.
Mann's reiteration of AAP's stance in Punjab comes at a time when the party and the Congress are in the midst of seat sharing talks in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Goa and Gujarat.
However, the AAP has entered into an alliance with the Congress for the Chandigarh mayoral poll.
Replying to a question by reporters after a Cabinet meeting on his party's alliance with the Congress, Mann said he has said many times that ""Punjab will become a hero in the country and the AAP will win 13-0 in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls"". Punjab accounts for 13 Lok Sabha seats.
Asked if it was clear that the AAP will not have an electoral alliance with the Congress, Mann said, ""We are not going with them (Congress)."" 	 In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Congress won eight seats, Shiromani Akali Dal(SAD) and its erstwhile ally BJP two each and the AAP one.
Mann and several AAP leaders have made known their opposition to any truck with the Congress for the Lok Sabha polls.
IT department head Amit Malviya, BJP co-incharge for West Bengal, said Banerjee’s decision to fight alone in West Bengal is a sign of desperation.
""Unable to hold her political ground, she wants to fight all seats in the hope that she can still be relevant after the polls,” he said in a post on X.
In New Delhi, TMC sources claimed the Congress delayed the seat-sharing talks and made unreasonable demands without acknowledging the ground reality.
The TMC is open to ""courtesy back-channel"" talks but there is hardly any hope left for reaching a pact, they said.
Maintaining that the TMC had offered two Lok Sabha seats to the Congress, a senior party leader said it is open to discussing a third seat, provided it agrees to give the TMC some seats in Meghalaya and Assam.
The NCP (Sharad Pawar faction) said Banerjee's announcement could be part of a ""strategy"" and maintained that the INDIA bloc stands united against the BJP.
Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray was of the view that Banerjee was ""fighting like a tigress"", and her fight was important for her state."

Balaji New Delhi Published 24.01.24, 05:28 AM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/rage-at-adani-deletion-in-supreme-court-case-on-top-of-list-after-dushyant-dave-protest/cid/1995744,"The Supreme Court will take up on Wednesday an application moved by Adani Power Rajasthan Limited over a Rs 1,376-crore dispute, after senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a state government undertaking, objected to the alleged abrupt deletion of the matter from Tuesday’s list.
The Rajasthan government’s Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd had earlier taken exception to the miscellaneous application moved by the Adani group company in January last year for a direction to Jaipur Vidyut to pay a late-payment surcharge (LPS) of Rs 1,376.35 crore to the private firm. The state had objected to the application since the apex court had already dismissed the Adanis’ plea on the issue in August 2020.
The government undertaking had in January last year objected to the application on the ground that it was illegal and “raises an extraordinarily serious question going to the very root of the institutional integrity of the Registry of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India”. In a letter signed by Kartik Seth, counsel for Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd, the Adani application was improper as a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court had in a judgment dated August 31, 2020, rejected the surcharge demand.
The Adanis’ miscellaneous application had been listed for hearing on Tuesday, but was abruptly deleted according to Dave, who wanted to question the maintainability of the plea.
Dave told the bench of Justices Aniruddha Bose and P.V. Sanjay Kumar that in terms of an earlier judicial order, the matter was to be listed for hearing on Tuesday, but had been deleted suddenly.
The senior counsel said that when his instructing advocate Kartik Seth’s law firm enquired with the Supreme Court registry, an assistant registrar informed them on Tuesday that the matter had been deleted as he had instructions not to list the case.
“When we enquired, the assistant registrar very boldly says, ‘I am under instructions not to list it,’” Dave told the court. He did not name the official.
Dave said when a judicial order had been passed by the court, the registry cannot delete it at the administrative level.
“It is very disturbing. It is contempt if the government does it. But when the registry defies court orders, it should be viewed seriously,” the senior counsel said. Dave pointed out that in another case (not related to the Adanis), a bench headed by Justice A.S. Oka had pulled up the registry for deleting the matter from the hearing list despite a judicial order for listing it on a particular day.
After Dave made the claim, Justice Bose, heading the bench, summoned the assistant registrar concerned and held an in-chamber discussion. Returning to the court, Justice Bose informed Dave that the Adani matter would be listed on “top of the board” as the first item to be heard on Wednesday.
Another PIL petitioner’s advocate also complained on Tuesday to the same bench that his matter, too, had not been listed despite a judicial order. The counsel submitted that the PIL, whose contents were not disclosed, related to an issue that concerned the lives of 20 people. The advocate said the matter had been earlier directed to be listed after two weeks, but had not been done even after eight weeks.
“Why is this happening despite listing date? We will hear it next Wednesday,” Justice Bose said.
On January 5 last year, the Chambers of Kartik Seth on behalf of Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd had shot off a letter to the Supreme Court secretary-general, saying the registry’s decision to clear the miscellaneous application filed by the Adani firm “raises an extraordinarily serious question going to the very root of the institutional integrity of the Registry of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India”.
The application moved by the Adanis on July 19, 2022, had sought a direction to the Rajasthan government undertaking to make a payment of Rs 1,376.35 crore towards late-payment surcharge.
The Rajasthan government had then pointed out that a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court had on August 31, 2020, expressly held that Adani Power Rajasthan Limited was not entitled to the payment of surcharge in terms of Article 8.3.5 of the Power Purchase Agreement dated January 28, 2010, signed between the two parties.
“In terms of the judgment, we have paid the entire amount payable and the same has been accepted by APRL without any protest. Therefore, the present MA (miscellaneous application) is a clear attempt to review the aforesaid judgment after a lapse of more than 2 years and that too without moving any application for condonation of delay…,” the Rajasthan government’s letter through its legal counsel stated."
ZAZQXTYBSO_UOJD1CJIGPM4MEA,"US Presidential elections 2024: Donald Trump, Nikki Haley spar over foreign wars","Reuters Rochester, New Hampshire Published 24.01.24, 09:31 AM","Reuters Rochester, New Hampshire Published 24.01.24, 09:31 AM",20240117,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/us-presidential-elections-2024-donald-trump-nikki-haley-spar-over-foreign-wars/cid/1995803,"At a campaign speech in an American Legion hall in New Hampshire last week, Nikki Haley animatedly warned the US must prepare for a war with China. Haley, the former ambassador to the UN under President Donald Trump, rattled off the size of the Chinese navy, warned of China's advances in artificial intelligence and hypersonic missiles, and worried about the development of ""neurostrike"" weapons that can scramble the brains of military commanders in the field.
China has been preparing for war with the US for years, Haley told the crowd of about 100 people gathered on an icy night in Rochester. It needed to be treated like an ""enemy"", not a ""competitor,"" and the US was not ready, she said.
""We've barely gotten started,"" she said.
Trump, who leads Haley in the Republican presidential nominating battle, has taken an entirely different tack in New Hampshire, which holds its primary on Tuesday. At rallies across the state, he tells voters that he alone can keep the nation out of “World War Three” and defends his relationships with some of the world’s most authoritarian rulers, including China’s Xi Jinping.
With just two candidates left in the Republican race, the New Hampshire vote pits the most hawkish in Haley against the more isolationist Trump, who would rather avoid foreign entanglements in keeping with an ""America First"" approach. Trump is favoured to win the primary, while Haley is hoping to draw enough support to argue that she is a viable threat to Trump going forward. The nominee will face President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the November 5 general election. Foreign policy normally does not assume a large role in US presidential elections, where domestic concerns are at the forefront of voters' minds. But with the war in Ukraine still raging, Israel battling Hamas in Gaza, and China signalling a more aggressive posture in Asia, these are not normal times.
“The world is on fire,” Haley likes to say at her events."

Jha New Delhi Published 26.01.24, 05:15 AM",20240126,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/india/he-was-elected-to-solve-problems-not-to-worship-in-temples-congress-taunts-narendra-modi-guarantees/cid/1996205,"Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge on Thursday expressed surprise at what he felt was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s gumption in building an election campaign based on ""Modi’s guarantee"" despite his alleged failure to fulfil most of his past promises.
""You must have seen full-page advertisements screaming ‘Modi’s guarantee’. What’s Modi’s guarantee? Modi promised two crore jobs every year; has that been delivered? He promised to bring back black money and distribute (shares of) Rs 15 lakh to everybody. Has that been done?"" Kharge told a party workers' convention in Hyderabad.
He said Modi had made several such unfulfilled promises, including bringing down prices.
""The high prices are tormenting people. Don’t fall into his trap. Democracy will be destroyed if he is not removed. He promises to strengthen democracy while MPs are suspended from Parliament for raising people’s concerns,"" the Congress president said.
Kharge accused Modi of using religiosity to mislead the people.
He said the country’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had described industries and dams as modern-day temples and that to him, pilgrimage meant ensuring a bright future for future generations. However, Kharge rued, Modi was wandering around temples and seashores instead of solving the people’s problems.
""He won’t go to Manipur where the lives of thousands of families have been destroyed,"" Kharge added.
This was the first of a series of workers’ conventions that Kharge is to address to prepare the Congress machinery for the general election, at a time Rahul Gandhi is occupied with the Nyay Yatra.
In Hyderabad on Thursday, he said the Opposition grouping INDIA would fight the BJP with all its might even if cracks seem to be developing in Bengal and Bihar.
He made it clear that Modi's failings would remain the main focus, apart from the Nyay infrastructure the party has been working on relating to issues of the youth, women, farmers, workers and equal participation.
""Modi was elected to solve problems, not to worship in temples and whip up religious passions. He destroyed the careers of youths by introducing schemes such as Agniveer (for temporary military recruitment),"" he said.
""Where will the youths go after retiring (from the military services) in four years? He (Modi) is engaged in personal publicity and electioneering at public expense. The nation’s debt jumped from Rs 55 lakh crore to Rs 155 lakh crore — is this development?""
Kharge appeared worried about the religious frenzy Modi has succeeded in generating over the Ram temple. He repeatedly said that religion was a private affair but Modi was linking it to politics.
Responding to Modi's claim of taking ""the youth out of the darkness that had faced them"", Congress communications chief Jairam Ramesh said: ""Really, Mr Prime Minister?! The reality is that the 10 years since 2014 have seen the maximum ANYAY against the youth of India. One out of every three youths has completely given up on their future as they do not have jobs, are not employed, and are not in training. This number is over 50 per cent for young women."""

He also questioned why senior BJP leaders such as JP Nadda, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh did not attend the ceremony.
""It is also a mystery that JP Nadda, Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh were not present at the consecration. Why did the leaders of their own party not go? It means that the method adopted was not right,"" he told reporters.
""The (consecration) programme was like a political event. The consecration of Ram Lalla could have been accomplished in a completely religious, cultural and religious manner. Shankaracharyas were ignored and that is not a good tradition,"" Gehlot added.
An idol of the new Ram Lalla was consecrated at the Ayodhya temple on Monday, a landmark event led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who also gave a clarion call to go beyond the grand mandir's construction to build the foundation of a ""strong, capable and divine"" India of the next 1,000 years.
Gehlot also claimed that the speeches delivered after the ceremony were dangerous and intellectuals are worried about the direction that these would take the country.
""We all, the countrymen, should be worried about this,"" he said.
Lakhs of people watched the 'pran pratishtha (consecration)' ceremony on television in their homes and neighbourhood temples, becoming part of the historic event held just months before the Lok Sabha elections.
""January 22, 2024, is not merely a date in the calendar but heralds the advent of a new era,"" Modi said after he performed a series of rituals in the 'garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum)'.
The prime minister also prostrated himself before the 51-inch idol that depicts the child Ram.
""Today, our Ram has arrived. After a long wait for ages, our Ram has arrived. Our Ram Lalla will no longer live in a tent. Our Ram Lalla will stay in a magnificent temple,"" Modi said in his address to the invitees.
Gehlot also attacked the BJP government in Assam for allegedly disrupting the Congress' Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
""The Assam chief minister ordered to file an FIR whereas no chief minister or the prime minister has the right to directly tell the police or an officer to file one,"" Gehlot said.
""This work is done by the SHO under the CrPC. They decide by looking at the incident that happened, in what form it happened, why it happened and the sections to be invoked,"" he added.
The veteran leader also alleged a conspiracy to stop the yatra.
""The yara will be successful. Rahul Gandhi is not going to be scared,"" he added.

Leading the pack is Oppenheimer, securing an impressive 13 nominations, including recognition for Best Picture, Best Actor (Cillian Murphy), Best Supporting Actor (Robert Downey Jr.), and Best Supporting Actress (Emily Blunt). Trailing closely behind are Poor Things and Killers of the Flower Moon, with 11 and 10 nominations respectively.
Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie ignored
However, amidst the celebration, there were some notable snubs that caught the attention of industry observers. Despite Greta Gerwig's remarkable feat of being the first woman to direct three consecutive Best Picture nominees, including Barbie, she was surprisingly overlooked for a Best Director nomination. Margot Robbie, the lead in Barbie, also missed out on a Best Actress nomination but did secure a Best Picture nod as a producer.
Leonardo DiCaprio misses out
Despite Killers of the Flower Moon earning 10 nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director, Leonardo DiCaprio was notably absent from the Best Actor category for his role as World War I veteran Ernest Burkhart. Nevertheless, the film stands as a testament to Martin Scorsese, who now holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for a director. Despite its widespread acclaim and numerous nominations, Killers of the Flower Moon faced a notable snub in the Best Adapted Screenplay category too.
Greta Lee snubbed
Past Lives actress Greta Lee, who received widespread acclaim for her performance was considered a strong contender for the Oscars, faced disappointment as she was left out of the Best Actress category. Despite early optimism, industry awards and the Academy ultimately overlooked her exceptional performance.
May December overlooked
Todd Haynes’ May December, which received acclaim for Charles Melton's portrayal of Joe Yoo, was surprisingly absent from major categories. Lead actresses Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman, as well as director Todd Haynes, were not recognised, leaving fans and critics puzzled. The drama received only one nod for Best Original Screenplay.
America Ferrera lands Best Supporting Actress nom
In an unexpected turn of events, America Ferrera, who portrayed Barbie's human counterpart in the film, received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Ferrera — who is one of three people of colour nominated in the supporting actress category, alongside Da’Vine Joy Randolph for The Holdovers and Danielle Brooks for The Color Purple — had only landed a nomination in the Critics Choice Awards 2024 before Oscars.
Marking a first
Lily Gladstone also made history by becoming the first Native American to be nominated for Best Actress for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon. Celine Song added another milestone by becoming the first Asian woman nominated for Best Original Screenplay.
Anatomy of a Fall makes a splash
Anatomy of a Fall, which clinched the Palme d'Or at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, is vying for recognition in five different categories at the 96th Oscars. The French courtroom drama has secured a spot in the Best Picture category at the Academy Awards. Furthermore, Sandra Hüller, the leading actress in the film (who also appears in another Best Picture nominee, The Zone of Interest), has earned a nomination for Best Actress. In addition to these accolades, director and co-writer Justine Triet has received nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, while the film itself is in contention for the Best Editing award."
ZIMBQ9ASI3_JYC4WTHNXTIMMAJ,"Before heading to Ayodhya, PM Modi visits ‘the starting point of the Ram Setu’","J.P. Yadav New Delhi Published 22.01.24, 06:08 AM","J.P. Yadav New Delhi Published 22.01.24, 06:08 AM",20240122,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/before-heading-to-ayodhya-pm-modi-visits-the-starting-point-of-the-ram-setu/cid/1995339,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday visited Arichal Munai in Tamil Nadu, the “starting point of the Ram Setu”, a day before he heads to Ayodhya for the Ram temple consecration, signalling the centrality of Modi and Ram to the BJP’s general election campaign in the north and south.
“Had the opportunity to be at Arichal Munai, which holds a special significance in Prabhu Shri Ram’s life. It is the starting point of the Ram Setu,” Modi posted on X with pictures of him praying against the background of the Indian Ocean.
As in Arichal Munai, Modi will be the cynosure at the Ayodhya spectacle on Monday with the veteran campaigners of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, BJP stalwarts L.K. Advani (96) and Murli Manohar Joshi (90), pushed to the sidelines.
Neither Advani, who led the Somnath-to-Ayodhya Rath Yatra in 1990, nor Joshi — a witness to the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992 along with Advani — will attend the consecration ceremony in Ayodhya despite being invited.
“Advaniji has cancelled his trip in view of the severe cold weather and fog,” Deepak Chopra, secretary to Advani, told The Telegraph.
Sources at Joshi’s home said he would not go, either, but cited no reason. “Only Joshiji can say why he is not going,” the person who took the call said, without identifying himself.
Amid the fanfare over Monday’s event, the BJP kept up its attack on the Opposition.
“Identify these unrighteous people! Those who oppose Ram temple, insult Sanatan Dharma,” the party wrote on X, posting images of almost all the main Opposition leaders.
The Congress was singled out for a separate, more scathing, salvo.
“Congress has refused to attend the consecration of Ram Lalla on Jan 22, but did not shy away from visiting the grave of Babar, under whose leadership the Ram temple of Ayodhya was demolished,” the party posted on X.
Accompanying the post was a video with a voiceover that claimed that Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi had visited Babar’s grave in Afghanistan.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman too joined in, accusing the DMK government in Tamil Nadu of being “anti-Hindu”.
She claimed the state government had “banned watching live telecast” of the Ram temple inauguration – a charge denied as “false information” by P.K. Sekar Babu, DMK leader and Tamil Nadu minister for Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HC&CE).
“TN govt has banned watching live telecast of #AyodhaRamMandir programmes of 22 Jan 24. In TN there are over 200 temples for Shri Ram. In HR&CE managed temples no puja/ bhajan/ prasadam/ annadanam in the name of Shri Ram is allowed. Police are stopping privately held temples also from organising events,” Sitharaman posted on X.
Babu issued a statement saying: “Strongly condemn the spreading of false information.... The HR & CE department hasn’t introduced any limitations on devotees freedom to offer food, conduct poojas in the name of Shri Ram....”
He accused Sitharaman of “purposefully propagating the erroneous information”.
Modi, who has undertaken an 11-day “special ritual” to prepare himself for the temple consecration, has been leading a campaign to turn Ram into a national deity with special focus on the Opposition-ruled southern states.
“Frankly, we are amazed by the fervour generated over the Ram temple Pran Pratistha. The euphoria in the southern states has particularly excited us. It’s beyond our expectations,” a BJP leader said, giving the sole credit to Modi.
“The way Modiji has used Ram and the Ram temple to spread the Hindutva spirit in the southern states, we are confident of reaping benefits in the elections.”
Most southern states, barring Karnataka and to some extent Telangana, have so far resisted the appeal of Modi.
Party managers said this was just the beginning and, after Monday’s consecration, the BJP would exploit the euphoria over the Ram temple to the hilt in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, expected in April-May.
The BJP and other Sangh Parivar outfits have decided to ferry thousands of people to Ayodhya daily on special trains for “Ram Lalla darshan”.
The railways have announced 200 “Aastha Special” trains to Ayodhya from across the country after January 22.
“The special trains will run for nearly a month. Our target is to ensure that by the time the elections are announced, crores of people have already visited Ayodhya,” a BJP leader said.
He said the pilgrims who return from Ayodhya would be expected to amplify the BJP agenda ahead of the general election."

Borah, who was attacked by a youth in Jamugurihat while trying to ease tension between the BJP and the Congress members on January 22, has responded by saying he was ready to go to jail.
He was served a notice under 41(A) of the CrPC on Thursday by the investigating officer of the case, Hirok Jyoti Changmai. Failure to appear or comply with the terms of the notice can render Borah “liable for arrest under Section 41 A (3) and (4) of the CrPC”.
The notice under Section 41A of the CrPC is a notice for appearance, requiring a person to appear before the investigating officer at the specified place and time if there is credible information against him.
The Jorhat police slapped the suo motu case against the organisers of the Rahul Gandhi-led Yatra after it did not take the approved route and the sudden change of route led to traffic disruption and clash with security personnel as Congress members and supporters broke through barricades put up on the Gar Ali Road in Jorhat town on January 18 afternoon. The case has been filed, among others,  against K.B. Byju, who is part of Rahul Gandhi’s personal security team.
Like the case FIR lodged by Guwahati police against Rahul and other senior Congress leaders on Tuesday, this case too has been registered under IPC sections dealing with criminal conspiracy, abetment of an offence, unlawful assembly, rioting, violating order promulgated by public servant criminal force to deter public servant from discharging duty, and relevant sections of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP) Act, among others.
The Assam Police had on Wednesday transferred the case filed against Rahul and other senior Congress leaders for “violation of laws” in Guwahati to the state Crime Investigation Department (CID).
Borah returned to Guwahati on Thursday after the Yatra entered West Bengal In the morning.  Both the send-off from Assam Dhubri district and the welcome accorded to the Yatra in Bengal were grand, according to a Congress member.
“All is well that ends well. There were a lot of controversies and conflict and confusion during the Assam leg. But we survived and made an impact,” the member said.
Borah told media persons that he was ready to go to jail for “breaking barricades” but it was in protest to dent the “arrogance” of the chief minister. He said they will not seek bail in the case.
Borah also mentioned the incident in which he was head-butted by a burly youth leaving him with a bleeding nose but “ if I have to go to jail, I will go.” Congress and Opposition parties have demanded the arrest of the burly man who attacked Borah.
Borah also said the Congress was planning a yatra with Priyanka Gandhi in 2024 from Sadiya with as much enthusiasm as the ongoing Yatra.
He also said that the chief minister’s threat to act against Rahul after the Lok Sabha elections means the BJP-led reign is coming to an end.
In a post on X earlier, Borah had said, “TIGER ZINDA HAI Nobody in Indian politics has been more attacked, villified or trolled than @RahulGandhi ji. The attacks on me are minor compared to him. But let me tell @himantabiswa one thing: Tiger Zinda Hai. Watch out!” He was alluding to Rahul Gandhi as tiger for the “manner he led the Yatra for justice”.
Rahul, while meeting individuals and civil society organisations to understand their problems and find solutions, had targetted chief minister through the Assam leg, describing him as the “most corrupt CM in India”. Sarma too hit back by accusing the Gandhi family of being the “most corrupt in India”.
Assam Congress Legislature party leader Debabrata Saikia expressed concern over the alleged attempts by the BJP-led state government to derail the Yatra, flagging the attacks on Yatra vehicles and leaders and not granting permissions for fields to hold Yatra activities."

""The idol of Lord Ram, whose consecration was done on January 22, has been named as 'Balak Ram'. The reason for naming the idol of Lord Ram as 'Balak Ram' is that he resembles a child, whose age is five years,"" Arun Dixit, a priest associated with the consecration ceremony told PTI.
""The first time I saw the idol, I was thrilled and tears started rolling down my face. I cannot explain the feeling I experienced then,"" he added.
The Varanasi-based priest, who has conducted nearly 50-60 consecrations, said, ""Of all the consecrations (I have) performed so far, this is the most 'alaukik (divine)' and 'sarvoch' (supreme) for me.""
Dixit said he had the first glimpse of the idol on January 18.
The idol was consecrated on Monday in a grand ceremony led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said it marked the advent of a new era. The old idol of Ram Lalla, which was earlier kept in a makeshift shrine, has been placed in front of the new idol.
Lakhs of people watched the 'pran pratishtha (consecration)' ceremony on television in their homes and neighbourhood temples, becoming part of the historic event held just months before the Lok Sabha elections.
According to the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, the ornaments for the idol have been prepared after extensive research and study of texts such as the Adhyatma Ramayana, Valmiki Ramayana, Ramcharitmanas and the Alavandar Stotram.
The idol is adorned in Banarasi fabric, featuring a yellow dhoti and a red 'pataka' or 'angavastram'. The 'angavastram' are embellished in pure gold 'zari' and threads, featuring auspicious Vaishnav symbols -- 'shankh', 'padma', 'chakra' and 'mayur'.
While the ornaments have been crafted by Ankur Anand's Lucknow-based Harsahaimal Shiamlal Jewellers, the garments were created by Delhi-based textile designer Manish Tripathi, who worked from Ayodhya Dham for the project.
The 51-inch idol chiselled by Mysuru-based sculptor Arun Yogiraj has been carved out of a three billion-year-old rock. The azure-coloured Krishna Shile (black schist) was excavated from Gujjegowdanapura at Jayapura Hobli in HD Kote Taluk of Mysuru. It is a fine-to-medium-grained, sky-blue metamorphic rock, generally called soapstone because of its smooth surface texture and is ideal for sculptors to carve idols.
The Krishna Shile was found while levelling the agricultural land of Ramdas (78) and a local contractor, who assessed the quality of the stone, drew the attention of the temple trustees in Ayodhya through his contacts.
Yogiraj, who has received effusive praise for his work, told PTI, ""I have always felt that Lord Ram has been shielding me and my family from all the bad times and I strongly believe that it was Him who chose me for the auspicious task.""
""I spent sleepless nights working on the idol with precision but it was all worth it. I feel I am the luckiest person on Earth and today is the best day of my life. I learnt the art of sculpting from my father. He would have been very proud to see my idol here today,"" he added.
Rama Lalla idols for the grand temple were made by three sculptors -- Ganesh Bhatt, Yogiraj and Satyanarayan Pandey. The temple trust said that of the three, one would be placed in the sanctum sanctorum while the other two kept in other parts of the mandir."

Some 40,000 people from the hills to the plains of Bengal made it a colourful congregation in their traditional attire.
Mamata and her party colleagues tried to weave into the one-and-a-half-hour rally representatives from all possible religions, faiths, castes and creeds to showcase Bengal’s diversity in faiths and cultures.
Calcutta apart, Trinamul organised interfaith rallies in each of the 341 blocks.
Mamata, who led the march themed on “religion is personal, the festival is universal”, was accompanied by various religious heads, followed by thousands of women, men, youths and children dressed up to represent various faiths.
The Telegraph spoke to some of those who walked to celebrate India’s unity in diversity.
Indubhushan Utthasini, Hindu priest
The 38-year-old Hindu priest travelled around 80km from his village in East Midnapore’s Mecheda to join the rally as a member of an organisation of priests.
Calling himself a devotee of Lord Ram, he said he worshipped the deity every day. Before leaving home early on Monday for Calcutta, he offered flowers to Lord Ram, Utthasini said.
An arts graduate and a professional priest, Utthasini explained why he took part in the interfaith rally. He said it wasn’t for political reasons but to send a message that the people of Bengal stood for inclusiveness.
“I am a devotee of Shri Ram and I worship him every day. I am happy with the temple that has been built in Ayodhya for our God. But I don’t want any political party to showcase its power by setting up a temple in our country. Ram is for all, not just for one particular community or religion. That’s why the rally of people from all faiths is the right way to celebrate the occasion. We all brothers here,” Utthasini said, adding that he would join such rallies in the future too.
Churmit Lepcha, president of the Indigenous Lepcha Tribal Association
Churmit, 40, travelled around 660km from Kalimpong with her friend Khusboo Chhetri, 26.
The woman dressed in traditional Lepcha attire said she travelled the distance to Calcutta to support the inclusive character of the country.
“Our chief minister Mamata Banerjee has done a lot for our community and has tried to preserve the spirit of brotherhood in Bengal. When I heard that she was organising an interfaith rally on January 22, I decided to travel from Kalimpong to Calcutta,” Churmit said.
Nagma Khatun, Muslim resident of Metiabruz
Nagma, 28, is one of the 400 Muslim women from Metiabruz who woke up early to finish her daily chores to participate in the rally.
One of the five women who held a banner of the Sanhati Yatra, Nagma was at the head of a team of around 4,000 women marchers who shouted slogans for amity.
A high-school dropout, Nagma said: “I don’t have any problem with any temple. We welcome the temple but can’t stand political leaders flexing muscles to celebrate the temple as a victory over others. Our chief minister always speaks for inclusiveness. Since my childhood, I have seen people of diverse faiths and communities living peacefully in my city. I walked in the rally for peace and harmony.”
Raju Shaw, Vaishnav saint with ISKCON
Shaw, 50, said his family migrated to Bengal from Bihar’s Gaya 35 years ago.
“I took part in the rally as I understand the need for inclusiveness, which is an integral part of Bengal,” said the saint who showed a small bag with “Hare Krishna, Hare Rama” inscribed several times on it.
He always carries the bag that contains his japamala (a loop of prayer beads), he said, adding it meant he always carries the name of Lord Ram in his hands and heart. But he did not support the way the consecration of the Ram temple had become a “political weapon” for a party.
“Ram is in our hearts but why will his august temple be used as a political platform? Here (at this interfaith rally), I am walking with people from all communities and I don’t have to think if someone beside me is from any other religion,” Shaw said.
Shantanu Sarkar, high school student
Santanu, 18, from Bowbazar, dressed up as a Muslim cleric to take part in the rally.
His friends Deb and Saikat, who walked with him, were dressed up like a Hindu priest and a Christian bishop, respectively.
“Can you identify our religion before we tell you our names?” grinned the teenager as he marched on with his friends amid thousands.
He said that recently, local Trinamul leaders asked him and his friends if they were interested in taking part in Monday’s interfaith rally dressed up as leaders of different faiths.
“We immediately agreed. It was a great opportunity to showcase the secular fabric of our country,” Santanu said."

With this, the police have so far arrested nine out of the 19 people named in the FIR.
The man, Paresh Shah, whose family members are partners in the Kotia Projects which was given the contract by the civic body to operate boats and other leisure activities at Motnath Lake in Harni area, was arrested from a highway on the city outskirts on Thursday morning, a senior police official said.
""Investigations revealed that Shah was handling the overall operations of the Kotia Projects and was on the run after the tragedy. Employees of the firm at the lake zone used to report to Shah. We have arrested him from the outskirts of the city. Efforts are on to nab the others,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Panna Momaya said.
Though Shah was not formally associated with the firm on paper, his wife, son and daughter are associated with the firm as partners and have also been named as accused in the FIR, the official said.
Twelve students and two teachers of the New Sunrise School on a picnic drowned, while 18 students and two teachers were rescued after an overloaded boat capsized in the Motnath Lake on the city's outskirts on January 18.
The police have registered a case under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) of the Indian Penal Code against 19 persons in connection with the boat tragedy.
As per the FIR, Kotia Projects was given a contract by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to operate the Harni Lake Zone in 2017.
Those arrested so far include four partners of Kotia Projects, its manager and and boat operators.
In its complaint, the Vadodara civic body pointed out lapses, including non-maintenance of boats by the Kotia Projects and not keeping the adequate number of life-saving equipment and life jackets, on the part of the contractor.
It was also revealed that only a few students were given life jackets on the day of the incident.
According to officials, the Kotia Projects had sub-let the contract for boating activities to another company, and the boat operator had no prior experience.
The Gujarat High Court has directed the state government to submit an action taken report (ATR) on the death of students and teachers in the boat tragedy, observing that it has ""shocked the conscience"" of the public.

ZSKJLCPPN9_FMJVM1EMLCDX8ED,Book of revelations,"Sushant Singh Published 25.01.24, 06:49 AM","Sushant Singh Published 25.01.24, 06:49 AM",20240125,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/book-of-revelations-the-lid-on-m-m-naravanes-memoirs/cid/1995986,"Five years after the ignominy of the 1962 Sino-India conflict, one of the men blamed for India’s defeat, Lieutenant-General B.M. Kaul, came out with his memoirs, The Untold Story. The book gave his version of the 1962 operations in which he first served as the Chief of General Staff and then took over the command of the newly-raised 4 Corps in the eastern sector where the Indian army suffered a humiliating rout. Kaul had resigned after the military defeat but when his book came out, it caused a furore in Parliament.
Many members of Parliament asked whether Kaul had sought prior permission from the government to publish it or had submitted the manuscript to the government before its publication. When the then defence minister, Swaran Singh, replied in the negative to both queries, some MPs demanded Kaul’s arrest. Singh then clarified that defence personnel need to seek permission to write a book only when they are in service. “But after their retirement, no permission as such is required. But the law of the land still prevails, namely the Official Secrets Act, and anything which comes within the Official Secrets Act will be an offence and as such actionable under the Official Secrets Act,” he added.
The law hasn’t changed since, but the political environment certainly has. Four Stars of Destiny: An Autobiography, the memoirs of General M.M. Naravane who retired as the army chief in April 2022, was to be released on January 15. The author and the publisher had made the announcement and the book was available for pre-order. But as soon as certain excerpts from the book were released by a news agency as part of the publisher’s promotion strategy, the Narendra Modi government stalled the release of the book. The tentative date for the book’s release is now April 30 on e-commerce portals.
Some chapters of the book have been given to the external affairs ministry while the army headquarters is reviewing the other material. Unlike an order issued by the Modi government in 2021 to bar retired bureaucrats, diplomats and intelligence officials from writing anything without prior approval, there is no such bar on retired military officers. They are only bound by the provisions of the Official Secrets Act, which they sign as having read on the first day of every year when in service.
Naravane is not the first retired army chief to pen his memoirs. It is hard to imagine that he is neither aware of the provisions of the law nor sensitive about revealing information that can jeopardise military operations. Most memoirs of retired government officials contain revelations that are interesting; some disclosures have even embarrassed governments. But such books get published freely even if they sprout a political controversy. That is the norm in any functioning democracy.
Based on the extracts, Naravane’s recounting of the decision-making process around the Agnipath scheme — the controversial arrangement for short-term contractual recruitment of soldiers announced in June 2022 — seems to have ruffled feathers in the Modi government. The former army chief writes that his proposal was only for a 10% recruitment of soldiers for five years on same terms as regular soldiers but this was converted by the Prime Minister’s Office into a new scheme that mandated 100% short-term contractual recruitment of soldiers into the three defence services at a monthly salary of Rs 20,000 for a period of three years.
""This was just not acceptable,"" writes the former army chief. ""Here, we were talking about a trained soldier, who was expected to lay down his life for the country. Surely a soldier could not be compared with a daily wage labourer?"" This led to an increase in the starting salary to Rs 30,000 per month but the army’s insistence on retaining 75% of the short-term contracted soldiers was rejected by the government. Even a proposal for 50% retention by General Bipin Rawat was not accepted by the political leadership which argued that only 25,000 demobilised Agniveer soldiers returning to society every year was too little. People in the know say that the current army chief, General Manoj Pande, has moved a case for 50% retention with the government late last year but has not got the formal political approval so far.
More important is his revelation that for the other two services, the navy and the air force, the political direction for the Agnipath scheme “came like a bolt from the blue."" Naravane explains that he needed some time to clarify to the other two service chiefs that his initial proposal had been specific to the army and that he, too, was taken aback by these unforeseen developments. For the air force, the three/four years' contractual engagement was insufficient to adequately train individuals in the technical skills essential for such tasks as repairs and routine operating and maintenance procedures for aircraft.
In November 2023, speaking at the army’s Chanakya Dialogue in New Delhi, a former navy chief revealed that the then navy chief, Admiral Karambir Singh, had rejected, in writing, the draft Agnipath scheme. But the scheme was still imposed upon the three services. More critically, the three service chiefs — Naravane and Singh had by then retired — were paraded in front of the media to take ownership of the Agnipath scheme. When massive protests broke out in many states over the new scheme, the military leadership was at the forefront of defending the unsatisfactory arrangement. None of the incumbent service chiefs has displayed the moral courage to state the truth. Instead, they have allowed the military to be used as a shield for an unwise political decision that is damaging for the armed forces.
The Modi government has deceived the public about the Agnipath scheme, portraying it as an idea of the military leadership for a ‘youthful profile’ for the armed forces. Their objections and the political impositions have never been revealed by the government. An RTI application seeking records of deliberations on the Agnipath scheme was rejected by the defence ministry, arguing that the files were classified as “secret”. The word, 'secret', is nowhere in the exemption clause of the RTI Act under which information could be denied to an applicant. Instead of passing specific orders, the Central Information Commission has only asked the ministry to either ""provide the revised information or reply as per the applicable exemption of the RTI Act.”
Naravane’s revelations do not violate the Official Secrets Act. They nail the untruths in the political narrative about the short-term contractual recruitment of soldiers at poor wages. The general demonstrates, perhaps unwittingly, that the Modi government was apathetic to the aspirations of the youth who wish to serve in the military, ignored the recommendations of the service chiefs, and was unconcerned about the health of the armed forces as an institution. Going into general elections in a couple of months, the ruling party is in no mood to let this truth about the Agnipath scheme be known to the public before they press the button on the voting machines.
Naravane’s memoirs are unlikely to see the light of the day before the elections, lest they damage the ruling party in any way. This is not a formal banning of the book but a devious way of imposing censorship. The effect, in furthering ignorance and subverting democracy, is the same as the burning of books in Europe in the previous century. The warning lies in the words of the Jewish writer, Heinrich Heine, in Almansor, a play he wrote in 1821: “That was but a prelude; where they burn books, they will ultimately burn people also.”

The historic 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony will be attended by representatives of all major spiritual and religious sects of the country, a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said.
People from all walks of life including representatives of various tribal communities will also attend the ceremony, it said.
Earlier in October, 2023, the prime minister had received the invitation from Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Trust for the 'Pran Pratishtha'  ceremony.
The prime minister will interact with 'shramjeevis' (workers) associated with the construction of Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir. He will also visit the Kuber Tila, where an ancient Shiv temple has been restored. He will also perform 'pooja' and 'darshan' at the restored temple, the statement said.
The Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir is constructed in traditional Nagara style – 380 feet in length (east-west), 250 feet wide and 161 feet tall.
The temple is supported by a total of 392 pillars and 44 doors. The pillars and walls of the temple showcase intricately sculpted depictions of Hindu deities, gods, and goddesses.
“In the main sanctum sanctorum at ground floor, the childhood form of Bhagwan Shri Ram (the idol of Shri Ramlalla) has been placed,” the statement said.
The main entrance to the temple is situated on the eastern side, which can be approached by ascending 32 stairs through the ‘Singh Dwar’.
There are a total of five halls in the temple - Nritya Mandap, Rang Mandap, Sabha Mandap, Prathana Mandap and Kirtan Mandap.
Near the temple is the Sita Koop, a historic well dating back to the ancient era, the statement said.
In the southwestern part of the temple complex, at Kuber Tila, the ancient Shiv temple has been restored along with the installation of a statue of Jatayu.
The foundation of the temple has been constructed with a 14-metre-thick layer of roller-compacted concrete (RCC), giving it the appearance of artificial rock. No iron is used anywhere in the temple, according to the statement.
For protection against ground moisture, a 21-foot-high plinth has been constructed using granite.
The temple complex has a sewage treatment plant, water treatment plant, water supply for fire safety and an independent power station.
The temple has been constructed employing the country's traditional and indigenous technology, the statement said.

ZWXU92JJRU_SZCXK23YT9K0ZVW,"Chinese ship equipped to carry research and surveys allowed to dock, says Maldives","PTI Male Published 24.01.24, 10:24 AM","PTI Male Published 24.01.24, 10:24 AM",20240124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/chinese-ship-equipped-to-carry-research-and-surveys-allowed-to-dock-says-maldives/cid/1995802,"A Chinese ship, equipped to carry research and surveys, will be docking at a Maldivian port after being permitted by the Male government to make a port call for replenishment.
The permission to allow the Chinese ship comes amid strains in ties between India and Maldives after its new President Mohamed Muizzu came to power and made Beijing his first port of call earlier this month after assuming office. Traditionally, New Delhi has been the first port of call for a Maldivian President.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Maldivian foreign ministry said a diplomatic request was made by the Chinese government for the necessary clearances to make a port call, for the rotation of personnel and replenishment.
The statement, however, said the Chinese research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 3, will “not be conducting any research while in the Maldivian waters”.
Further, the statement said Maldives has always been a welcoming destination for “vessels of friendly countries”, and continues to host both civilian and military vessels making port calls for peaceful purposes.
“Such port calls not only enhance bilateral ties between the Maldives and its partner countries but also demonstrate the centuries-old tradition of the Maldivian people welcoming vessels from friendly countries,” it said.
According to Marine Traffic, a private website keeping a watch on the movement of ships, the eight-year-old Chinese ship is likely to dock at a Male port on February 8.
An American think-tank has alleged that a vast fleet of China’s “scientific research” ships is collecting data from the oceans, including in the Indian Ocean, for military purposes, especially for submarine operations, a charge denied by Beijing which said the Chinese vessels operations are in line with the UN Convention on Law of the Seas.
On January 5, Sri Lanka, while denying entry to the Chinese ship, said it has declared a moratorium on foreign research ships entering its waters for a year amid concerns from India over Chinese research vessels docking in its neighbourhood.
Foreign ministry spokesman Niluka Kadurugamuwa had said the moratorium relates to all countries and will allow local researchers to build capacity on a par with their foreign counterparts in joint research.
The Maldives’ proximity to India, barely 70 nautical miles from the island of Minicoy in Lakshadweep and 300 nautical miles from the mainland’s western coast, and its location at the hub of commercial sea lanes running through the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) gives it significant strategic importance.
The Maldives is India’s key maritime neighbour in the IOR and occupies a special place in its initiatives like SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) and the Neighbourhood First Policy of the Narendra Modi government.
According to officials in New Delhi in the know of the developments in the island nation, the Maldivian President has signed undisclosed agreements with Turkey and China and possibly to help Beijing set up a base at an Island H.Dh Makunudhoo.
Though the President’s office has denied having signed any such agreement, the Opposition leaders in the Maldives have been making allegations to this effect while demanding Muizzu to share details of the bilaterals signed with China.
Officials in New Delhi said Male was bringing back so-called reformed Islamic State terrorists from Syria without any rehabilitation plan in effect."
ZXJJ4P96VH_HQ3BA2V6JSWQI96,Saudi Arabia's top diplomat says it won't recognise Israel without a path to a Palestinian state,"AP/PTI Jerusalem Published 23.01.24, 04:49 AM","AP/PTI Jerusalem Published 23.01.24, 04:49 AM",20240123,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/world/saudi-arabias-top-diplomat-says-it-wont-recognise-israel-without-a-path-to-a-palestinian-state/cid/1995553,"Saudi Arabia’s top diplomat said the kingdom will not normalise relations with Israel or contribute to Gaza’s reconstruction without a credible path to a Palestinian state — a non-starter for Israel’s government.
Prince Faisal bin Farhan’s remarks in an interview with CNN broadcast late Sunday were some of the most direct yet from Saudi officials.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — who faces mounting domestic pressure over the plight of Israeli hostages, including an angry protest inside a parliamentary committee meeting on Monday — has rejected Palestinian statehood and described plans for open-ended military control over Gaza.
The dispute over Gaza’s future — as the war rages with no end in sight — pits Israel against its top ally, the US, as well as much of the international community, and poses a major obstacle to any plans for post-war governance or reconstruction of the impoverished coastal enclave that is home to 2.3 million Palestinians.
Before the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel that triggered the war, the US had been trying to broker a landmark agreement in which Saudi Arabia would normalise relations with Israel in exchange for US security guarantees, aid in establishing a civilian nuclear programme and progress towards resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In September, Netanyahu had said Israel was on “the cusp” of such a deal.
In the interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS, the host asked: “Are you saying unequivocally that if there is not a credible and irreversible path to a Palestinian state, there will not be normalisation of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel?”
“That’s the only way we’re going to get a benefit,” Prince Faisal replied. “So, yes.”
Earlier in the interview, when asked if oil-rich Saudi Arabia would finance reconstruction in Gaza — where Israel’s offensive has caused unprecedented destruction — Prince Faisal gave a similar answer.
“As long as we’re able to find a pathway to a solution ... then we can talk about anything,” he said. “But if we are just resetting to the status quo before October 7, in a way that sets us up for another round of this, as we have seen in the past, we’re not interested in that conversation.”
The Palestinians seek a state that would include Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
Israel views all of Jerusalem as its capital and the West Bank as the historical and biblical heartland of the Jewish people. It has built scores of settlements across both territories that are home to hundreds of thousands of Jewish settlers. The last of several rounds of peace talks broke down nearly 15 years ago.
At a meeting about the war on Monday, EU foreign ministers said the creation of a Palestinian state was the only way to achieve peace and expressed concern about Netanyahu’s rejection of the idea.
The current war between Israel and Hamas — the fifth and by far deadliest — began when Palestinian militants broke through Israel’s defences and rampaged through several nearby communities.
Israel’s offensive has killed at least 25,295 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 60,000, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory.
Anger over hostages
Netanyahu has vowed to continue the offensive until “complete victory” over Hamas and to return all of the remaining hostages after nearly half were released in a ceasefire deal in November. But Israelis are increasingly divided on the question of whether it’s possible to do both.
Hamas is believed to be holding the hostages in tunnels deep underground and using them as shields for its top leaders. Israel has only successfully rescued one hostage, while Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli airstrikes or during failed rescue operations. Those claims could not be independently confirmed.
On Monday, dozens of family members of the hostages stormed a committee meeting in Israel’s parliament, yelling: “You won’t sit here while they are dying there!” Some had to be physically restrained as they shouted at the lawmakers, and at least one person was escorted out."
ZZK0K7NFM3_NV77QEWBMLMGR5I,Gaps remain: Editorial on India’s plan to fence its entire border with Myanmar,"The Editorial Board Published 24.01.24, 07:17 AM","The Editorial Board Published 24.01.24, 07:17 AM",20230124,telegraphindia.com,https://www.telegraphindia.com/feeds/opinion/gaps-remain-editorial-on-indias-plan-to-fence-its-entire-border-with-myanmar/cid/1995778,"India’s plan to fence its entire border with Myanmar, as announced by the Union home minister, Amit Shah, last Saturday marks the end of a decades-long commitment by New Delhi to allow relatively free movement of people from both sides who share family and ethnic ties. While a border fence has long been sought by security agencies, the move to build it now poses questions on New Delhi’s responsibilities towards its own citizens, its relationship with the military junta that rules Myanmar, and Indian federalism. The free movement regime has allowed people to cross the border up to 16 kilometres for a day without any documents, and up to 72 hours with permits issued by the authorities. It has particularly benefited the Kuki-Zo community that lives on both sides of the border. But as New Delhi has failed to stem the violence that has raged in Manipur since May last year, the government of the state has repeatedly accused illegal Kuki-Zo immigrants from Myanmar of stoking tensions between the ethnic community’s local population and the majority Meitei community. The Manipur government has backed the plan to fence the border. Yet, there is little evidence to suggest that such a move would stop the violence in Manipur at a time when the state and central governments refuse to acknowledge and correct their own documented biases and failures in dealing with the crisis.
Even as India plans to seal its border with Myanmar, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears content to continue with a business-as-usual attitude towards the rulers of the neighbouring nation. If, indeed, Myanmar is failing to help India maintain security along their 1,643 km border, New Delhi needs to rethink that relationship with a regime whose brutal crackdown on the Opposition, dissenters and multiple ethnic minorities is amplifying a refugee crisis that, in turn, affects India. Within India, Mr Modi’s government must also recognise that a fence will compound the humanitarian challenges for communities on both sides of the border. The governments of Mizoram and Nagaland, states that have significant Kuki-Zo populations, have opposed the fence. Mr Modi’s regime must consult and convince the impacted states about the need for a fence before proceeding with it. If the aim of the initiative is to strengthen India’s security, the government must avoid any step that deepens not only internal fissures along ethnic or state lines but also the stress on federalism."
