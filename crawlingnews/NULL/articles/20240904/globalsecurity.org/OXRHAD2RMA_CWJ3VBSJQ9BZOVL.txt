MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Poland wants to set a "world record" for military spending next year by ramping up procurement of weapons and military equipment, Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on Tuesday.
"Next year, 4.7% of Polish GDP will be allocated to defense. This will be the absolute record and a world record that Poland will set," he said on the margins of a defense industry exhibition in the Polish city of Kielce.
Poland has already earmarked a record-breaking 4.1% of gross domestic product for the military spending in the 2024 budget. Polish media reported in August that the government intended to hike military expenditure to nearly 5%.
Only five allies in 32-member NATO spend more than 3% on their military needs: Poland, Estonia, the United States, Latvia, and Greece. Two-thirds of NATO member states have met the alliance's requirement of spending at least 2% on defense.
