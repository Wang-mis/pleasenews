JERUSALEM, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli police officers, a female and two males, were killed after Palestinian gunmen opened fire on an Israeli checkpoint in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, according to Israeli authorities.
The Israeli army said in a statement that the gunmen arrived with a car near the Tarqumiyah checkpoint in the southern West Bank. They fired at a police vehicle before abandoning their car and fleeing the scene.
Israel's Magen David Adom emergency service confirmed that three police officers were killed by the gunshots.
Israeli forces have launched a search for the attackers.
The incident occurred amid the ongoing large-scale raids carried out by the Israeli military in the northern West Bank. The military stated that the raids were launched in an attempt to arrest wanted persons and prevent future attacks against Israel.
Tensions have escalated in the West Bank since the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023.
