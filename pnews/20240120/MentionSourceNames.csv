3VXNYSC9VW_FEEX4YVQ4H6LQN7,Nauru cuts diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of China,By Kelly Ng,6 days ago,20240115,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-67978185,"One of Taiwan's last diplomatic allies has cut ties with the island in favour of Beijing, just days after a new president was voted in in Taipei.
Nauru, a tiny Micronesian island, was just one of 12 countries that kept diplomatic ties with Taipei.
But in recent years, Beijing - which insists Taiwan is part of China - has been poaching its diplomatic allies.
Taiwan suggests this latest loss is related to the weekend's election results, which angered China.
The election saw voters pick pro-sovereignty candidate William Lai as their next president, a man Beijing has labelled a ""troublemaker"" over remarks he made in the past supporting Taiwanese independence, which it sees as a red line.
""This timing is not only China's retaliation against our democratic elections but also a direct challenge to the international order,"" Taiwanese officials said after Nauru's government announced it would ""no longer recognise [Taiwan] as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China's territory"".
In a media conference on Monday, Taipei's deputy foreign minister Tien Chung-kwang accused China of taking advantage of recent ""political fluctuations"" in Nauru to ""buy over"" the country with financial aid.
""China thinks it can suppress Taiwan with such methods, I think it is wrong. The world has noticed Taiwan's democratic development. If [Beijing] continues to use such despicable methods to seize Taiwan's diplomatic relations, democratic countries all over the world will not recognise it,"" Mr Tien said.
Still, his ministry remains ""on strong alert"" to combat further moves from China to isolate Taiwan on an international stage, he said.
China - which sees the self-ruled island of 23 million as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - welcomed Nauru's decision.
""The decision of the government of Nauru to resume diplomatic relations with China fully demonstrates once again that the one-China principle is the will of the people and the trend of the times,"" China's foreign ministry said.
This is not the first time Nauru has cut ties with Taiwan, which considers itself distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders.
In 2002, Nauru made a similar diplomatic switch to China - it later restored relations with Taiwan in May 2005.
Analysts said the move by Nauru was not unexpected.
""The likelihood that Nauru would switch recognition from Taiwan to China has been on the cards for a while,"" said Anna Powles, associate professor in security studies at New Zealand's Massey University.
The speed at which Australia pursued a treaty offering climate refuge to Tuvalu citizens late last year reflected concerns that Tuvalu, another Pacific nation, was ""under pressure to switch recognition to China"", Ms Powles said.
""These concerns extended to Nauru,"" she said.
""China is always looking to erode Taiwan's influence, especially in the Pacific, where many small nations are looking for development gains,"" said Mihai Sora, a research fellow in the Pacific Islands Program at Lowy Institute, a think tank based in Australia.
""As Taiwan has fewer diplomatic allies around the world, each one becomes more important in its claim to sovereignty... And it is quite possible that China will continue to look for opportunities to erode that.""

The name Balochistan can also be used to refer to a wider area that includes land in Iran and Afghanistan. In the past week, both Iran and Pakistan have launched strikes across each other's borders targeting militants in the region.
To understand the escalation in fighting, here's a closer look at Balochistan, which has a distinct cultural and historical identity.
The largest part of Balochistan is in south-western Pakistan. The Pakistani province covers nearly 44% of the country's total land but is home to only 6% of the country's 241 million people. Its history is marred by insurgency, militancy, and human rights violations.
Sharing a volatile border with Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, Balochistan also boasts a vast coastline along the Arabian Sea.
The region derives its name from the Baloch tribe, which has resided here for centuries. Balochs remain the largest ethnic group, followed by the Pashtuns. Many Baloch people also live in the neighbouring Iranian province of Sistan-Baluchestan, as well as in Afghanistan.
Balochistan stands out as the richest Pakistani province in terms of natural resources, including gas and minerals and is a crucial part of a multi-billion dollar project funded by China called the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
The project is part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative, with the deep-sea port in the city of Gwadar, near the Gulf of Oman, seen as a vital checkpoint.
China is also involved in mining projects here and the construction of an international airport in Gwadar, which insurgent groups in Pakistan fiercely oppose.
A Canadian mining company, Barrick Gold, holds a 50% stake in a Balochistan mine called Reko Diq, which is considered to be one of the world's largest underdeveloped sites for copper and gold.
Local groups in both Pakistan and Iran are part of a decades-long struggle for greater autonomy in Balochistan.
Recent cross-border tensions escalated with Iran's attack on Pakistan on 16 January, which Pakistan said killed two children. Pakistan retaliated with a missile strike inside Iranian territory, which Iran says killed nine people.
Iran claimed it was targeting Jaish al-Adl, a militant group active against Iran, while Pakistan said it was aiming at the ""hideouts"" of two militant groups inside Iran, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF).
Pakistan's strikes were the first external land attack on Iran since the 1980s. It comes as tensions in the Middle East are high with the Gaza war intensifying. Iran also attacked targets in Iraq and Syria in the same week it attacked Pakistan.
The Pakistani province of Balochistan has long grappled with extensive exploitation of its resources and this has been a major catalyst for insurgency and unrest. Locals, particularly the Balochs, have blamed governments for exploiting and profiting from Balochistan's resources while neglecting the development of the region itself.
Resistance against the Pakistani government and the militant insurgency advocating for an independent state for the Baloch people began in 1948, after Pakistan's independence from the British Indian Empire.
Resistance continued in phases through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. After a relatively quiet period, insurgent activities increased significantly from 2003 during the era of military ruler Gen Pervez Musharraf. He launched several counter-insurgency operations in Balochistan and a famous Baloch leader, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, was killed in one of the most controversial ones.
Bloody counter-insurgency operations and a crackdown in the province by Pakistan's army and intelligence agencies have reportedly seen tens of thousands of people disappear, allegedly picked up, tortured and killed with impunity by Pakistani security forces. Pakistan strongly denies these accusations.
According to the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), there are more than 7,000 people missing from Balochistan. But the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances says there are just 454 active cases from Balochistan as of October 2023.
Pakistan's interim prime minister recently said in an interview with the BBC that the number was ""exaggerated"", claiming there are only 50 missing people in Balochistan.
Some of these cases are with the Supreme Court and a large group of women and family members have been protesting in Islamabad, demanding people are returned and an end to kidnappings and killings in the region.
Various militant groups have operated in the province but two remain highly active in the region - the BLF and BLA. These groups operate against Pakistan inside Pakistani territory although Pakistan claims they maintain hideouts primarily in Iran and sometimes in Afghanistan too.
Pakistan accuses the Iranian government of offering safe havens to the leaders and militants of these groups, which Iran denies. Pakistan also claims that India financially supports some factions in Balochistan - allegations India denies.
In the past two years, the Pakistani government has expressed heightened concern over reports of joint attacks by the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), an umbrella organisation of various Islamist armed militant groups operating along the Afghan-Pakistani border.
The BLA stands out as the militant group challenging the authority of Pakistan the most. Several Western countries, including the UK and US, have designated this group as a global terrorist organisation.
In recent years, the BLA has intensified its attacks, shifting from primarily targeting Pakistan's security forces in Balochistan to focusing on Chinese nationals involved in projects in the region.
Similar to other insurgent groups, the BLF frequently targets gas projects, infrastructure, and security posts in Balochistan. Since 2011, the group has actively carried out attacks against Pakistani security forces, foreign workers, government affiliates, and journalists.
Established in Syria in 1964, the BLF initially joined the Iranian Baloch Revolt, an insurgency of Baloch groups against the Iranian government. After five years of conflict, the group negotiated an end to the fight with the Shah of Iran. Subsequently, the BLF, along with other Baloch groups, turned against the Pakistani state, taking refuge in Afghanistan in the 1970s.

A man who faked his death and fled from the US to Scotland has appeared in court in Utah, where he is charged with raping a woman more than 15 years ago.
Nicholas Rossi, 36, had fought against extradition and claimed to be an Irish orphan called Arthur Knight.
On Tuesday, he appeared by video link at the Third District Court in Utah.
He denied that he was the suspect and described the suggestion that he was not giving his true name as ""complete hearsay"".

Watch: US President vows retaliation against Houthis if attacks continue
The UK's defence secretary has told Iran to urge its proxies in the Middle East to ""cease and desist"" as the world is ""running out of patience"".
Grant Shapps singled out Yemen's Houthis and Lebanon's Hezbollah, both key allies of Tehran and supporters of Hamas.
The UK joined the US in launching airstrikes against Houthi targets in Yemen overnight on Thursday.
The Houthis have been attacking shipping in the Red Sea since November.
The Iranian-backed political and military group - who control a large part of Yemen - claims to be targeting ships in response to Israel's attacks on Gaza.
On Friday, US and British forces responded with air strikes on 16 targets in Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, including logistical hubs, air defence systems and military depots. A follow-up strike was also carried out on Saturday, US officials said.
In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mr Shapps said Iran has a vital role to play in de-escalating Middle East tensions.
Asked about his message to the Iranian government Tehran, he said: ""You must get the Houthi rebels, others who are acting as proxies for you, Lebanese Hezbollah are obvious examples, (and) some in Iraq and Syria, you must get these different organisations to cease and desist because we are, the world is, running out of patience.
""We see you, we see through what you're doing. We see how you're doing it, particularly the Houthi rebels, and no good can come from it.""
Mr Shapps also argued the UK was ""acting in self-defence"" over the threat to container ships and an attack on Royal Navy destroyer HMS Diamond by a drone last month.
Hezbollah has been exchanging fire with Israel across the border with Lebanon since the Israeli military launched its campaign in response to the unprecedented Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October.
Around 1,300 people were killed in Israel and 240 more kidnapped. Israel's retaliatory strikes and ground offensive in Gaza has since led to more than 23,000 people there being killed.
Iranian proxies in Syria and Iraq have also regularly been launching attacks on US military bases in the region since the war broke out.
Houthi attacks in the Red Sea increased 500% between November and December last year. The threat has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December.
The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead.

6RDUEPXQ2E_OTVDRTYA2LNKEG6,Somalia turns back Ethiopian plane headed for Somaliland,By Ian Wafula,3 days ago,20240117,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68006001,"Somalia has turned away a plane transporting officials from Ethiopia to the self-declared republic of Somaliland in a major escalation of the diplomatic row between the countries.
Somalia's information minister told the BBC the plane did not have permission to be in the country's airspace.
The Ethiopian officials were visiting Somaliland to discuss a deal, which has sparked a huge row.
Somalia considers Somaliland to be part of its territory.
The agreement, signed on 1 January, would allow Somaliland to lease one of its ports to Ethiopia in exchange for a stake in Ethiopian Airlines and possible recognition of Somaliland as a sovereign state.
Somalia has reacted angrily to the deal, calling it an act of aggression.
On Wednesday, the Somali Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA) said flight ET8273 had broken international rules that flights must obtain clearance from countries they are passing through.
It had attempted to land at Somaliland's Hargeisa Airport.
Despite this incident, regular flights between the two countries are operating as usual, the SCAA said.
Ethiopia's government has not yet commented, but the head of Ethiopian Airlines confirmed that the plane in question had returned to the nation's capital, Addis Ababa.
Somaliland, a former British protectorate which declared independence from Somalia in 1991, has all the trappings of a country, including regular elections, a police force and its own currency.
But this has not been recognised by any country.
By ordering the Ethiopian plane out of its airspace, Somalia is sending a strong message that Somaliland is not an independent country.
Amid the row between Somalia and Ethiopia, both the US and the African Union have backed the territorial integrity of Somalia and urged all parties to cool tensions."
95NTLS3YF7_MBZAWBAKI2TDZLM,Aptamil baby milk: Big supermarkets cut price of formula,By Sam Gruet,5 days ago,20240115,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-67986236,"Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have joined Iceland in cutting the cost of Aptamil baby formula.
It comes after manufacturer Danone cut the price it charges retailers for the majority of its baby milk range by 7%.
Asda said from Monday its customers would also be able to pay for formula using rewards scheme vouchers for the first time.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said prices for baby formula milk had risen by a quarter in two years.
The regulator found competition was hampered because shoppers were reluctant to switch brands, either because they were recommended by friends and family or because their baby would only drink one.
There are rules banning retailers from advertising discounts on infant formula - for babies up to six months - because it might discourage breastfeeding.
In August Iceland called on the government to ""immediately"" update existing legislation so that retailers were allowed to tell the public when they reduce the price of formula.
The supermarket said at the time it still endorsed breastfeeding, yet rising costs were ""placing unbearable pressure on parents who choose to or have no alternative"" to using formula milk.
Iceland was the first supermarket to announce a price reduction, saying Danone's cuts would be reflected in its stores. Asda said it would continue to work with its manufacturing partners to make sure price reductions were passed on to customers.
Kris Comerford, Asda's chief commercial officer, said the supermarket understood that baby formula was a ""vital necessity"" for many.
He said: ""Whilst we respect the regulations in place regarding the sale of baby formula, we want to do everything we can to help families manage their budget and keep their family fed.""
A Sainsbury's spokesperson said the supermarket was passing on cost savings to customers.
In November, the CMA found just two suppliers accounted for 85% of infant formula sales and there was ""very limited availability"" of cheaper own-brand alternatives.
New parents could make significant savings of Â£500 in the first year of a baby's life on formula milk products by shopping around, the CMA added.
Danone told the BBC it would ""continue to engage"" with the CMA investigation.
The rise in costs has correlated with a spike in formula thefts as part of a surge of shoplifting during the cost of living crisis.
Only one UK retailer, Aldi, sells its own brand. Lidl did not immediately reply to a request to comment.

9OQDS5AQVM_19UE65B31FTTTB4,British brothers jailed and banned from Switzerland for museum heist,By Thomas Mackintosh,4 days ago,20240116,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67988454,"Two British brothers have been jailed after confessing to breaking into a Geneva museum and stealing iconic 14th century Chinese Ming Dynasty antiques.
Stewart and Louis Ahearne admitted to a court in Geneva that they were part of a gang of three who raided the Museum of Far Eastern Art in June 2019.
The judge found the brothers guilty of aggravated theft and jailed them each for three-and-a-half years.
He also banned the pair from visiting Switzerland for five years each.
The brothers were ordered to pay 15,000 Swiss francs ($17,400; Â£13,770) in damages to the Baur Foundation which manages the Museum of Far Eastern Art.
Their prison terms, for now, are to be served in Switzerland.
Previously, the court heard about 3.5m Swiss francs ($4m; Â£3.2m) worth of damage to the museum was caused in June 2019 by a power saw, sledgehammer and crowbar in the raid.
Prosecutor Marco Rossier told the court that the brothers, who are from south-east London - and a third man named in court by lawyers as Daniel Kelly - were all ""equally involved"" in the burglary.
Passing his judgement, Geneva's Palais de Justice President Patrick Monney agreed with the shared culpability adding the gang ""acted out of desire to enrich themselves"".
""This desire was considerable,"" he said.
""During the burglary on 1 June 2019 the three act together,"" he added, adescribing the events of the evening.
""After checking out the configuration the day before they know where they are going to the point they run once inside.
""They are able to go in through the hole and out through that same hole in less than a minute.""
The court previously heard Louis Ahearne carried out reconnaissance of the museum, while his older brother Stewart hired a Renault Captur car at Geneva Airport in his name - which he then drove to and from the scene of the crime.
""Louis Ahearne booked the hotel room, [and acquired] the ski masks and clothing used in the burglary,"" Mr Rossier said.
""Everything was prepared and organised. Everything was very quick.""
Two bowls and a vase from the 14th Century were taken in the raid, Mr Rossier explained, adding one bowl was taken to a Hong Kong auction house by the three men. Stewart Ahearne left his passport details as they sold the item, the prosecutor added.
A second item, a vase, was recovered in central London as part of an undercover sting operation with Metropolitan Police officers posing as art buyers a year after the heist.
The third plundered artefact, a wine cup decorated with a chicken, has never been recovered.
During his sentencing President Monney added: ""The prejudice caused is considerable and may be irreparable given the chicken cup has not been found since.""
Before the sentencing, the Ahearnes apologised for their actions and acknowledged the support of their family who were present in court.
Stewart Ahearne said: ""I would like to say sorry to the person who owns the museum for the pain and inconvenience caused. I would like to say sorry to the Swiss society in general. Lastly I'd like to say sorry to Nicola [his partner] and my mum.""
His brother Louis Ahearne added: ""I would like to add my condolences to the museum, Swiss society and my family for the stress I have put them through.""
President Monney said he noted the brothers' admissions, apologies and regrets expressed.
As the brothers were led away, Stewart Ahearne waved at his family while Louis Ahearne blew a kiss in their direction.

A1A6ZMB13U_IWYIMBW92C6ZP67,American XL bully ban in Scotland 'likely by end of month',By Andrew Kerr,9 January,20240110,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-67927591,"A ban on XL bully dogs in Scotland is likely by the end of the month, BBC Scotland News understands.
Due to rising concerns over attacks and even deaths, the breed has been banned by the UK government in England and Wales.
It will be illegal to own this type of dog south of the border from 1 February without an exemption certificate.
On Tuesday Scotland's Community Safety Minister Siobhian Brown told MSPs she was urgently reviewing the matter.
And she advised potential owners: ""It would be preferable not to acquire any such dog at the present time in Scotland.""
BBC Scotland News understands that a Scottish ban could be in force by the end of January.
The Scottish Conservatives had pointed to widespread rehoming of the breed to Scotland since the change in legislation in England and Wales.
And Jamie Greene MSP told Holyrood: ""I would not want to be the minister in charge of any policy who dithered and delayed a day longer than is necessary on this issue and another tragedy occurs.""
The Scottish government had complained their UK counterparts had not kept them informed of the action they were taking.
Ms Brown told MSPs: ""The unintended consequences of the UK government policy is that we're now seeing an influx of XL bully dogs coming into Scotland.""
Last week a man claimed to have driven 30 dogs across the border for rehoming purposes.
Under the new UK laws, XL bully owners must apply for a permit, take out insurance, neuter their dogs and pay a Â£92.40 fee by the end of the month in order to keep the animals.
The breed has been linked to a series of attacks including the death of a man in Staffordshire.
The campaign group Bully Watch, which was formed in response to a series of high-profile attacks by the dogs, previously accused the Scottish government and SSPCA of being ""asleep at the wheel"".
And it called for action to be taken in Scotland ""before it is too late"".
Under the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs definition, an XL bully has to be 20 inches in height if it is a male or 19 inches in height if it is a female."
B5MYZYOSEA_KCVLMS5QS6GNTPI,British brothers raided Swiss museum 'to clear a debt',By Thomas Mackintosh,6 days ago,20240115,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-67950947,"Two British brothers have admitted raiding a museum in Switzerland and making off with iconic Chinese Ming dynasty era artefacts worth millions in order to ""clear a debt"", a court heard.
Prosecutors said the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva was burgled in June 2019 by a gang of three who used tools to break through the front door.
Two 14th Century vases and a bowl were taken in the heist.
Stewart and Louis Ahearne admitted their involvement at a court in Geneva.
The pair, from south-east London, appeared before a panel of three judges at the Palais de Justice in Geneva on Monday facing charges of theft, trespass and damage to property.
They fought extradition from the UK, but it was approved by the Home Secretary in 2022.
Patrick Monney, the president of the court, rejected a last-minute application for the trial to be heard in private. He added that the court was aware of the facts of the case from reports by the Swiss Prosecutors Office and Geneva Police and explained the purpose of the hearing was to ""ask additional questions"".
The court heard that the two brothers travelled to Hong Kong shortly after the raid to sell one of the stolen items to an auction house for Â£80,000.
Father-of-one Louis Ahearne told the court he came to Geneva days before the raid to carry out reconnaissance.
The 34-year-old to confirmed he went to ""film the museum"" and ""took part in the burglary"".
He also admitted giving his passport to the auction house in Hong Kong.
""I was in debt,"" he told the court. ""I was paid to be a front man to clear a debt. In the [CCTV] video I am the third person [going into the museum] with no crowbar and no sledgehammer.""
Throughout the hearing, the brothers insisted they didn't want to name the third person involved.
Stewart Ahearne, 45, told the court he has five children and worked as a tradesman in England. He also admitted to using his name to hire the Renault Captur car, used in the heist, from Avis at Geneva Airport.
He told the court he ""took full responsibility"" for his actions, but denied being involved in any pre-planning of the heist in Geneva.
""I went into the museum. I stole some stuff. Any organisation, anything to do with the artwork I didn't know nothing,"" he said.
He added that he was ""used as a pawn like in a game of chess"" during the heist: ""I was asked to come to Switzerland to do some driving. The story, the scenario changed with the third person. He is not someone you can say no to. He is not a very nice person. My role was I was used.
""I got a phone call telling me my brother was in debt and that I was needed to bring back some stuff. Alarm bells started ringing. My instinct as an older brother was to protect my brother.""
The court heard the three came to Geneva in February 2019. Louis Ahearne said this was for ""tourist"" purposes, but Stewart Ahearne said he ""put two and two together"" after the burglary.
""It was so the third person could do some scouting,"" he added.
He broke down when answering questions about his life in Champ-Dollon prison, saying he spends his time in a cell by himself for 23 hours a day.
The hearing continues.

N61A1ZSRKD_0RVD4N5PI9KA4M2,Georgia: Stalin Icon removed from Tbilisi church,By Rayhan Demytrie in Tbilisi & Robert Greenall in London,2 days ago,20240118,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-68020286,"An icon depicting Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin meeting a Russian Orthodox saint has been removed from Georgia's main cathedral.
The Georgian Church said the painting had been taken away to be ""amended"" as there was ""insufficient evidence"" the two had ever met.
The painting has caused a public outcry and was recently splashed with blue paint in a protest by an activist.
Church leaders and the ruling party have condemned the action.
But the Patriarchate of Georgia said in a statement last week that icons had to portray ""real stories"" and that the depiction of Stalin had to be changed.
""The donors of the icon are called upon to make the appropriate changes to the image themselves; otherwise, we will do it ourselves,"" it said.
Many Georgians have criticised the Church for accepting the icon, as Stalin - who was born in Georgia and as a young man trained to be a priest - carried out a massive purge of clergy during his rule.
The icon, which was placed in the Holy Trinity Cathedral in the capital Tbilisi, depicts scenes from the life of St Matrona of Moscow, a 20th Century Russian visionary and healer who was canonised in the 1990s.
In one, the Russian Orthodox saint can be seen blessing Stalin.
It was donated to the church several months ago by anti-Western nationalist party Alliance of Patriots, which is suspected of having links to the Kremlin.
But the icon only came to prominence this month, after an opposition former politician Giorgi Kandelaki highlighted its presence. It has been courting controversy ever since.
Activist Nata Peradze published a video of her throwing eggs filled with paint at the icon and said she was protesting against what she saw as the glorification of a tyrant.
""I felt that I had to do something, I am not going to talk about Stalin's Terror, everyone knows about it, but my family on both sides suffered and relatives disappeared,"" she told the BBC.
Ultra-conservative pro-Russian group Alt-Info, which was behind homophobic attacks which turned into violence against journalists in 2021, has organised protests outside Ms Peradze's house and outside parliament.
She says she has received death threats, and has now gone into hiding. Her house is under police guard.
The scandal surrounding the icon has awoken a national debate about the Soviet dictator's legacy.
The ruling Georgian Dream party condemned the defacement of the icon but has not commented on the national debate about the role of Stalin.
The Soviet Past Research Laboratory (Sovlab), which aims to explore and analyse Georgia's totalitarian past, says that the rehabilitation of the Soviet dictator has accelerated in Putin's Russia and that Moscow has used it as information warfare agenda to influence the Georgian public.
Sovlab has tracked the emergence of 12 new statues to Stalin across Georgia in the past decade.
Stalin was born Iosif Dzhugashvili in the town of Gori, in the east of Georgia, in 1878. A key figure in the Russian revolution which brought the Bolsheviks to power, he ruled the USSR from 1924 until his death in 1953.
Millions died as Stalin imposed iron discipline and state terror to root out ""enemies of the people"" and build a communist state.
Many people in the small South Caucasian country reject the legacy of the Soviet Union, but some still view Stalin with some pride because of his humble beginnings there.
Visiting Tbilisi on 16 January for the film dramatisation of his book, the Young Stalin, British author Simon Sebag Montefiore said it was surprising to see the dictator's image in the cathedral.
""Stalin studied in the seminary and was a believer by his own account until his late teens. He was the star choir boy,"" he said.
""But nonetheless, he turned very much against the Church, embraced secular life, rejected God and embraced Bolshevism and Marxism.""
""His essential belief was that society can be improved by mass killings of people.""

PEA62KIZBL_B5XUSS8D63GJ6W0,Two British brothers 'should be banned from Switzerland' for museum heist,By Thomas Mackintosh,5 days ago,20240116,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-67988451,"Prosecutors have called for two British brothers to be banned from Switzerland for five years as punishment for their role in raiding a museum of iconic Chinese Ming Dynasty artefacts.
At a court in Geneva on Monday, Stewart and Louis Ahearne confessed to being part of a gang which burgled the Museum of Far Eastern Art in June 2019.
On top of the ban, prosecutor Marco Rossier said the court should jail the brothers for four years.
They will be sentenced on Tuesday.
Mr Rossier told the court the brothers, who are from south-east London - and a third man named in court by lawyers as Daniel Kelly - were all ""equally involved"" in the burglary.
He said Louis Ahearne carried out reconnaissance of the museum, while his older brother Stewart hired a Renault Captur car out in his name - which he then drove to and from the scene of the crime.
""Louis Ahearne booked the hotel room, the ski masks and clothing used in the burglary,"" Mr Rossier said.
""Everything was prepared and organised. Everything was very quick.""
Two bowls and a vase from the 14th Century were taken in the raid, Mr Rossier explained, adding one bowl was taken to a Hong Kong auction house by the three men. Stewart Ahearne left his passport details as they sold the item, the prosecutor added.
A second item, a vase, was recovered in central London as part of an undercover sting operation with Metropolitan Police officers posing as art buyers a year after the heist.
The third plundered artefact, a wine cup, has never been recovered.
Around 3.5m Swiss francs (Â£3.2m) worth of damage was caused to the Museum of Far Eastern Art which is based in a listed townhouse in Geneva's old town.
On Monday, Louis Ahearne said he carried out the burglary in order to ""clear a debt"" and Stewart Ahearne said he took ""full responsibility"" explaining he wanted to ""protect"" his younger brother.
Mr Rossier said the prosecution doubted the brothers' version of events as the third person was not in the court and is currently the subject of extradition proceedings to Japan.
The court also heard from Loris Bertoliatti, representing the Museum of Far Eastern Art, who said damage caused by a power saw, sledgehammer and crowbar cost the institution millions.
""They are a professional gang,"" he said. ""They were determined to sell the items. The victim is the museum. Lots of people were shocked by what happened.""
Stewart Ahearne's partner Nicola Barry was called as a witness on Monday and described the father-of-five as a ""kind, loving and nice person"" - adding his employer has committed to giving him a job when he is freed.
The brothers' mother, Suzanne Ahearne, said Louis Ahearne is a ""compassionate and empathetic"" person who had an ""unhappy childhood"".
She told the court since his extradition from the UK, he has been writing to his nine-year-old son from prison in Switzerland trying to ""give the guidance he never got"" from his father.
The Ahearnes' defence barristers will also provide mitigation before the president of the court Patrick Monney delivers his judgement.
The hearing continues.

RIISLN6RWM_6XBEF2BNO4Y91CQ,Namibia criticises German support for Israel over ICJ genocide case,By Danai Nesta Kupemba,7 days ago,20240114,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67974067,"Namibia has condemned former colonial ruler Germany for rejecting a case at the UN's top court accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.
Germany has offered to intervene on Israel's behalf in the case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.
President Hage Geingob urged Germany to ""reconsider its untimely decision to intervene as a third-party in defence"".
In 2021 Berlin acknowledged committing genocide in Namibia.
German colonisers massacred more than 70,000 Herero and Nama people between 1904 and 1908. Historians consider this to be the 20th Century's first genocide.
President Geingob said Germany could not ""morally express commitment to the United Nations Convention against genocide, including atonement for the genocide in Namibia"" and at the same time support Israel.
""The German Government is yet to fully atone for the genocide it committed on Namibian soil,"" he added.
On Friday the German government said the accusation of genocide against Israel was completely unfounded and amounted to a ""political instrumentalisation"" of the UN genocide convention.
""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Holocaust, the government sees itself as particularly committed to the genocide convention,"" it said.
It said Hamas - which attacked Israel on 7 October, triggering the current war - aimed to destroy Israel, which was acting in self defence.
Hamas killed about 1,300 people, most of them civilians, and took about 240 others hostage on 7 October.
Since then Israel has killed nearly 24,000 people, mostly children and women, in its retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The UN and humanitarian organisations have warned of the risk of famine in Gaza as well as the spread of disease among displaced people and have urged that more aid be allowed into the territory.
The scale of the Israeli response prompted South Africa to ask the ICJ to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.
Pretoria's case included a litany of alleged Israeli offences, from the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians to the wholesale destruction of Gaza's infrastructure.
Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"" and its legal team was scathing about South Africa's submission, arguing that if anyone was guilty of genocide, it was Hamas.

SEZQOMWRWB_QCSH1Q3M8BQE98E,Pakistan-Iran diplomatic ties restored after missile and drone strikes,By Thomas Mackintosh,1 day ago,20240119,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68033426,"Pakistan and Iran have restored diplomatic ties according to the caretaker prime minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar's office.
It comes after both countries exchanged drone and missile strikes on militant bases on each other's territory.
As a result of the tit-for-tat attacks Iran and Pakistan withdrew their ambassadors from the respective capitals.
Both ambassadors are now expected to return to their posts following talks.
Iran said Thursday's strikes killed nine people in a border village on its territory, including four children. Pakistan said an Iranian attack on Tuesday killed two children.
There has been no immediate comment from Iran on the talks.
Earlier on Friday, Pakistan expressed its willingness to work with Iran on ""all issues"" following a call between their foreign ministers.
""Foreign Minister Jilani expressed Pakistan's readiness to work with Iran on all issues based on spirit of mutual trust and cooperation,"" the Pakistan foreign ministry said.
""They also agreed to de-escalate the situation. The return of ambassadors of the two countries to their respective capitals was also discussed.""
The reciprocal attacks came as tensions in the Middle East are high with several overlapping crises.
Israel is fighting the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza and exchanging fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Meanwhile, Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria are targeting US forces, and the US and UK have struck the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, who have been attacking shipping.
On Thursday, Pakistan's foreign ministry said its strikes around the Iranian city of Saravan had come in light of ""credible intelligence of impending large-scale terrorist activities"".
The ministry added it ""fully respects"" Iran's ""sovereignty and territorial integrity"".
Pakistan's army said the ""precision strikes"" were conducted with drones, rockets and long-range missiles and targeted the Balochistan Liberation Army and the Balochistan Liberation Front.
Both groups are part of a decades-long struggle for greater autonomy in Balochistan, a remote region in south-western Pakistan.

SICP2HB0BS_1VJULSQCMXH2BNQ,Bee-harming neonicotinoid pesticide has emergency approval again,By Malcolm Prior,2 days ago,20240118,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-68025634,"The UK government has given emergency approval for the use of a pesticide banned because of the harm it can cause bees, for the fourth year in a row.
Permission to use the neonicotinoid on sugar beet seeds has been needed despite a vow by the industry to find an alternative by the end of 2023.
The Wildlife Trusts said the decision was a ""deathblow"" for wildlife.
The government said it was a ""necessary and proportionate measure"" to tackle a damaging crop virus spread by aphids.
It added that the product - which has been banned since 2018 - can only be used if an independent, scientifically-verified level of threat posed by the disease, Virus Yellows, is met in March.
That threshold will be a 65% infection across the national sugar beet crop.
The NFU said the Virus Yellows disease had already caused sugar beet crop losses of up to 80% in recent years and threatened an industry with more than 9,500 jobs.
Sugar-beet farmer Michael Sly, who has land across north Cambridgeshire and south Lincolnshire and is the chair of the NFU's sugar board, said he was ""relieved"" the derogation had been granted.
He said farmers would ""ensure safe and responsible use of the treatment"" if the pesticide had to be used.
""The homegrown sugar industry is working hard to find viable, long-term solutions to this disease,"" he added.
Environmental and wildlife campaigners warned that the neonicotinoid - a seed treatment called thiamethoxam - disrupts bees' ability to navigate and reproduce.
Barnaby Coupe, land use policy manager at The Wildlife Trusts, said the decision to authorise its use was ""a deathblow for wildlife, a backwards step in evidence-based decision making, and a betrayal of farmers who are producing food sustainably"".
Richard Benwell, CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of environmental and rural campaign groups, said the decision ""flies in the face of ecological sense"".
Back in 2020, British Sugar - which supplies 60% of the UK's sugar - had told the government that in three years it would have developed alternatives to the seed treatment.
Dan Green, the company's agriculture director, told the BBC that research was continuing and included ""research into how the industry can benefit from gene editing"".
The company hopes Virus Yellows resistant crops will be available commercially by 2026.
Farming Minister Mark Spencer said his decision had been based on robust scientific assessment with the risk evaluated ""very carefully"".
""We recognise the damaging impact that an outbreak of beet yellow virus could have on farmer livelihoods. We therefore regard issuing an emergency authorisation as a necessary and proportionate measure,"" he added.

XVER5VHG5D_BBK7K0T2A17JR4E,FM calls for UK parliament recall over Yemen air strikes,_,12 January,20240112,bbc.co.uk,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-67956866,"Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf has called for the UK parliament to be recalled over the air strikes in Yemen.
The UK and US strikes against Houthi rebel sites have been described by Rishi Sunak as ""necessary and proportionate"" to protect the global shipping in the Red Sea.
The targeted strikes on military facilities took place overnight.
Humza Yousaf said there were ""significant questions"" to be asked and answered about military action.
He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Let there be no equivocation that the SNP align ourselves with the UN security resolution, which is essentially calling for the Houthi rebels to stop their attacks in the Red Sea.
""But of course the UK's record on military intervention, particularly in the Middle East, is not a good one.
""Before action was taken, the correct and appropriate thing to have done would have been to have recalled parliament, who have given serious detail about any proposed military action.""
He added: ""There are significant questions around the action taken. What is the end goal? What will be deemed as a success?""
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the strikes against the Iranian-backed group, who he accuses of threatening UK ships, was in ""self-defence"".
In response, Houthi officials have warned that the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"".
The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea last year.
The Houthis control much of Yemen and say they are supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel.
More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said.
Mr Sunak accused the Houthi rebels of threatening UK and international ships and causing major disruption to the trade route.
""Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week, "" the prime minister said.
""This cannot stand. The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade.""
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones.
Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"".
The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel.
Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf's wife, Nadia El-Nakla, has confirmed her sister-in-law and her four children had escaped Gaza.
Her brother is a doctor at Al-Nassar Hospital. He is still in the territory with other relatives.
Ms El-Nakla's parents returned to Scotland in November after being trapped in Gaza for four weeks when the war with Israel broke out during a family visit.
In a statement she said: ""I'm pleased that my sister-in-law, Doaa, and their four children have escaped from Gaza, and are now safe.
""However, my brother Mohamed remains there along with my 93-year-old grandmother and many wider family members.""
Ms El Nakla, who is a Dundee councillor, said families in Gaza were ""still suffering after the loss of entirely innocent men, women and children"".
She urged the UK government to launch a resettlement scheme for Palestinians, similar to the Ukraine Family Scheme visa.
She added: ""I will continue to raise my voice to stop the killing and suffering of the innocent people of Gaza, and call for an immediate and urgent ceasefire.""
A UK government spokesperson said: ""Over 300 British nationals and their dependants have so far left Gaza, and we are working around the clock to get the rest of those out who want to leave.
""We have a team on the ground in Cairo and at the Rafah crossing as required to provide consular assistance.
""Any dependants of British citizens who need a visa can apply for one.
More than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
During the initial Hamas attacks on Israel some 1,300 people were killed - mainly civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage."

US officials say warship-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles and fighter jets hit 16 sites, including in the capital, Sanaa, and Hudaydah, the Houthi Red Sea port stronghold.
The strikes are in response to repeated attacks by the Iran-backed group on commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
The Houthis, who back Hamas, said at least five of their number were killed.
The group claims to be targeting ships linked to Israel - saying the attacks are in response to Israel's campaign in the Gaza Strip - and have also launched a series of drones and missiles towards Israel.
The Houthi targets in Yemen early on Friday included logistical hubs, air defence systems and arms depots, US officials told the Associated Press news agency.
US President Joe Biden, quoted by Reuters news agency, said the US and UK military had successfully launched strikes against Houthi targets with support from countries including Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.
""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,"" Mr Biden said.
He added that he ""will not hesitate"" to order further military action if necessary.
Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said in response that there was ""absolutely no justification"" for the attacks and that the group would continue to target Israeli ships.
Iran and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah - both Houthi allies - have also condemned the strikes.
These are the first such actions by the US military in the Red Sea since the Houthi drone and missile attacks on shipping began in November.
The Houthis, who control a large part of Yemen, have been targeting merchant vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden with missiles and drones - putting lives at risk, threatening the global economy and destabilising the region.
Four RAF Typhoon jets flying from Akrotiri in Cyprus also conducted air strikes on two Houthi targets in Yemen using Paveway bombs, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale reports.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the strikes in a statement on Friday morning, calling them ""limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence"".
Mr Sunak denounced the ""reckless actions"" of the Houthi militia, who he said had carried out a series of ""dangerous and destabilising attacks"" against commercial shipping in the Red Sea despite repeated warnings from the international community.
He added that the UK would ""always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade"".
On 9 January, HMS Diamond, along with US warships, successfully repelled the largest attack from the Houthis in the Red Sea to date. On the same day, the Houthis said they targeted a US ship providing support to Israel - the 26th attack on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November.
Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have increased 500% between November and December. The threat has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December.
The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead.

A6LEPTA5MN_SFH9XNHOWNBJ9FH,Boeing seeks Ryanair support with checks after mid-air blowout,By Katy Austin,4 days ago,20240116,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67994140,"Boeing has asked Ryanair to send extra engineers to oversee quality checks of its planes ""on the ground"" following the Alaska Airlines incident.
Ryanair's boss told the BBC that quality was improving but the incident had shown there was ""more to be done"".
It comes after an unused door fell off a Boeing 737 Max 9 operated by US-based Alaska Airlines.
Ryanair does not use Boeing's 737 Max 9 aircraft but operates the Max 8 variant and has Max 10s on order.
The airline is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the 737 Max family, with more than 100 in service and due to have some 400 more by 2034.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said that he expects delivery delays to affect its capacity.
Asked in an interview with the BBC if he had complete confidence in Boeing's quality control processes after the incident which saw an unused door fall off, the Ryanair boss said ""no"".
But he added that his airline did now have ""more confidence"" in plane maker Boeing.
Mr O'Leary also said that a delivery of 12 planes towards the end of last year had been ""in terms of defects the best deliveries we've had in three years"".
He acknowledged what happened with the Alaska Airlines flight had been serious but said the industry always learned from incidents.
Ryanair will deploy more engineers to oversee quality control at US factories in Seattle and Wichita building aircraft and fuselages for the airline.
Mr O'Leary said that Boeing made good planes, but compared the relationship to a marriage: ""I can be in love with you and still occasionally criticise some of your personal habits. I think that's the same with Boeing.""
He suggested that the management team at Boeing ""needs to be improved"" following the incident, although he gave his support for Boeing's current chief executive David Calhoun, stating that he is ""doing a stellar job in very tough circumstances"".
Mr O'Leary added: ""We don't need more senior management changes in Boeing.""
On Monday, Boeing announced that an outside party would also be brought in to assess its production practices.
It will also check the work of the firm that supplies and installs the parts involved in the accident.
Last week, the US regulator extended the grounding of 737 Max's with similar fuselage panels, while United and Alaska Airlines have said they were extending the cancellations of any flights involving the 737 Max 9 through until Wednesday.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also said it would conduct an audit of the plane's production line, adding it believed there were ""significant problems"" with the 737 Max 9 jet as well as ""other manufacturing problems"".
Announcing the latest measures, Stan Deal, who heads up Boeing's commercial division, said the company was ""not where we need to be"".
Scrutiny of Boeing has been renewed after the blowout on the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to California, which forced an emergency landing but resulted in no serious injuries.
The US aerospace giant has been struggling to restore confidence after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different plane in the 737 Max group killed 346 people.
Poor design of a piece of its flight control system was found to play a role in those crashes, and authorities grounded its popular 737 Max planes globally for more than 18 months. Poor oversight by the FAA was also cited.
On Tuesday, Boeing also announced that it had appointed Kirkland H. Donald, a former Navy admiral, as the independent advisor responsible for overseeing a review of its quality control systems for its commercial aircraft.
He and a range of experts will provide Boeing bosses, including Mr Calhoun, with a series of recommendations.

BP3F1HBNVD_FOKDFQYMAE9JW2O,Two British brothers 'should be banned from Switzerland' for museum heist,By Thomas Mackintosh,5 days ago,20240116,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67988451,"Prosecutors have called for two British brothers to be banned from Switzerland for five years as punishment for their role in raiding a museum of iconic Chinese Ming Dynasty artefacts.
At a court in Geneva on Monday, Stewart and Louis Ahearne confessed to being part of a gang which burgled the Museum of Far Eastern Art in June 2019.
On top of the ban, prosecutor Marco Rossier said the court should jail the brothers for four years.
They will be sentenced on Tuesday.
Mr Rossier told the court the brothers, who are from south-east London - and a third man named in court by lawyers as Daniel Kelly - were all ""equally involved"" in the burglary.
He said Louis Ahearne carried out reconnaissance of the museum, while his older brother Stewart hired a Renault Captur car out in his name - which he then drove to and from the scene of the crime.
""Louis Ahearne booked the hotel room, the ski masks and clothing used in the burglary,"" Mr Rossier said.
""Everything was prepared and organised. Everything was very quick.""
Two bowls and a vase from the 14th Century were taken in the raid, Mr Rossier explained, adding one bowl was taken to a Hong Kong auction house by the three men. Stewart Ahearne left his passport details as they sold the item, the prosecutor added.
A second item, a vase, was recovered in central London as part of an undercover sting operation with Metropolitan Police officers posing as art buyers a year after the heist.
The third plundered artefact, a wine cup, has never been recovered.
Around 3.5m Swiss francs (Â£3.2m) worth of damage was caused to the Museum of Far Eastern Art which is based in a listed townhouse in Geneva's old town.
On Monday, Louis Ahearne said he carried out the burglary in order to ""clear a debt"" and Stewart Ahearne said he took ""full responsibility"" explaining he wanted to ""protect"" his younger brother.
Mr Rossier said the prosecution doubted the brothers' version of events as the third person was not in the court and is currently the subject of extradition proceedings to Japan.
The court also heard from Loris Bertoliatti, representing the Museum of Far Eastern Art, who said damage caused by a power saw, sledgehammer and crowbar cost the institution millions.
""They are a professional gang,"" he said. ""They were determined to sell the items. The victim is the museum. Lots of people were shocked by what happened.""
Stewart Ahearne's partner Nicola Barry was called as a witness on Monday and described the father-of-five as a ""kind, loving and nice person"" - adding his employer has committed to giving him a job when he is freed.
The brothers' mother, Suzanne Ahearne, said Louis Ahearne is a ""compassionate and empathetic"" person who had an ""unhappy childhood"".
She told the court since his extradition from the UK, he has been writing to his nine-year-old son from prison in Switzerland trying to ""give the guidance he never got"" from his father.
The Ahearnes' defence barristers will also provide mitigation before the president of the court Patrick Monney delivers his judgement.
The hearing continues.

Deborah Harrington, an obstetrician who has been working at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah with the British charity Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP), said the fighting meant there has been ""a real decrease"" in the number of staff able to work at the facility over the past two weeks.
At the same time, she said some 600 to 700 patients were still being treated inside the hospital daily, and that hundreds of displaced people were sheltering there or in the immediate vicinity.
""Without any functioning or sufficient healthcare staff, it will be an unmitigated disaster for those people living in Middle Gaza,"" another member of the team, surgeon Nick Maynard, told the BBC.
When asked about the reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC: ""The forces closest to there are 1.5km (0.9 miles) away and there is no activity there.""
Hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law. Any military operation around hospitals must take steps to spare patients, medical staff and other civilians inside them.
On Sunday, MAP and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) announced that their staff had been ""forced to withdraw and cease activities"" as a result of what they called ""increasing Israeli military activity around the al-Aqsa Hospital"".
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it had ""received troubling reports of increasing hostilities and ongoing evacuation orders near the vital al-Aqsa hospital... which according to the facility's director forced over 600 patients and most health workers to leave"".
He stated that al-Aqsa was ""the most important hospital remaining in Gaza's Middle Area and must remain functional, and protected, to deliver its lifesaving services"".
""Further erosion of its functionality cannot be permitted - doing so in the face of such trauma, injury and humanitarian suffering would be a moral and medical outrage,"" he warned.
Speaking to the BBC from Cairo airport, Mr Maynard, a senior surgeon and clinical lead with MAP who worked at al-Aqsa's surgical unit for two weeks, said he and his team were told to evacuate from Gaza last Friday.
""I was operating on a serious blast injury during the day, and at about 15:00 I finished in theatres to come out to find that there had been an attack on the intensive care unit (ICU)."" He added: ""We were told we had to leave.""
Two other doctors said they had been told of an incident at the ICU, and had later seen pictures shared on social media of a bullet embedded into the ICU building's wall - but none of them witnessed the incident themselves.
The BBC was not able to verify the reports. Asked about the incident specifically, the IDF said it was ""not aware of an air strike regarding the incident in question"".
Another doctor placed at al-Aqsa with MAP, James Smith, told the BBC that he had heard gunfire on several days.
""It's worth stressing that the sound would travel, so it was maybe 1km or 2km (0.6-1.2 miles) away,"" he said, adding that it could occasionally be heard from the hospital courtyard.
Shelling was reported in the vicinity of the hospital on Tuesday, the UN said.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza also reported that 57 dead and 65 injured people had been brought to al-Aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours but provided no further details.
And on Wednesday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said six people had been killed in an Israeli strike that targeted an ambulance on the outskirts of Deir al-Balah. Four of those killed were PRCS team members while the two others were in the ambulance at the time, it added.
The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the strike was in the vicinity of al-Aqsa hospital and that a journalist was also among the dead.
The IDF said in a statement on Thursday that ""a review was conducted based on the details provided to the IDF which shows that no strike was carried out in the described area"". ""The IDF is committed to international law and takes all feasible measures in order to mitigate civilian harm,"" it added.
The BBC has verified footage posted on social media in recent days, in which plumes of smoke and the sound of gunshots can be heard in the surrounding area - though we could not verify where the shots were coming from and who was firing.
Pictures posted on social media also showed leaflets apparently dropped by the IDF, which warned residents of several neighbourhoods to the north that they were now in a ""dangerous combat zone"" and called on them to urgently evacuate for their own safety. They did not include the area directly around al-Aqsa hospital.
The doctors the BBC spoke to also said they were told about the leaflets, but had not seen them themselves.
Sean Casey, a WHO emergency medical teams co-ordinator who visited al-Aqsa hospital on the weekend, said the facility was now near an evacuation zone.
The IDF said ""no specific evacuation notice had been given to"" al-Aqsa.
Dr Harrington said two nurses who worked at al-Aqsa's emergency room had been killed in the last two weeks as a result of fighting, while another staff member who had already been displaced once had her house bombed.
Dr Smith said: ""Many Palestinian healthcare workers have expressed that they have felt that it is too unsafe to go back to the hospital.
""Certainly some people I've been in touch with haven't gone back since Friday.""
He added that he and his colleagues remained concerned for those still in the hospital.
""There are many patients who physically cannot move, the elderly, people with disabilities, many patients on the neo-natal unit, many people recovering post-operative care who cannot move, and thousands of internally displaced people living within the hospital compound or in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.""
Some people may find the details and image below distressing. The text graphically describes fatal injuries suffered by children brought to the hospital.
The three doctors from the UK said they witnessed ""horrific"" injuries and challenging conditions inside al-Aqsa hospital.
""We had no running water in theatres, so we had no ability to scrub up and wash,"" Mr Maynard said of the surgical unit. ""We just had to use alcohol gel before operating.""
""There were no drapes to cover the patients in theatres, so we had to use makeshift gowns to try to keep the patients sterile and clean.
""Instruments were limited, there were very limited sutures for stitching,"" he added.
Recalling what the emergency room was like to work in, Dr Harrington said: ""There were often no trolleys, so we were managing patients on the floor, which is filthy, which is cold.
""Sometimes oxygen tubing couldn't even reach those patients. We were putting in chest drains in completely unsanitary conditions, affording patients no dignity.""
She said there was often no morphine or other pain relief.
""I can't get out of my mind - a child came in alive, literally burnt to the bone, their hands were contracting. Their face was just charcoal, and they were alive and talking. And we had no morphine,"" she said.
""I won't be able to wipe that memory and the smell, being treated on the floor.""
Dr Smith, an emergency doctor, also described how many patients arrived with ""horrific, traumatic injuries"", ranging from burns to amputations and serious shrapnel injuries.
""We saw people with traumatic amputations. I saw a child, around one year old, who had had two limbs traumatically amputated, and the other two were severely damaged.""
The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in an update that ""intense Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea"" continued across much of Gaza on Tuesday, particularly in the Deir al-Balah southern Khan Younis areas.
""The offensive in these areas results in the killing and injury of many people and having devastating consequences for tens of thousands of civilians, many of whom had already fled for safety from Gaza City and the north to central and southern Gaza,"" it warned.
Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group.
It says it tries to avoid harm to civilians and blames Hamas for embedding fighters among them.
The war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage.
More than 23,350 people have been killed in Gaza - mostly children and women - during the 13 weeks of fighting since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

FZ3KFZZI8Y_27OE7RUFNBUCAPN,Comoros President Azali Assoumani wins fourth term in disputed poll,By Gloria Aradi,3 days ago,20240117,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68002934,"Comoros President Azali Assoumani has been re-elected for a fourth term in a poll disputed by the opposition as ""fraudulent"".
He secured the win with 63% of the vote, the electoral body Ceni said.
However, turnout was low amid an opposition boycott - just 16% of people voted in the presidential election.
After the results were announced, security forces clashed with protesters in several parts of the capital, Moroni.
The house of a former minister was set on fire, while demonstrators blocked roads, the AFP news agency reports.
Opposition candidates alleged instances of ballot stuffing in favour of Mr Assoumani and that polls had closed early, according to the Reuters news agency.
Mr Assoumani's campaign team has denied the opposition's claims.
Six candidates ran in the 14 January presidential election in the Indian Ocean archipelago.
""We cannot talk about results because there was no election,"" Mouigni Baraka Said Soilihi, one of Mr Assoumani's opponents, was quoted as saying by Reuters.
International poll observers have said that voting was largely free and fair despite the irregularities reported by the opposition.
According to the election commission, 189,000 voters went to the polls, but only 55,259 - just 16% of registered voters - took part in the presidential election.
The dismal turnout followed calls for a boycott by some opposition candidates, prompting some voters to only participate in the gubernatorial elections held at the same time.
More than 330,000 people were registered to vote, out of a population the World Bank estimates at 836,000.
Mr Assoumani is a former military officer who first came to power through a coup in 1999 and won his first election in 2002.
He exited politics in 2006, before making a comeback with a presidential win in 2016.
He was able to seek a fourth term after a controversial referendum removed presidential term limits in 2018, leading to widespread protests in the country.
Mr Assoumani's rule has been marred by controversy, with critics accusing him of jailing and exiling his opponents.
He is the current chairperson of the African Union.

FZBZ75W2ZS_1HR1QNNO9WERAXZ,Aptamil baby milk: Big supermarkets cut price of formula,By Sam Gruet,5 days ago,20240115,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67986236,"Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have joined Iceland in cutting the cost of Aptamil baby formula.
It comes after manufacturer Danone cut the price it charges retailers for the majority of its baby milk range by 7%.
Asda said from Monday its customers would also be able to pay for formula using rewards scheme vouchers for the first time.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said prices for baby formula milk had risen by a quarter in two years.
The regulator found competition was hampered because shoppers were reluctant to switch brands, either because they were recommended by friends and family or because their baby would only drink one.
There are rules banning retailers from advertising discounts on infant formula - for babies up to six months - because it might discourage breastfeeding.
In August Iceland called on the government to ""immediately"" update existing legislation so that retailers were allowed to tell the public when they reduce the price of formula.
The supermarket said at the time it still endorsed breastfeeding, yet rising costs were ""placing unbearable pressure on parents who choose to or have no alternative"" to using formula milk.
Iceland was the first supermarket to announce a price reduction, saying Danone's cuts would be reflected in its stores. Asda said it would continue to work with its manufacturing partners to make sure price reductions were passed on to customers.
Kris Comerford, Asda's chief commercial officer, said the supermarket understood that baby formula was a ""vital necessity"" for many.
He said: ""Whilst we respect the regulations in place regarding the sale of baby formula, we want to do everything we can to help families manage their budget and keep their family fed.""
A Sainsbury's spokesperson said the supermarket was passing on cost savings to customers.
In November, the CMA found just two suppliers accounted for 85% of infant formula sales and there was ""very limited availability"" of cheaper own-brand alternatives.
New parents could make significant savings of Â£500 in the first year of a baby's life on formula milk products by shopping around, the CMA added.
Danone told the BBC it would ""continue to engage"" with the CMA investigation.
The rise in costs has correlated with a spike in formula thefts as part of a surge of shoplifting during the cost of living crisis.
Only one UK retailer, Aldi, sells its own brand. Lidl did not immediately reply to a request to comment.

QJ316K2IQ9_G26P679O9PL32PE,Namibia criticises German support for Israel over ICJ genocide case,By Danai Nesta Kupemba,7 days ago,20240114,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67974067,"Namibia has condemned former colonial ruler Germany for rejecting a case at the UN's top court accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza.
Germany has offered to intervene on Israel's behalf in the case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.
President Hage Geingob urged Germany to ""reconsider its untimely decision to intervene as a third-party in defence"".
In 2021 Berlin acknowledged committing genocide in Namibia.
German colonisers massacred more than 70,000 Herero and Nama people between 1904 and 1908. Historians consider this to be the 20th Century's first genocide.
President Geingob said Germany could not ""morally express commitment to the United Nations Convention against genocide, including atonement for the genocide in Namibia"" and at the same time support Israel.
""The German Government is yet to fully atone for the genocide it committed on Namibian soil,"" he added.
On Friday the German government said the accusation of genocide against Israel was completely unfounded and amounted to a ""political instrumentalisation"" of the UN genocide convention.
""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Holocaust, the government sees itself as particularly committed to the genocide convention,"" it said.
It said Hamas - which attacked Israel on 7 October, triggering the current war - aimed to destroy Israel, which was acting in self defence.
Hamas killed about 1,300 people, most of them civilians, and took about 240 others hostage on 7 October.
Since then Israel has killed nearly 24,000 people, mostly children and women, in its retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The UN and humanitarian organisations have warned of the risk of famine in Gaza as well as the spread of disease among displaced people and have urged that more aid be allowed into the territory.
The scale of the Israeli response prompted South Africa to ask the ICJ to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.
Pretoria's case included a litany of alleged Israeli offences, from the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians to the wholesale destruction of Gaza's infrastructure.
Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"" and its legal team was scathing about South Africa's submission, arguing that if anyone was guilty of genocide, it was Hamas.

UWPBLHZ252_2VLNQ2R380V6WVX,Nauru cuts diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of China,By Kelly Ng,6 days ago,20240115,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67978185,"One of Taiwan's last diplomatic allies has cut ties with the island in favour of Beijing, just days after a new president was voted in in Taipei.
Nauru, a tiny Micronesian island, was just one of 12 countries that kept diplomatic ties with Taipei.
But in recent years, Beijing - which insists Taiwan is part of China - has been poaching its diplomatic allies.
Taiwan suggests this latest loss is related to the weekend's election results, which angered China.
The election saw voters pick pro-sovereignty candidate William Lai as their next president, a man Beijing has labelled a ""troublemaker"" over remarks he made in the past supporting Taiwanese independence, which it sees as a red line.
""This timing is not only China's retaliation against our democratic elections but also a direct challenge to the international order,"" Taiwanese officials said after Nauru's government announced it would ""no longer recognise [Taiwan] as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China's territory"".
In a media conference on Monday, Taipei's deputy foreign minister Tien Chung-kwang accused China of taking advantage of recent ""political fluctuations"" in Nauru to ""buy over"" the country with financial aid.
""China thinks it can suppress Taiwan with such methods, I think it is wrong. The world has noticed Taiwan's democratic development. If [Beijing] continues to use such despicable methods to seize Taiwan's diplomatic relations, democratic countries all over the world will not recognise it,"" Mr Tien said.
Still, his ministry remains ""on strong alert"" to combat further moves from China to isolate Taiwan on an international stage, he said.
China - which sees the self-ruled island of 23 million as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - welcomed Nauru's decision.
""The decision of the government of Nauru to resume diplomatic relations with China fully demonstrates once again that the one-China principle is the will of the people and the trend of the times,"" China's foreign ministry said.
This is not the first time Nauru has cut ties with Taiwan, which considers itself distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders.
In 2002, Nauru made a similar diplomatic switch to China - it later restored relations with Taiwan in May 2005.
Analysts said the move by Nauru was not unexpected.
""The likelihood that Nauru would switch recognition from Taiwan to China has been on the cards for a while,"" said Anna Powles, associate professor in security studies at New Zealand's Massey University.
The speed at which Australia pursued a treaty offering climate refuge to Tuvalu citizens late last year reflected concerns that Tuvalu, another Pacific nation, was ""under pressure to switch recognition to China"", Ms Powles said.
""These concerns extended to Nauru,"" she said.
""China is always looking to erode Taiwan's influence, especially in the Pacific, where many small nations are looking for development gains,"" said Mihai Sora, a research fellow in the Pacific Islands Program at Lowy Institute, a think tank based in Australia.
""As Taiwan has fewer diplomatic allies around the world, each one becomes more important in its claim to sovereignty... And it is quite possible that China will continue to look for opportunities to erode that.""

W7VU6ANF0U_FNUY3VO94SQWM4Y,Japan Airlines appoints ex-flight attendant as first female president,By Oliver Slow,3 days ago,20240118,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68015617,"Japan Airlines has named a woman as its next president for the first time, a rare appointment for a major Japanese firm - and global airline.
Mitsuko Tottori joined the flag carrier as a flight attendant in 1985, before working her way up.
She said she hoped her promotion would give other women the courage to pursue the next step in their careers.
Despite some improvements, very few major airlines have women in senior leadership positions.
Ms Tottori will replace Yuji Akasaka as president on 1 April. Mr Akasaka will replace Yoshiharu Ueki as chairman, the airline's most senior position.
The appointments come weeks after a Japan Airlines plane crashed with a smaller coastguard aircraft at Tokyo's Haneda Airport.
A ""miraculous"" evacuation ensured all 379 passengers and crew on board the jet survived, but five of the six crew on the coastguard plane died.
Ms Tottori - who worked in frontline roles before becoming a director for cabin crew in 2015 - said she would prioritise safety.
""I have spent most of my career at the frontline of safety and customer services - that is the cabinet attendants' division,"" she told a press conference.
""Operational safety is the foundation of airlines. I will continue to demonstrate my firm commitment to this principle,"" she said.
She also said there were women struggling to progress in their career, and hoped her appointment ""can encourage them, or give them the courage to take the next step"".
A survey by the aviation specialist website FlightGlobal found that, at the end of 2022 there were 12 women leading the top 100 airlines, up from six a year earlier.
They include Marjan Rintel at Dutch carrier KLM, Annette Mann at Austrian Airlines and Aer Lingus's Lynne Embleton.
Earlier this month, Joanna Geraghty was appointed chief executive of JetBlue Airways, becoming the first female to head a major airline in the United States.
It is also rare for women to lead major companies in Japan.
The government wants a third of leadership positions at major businesses to go to women by 2030, after failing to achieve the goal by 2020.
It is also urging businesses to appoint at least one woman as an executive by 2025.
Women held 13.2% of management positions in Japan in 2021, the lowest among the members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The trend suggested ""a serious misallocation of human resources,"" the OECD said.

WPGIATAFFS_FXGMFX4TIPX7EWM,Iran's sudden strikes show just how perilous region has become,By Lyse Doucet,1 day ago,20240120,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68017444,"These are shape-shifting times in the Middle East.
This week, out of the blue, Iran suddenly attacked targets in ""friendly"" Pakistan, sparking an unprecedented tit-for-tat across their volatile border and a sharp spike in tension on a far edge of the grievous Israel-Gaza war.
Iran wanted a message to be heard loud and clear - at home, and a long way beyond.
""It has showcased its missile arsenal and its willingness to use it,"" says Vali Nasr, professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University.
""It was a message also likely intended for Israel and the US in the midst of the Gaza war, especially with the potential escalation in Lebanon and Yemen.""
Like most observers, he believes ""for now Iran is not looking to escalate"".
Ever since the Gaza war exploded after Hamas's murderous 7 October assault on southern Israel, it has been darkened by fears of an even more dangerous contagion. No-one, including Iran and its principal partner Hezbollah, as well as the United States, wants to see an even hotter conflagration.
Iran's war has been a web of shadow wars. It sits at the fulcrum of what it calls an ""axis of resistance"", the alliance of Tehran-backed groups dotting the region, from Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, to the Houthis in Yemen, and well-armed groups in both Iraq and Syria. Most have been designated as terrorist entities by some Western states.
Their military prowess is rooted in Iran's accelerated arming and training; each actor also has agendas and ambitions of its own.
Fires have been burning on all these fronts, and sometimes blazing, with efforts to douse the flames lest they provoke crippling Israeli and American reprisals.
When Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) carried out these first direct strikes since this crisis erupted, they trained their sights on Pakistan and two other friendly countries. They may have seen them as areas of least resistance beyond the highly combustible landscape of their ""axis of resistance"".
Iran's elite force unleashed a barrage of ballistic missiles and suicide drones against what it called an intelligence centre for Israel's Mossad spy agency in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, and at ""anti-Iran terror groups"" including Islamic State in rebel-controlled swathes of Syria.
Each operation was said to have its own specific retaliatory rationale.
Iran says it had to aim fire at Iranian Baloch separatists operating in restive southwest Pakistan.
""An attack was imminent. They had gathered and were leaving the base,"" says Prof Seyed Mohammad Marandi at the University of Tehran. He also points to last month's killing of 11 Iranian police officers in its tense province of Sistan and Balochistan.
Pakistan also spoke of an ""impending attack"" when it then fired its own salvos two days later into southern Iran against what it said were bases of its own Baloch nationalists, which it called ""terrorist targets"". This cross-border tension has simmered for decades; this is its worst moment.
Northern Iraq and Syria, closer to the Gaza epicentre, were about settling separate scores.
""The attacks in Iraq and Syria were retaliation for the general as well as the atrocity in Kerman,"" explains Prof Marandi. He's referring to last month's assassination just outside Damascus of one of the IRGC's most senior men, Sayyed Razi Mousavi, which was widely reported as the work of an Israeli air strike.
Then, earlier this month, a double suicide bombing shattered a memorial service in Iran for Qasem Soleimani, the top commander assassinated by an American drone in Iraq four years ago. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the deadliest attack in Iran since the 1979 revolution.
""Iran has been under pressure to react, including to the killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah commanders in Lebanon, but it doesn't want to get directly embroiled in any escalation by hitting Israel or the US,"" says Mohammad Ali Shabani, editor of Amwaj media, which provides in-depth analyses of the region.
""We are going to continue to see a slow boil,"" he says.
These are also tough times at home for Iran's ruling clerics. They've faced unprecedented women-led protests over social freedoms and more, as well as financial woes stemming from international sanctions, alleged corruption, and mismanagement.
And there has been blowback after these latest operations, with angry denunciations from Iraq, as well as the Arab League, and an even more forceful rebuke from Pakistan.
""They did not think through that striking in Pakistan territory could just have no repercussions,"" remarks former Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar. ""Their action created a crater of distrust. It will take hard work and persistence to fill.""
There are wars within wars in every corner of this conflict. Pakistan also had to be seen to be setting its own red lines in a neighbourhood where age-old rival India, as well as Taliban-run Afghanistan, were watching closely. Accusations and more of harbouring hostile forces have long been hurled across those borders too.
This past week has been a reminder, if one was needed, of the unpredictability and peril in this moment of a widening and worsening Israel-Gaza war.
Any day can be a flare-up on one or multiple fronts - and there are the longer-term risks being shaped in a region where fault lines were deeply and darkly etched long before Hamas's 7 October attacks.
Israel's largest loss of life in a single day since the founding of its state, as well as the seizing of more than 250 hostages, sparked a military campaign causing a staggering number of civilian deaths and turning much of Gaza into an unliveable wasteland.
It has enraged and emboldened this Iran-backed military alliance of militant non-state actors. They've been drawing closer for years. Now they've forged a far more vocal and visible league.
For Iran's adversaries, the proverbial ""we need to do something about Iran"" may now be even riskier. It may also mean confronting Tehran's staunchest allies across the region.
""Tehran has achieved what the Pentagon calls military 'overmatch' - a level of capability in which a country has weaponry that makes it extremely difficult to check or defeat,"" says Robin Wright, author of several books on Iran and a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars.
This current escalation has not been cost-free. US salvos against Iranian-backed fighters in Iraq are reported to have significantly damaged their infrastructure.
The Pentagon says its air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, in an effort to stop their attacks on vessels in the vital Red Sea shipping lanes, have destroyed a quarter of the Houthi arsenal.
But on the balance sheets of some of Iran's allies, they believe they're winning far more than they're losing. Standing up for Gazans has galvanised their popularity on Arab streets. Yemen's Houthis in particular are relishing being catapulted into the centre of world attention.
Minds are already focused on the ""day after"", when this Israel-Gaza war ends, including in Tehran, which has long prided itself on its ""strategic patience"".
""Iran is playing a broader longer game,"" points out Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House. ""It perhaps anticipates that after Gaza winds down Israel is going to be more provocative towards Iran, so it is preparing for a longer fight.""
Iran's long-term goals include keeping the US out of its backyard, and avoiding a direct confrontation with Israel and America.
That means careful calculations on where and how it strikes in a hazardous region where the risks of miscalculation are always dangerously high.

X5KCFF9WH0_5DLG0TSF147TGP7,Ukraine war: Russian missiles wreck Kharkiv hotel - governor,By Laurence Peter,11 January,20240111,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67942020,"Two Russian missiles have struck a hotel in Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, injuring 11 people, the Kharkiv governor says.
Photos from Ukraine's State Emergency Service showed the hotel heavily damaged and firefighters at the scene.
Governor Oleh Synehubov said the injured included Turkish journalists. Two S-300 missiles struck at about 22:30 (20:30 GMT), he said.
Russia has stepped up air strikes on Ukrainian cities in the past two weeks.
Ukrainian officials say dozens of civilians have died in those attacks from drones and missiles.
Kharkiv, just 30km (19 miles) from the Russian border, has suffered extensive damage from Russian air strikes since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
In the latest strike, nine injured were taken to hospital, including a 35-year-old man in a serious condition, the governor said on the Telegram messaging service.
The city's mayor, Ihor Terekhov, quoted by Ukraine's Unian news agency, said ""there were no military at all"" in the hotel at the time, but 30 civilians were there. It is in the city's central Kyiv district. He said several homes and cars nearby were also damaged.
The Russian city of Belgorod, 74km north of Kharkiv, was hit by Ukrainian missiles and drones on 30 December which Russian officials say killed 25 civilians.
Russia has started moving hundreds of Belgorod children to holiday camps further away from Ukraine for three-week stays. A camp in Voronezh region received 93 on Wednesday and later 280 arrived in Kaluga region, state TV reported, adding that teachers would join them there.
President Volodymyr Zelensky, on a visit to Lithuania on Wednesday, urged Western allies to provide more air defence weapons. The Baltic nation is among the staunchest allies of Ukraine in bolstering Kyiv's resistance to the Russian forces.
""Air defence systems are what we lack the most. The fight against drones. I am happy that we have agreements with Lithuania and many other partners,"" he said in Vilnius. Lithuania and its two Baltic neighbours, Latvia and Estonia, are ex-Soviet states now in the Nato alliance.
In terms of GDP, Lithuania is the biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine, Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy reports. The US contribution to Ukraine's defence is, however, by far the largest.
Mr Zelensky, quoted by Interfax-Ukraine, said Vladimir Putin ""will not calm down until he destroys Ukraine"".
""He wants to fully occupy us. And sometimes our partners' doubts over financial and military assistance to Ukraine, quick reaction, gives courage and strength to the Russian Federation.""
He said the Russian leader ""won't finish this [war], until we all finish him together"" and warned that the Baltic states and Moldova ""may be next"".
In recent days, the Ukrainian leader has held intensive talks with Western allies aimed at maintaining vital arms deliveries. Kyiv's counter-offensive late last year made little progress, and some in the West have questioned Kyiv's strategy, fuelling concern about the cost of the war.
With Russia now committed to much higher military expenditure, Nato countries are struggling to boost production of artillery shells and other heavy weapons.
An EU aid package worth â¬50bn (Â£43bn; $55bn) for Ukraine is stuck because of a Hungarian veto, while the divided US Congress has stalled over a new tranche of military aid.
After a video conference with the Ukrainian government on Wednesday, Nato said it had plans to provide ""billions of euros of further capabilities"" to Ukraine this year.
""Nato strongly condemns Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians, including with weapons from North Korea and Iran,"" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said.

ZQ9HNPSXCN_0B9S2W5YLC7MQO1,British brothers raided Swiss museum 'to clear a debt',By Thomas Mackintosh,6 days ago,20240115,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-67950947,"Two British brothers have admitted raiding a museum in Switzerland and making off with iconic Chinese Ming dynasty era artefacts worth millions in order to ""clear a debt"", a court heard.
Prosecutors said the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva was burgled in June 2019 by a gang of three who used tools to break through the front door.
Two 14th Century vases and a bowl were taken in the heist.
Stewart and Louis Ahearne admitted their involvement at a court in Geneva.
The pair, from south-east London, appeared before a panel of three judges at the Palais de Justice in Geneva on Monday facing charges of theft, trespass and damage to property.
They fought extradition from the UK, but it was approved by the Home Secretary in 2022.
Patrick Monney, the president of the court, rejected a last-minute application for the trial to be heard in private. He added that the court was aware of the facts of the case from reports by the Swiss Prosecutors Office and Geneva Police and explained the purpose of the hearing was to ""ask additional questions"".
The court heard that the two brothers travelled to Hong Kong shortly after the raid to sell one of the stolen items to an auction house for Â£80,000.
Father-of-one Louis Ahearne told the court he came to Geneva days before the raid to carry out reconnaissance.
The 34-year-old to confirmed he went to ""film the museum"" and ""took part in the burglary"".
He also admitted giving his passport to the auction house in Hong Kong.
""I was in debt,"" he told the court. ""I was paid to be a front man to clear a debt. In the [CCTV] video I am the third person [going into the museum] with no crowbar and no sledgehammer.""
Throughout the hearing, the brothers insisted they didn't want to name the third person involved.
Stewart Ahearne, 45, told the court he has five children and worked as a tradesman in England. He also admitted to using his name to hire the Renault Captur car, used in the heist, from Avis at Geneva Airport.
He told the court he ""took full responsibility"" for his actions, but denied being involved in any pre-planning of the heist in Geneva.
""I went into the museum. I stole some stuff. Any organisation, anything to do with the artwork I didn't know nothing,"" he said.
He added that he was ""used as a pawn like in a game of chess"" during the heist: ""I was asked to come to Switzerland to do some driving. The story, the scenario changed with the third person. He is not someone you can say no to. He is not a very nice person. My role was I was used.
""I got a phone call telling me my brother was in debt and that I was needed to bring back some stuff. Alarm bells started ringing. My instinct as an older brother was to protect my brother.""
The court heard the three came to Geneva in February 2019. Louis Ahearne said this was for ""tourist"" purposes, but Stewart Ahearne said he ""put two and two together"" after the burglary.
""It was so the third person could do some scouting,"" he added.
He broke down when answering questions about his life in Champ-Dollon prison, saying he spends his time in a cell by himself for 23 hours a day.
The hearing continues.

0X6R5WI92U_GN1APLKPT5SGM4Q,Pakistan condemns deadly Iranian missile strike on its territory as tensions spike across region,"By Jonny Hallam, Asim Khan and Helen Regan, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:15 PM EST, Wed January 17, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/middleeast/iran-missile-attack-pakistan-intl-hnk/,"Pakistan has strongly condemned an Iranian airstrike inside its borders that killed two children, calling it an “unprovoked violation of its airspace” and warning of retaliation.
Iran said it used “precision missile and drone strikes,” to destroy two strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, in the Koh-e-Sabz area of Pakistan’s southwest Balochistan province, according to Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency.
Tuesday’s attack comes after Iran launched missiles in northern Iraq and Syria Monday, in the latest escalation of hostilities in the Middle East where Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza risks spiraling into a wider regional conflict.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said the attack on its territory killed “two innocent children” and warned Iran of “serious consequences.”
It described the airstrike as an “unprovoked violation of its airspace by Iran … inside Pakistani territory.”
“It is even more concerning that this illegal act has taken place despite the existence of several channels of communication between Pakistan and Iran,” the ministry said.
Pakistan on Wednesday recalled its ambassador from Iran and suspended all Iraninan high-level visits.
“Last night’s unprovoked and blatant breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty by Iran is a violation of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,” Mumtaz Baloch, a spokesperson for Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry, said in a televised address.
She said the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan should not return from a current visit to Iran and warned “Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act.”
China urged Iran and Pakistan to exercise restraint in handling their ongoing conflict after the deadly strike. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday called on both countries to “avoid actions that would lead to an escalation of tension and work together to maintain peace and stability in the region.”
A spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs said the strike was “a matter between Iran and Pakistan,” but stressed India has “zero tolerance towards terrorism.”
Iran launches missile strikes in northern Iraq and Syria, claims to destroy Israeli spy base
The Jaish al-Adl militant group late Tuesday said Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had used six attack drones and a number of rockets to destroy two houses where the children and wives of its fighters lived.
Authorities in Balochistan province told CNN two girls had died and at least four people were injured. The girls, aged eight and 12, were killed in houses that were damaged in the attack in the village of Koh-e-Sabz in Kulag, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Panjgur district, on Tuesday evening, according to the district’s deputy commissioner Mumtaz Khetran.
Khetran also said a mosque near the homes was targeted and hit in the strikes.
Koh-e-Sabz — about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Pakistan’s border with Iran — is known to be the home of Jaish al-Adl’s former second-in-command Mullah Hashim, who was killed in clashes with Iranian forces in Sarawan, an Iranian region adjacent to Panjgur, in 2018.
Last month, Iran accused Jaish al-Adl militants of storming a police station in the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchistan, which resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian police officers, according to Tasnim.
Jaish al-Adl, or Army of Justice, is a separatist militant group that operates on both sides of the border and has previously claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian targets. Its stated goal is the independence of Iran’s Sistan and Baluchistan province, which neighbors Pakistan.
On Wednesday, it claimed responsibility for an attack on an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) vehicle in Sistan and Baluchistan that Iranian state media says killed one of its colonels.
Jaish al-Adl said on its official website that it had targeted an IRGC pick-up truck on the outskirts of Iranshahr.
Colonel Hossein Ali Javadanfar was killed in the attack, according to the IRGC’s Sepah news.
CNN cannot independently verify Jaish al-Adl’s claim.
Iran said Wednesday it “only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan” and that “none of the nationals of the friendly country of Pakistan were targeted” in the strike.
“We respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan. But we don’t allow our national security to be compromised and to be played with and we have no reservation when it comes to our national interests,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
The strikes in Pakistan came a day after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards launched ballistic missiles, targeting what it claimed was a spy base for Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad in Erbil, northern Iraq, and at “anti-Iran terror groups” in Syria.
Iran said the strikes in Iraq were in response to what it said were Israeli attacks that killed Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders, and claimed targets in Syria were involved in the recent dual bombings in the city of Kerman during a memorial for the slain Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani that left scores dead and wounded.
It defended the strikes as a “precise and targeted” operation to deter security threats, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement on Tuesday.
Iran’s attacks will further raise fears that Israel’s war in Gaza could widen into a full-scale war in the Middle East with grave humanitarian, political and economic consequences.
The attacks in Iraq and Syria were condemned by the United States as “reckless” and imprecise, while the United Nations said, “security concerns must be addressed through dialogue, not strikes.”
Iraq said it submitted a complaint to the UN Security Council and the UN on Tuesday. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said there are no Mossad-affiliated centers operating in Erbil in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region.
But, speaking to CNN’s Fareed Zakaria at Davos, Iran’s Foreign Minister repeated the country’s claim that the strike on Iraq was a response “against elements and agents of Mossad,” and said Iran has “very good relations” with both Iraq and Pakistan.
“We have talked and agreed for several times on the necessity of fighting terrorism,” he said, adding that the action taken by Iran “targeted Israel that remains a common enemy of both of us,” and that the country would respond to any attack “vigorously.”
He stressed that if Israel’s war in Gaza ends, then other conflicts across the Middle East would too. “If the genocide in Gaza stops, then it will lead to the end of other crises and attacks in the region,” Amir-Abdollahian said.
Israel’s relentless bombing of Gaza in response to Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks has killed more than 24,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, and wrought widespread devastation, as civilians live with the threat of imminent death – either by an airstrike, starvation or disease.
The conflict has escalated hostilities across the region, with Iran’s allies and proxies – the so-called axis of resistance – launching attacks on Israeli forces and its allies.
On Tuesday, the US military launched new strikes against Houthi targets inside Yemen, targeting anti-ship ballistic missiles controlled by the Iran-backed rebel group, a defense official told CNN.
A few hours later, the Houthis launched a missile into international shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea, hitting the M/V Zografia, a Maltese flagged bulk carrier, the official said.
The strikes are at least the third round of attacks the US military has launched against the Houthis’ infrastructure since last Thursday, when American and British conducted a joint operation that targeted command and control nodes and weapons depots used by the Houthis to launch missile and drone attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
US troops in Iraq and Syria have also repeatedly come under rocket and drone attacks from Tehran’s proxies. Last week, the US carried out a strike in Baghdad that killed a leader from an Iran-backed proxy group that Washington blamed for attacks against US personnel in the region.
And fighting has intensified between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah, across the Lebanon border. On Sunday, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah vowed to press on with confrontations with Israeli forces on the Lebanon border until the end of the Israeli offensive in Gaza.

0ZIHR5ORGZ_44HSC1FLW0EF61J,Taiwan voters dismiss China warnings and hand ruling party a historic third consecutive presidential win,"By Eric Cheung, Wayne Chang, Nectar Gan and Jerome Taylor, CNN","6 minute read Updated 4:43 PM EST, Sat January 13, 2024",20240113,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/13/asia/taiwan-presidential-election-results-intl-hnk/,"Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party pulled off a historic third consecutive presidential victory on Saturday as voters shrugged off warnings by China that their re-election would increase the risk of conflict.
Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s current vice president, declared victory on Saturday evening while his two opposition rivals both conceded defeat.
“This is a night that belongs to Taiwan. We managed to keep Taiwan on the map of the world,” Lai told thousands of jubilant supporters at a rally after his win.
“The election has shown the world the commitment of the Taiwanese people to democracy, which I hope China can understand,” he added.
China responded soon after the vote by saying “Taiwan is part of China.”
Lai’s running mate Hsiao Bi-khim, who recently served as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States, was elected Vice President.
The counting of votes has concluded, with Lai – the candidate of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) – receiving just over 40% of the total votes, according to Taiwan’s Central Election Commission (CEC).
Taiwan’s opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party candidate Hou Yu-ih garnered 33.49% of the votes, with Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) candidate Ko Wen-je received 26.45%. More than 14 million people took part, meaning that voter turnout came in at just over 71%.
The boisterous election campaign, an illustration of Taiwan’s vibrant democratic credentials, was fought over a mixture of livelihood issues as well as the thorny question of how to deal with its giant one-party state neighbor, China, which under leader Xi Jinping has grown more powerful and bellicose.
The result shows voters backing the DPP’s view that Taiwan is a de facto sovereign nation that should bolster defenses against China’s threats and deepen relations with fellow democratic countries, even if that means economic punishment or military intimidation by Beijing.
It is also a further snub to eight years of increasingly strongarm tactics towards Taiwan under Xi who has vowed that the island’s eventual “reunification” with the mainland is “a historical inevitability”.
Following Taiwan’s election result, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said no matter “whatever changes take place in Taiwan, the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change.”
The spokesperson continued: “The one-China principle is the solid anchor for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. We believe that the international community will continue to adhere to the one-China principle and understand and support the Chinese people’s just cause of opposing ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities and striving to achieve national reunification.”
A spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office earlier insisted the election result “does not represent the mainstream view on the island.”
Other world powers have congratulated Lai, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying the vote demonstrated “the strength of [Taiwan’s] robust democratic system and electoral process.”
Like outgoing president Tsai Ing-wen, who cannot stand again because of term limits, Lai is openly loathed by China’s Communist Party leaders and his victory is unlikely to lead to any improvement in ties between Beijing and Taipei.
China cut off most communications with Taipei after Tsai took office and ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on the self-ruled island, turning the Taiwan Strait into one of the world’s major geopolitical flash points.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it. While successive Chinese Communist leaders have vowed to eventually achieve “reunification,” Xi has repeatedly said the Taiwan issue “should not be passed down generation after generation,” linking the mission to his mid-century goal of “national rejuvenation.”
The DPP emphasizes that Taiwan is not subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party, and that its future Taiwan must only be decided by its 23.5 million people.
In the run up to Saturday’s vote, Beijing warned Taiwan’s voters to “make the right choice” and “recognize the extreme danger of Lai Ching-te’s triggering of cross-strait confrontation and conflict.”
His running mate Hsiao has been sanctioned twice by China for being a “stubborn secessionist.”
Speaking to the media ahead of his victory speech on Saturday night, Lai called his win a “victory for the community of democracies.”
“We are telling the international community that between democracy and authoritarianism, we still stand on the side of democracy,” he said.
“I will act in accordance with our democratic and free constitutional order in a manner that is balanced and maintains the cross-strait status quo,” he added. “At the same time, we are also determined to safeguard Taiwan from continuing threats and intimidation from China”.
“In the future, we hope that China will recognize the new situation, and understand that only peace benefits both sides of the strait,” he added.
Lai’s victory comes as the US is trying to stabilize fraught relations with China and prevent competition from veering into conflict. During Tsai’s administration, Taiwan bolstered ties with the United States, its biggest international backer, which increased support and arms sales to the island.
US officials have said that Washington will uphold its longstanding policy toward Taiwan no matter who takes on the top job. The Biden administration will dispatch an unofficial delegation – including former senior officials – to Taipei following the election in keeping with past practice, according to senior officials.
The delegation visit “will be a signal, a very symbolic way of supporting Taiwan,” said T.Y. Wang, a professor at Illinois State University.
Saturday’s result is another major blow for Taiwan’s Kuomintang, which back warmer relations with Beijing and have not held the presidency since 2016.
Beijing made little secret of its desire to see the KMT return to power. During campaigning the KMT accused Lai and the DPP of needlessly stoking tensions with China.
Lev Nachman, a political science professor at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, said that while Lai has to make some economic adjustments given deep public grievances over low wages and unaffordable housing, on issues like foreign policy and cross-strait relations he is expected to largely follow Tsai’s approach.
“So much of (Lai’s) campaign has been trying to reassure not just a domestic audience, but international audience that he is Tsai Ing-wen 2.0,” he said.
That will not be welcome in Beijing.
Days before the election, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said by following Tsai’s path, Lai is pursuing a path of provocation and confrontation and will bring Taiwan “closer and closer to war and recession.”
Analysts say China could escalate economic and military pressure on Taiwan to show its displeasure in the coming days and weeks, or save a more forceful response for May, when Lai takes office.
“There’s multiple times that China could cause a fuss over a DPP victory, either now or later this year,” Nachman said.
And Beijing has a wide range of coercive measures in its toolbox too.
In the lead-up to the vote, China ended preferential tariffs for some Taiwanese imports under a free trade agreement. It could broaden the scope of goods targeted, or even suspend the agreement altogether.
China can also further ramp up its military pressure on Taiwan, sending more fighter jets and warships close to the island’s skies and waters, a tactic it has deployed with increased frequency in recent years.
But Taiwan’s security officials said ahead of the vote that they didn’t expect large-scale military actions from China right after the election, citing unsuitable winter weather conditions, troubles in the Chinese economy, and efforts by Beijing and Washington to stabilize ties following a bilateral summit in November.
And while an escalation of military tension could increase the risks of accidents and miscalculations, it doesn’t necessarily portend an imminent conflict in the Taiwan Strait, analysts noted.
“Just because the DPP is in power doesn’t mean China’s going to war,” said Nachman.
“The last eight years have obviously been uncomfortable with the DPP in power, but it hasn’t led to war, they’ve been able to find an uncomfortable middle ground. And the hope is that even with a Lai presidency that we can continue to have this sort of uncomfortable silence without having to go to war.”"
14ZRV2ZC90_EOLF5A63STEG9DC,US and UK carry out strikes against Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen,"By Oren Liebermann, Haley Britzky, Natasha Bertrand, Kevin Liptak, Alex Marquardt, MJ Lee and Jennifer Hansler, CNN","11 minute read Updated 3:36 PM EST, Fri January 12, 2024",20240112,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/11/politics/us-strikes-houthis-yemen/,"The US and UK militaries launched strikes against Houthi targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen on Thursday, marking a significant response after the Biden administration and its allies warned that the Iran-backed militant group would bear the consequences of its attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
US President Joe Biden said he ordered the strikes “in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea.”
READ: President Joe Biden’s statement on strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen
“Today, at my direction, U.S. military forces — together with the United Kingdom and with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands—successfully conducted strikes against a number of targets in Yemen used by Houthi rebels to endanger freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most vital waterways,” the president said in a statement released by the White House.
Biden added that he will “not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.”
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday the strikes were an act of “self-defense,” adding that the aim was to “de-escalate tensions and to restore stability to the region.”
US Air Forces Central Commander Lt. Gen. Alex Grynkewich initially said US and coalition forces struck over 60 targets with more than 100 precision-guided munitions at 16 Iranian-backed Houthi militant locations. The Houthi assets included command and control nodes, munitions, depots, launching systems, production facilities, and air defense radar systems, he added.
On Friday afternoon, Director of the Joint Staff Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims II said another 12 locations were also hit on Thursday after a “near immediate” decision following the initial strikes.
The strikes, which have been condemned by several leaders across the Middle East, killed five and wounded six others, according to the rebels’ military spokesperson, Yahya Sare’e, who said the airstrikes would not deter further Houthi attacks on shipping.
The US and UK strikes are a sign of the growing international alarm over the threat to one of the world’s most critical waterways. For weeks, the US had sought to avoid direct strikes on Yemen because of the risk of escalation in a region already simmering with tension as the Israel-Hamas war continues, but the ongoing Houthi attacks on international shipping compelled the coalition to act.
Though the US has carried out strikes against Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, this marks the first known strike against the Houthis in Yemen.
The strikes were from fighter jets and Tomahawk missiles. More than a dozen Houthi targets were fired on by missiles fired from air, surface, and sub platforms and were chosen for their ability to degrade the Houthis’ continued attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, a US official told CNN.
What kind of weapons are the US and UK using to strike Yemen’s Houthis?
The USS Florida, a guided missile submarine that crossed into the Red Sea on November 23, was part of the attack on Yemen, according to a second US official.
The USS Philippine Sea guided missile cruiser and two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers, the USS Gravely and the USS Mason, also took place, the official added on Friday.
The US also deployed 22 fixed wing aircraft — including F18s — from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier, the official said.
Four British Typhoon jets departed RAF Akrotiri, a major UK airbase in Cyprus, on Thursday evening local time, according to a British government official.
Two Voyager air-to-air refuelling tankers also comprised the mission, UK junior armed forces minister James Heappey told the BBC on Friday, adding that at least 14 targets were successfully hit.
“They flew south, joined up with their US colleagues, and prosecuted two targets in Houth-controlled Yemen, both of which had been used for the launching of drone and missile attacks,” Heappey added. There are no more UK convoys “immediately planned,” he said.
On Thursday, Rear-Admiral Emmanuel Slaars, joint commander of French forces in the Red Sea region, told journalists in Paris that French naval forces were patroling the waters where the Houthis operated.
Slaars said the French navy forces remain “under national command” and were “not subordinated” to the US. However, they are cooperating and sharing intelligence with the US.
A senior US military official told reporters on Thursday evening that he could not provide an exact percentage of Houthi assets that were destroyed in the strikes but that it was “significant.” He added that precision guided munitions were used to destroy the targets “and also to minimize collateral damage.”
“We were absolutely not targeting civilian population centers. We were going after very specific capabilities, in very specific locations, with precision munitions,” the official said.
The Houthis — an Iran-backed Shia political and military organization that has been fighting a civil war in Yemen against a coalition backed by Saudi Arabia — have been launching drones and missiles at commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea for weeks, many of which have been intercepted and shot down by US Navy ships in the area.
The Houthis have said their bombardments are showing solidarity with the Palestinian people, after Israel launched an unrelenting military campaign on Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks.
The Houthis have said they will only relent when Israel allows the entry of food and medicine into Gaza; its strikes could be intended to inflict economic pain on Israel’s allies in the hope they will pressure it to cease its military offensive.
Within Yemen, a yearslong conflict between Houthi forces and the Saudi-backed coalition has plunged the population into a devastating humanitarian crisis marked by famine, economic turmoil and extreme poverty.
Houthi forces stormed the capital Sanaa in 2014, and toppled the internationally recognized and Saudi-backed government, triggering a civil war. The conflict spiraled into a wider war in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an attempt to beat back the Houthis.
The conflict has killed up to 377,000 people, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reported in 2021. More than half of those died from indirect causes associated with the conflict, such as lack of food, water and healthcare.
Pro-Houthi demonstrators gathered in Sanaa on Friday, protesting against the US and UK airstrikes. Some chanted, “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews, victory to Islam.”
The Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping on Tuesday marked the final straw that culminated in Biden giving the green light for the US to move forward with Thursday’s strikes, though preparations have been ongoing for some time, a senior US official told CNN.
The strikes come as Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin remains hospitalized following complications from a surgery for prostate cancer. A senior Defense official said Austin ordered and monitored the strikes in in real-time from the hospital “with a full suite of secure communications.”
Pentagon watchdog launches review following Austin hospitalization
Over the course of the past several weeks, Biden has weighed potential strikes against Houthi positions in Yemen against the prospect of an escalating crisis in the Middle East. His underlying hesitancy in ordering direct action has been the potential of getting drawn in more directly to an expanding conflict — a scenario US officials believe could ultimately be Iran’s objective.
But the White House had made clear the repeated Houthi attacks on international shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea were intolerable. The attacks have forced some of the world’s largest shipping companies to avoid the waterway, instead adding thousands of miles to international shipping routes by sailing around the continent of Africa.
Hours before the strike on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Iran “has a role to play” in getting the Houthis to stop their “reckless, dangerous, and illegal activity.” If they did not, he said, “there will be consequences.”
The Houthi’s deputy foreign minister, Hussein al-Ezzi, claimed that Yemen was targeted in a “massive aggressive assault.”
In a speech Thursday, Houthi leader Abdul Malek Al-Houthi said that any US attack on Yemen ” will not go unanswered,” cryptically warning that the response will be “much more” than attacking US ships in the sea.
Houthi rebels’ military spokesperson Sare’e on Friday said they would continue their aggression against commercial ships in the Red Sea.
In a statement Friday on social media, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the group’s Supreme Revolutionary Committee, said the airstrikes “are barbaric, terrorist, and are a deliberate and unjustified aggression that reflects a brutal psychology.”
A senior US administration official signaled that there could be more action to come against the Houthis.
The Houthis fired at least one anti-ship ballistic missile towards a commercial vessel, Sims said on Friday.
The ballistic missile, fired Friday, “did not hit any ships of any kind,” Sims said, adding that he expected they were working through things on the ground and “trying to determine what capabilities still exist for them.” A US official said the missile was fired towards the M/T Khalissa in the Gulf of Aden.
“I would expect that they will attempt some sort of retaliation. Quite honestly I would hope they wouldn’t. And what I mean by that is, there are a number of actors here who have the ability and have influence with the Houthis who recognize that continued conflict is not … advantageous to them,” Sims said. “Iran would be one of them.”
“The hope would be that any real thought of retaliation is based on a clear understanding that we simply are not going to be messed with here,” he added.
New explosions were heard in Yemen’s western port city of Hodeidah on Friday, a resident told CNN.
The airport in Hodeidah had been hit in the initial round of strikes early Friday morning. The resident provided CNN a video that showed smoke rising from the direction of the airport.
CNN has reached out to the US Department of Defense about the explosions, and whether there are new strikes in Yemen.
On Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned while traveling in the region that “if it doesn’t stop, there will have to be consequences. And unfortunately, it hasn’t stopped.”
Blinken also said he doesn’t believe the war in Gaza is escalating into a regional conflict, even as he warned of “a lot of danger points.” While in the region, Blinken visited Bahrain, home to the US Naval Forces Central Command and the Navy’s Fifth Fleet.
An important aspect of Blinken’s trip to the Middle East was to tell regional leaders that if US takes military action against the Houthis, it should be seen as defensive, not escalatory, according to a senior State Department official.
On Wednesday, the United Nations Security Council passed a US- and Japan-led resolution condemning “in the strongest terms the at least two dozen Houthi attacks on merchant and commercial vessels since November 19, 2023” and demanding “that the Houthis immediately cease all such attacks.” Eleven countries voted in favor of the resolution. Four abstained, including China and Russia. A Western diplomat told CNN that the US accommodated some of China’s requests on the language of the resolution.
US strikes in Yemen are not unprecedented; according to the Council on Foreign Relations, the US has conducted nearly 400 airstrikes in Yemen since 2002.
In Yemen, officials say they are concerned at what a strike against the Houthis would portend for the region. Declassified US intelligence shows that Iran has been deeply involved in coordinating the Houthi attacks on commercial and merchant ships, including providing information about shipping vessels passing through the waterway.
Among the US’ concerns about taking direct action inside Yemen is also the risk of upsetting a carefully brokered truce in the war in Yemen between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia, which a US official previously told CNN the Biden administration considers one of its most significant foreign policy achievements.
Some American officials feared a direct attack on the Houthis in Yemen would be precisely what the group craved: drawing the US into direct engagement with the Iranian proxy group and potentially committing its forces to a more prolonged conflict.
Still, Biden’s attempts at deterrence had done little to prevent the Houthis from continuing their attacks on commercial and merchant ships transiting the Red Sea.
A significant turning point came around New Year’s, when US Navy helicopters shot and sank three Houthi boats in self-defense, killing those aboard. It was the first direct engagement between the US and Houthis since the start of the conflict, and prompted Biden to convene his national security team for a secure briefing call while he was on vacation in the US Virgin Islands.
That joint statement was issued on January 3, saying that the Houthis “will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways.”
While not describing the statement as a red line, Biden and his team recognized the language would essentially bind them to a more forceful response should the Houthi attacks continue, which many officials privately believed they would.
Just on Tuesday, the US Navy to shot down 21 missiles and drones fired by the Houthis; culminating on Thursday the fiercest response from the Biden administration since the salvos began.
There have been at least 27 Houthi attacks since November 19. As the US and its allies have been navigating the Houthis’ ongoing attacks, there have also been at least 131 attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria since October 17, leading to several strikes on facilities linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other proxy forces.
But many of the commercial vessels have had no connection to Israel. Vice Adm. Bradley Cooper, the commander of US Navy Central Command, said last week that the US assesses 55 nations have “direct connections” to the ships that have come under fire.

17K8IEPLS1_8F66NP9A6FKJ13I,Taiwan loses diplomatic ally to China days after presidential election,"By Nectar Gan, Eric Cheung and Wayne Chang, CNN","4 minute read Updated 4:13 AM EST, Mon January 15, 2024",20240115,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/15/asia/nauru-cuts-diplomatic-ties-taiwan-china-intl-hnk/,"Taiwan has lost another diplomatic ally to China just days after its presidential election in what Taipei said was both sudden and designed by Beijing to suppress the island’s “democratic achievements.”
The Pacific Island nation of Nauru on Monday announced it had severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established ties with China, a decision confirmed by Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry.
The move is the latest blow to Taiwan’s efforts to retain its dwindling number of diplomatic allies, and comes just two days after Taiwan’s voters defied China’s threats to elect a new president loathed by Beijing.
Lai Ching-te, the current vice president and a staunch defender of Taiwan’s distinct identity and sovereignty, won the presidential election on Saturday, handing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a historic third straight term.
Beijing had repeatedly warned Taiwan’s voters that his election would increase the risk of conflict.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never controlled it, and has ramped up diplomatic pressure on Taipei in recent years, including by poaching its allies.
During the DPP’s eight years in power, Taiwan has lost 10 diplomatic allies to China.
Who is Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s new President?
On Monday, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry condemned China in “the strongest possible terms” for Nauru’s diplomatic switch, which it said came at “a key moment” following the presidential election.
“China’s move is to suppress Taiwan’s democratic achievements,” Taiwan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang told reporters.
Tien added that the severance of ties was a “very sudden move” by the Nauru government, which had congratulated Lai’s presidential victory over the weekend.
Tien said Taiwan will immediately suspend all official interactions with Nauru “to defend national dignity,” including closing its embassy and asking the Pacific Island nation to close its embassy in Taiwan.
Tien also claimed that Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry had received information that Chinese officials had courted politicians in Nauru with offers of economic assistance.
He refused to put a figure on the alleged inducement, but said it was “beyond what we are able to assist our diplomatic allies with.”
In a regular news briefing Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson did not divulge whether Beijing had pledged financial aid to Nauru, but welcomed its move.
“It is Nauru’s right decision made on its own volition as an independent sovereign nation to announce its recognition of the one-China principle, its severance of ties with Taiwan and resumption of diplomatic relations with China after Taiwan’s election,” spokesperson Mao Ning said. “This also shows that the one-China principle is a general trend and the common aspiration of the people.”
This is the second time Nauru has severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The Pacific Island country first cut ties in 2002, followed by a resumption in 2005.
The Nauru government said its resumption of diplomatic relations with China was “in the best interests” of the country and its people.
“This means that the Republic of Nauru will no longer recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China’s territory, and will sever ‘diplomatic relations’ with Taiwan as of this day and no longer develop any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan,” it said in a statement.
Unofficial US delegation says support for Taiwan remains ‘rock solid’ after voters defied China
Nauru’s switch of allegiance leaves Taiwan with only 12 diplomatic allies, mostly small nations in the Pacific Ocean and Latin America, and the Vatican.
Nauru’s announcement came as an unofficial US delegation reaffirmed “rock solid” US support for Taiwan during a visit to the island to meet its current and incoming presidents.
Washington cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 after switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
But since then, the US has maintained close unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
Many other Western nations, including several in Europe, have also retained informal relations with Taipei in the guise of trade offices.
Analysts say these unofficial relationships with powerful Western nations are in many ways more consequential than the official diplomatic ties it maintains with a handful of smaller countries.
However, formal diplomatic relations allow those countries to advocate on behalf of Taiwan in international bodies that the island is locked out of, such as the United Nations.

1C4RMZH9MP_KH93DCN9AWYAEYF,South Africa accuses Israel of genocide and urges top UN court to halt Gaza war,"By Christian Edwards, CNN","7 minute read Updated 10:12 PM EST, Thu January 11, 2024",20240111,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/11/middleeast/south-africa-israel-genocide-icj-hague-day-one-intl/,"South Africa accused Israel of genocide in an unprecedented case at the United Nations’ top court, saying the country’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza” and calling for the court to order a halt to Israel’s military campaign in the enclave.
On the first of two days of hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), South Africa on Thursday argued that Israel’s air and ground assaults on Gaza were intended to “bring about the destruction” of its Palestinian population, and that comments made by Israeli leaders signalled their “genocidal intent.”
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s murderous rampage on October 7, when more than 1,200 people were killed and 240 hostages were taken back to Gaza. South Africa condemned Hamas’ attacks but said “nothing” could justify Israel’s response, which has killed more than 23,000 people in Gaza.
“The point is not simply that Israel is acting disproportionately. The point is that the prohibition on genocide is an absolute,” said Vaughan Lowe, one of the lawyers representing South Africa. “Nothing can ever justify genocide.”
Israel dismissed the case as “absurd blood libel,” and government spokesperson Eylon Levy said it is “tragic that the rainbow nation that prides itself on fighting racism will be fighting pro-bono for the anti-Jewish racists.”
Israel is facing a genocide case in international court. Could it halt the war in Gaza?
Israel is scheduled to deliver its response in court on Friday. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the country would make the case that the war was one of self-defense, and would show that Israel is doing its “utmost” under “extremely complicated circumstances” to avert civilian casualties.
The ICJ, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, was set up in June 1945 and hears cases brought by states accusing others of violating their UN treaty obligations. South Africa and Israel are signatories to the 1948 Genocide Convention, meaning they are obliged not to commit genocide and to prevent and punish it.
Experts say it is the first time that the Jewish state is being tried under the Genocide Convention, which was drawn up after World War II in light of the atrocities committed against the Jewish people during the Holocaust.
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them, and other countries who are party to the court have ignored its rulings in the past.
In an 84-page filing to the ICJ, South Africa argued that Israel is committing genocide by killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing serious mental and bodily harm, forced evacuation, widespread hunger, and by creating conditions “calculated to bring about their physical destruction.” It also accused Israel of failing to stem incitement to genocide in the public pronouncements of its officials.
During three hours of oral argument, lawyers representing South Africa asked the ICJ to order a suspension of Israel’s campaign in Gaza to protect the rights of Palestinians in Gaza “from imminent and irreparable loss.”
Such “provisional measures,” as they are known, function as a kind of restraining order to stop a dispute from escalating while the court considers the full merits of the case, which could take years. For provisional measures the court need only decide if prima facie, or “at first glance,” the acts complained of could fall foul of the genocide convention.
“It is not necessary for the court to come to a final view on the question of whether Israel’s conduct constitutes genocide. It is necessary to establish only whether at least some of the acts alleged are capable of falling within the provisions of the convention,” argued Adila Hassim, one of the lawyers representing South Africa.
In its opening remarks, South Africa said it “places Israel’s genocidal acts and omissions within the broader context of Israel’s 25-year apartheid, 56-year occupation, and 16-year siege imposed on the Gaza Strip.”
South Africa operated under a system of apartheid from 1948 until the early 1990s, and its governing African National Congress has long championed the Palestinian cause.
Ahead of the hearing South Africa was accused by Israel and others of hypocrisy for not also bringing a charge of genocide against Hamas, whose founding charter mandates the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel.
South Africa explained during the hearing that “Hamas is not a state and cannot be a party to the genocide convention,” and said the group would be accountable to “other bodies” such as the International Criminal Court, which tries individuals – rather than states – for crimes including war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a grouping of 57 Muslim countries, as well as Jordan, Turkey and Malaysia have so far backed South Africa’s case, while Israel’s allies have fiercely opposed it.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the case as “meritless,” and said it was “particularly galling given that those who are attacking Israel – Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, as well as their supporter of Iran – continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews.”
South Africa presented widely reported evidence that it said showed a “systematic pattern of conduct” by Israel “from which genocide can be inferred.” The UN defines genocide as an act “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”
“South Africa believes that the publicly available evidence of the scale of the destruction resulting from the bombardment of Gaza, and the deliberate restriction of food, water, medicines and electricity available to the population of Gaza, demonstrates that the government of Israel… is intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza as a group, and is doing nothing to prevent or punish the actions of others who support that aim,” said Lowe.
Citing previous CNN reporting that nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions that Israel has used in Gaza in its war with Hamas have been unguided “dumb bombs,” Vaughan said “it’s no use Israel saying it does whatever it can to minimize the deaths of innocent” Palestinians.
“The use of 2,000-pound bunker-busting bombs and dumb bombs in residential areas, and the relentless bombardment of Gaza… tell another story.”
Israel has repeatedly stressed that it is targeting Hamas – which has long been known to station military operations inside civilian buildings – rather than civilians in Gaza.
South Africa argued that the evacuation order issued by Israel to residents of northern Gaza on October 13 – the first of its kind – was itself “genocidal,” since “it required immediate movement… while no humanitarian assistance was permitted.” Israel said at the time that, by notifying the civilian population of a planned military attack, it was complying with international law.
As well as detailing the actions of the Israeli military, South Africa also cited public pronouncements by Israeli officials it alleged were genocidal in nature.
“Israel’s political leaders, military commanders, and persons holding official positions, have systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent,” argued Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.
Ngcukaitobi cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Israeli forces on October 28, ahead of the imminent launch of its ground offensive in Gaza.
“Remember what Amalek did to you,” Netanyahu said in his address, which Ngcukaitobi told the court “refers to a Biblical command by God to Saul for the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people known as the Amalekites.”
There is precedent for the court to grant the kind of emergency orders South Africa is calling for.
In January 2020, the court granted The Gambia’s request for provisional measures to protect the Rohingya people remaining in Myanmar from genocide. The Court has granted similar measures to protect Ukrainians from ongoing Russian aggression, and Bosnians during the Balkan Wars in the 1990s.
Max du Plessis, another of South Africa’s lawyers, said if the court failed to do so it risked treating Palestinians “differently, as less worthy of protection than others.”
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them. A 2022 report by Human Rights Watch found continued abuses against the Rohingya remaining in Myanmar, despite the provisional measures. Similarly, despite the court in March 2022 ordering Russia to immediately suspend its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow’s war rages on nearly two years later.
While an ICJ ruling against Israel may fail to constrain its military action, it could land a serious blow to Israel’s international reputation.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused South Africa of “functioning as the legal arm of Hamas” in furious comments on Thursday.
“Today we were witness to one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history, compounded by a series of false and baseless claims,” Lior Haiat, a spokesperson for the ministry, said on X.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also hit out at South Africa.
“Today, again, we saw an upside-down world, in which the State of Israel is accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting genocide,” he said during a televised speech Thursday.
“South Africa’s hypocrisy screams to the high heavens.”

21FF1OOTFD_XEHADIGC0POUFHO,"Somali president’s son convicted for fatal collision in Turkey, but spared jail time","By Scott McLean, Isil Sariyuce and Umut Sevdi Tangor, CNN","6 minute read Updated 12:57 PM EST, Wed January 17, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/17/world/somali-presidents-son-convicted-for-fatal-collision-in-turkey-but-spared-jail-time/,"The son of Somalia’s president was convicted in an Istanbul courtroom but spared jail time over a collision that killed a motorcycle courier in the city, in a case that has drawn anger and demands for justice across Turkey.
Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was handed a 2.5-year sentence on Tuesday which was commuted to a fine of 27,300 Turkish Liras ($910 USD) after he accepted the charge of “reckless killing” for fatally striking Yunus Emre Gocer, a married father of two, in late November, according to Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber.
The case initially sparked controversy in Turkey after Mohamud left the country following the deadly incident, prompting criticism of perceived inaction by police and prosecutors. An arrest warrant for Mohamud was dropped when he returned to Turkey in order to give a statement in court on Friday, according to TRT.
Mohamud was not required to be in court on Tuesday when the verdict in the case was read. He was originally handed a 3-year prison sentence, which was decreased to 2.5 years for “good conduct,” according to TRT. According to Turkish penal code, the court can opt to convert a sentence of that length to a fine, which it did, sparing Mohamud any prison time. His driver’s license will also be cancelled for six months, according to TRT.
Iyaz Cimen, the lawyer representing Gocer’s family, told CNN that his clients had agreed to drop their formal complaint against Mohamud. He would not say what, if any, deal with Mohamud prompted that decision, or whether the family would be financially compensated.
Mohamud’s case is one of two incidents involving the sons of prominent foreign officials that have raised questions about fairness in the justice system. In December, there was a second collision allegedly involving the son of a former Yemeni defense minister, who police say hit two pedestrians. One of the victims was seriously injured.
The two cases have no direct connection to one another, beyond the coincidental timing, and the harsh public spotlight cast on both – especially after early missteps and discrepancies by police and prosecutors in the first.
According to Turkish police, 40-year-old Mohamud, the son of Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, was behind the wheel of a black BMW with diplomatic plates in southwest Istanbul when it struck Gocer, a delivery driver on a scooter, on November 30.
According to a statement from the prosecutor, Gocer died on December 6 and “therefore the nature of the crime changed” from the charge of “reckless injury” to “reckless killing.” Two days later, an arrest warrant was issued.

Cimen, the lawyer representing Gocer’s family, told CNN in December that Mohamud had left the country on December 2, before the warrant was issued.
Cimen had previously told CNN that the initial police report suggested the victim had made an illegal lane change, but only after public scrutiny, and after the victim died and the charge became more serious, did a subsequent report cast doubt on the initial police assessment of what happened. That second report, written by independent experts, says that the “primarily negligent party” was Mohamud.
A third report, meant to resolve discrepancies between the initial police report and the subsequent expert report, produced a more mixed result. Published December 18 by the Traffic Specialization Department of the Forensic Medicine Institute, it affirmed that Mohamud was “primarily at fault,” but also found that Gocer was also “secondarily at fault.” The report says that Gocer was in front of Mohamud in the second-to-right lane, while Mohamud was behind in the right lane.
Gocer slowed to change lanes to the right, and that’s when he was hit. It blames Mohamud for failing to hit the brakes and slow down, but it also blames Gocer for failing to adequately check his mirrors to see Mohamud behind him and slowing to a stop on a road with a speed limit of 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour.
The perceived initial failings quickly led to public outrage, with motorcycle drivers and couriers staging a protest in December calling for justice for Gocer.
Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, said in December that he was glad the prosecutor’s office had issued the arrest warrant. The mayor had written on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the prosecutor’s office would need to explain discrepancies between the initial police report and the latest statement “which allowed the suspect to flee abroad.”
CNN reached out to the Somali consulate for comment in December but did not receive a response. In an interview with the Associated Press published December 14, the Somali president denied that his son had fled the country, saying that he left because he had business elsewhere and there was no arrest warrant for him. President Mohamud told the AP he was sorry for Gocer’s family for his loss, and said that he has advised his son to go back to Turkey for court proceedings. “The decision is his — but I am giving that advice,” he said.
At the time, Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported that Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc told reporters in Ankara he had personally spoken with the Somali justice minister.
“In the coming days, the defendant will come to Turkey and participate in the trial process,” he said, according to Anadolu. “”We will never allow any of our citizens to lose their rights and legal interests in favor of a foreigner. We will follow the incident to the end. We will work for justice to prevail.”

In the second, separate incident in early December in central Istanbul, Musaeed Ahmed Musaeed Hussein, the son of Yemen’s former Defense Minister Ahmed Musaeed Hussein, was behind the wheel of a vehicle that hit two people as they were crossing the street, according to the statement Hussein gave to prosecutors.One of them was a 71-year-old named Pakize Ozer, who was seriously injured, according to CNN Turk. “The complainant suddenly appeared in front of me. Since the sun was coming from the opposite direction, I didn’t see exactly where she was coming from,” he said in his statement to prosecutors. In that report he said that Ozer was not in a pedestrian crosswalk and he denied that he was at fault.
Hussein’s father was in the passenger seat at the time. CNN Turk reported in December that Ozer was in hospital in life-threatening condition, but Hussein’s lawyer, Kerim Bahadır Seker, now says that she has since left hospital. He says his client is currently under house arrest and a travel ban prevents him from leaving the country.
Last month, he told CNN Turk that his client was not speeding or under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the collision.
Grainy videos purportedly showing security camera footage of each crash have been widely broadcast on Turkish media, which has heavily covered both incidents."

“In the past year of 2023, China’s economy has generally rebounded and improved,” the country’s second highest official told the meeting of global business and political leaders.
The Chinese government had earlier said that it was targeting a growth rate of around 5% for 2023, and is set to announce its annual GDP figures for last year on Wednesday.
While this expansion would mark a significant pick-up over 2022, when China’s economy grew by just 3%, it is still one of the country’s economic worst performances in over three decades.
Barring the pandemic years through 2022, when China’s growth was disrupted by strict lockdowns and other restrictions, 5.2% is the country’s slowest pace of annual growth since 1990, when the economy expanded by 3.9% because of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
The country has been beset by a series of economic problems, including a real estate crisis, record youth unemployment, deflation, and a rapidly ageing population. International economists have widely projected China’s growth to slow to around 4.5% this year.
Those problems have sent investors rushing for the exits. China’s stock markets were the biggest losers in 2023. The country’s blue-chip CSI 300 index fell more than 11%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 14%. Meanwhile, the MSCI World index closed the year 22% higher, its biggest annual jump since 2019.
“Even if there are twists and turns in China’s economic operation, its overall long-term positive trend will not change,” said Li. The premier is the most senior Chinese leader to attend the Davos forum in person since President Xi Jinping in 2017.
Li also tried to reassure international investors, who have become increasingly wary of China’s tough business environment and slowing growth.
“Investing in the Chinese market is not a risk but an opportunity,” he said.
The country has about 400 million people in the middle-income group, and that number is expected to double to 800 million in the next 10 years, Li said.
“The momentum for consumption … is very strong,” he added.
Ongoing urbanization will create huge demand in sectors such as housing, education, medical and elderly care, he said, adding that there are still nearly 300 million rural Chinese who will eventually migrate to cities.
There is also a lot of room for investments in upgrading urban transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, he noted.
Li also pledged to create “first-class” operating environment for international businesses in China.
“No matter how the world’s situation changes, China will adhere to its fundamental national policy of opening up, and its door will only get wider and wider,” he said.
His remarks come as Beijing intensifies its efforts to revive the economy and woo foreign investment back into the country. Foreign companies have grown wary of Beijing’s rising scrutiny and are pulling out. In the third quarter, a measure of foreign direct investment (FDI) into China turned negative for the first time since 1998.
On Monday, Li met with Swiss President Viola Amherd and said the two countries would deepen economic ties and start talks to upgrade their free-trade agreement, according to a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry.
In November, Xi visited the United States for the first time in more than six years, where he met with President Joe Biden to amend ties between the two countries. In a meeting with top American business executives, Xi pledged to make it easier for foreigners to invest and operate in his country.

2PFJXEGSJY_ULGM9WWX9O33QTU,Unofficial US delegation says support for Taiwan remains ‘rock solid’ after voters defied China,"By Nectar Gan and Eric Cheung, CNN","4 minute read Updated 3:01 AM EST, Mon January 15, 2024",20240115,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/15/asia/us-unofficial-delegation-visit-taiwan-intl-hnk/,"Former senior US officials reaffirmed “rock solid” American support for Taiwan in a visit Monday after the self-ruled island defied threats from China by electing a new president loathed by Beijing.
Lai Ching-te, a staunch defender of Taiwan’s sovereignty and democracy, on Saturday won a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), shrugging off warnings from Beijing that his election would increase the risk of conflict.
In keeping with past US practice, the Biden administration dispatched an unofficial delegation to Taiwan following the election to meet the island’s current and incoming presidents. But the US reaction to the election has already sparked an angry response from China.
In a meeting with Taiwan’s incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen Monday, former US national security adviser Stephen Hadley congratulated Taiwan on the elections on behalf of the American people, praising the self-ruled island’s democracy as a “shining example for the world.”
Hadley reaffirmed that “the American commitment to Taiwan is rock solid, principled and bipartisan.”
“We look forward to continuity in the relationship between Taiwan and the United States under the new administration and for common efforts to preserve cross-strait peace and stability,” he said.

Former deputy secretary of state James Steinberg said the delegation traveled to Taiwan to “underscore the US bipartisan support for our long-standing friendship for Taiwan.”
During Tsai’s eight years in office, Taiwan has bolstered its ties with its democratic partners, especially the US, its biggest international backer, which increased support and arms sales to the island.
The delegation also met with Lai and Vice President-elect Hsiao Bi-khim, a well-known figure in Washington after serving as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States.
In the meeting, Lai called the US “Taiwan’s most important partner,” and expressed gratitude for its long-standing support to the island.
Lai vowed to build on Tsai’s efforts to defend peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. “And we hope that the United States will continue to support Taiwan to deepen our cooperation in this area,” he said.
“I believe that our relationship will continue to flourish as we work together, and it will become an important force in defending peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,” he added.
The visit came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday congratulated Lai on his win and Taiwan’s people “for once again demonstrating the strength of their robust democratic system and electoral process.”
In a statement, Blinken said the US looks forward to working with Lai and Taiwan’s leaders of all parties to “advance our shared interests and values, and to further our longstanding unofficial relationship.”
That statement prompted an angry response from Beijing, which views Taiwan as its own territory to be taken by force if necessary.
On Sunday, China’s Foreign Ministry said the statement “seriously violates the one-China principle” and US promises to only maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial ties with Taiwan.
“It also sends a gravely wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces. We strongly deplore and firmly oppose this, and have made serious representations to the US side,” the ministry said in a statement.
The Chinese embassies in Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada also lashed out at their host countries for congratulating Lai on his victory.
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa called Taiwan “an extremely crucial partner and an important friend” in her congratulatory message. The Chinese embassy in Tokyo said it “resolutely opposed” her statement, which it blasted as “a serious interference in China’s internal affairs.”
Taiwan was a Japanese colony for half a century until 1945.
Under Xi Jinping, China’s most powerful leader in a generation, Beijing has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan, and severed official communication with Taipei’s government since 2016. Lai’s election is unlikely to lead to a thawing of cross-strait ties any time soon.
Washington cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 after switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
Since then, the US has maintained close unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. But it has long remained deliberately vague on whether it will come to Taiwan’s defense in case of a Chinese attack.
Asked by reporters to comment on Taiwan’s election results Saturday, US President Joe Biden said: “We do not support independence.”"
4P369YGVUH_3U3A7CJ35G6PTCT,Why this American woman has ditched the US for Portugal,"By Silvia Marchetti, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:54 AM EST, Tue January 16, 2024",20240116,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/travel/american-woman-ditched-us-portugal/,"Moving to a foreign country can be a scary decision. Particularly if it’s a country you’ve never even visited.
In 2021, Katie Meyer, a global hospitality communications professional from California, chose to do just that.
Meyer, who had previously lived and worked in London before returning to the US, relocated to Portugal during the Covid-19 pandemic, settling in the idyllic seaside resort of Cascais, close to Lisbon.
“My dream was to someday to return to Europe,” Meyer, 66, tells CNN. “Once remote work became standard and I sold my real estate in the US. I knew that relocation to Europe was a ‘now or never’ proposition.”
Her personal and professional travels had taken her to many countries in Europe throughout the years, but never Portugal.
While the sunny Mediterranean climate and Portugal’s laid-back vibe were part of the allure, Meyer was ready for a new chapter in her life.
Safety, quality of life, affordable medical care, and a relatively simple path to permanent residency and citizenship, were high on her list of priorities for her future country of residence, and Lisbon ticked all of her boxes.
Signs of the pandemic were still very evident when Meyer arrived in the Portuguese capital with five suitcases in tow in August 2021.
“Few hotels and restaurants open, a fraction of the number of usual tourists, mask-wearing the norm, I felt like I had Lisbon to myself,” she says.
Meyer rented an apartment for three months in Lisbon at first. But after exploring the area, she fell in love with the charms of nearby Cascais, a former fishing village that has been luring many expats recently.
This US couple sold their house and moved to Italy for good
She was struck by Cascais’ unplugged and somewhat sleepy feel, which was something she wasn’t accustomed to, and the fact that locals didn’t seem to use mobile phones at the market or cafes.
“Here, time stands still, and people relish time together,” she says. “Things take longer. In place of any sense of urgency you find a happier, more laid-back lifestyle.
“But one that can be very frustrating to Americans addicted to frenetic beats and trapped in the rat race.”
She says she was taken aback by the genuineness of the Portuguese people, their pride and joy in learning that an expat had chosen their country as a new home, and their willingness to help when she was struggling to communicate.
“Portuguese is a very difficult language to learn, but they are always willing to help with pronunciations and usage,” she says. “It is very much a welcoming culture.”
Later that year, Meyer bought a 95-square-meter, two-bedroom, split-level apartment with a roof terrace in a quiet neighborhood, close to cafés and cultural attractions.
Situated on a hill above the center of town, it offers striking views stretching from Cascais Bay and the ocean to the famous mountains and palaces of Sintra.
The purchase price was 595,000 euros (around $651,000). Even though Portugal saw an overall property price increase of 13.8% in 2021, with prices continuing to rise in the years since then, Meyer estimates that an apartment in a similar spot in California would have cost her at least triple.
Fortunately, Meyer was able to benefit from Portugal’s “golden visa” system, a five-year residence by investment program aimed at non-EU nationals, which is no longer available for real estate purchases.
To qualify, applicants were required to make a real estate purchase of a minimum of 500,000 euros ($547,000.)
The golden visa grants her visa-free travel through Europe’s Schengen Area. She also has the option to apply for Portuguese citizenship after holding a golden visa for five years, according to a recently amended law aimed at speeding up procedures.
They sold everything to become a digital nomad family. Here’s what happened next
But for Meyer, one of the cons to moving to a destination with such a slower-paced lifestyle has been getting through red tape, and she faced a wait of around two years to obtain her residency due to the Portugal’s previous long approval process.
“Word of mouth from others who have been through it reigns supreme,” she says. “And my advice would be to find a good attorney.”
Meyer says that Cascais’ strong sense of community played a part in her decision to build her new life there.
“People are very social and family-oriented,” she says. “On weekends I meet friends at the popular mercado, where, in addition to a farmers’ market, butchers, cheese and fishmongers, crafts, stands with clothing and household goods for sale, you can socialize and just watch the world go by.”
Savoring a creamy pastel de nata (egg or custard tarts) or a tosta mista (a grilled sandwich) at one of the local pastelaria shops is also a popular pastime here.
According to Meyer, the quality and speed of service in restaurants and hotels is slower than in the US, and deliveries and home repairs are also likely to take longer.
“On the upside, a restaurant server would never, ever present a bill without a customer asking for it,” she adds.
“That would be considered rude, even with a line of customers waiting for a table. And you won’t see people eating or drinking on the go, as you would in the US.”
Meyer has noticed that the absence of a tipping culture in Portugal is something that Americans find difficult to grasp.
“A small tip is always appreciated for good service and overall experience,” she adds. “But not mandatory. Americans over-tipping can even be considered rather vulgar in some circles.”
She’s picked up some local habits, like forsaking a clothes dryer, considered “the Portuguese way.”
However, Meyer hasn’t been able to give up air-conditioning – a 2022 study by real estate platform Idealista found that only one in four properties on the market in Portugal had air conditioning – and has a unit installed at her home.
Adapting to the local climate has also meant learning to deal with the high coastal humidity and the propensity for mold in winter.
“Due to different building standards than those we are accustomed to in the US, dampness and mold is common,” says Meyer.
“I’ve learned to live with various dehumidifying devices and the frequent airing out of my apartment during winter months. Just part of the new routine.”
Meyer’s also had to adapt to the intricately-designed cobblestones on the sidewalks of Portugal – calcada portuguesa – which can be “beautiful to the eye but treacherous to the body.”
“I slipped and fell on these slick stones several times when I first arrived, and quickly learned that this is simply a rite of passage,” she says, adding that she now wears sneakers to tackle them. “In Portugal, it’s function over style in the shoe department.”
She’s also had to get used to the Portuguese queuing systems. The phrase, “take a number,” has all-new meaning in Portugal, says Meyer.
“To get served at post offices, hospitals and pharmacies requires you go to a machine for a senha, a piece of paper containing a code indicating your place in line,” she explains.
“You may proceed to a desk only once your number is illuminated on a screen and called.”
However, Meyers feels that the affordable cost of living in Portugal outweighs any challenges, even though prices have risen in the years since she’s been there.
“When I arrived an Uber ride within the greater Cascais area started at 1.50 euros (around $1.64),” she says. “Today that is closer to 3.50 euros or 4 euros (about $4.38.)
“Recently, I had friends tell me that a round trip Uber ride they took in NYC – from Lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side – was $100, including tip, of course. Sticker shock is common for anyone living in Portugal and returning to the US.”
Back in late 2021, Meyer says that lunch for two (a fish, steak or stew main, vegetable and potatoes, two glasses of wine, bread and bottled water) would cost her 16 euros (around $17.50.) More recently, the price was 22 euros (around $24,) which she still considers to be a relative bargain.
Although Meyer has adapted well, she says she’s still trying to fully absorb the Cascais vibe and feel like a local.
“When living outside of the US, I consider myself first and foremost a foreigner,” she says.
“I know that I must adapt to a new and different culture, not vice versa. Embracing that mindset is fundamental to living abroad.”
Meyer gets homesick from time to time, but says she has no plans to return to the US, and wouldn’t swap her new life for anything.
“I miss my friends and family in the US, but living in a safe, peaceful, affordable and eye-opening environment is an indisputable trade-off,” she says.
“Portugal is a pretty wonderful travel destination – and I’ve had more US visitors these past two years than I probably would have had time to see if I were still living in the US.”"
6IA7G22N98_2RSYHECX5NK7EI9,"Who is Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s new President?","By Nectar Gan, CNN","8 minute read Updated 9:58 PM EST, Sat January 13, 2024",20240114,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/14/asia/profile-lai-ching-te-taiwan-new-president-intl-hnk/,"Lai Ching-te, a former doctor from a poor mining family, was propelled into politics by a military crisis in the Taiwan Strait 27 years ago.
Now, the soft-spoken political veteran is tasked with preventing another one from happening as the newly elected leader of the self-ruled island that China’s Communist Party has vowed to one day absorb.
On Saturday, Lai, 64, the current vice president from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), won a widely watched election to become Taiwan’s next president.
His victory handed the DPP a historic third consecutive term, delivering a snub to years of growing threats from Taiwan’s much-larger authoritarian neighbor, China.
“The election has shown the world the commitment of the Taiwanese people to democracy, which I hope China can understand,” Lai told thousands of jubilant supporters at a rally after his win.
Lai, who has long faced Beijing’s wrath for championing Taiwan’s sovereignty, said as president he has “an important responsibility to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” pledging to pursue dialogue with China under the principles of dignity and parity.
“At the same time, we’re also determined to safeguard Taiwan from continuing threats and intimidation from China,” he told reporters ahead of his victory speech.
Under leader Xi Jinping, China’s most assertive leader in a generation, Beijing has ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on Taiwan, which it views as its own territory to be seized by force if necessary.
Tensions across the Taiwan Strait are at their highest since 1996, when China fired missiles into waters off Taiwan’s coast to intimidate voters ahead of the island’s first free presidential election – after the nascent democracy emerged from decades of its own authoritarian rule.
For Lai, then a fresh-faced doctor at a university hospital in the southern city of Tainan, that missile crisis became his “defining moment.”
“I decided I had a duty to participate in Taiwan’s democracy and help protect this fledgling experiment from those who wished it harm,” he wrote in The Wall Street Journal last year.
Lai hung up his white coat to run for office – first becoming a legislator, then a popular two-term mayor of Tainan, before serving as the premier and – since 2020 – the vice president of incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen.
The doctor-turned politician has now broken the “eight-year curse” of Taiwan politics – a popular term nodding to the fact that, until Lai’s victory, no political party had ever stayed in power for more than two terms since Taiwan became a democracy.
Lai called his foray into politics an “unexpected journey.”
Growing up in poverty in a mining village near the northern coast of Taiwan, Lai had dreamed of becoming a doctor since childhood. He had five siblings, and his mother raised them alone by doing odd jobs. His father, a coal miner, died in a work accident when Lai was a small child.
Lai was too young to remember his father. “But one day I suddenly realized, the biggest asset my father left me was that my family was poor,” he said at an event in March last year.
“Growing up in such a family, we will be more mature, have more willpower, and have more courage to overcome difficulties.”
After completing a bachelor’s degree in physical medicine and rehabilitation in Taipei, Lai went to Tainan for medical school.
He was a few years into a promising career as a physician in Tainan when a local DPP official approached him. He asked the popular doctor to help a DPP politician campaign for local elections.
It was 1994, less than a decade after the DPP first emerged from Taiwan’s democracy movement against the authoritarian rule of the Kuomintang (KMT).
Before lifting martial law in 1987 and transitioning slowly toward free elections, the KMT ruled Taiwan with an iron fist for nearly four decades after fleeing to the island from mainland China after losing the civil war to the Communist forces there.
Tens of thousands of political opponents were killed or jailed during what came to be known as the “White Terror” and the DPP was formed by many veterans of those who had campaigned for democracy.
While Lai was in college in Taipei, he and his roommates had closely followed news of the KMT’s brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. “I was full of doubts and concerns for the future of this country,” he said in video released by his presidential election campaign.
Lai agreed to help the DPP with the local election, but the candidate lost in the end.
A year later, some democracy activists invited Lai to join the DPP to run for the legislature.
He initially rejected the idea. “I was born and raised in a rural, impoverished place, and I had always wanted to be a doctor. Now, I’ve finally made it this far to become a chief physician,” he said in the campaign video.
But his political friends refused to give up. Months later, crisis flared in the Taiwan Strait as China held live-fire exercises and fired missiles toward Taiwan, giving Lai a final push across the line.
“Instead of criticizing the ruling government at the time from my clinic, wouldn’t it be better to come out and follow the vanguards of the democratic movement and actually do something for Taiwan?” he said in the video.
“I also thought that in this life, if I could find a project that makes me feel passionate to embark on, it would be a life worth living.”
In the lead-up to the election, China made no secret of its desire to prevent a Lai victory.
Chinese officials repeatedly framed the vote as a choice between “peace and war” – echoing a talking point of the KMT’s Hou Yu-ih, Beijing’s preferred candidate – while railing against Lai for triggering “cross-strait confrontation and conflict.”
Hailing from a more radical wing of the DPP, Lai was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence – a red line for Beijing.
His views tempered as he rose through the ranks. But China never forgave him for his comments from six years ago, in which he described himself as a “practical worker for Taiwan independence.”
Lai now says he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that “Taiwan is already an independent sovereign country” so there is “no plan or need” to declare independence.
That deliberately nuanced stance mimics his outgoing predecessor Tsai, Taiwan’s first female president, who was unable to stand again because of term limits.
Beijing cut off official communications with Taipei after Tsai took office in 2016 and ramped up its campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally, something that looks set to continue when Lai is inaugurated and fully takes over in May.
In many ways Beijing’s rhetoric towards Lai is even more hostile than how it viewed Tsai.
China’s government and state media regularly rebuke Lai, calling him a dangerous separatist, “troublemaker” and “war maker,” while rejecting his repeated offers for talks.
One such offer was made to China’s top leader, Xi.
In May last year, at a quick-fire Q&A session with students at his alma mater, National Taiwan University, Lai named Xi as the head of state he would most like to have dinner with.
If he had a chance to dine with Xi, Lai said, he would advise the Chinese leader to “chill out a little.”
“No need to be so stressed,” he said.
Asked about Lai’s invitation, Beijing said his comments were “weird” and accused Lai of “trying to put on the cloak of goodwill” given that his “Taiwan independence nature” had not changed.
Lai’s running mate Hsiao Bi-khim, who was elected vice president Saturday, was also openly loathed by Beijing. Hsiao, who recently served as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States, was sanctioned twice by China for being a “diehard secessionist.”
Lai earned more than 40 percent of the popular vote, while the KMT scooped up 33 percent and a newer opposition party, the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), racked up 26 percent.
The DPP lost its majority in the legislature, taking 51 of the 113 seats, meaning Lai may find himself more constrained than Tsai and needing to rely on political alliances to pass legislation.
Hours after Lai declared victory, China dismissed the outcome of Taiwan’s elections, saying the DPP “does not represent mainstream public opinion” on the island.
“Taiwan is China’s Taiwan,” China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement on Saturday night.
“This election cannot change the shared hope from compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to get closer and closer, it moreover cannot stop the inevitable destiny that our motherland will be united.”
But that assertion could not be further from Taiwan’s mainstream public opinion.
Under Xi’s strongarm tactics, Taiwan’s public has shifted determinedly away from China. Less than 10 percent now support an immediate or eventual unification, and less than 3 percent identify primarily as Chinese.
The majority of Taiwanese want to maintain the current status quo and show no desire to be ruled by Beijing.
“We have been bullied for years on end. I just can’t stand kneeling down to their demands and their meddling with our elections. We want to keep our free style of living and our democracy,” Yang Wei-ting, a 27-year-old civil servant, said amid cheers and celebrations at Lai’s rally.
“I think the most important part for us is to work with like-minded partners around the globe, and tell China that we’re not alone and we’re not scared. We’re standing in the face of an authoritarian regime, but we’re backed by many like-minded countries.”

According to FlightAware, the plane was in the air for 14 minutes. The incident apparently started about three minutes into the flight. The crew reported an engine fire, according to air traffic recordings.
“Mayday, mayday, giant 095 heavy, engine fire. Request vectors back to the airport,” the crew said, according to audio posted on LiveATC.net.
An FAA incident report says the flight’s No. 2 engine failed. That is the inboard engine on the left wing of a Boeing 747.
A “post flight inspection revealed a softball size hole above #2 engine,” the report says.
The ordeal sent sparks flying through the night sky over Miami.

Melanie Adaros was walking near her home in Miami’s Kendall neighborhood around 10:40 p.m. when she looked up and saw fire and sparks coming from a plane’s engine.
“It was very frightening,” she told CNN. “I couldn’t tell if the plane was going down.”
It’s unclear whether the sparks were caused by an issue with the plane or something external.
Atlas Air said the crew followed all standard procedures and safely returned to Miami International Airport. The plane landed around 11 p.m. Thursday.
Atlas Air will conduct an inspection to determine the cause of the issue, and the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board said they will investigate.
“NTSB has opened an investigation and is collecting information to evaluate and determine scope of the investigation,” the agency said in a statement to CNN. “No further information to release at this time.”
The aircraft is a Boeing 747-8 built in 2015, according to FAA data. In a statement to CNN, Boeing said it is “supporting our customer and will support the NTSB investigation into this incident.”

But as of January 1, 2024, some of those restrictions have dropped or loosened, making it easier than ever for US citizens to obtain a Chinese tourist visa.
Americans have the seventh most powerful passport in the world, meaning there are a whopping 187 countries and territories that US citizens can visit either without a visa or by getting one immediately on arrival – a list that includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, but not mainland China.
Elsewhere in the region, US passport holders can visit Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore on vacation visa-free for 30-90 days.
As a result, China has been further down the bucket list for many American travelers, who considered the country “too hard” to visit.
China tries to lure foreign tourists with expanded visa-free scheme after weak post-pandemic bounce back
Now, Americans who want to get a Chinese tourist visa (L-visa) no longer have to submit proof of a round-trip flight booking, a hotel reservation, an organized itinerary or a letter of invitation.
The Chinese embassy in Washington announced the newly relaxed guidelines on December 29, 2023, citing the desire “to further facilitate people-to-people exchanges.”
State-run media outlet Xinhua also reported that the Civil Aviation Administration of China plans to increase nonstop flights between the two countries.
Sam Fleischmann, a Pittsburgh-based education consultant planning to visit China in April, said he’s more inclined to do so now that certain restrictions have been lifted.
“If I’m in a city to do consultancy for two weeks, but I have other opportunities to go to a different city, it’s nice to have the flexibility that I don’t need my return ticket,” says Fleischmann. “I think spontaneous travel is one of the most beautiful things about traveling.”
For his next trip to Hong Kong, he’s considering staying in Shanghai for a few days thanks to the six-day visa-free transit policy, where citizens of 53 countries can enter and stay in designated cities and provinces in China without a visa if they meet certain criteria.
It’s not just Americans who stand to benefit from China opening up.
In November, China announced a trial program to allow visitors from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia to enter visa-free for 15 days.
Soon after, China and Thailand announced intentions of a reciprocal visa-free program, which the Chinese Foreign Ministry said would “serve the fundamental interests of both peoples.”
Visas weren’t the only challenge for Western tourists going to China that the country has addressed.
Last year, the country’s main digital payment systems, WeChat Pay and Alipay, opened up to users with non-Chinese credit cards and bank accounts, thus eliminating a major pain point for foreign visitors.

Since last July, visitors have also been able to link their Visa and Mastercard accounts to China’s most popular mobile payment platforms – allowing them to book taxis, ride the subway and pay for goods and services at millions of outlets across the near-cashless country, though a fee may be added for larger transactions.
However, one thing that hasn’t eased is the US State Department’s guidance on going to China. It lists China as a level three or “orange” country, which means “reconsider travel.”
The guidance reads: “Reconsider travel to Mainland China due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans, and the risk of wrongful detentions.”
China enforced one of the world’s strictest lockdowns during the pandemic, which battered the economy. The consequences of these policies can be seen in the slowdown and dismal economic results last year.
“The impact of Covid lockdowns communicated to the rest of the world in the sense that China was closed and closing off, and so by changing these rules, it sends the message that it’s opening back up,” says Hong Kong University tourism professor Benjamin Iaquinto.
“The economy in China is not doing so well. And this is probably going to help contribute to boosting it back up again, there are also concerns with its international reputation,” he added.
However, according to Iaquinto, geopolitical tensions – including “volatile” US-China relations – mean that these changes might not be permanent.
“If there’s some type of blowup between the two countries, not necessarily in terms of war, but some type of political argument,” he said, “that might result in China responding by reversing those changes.”

Since last July, visitors have also been able to link their Visa and Mastercard accounts to China’s most popular mobile payment platforms – allowing them to book taxis, ride the subway and pay for goods and services at millions of outlets across the near-cashless country, though a fee may be added for larger transactions.
However, one thing that hasn’t eased is the US State Department’s guidance on going to China. It lists China as a level three or “orange” country, which means “reconsider travel.”
The guidance reads: “Reconsider travel to Mainland China due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans, and the risk of wrongful detentions.”
China enforced one of the world’s strictest lockdowns during the pandemic, which battered the economy. The consequences of these policies can be seen in the slowdown and dismal economic results last year.
“The impact of Covid lockdowns communicated to the rest of the world in the sense that China was closed and closing off, and so by changing these rules, it sends the message that it’s opening back up,” says Hong Kong University tourism professor Benjamin Iaquinto.
“The economy in China is not doing so well. And this is probably going to help contribute to boosting it back up again, there are also concerns with its international reputation,” he added.
However, according to Iaquinto, geopolitical tensions – including “volatile” US-China relations – mean that these changes might not be permanent.
“If there’s some type of blowup between the two countries, not necessarily in terms of war, but some type of political argument,” he said, “that might result in China responding by reversing those changes.”

The event, which raised €1.31m in total, was attended by US Climate Envoy John Kerry along with many other climate action visionaries. Art pieces and unique jewelry were also auctioned off.
“Amidst the ongoing fight against pollution, I also witness the progress that has been achieved. We have come a long way. Today, so many people are here to be part of the solution,” Schwarzenegger said at the dinner. “I extend my gratitude to everyone who has joined my fight against pollution.”
Schwarzenegger is facing criminal tax proceedings for failing to declare the Audemars Piguet watch to customs officers in Munich after he got off a flight from Los Angeles, a Munich Customs press officer told CNN Wednesday.
“He did not declare a product. A product that was imported from non-EU countries in order to remain in the EU. And this process applies to everyone,” press officer Thomas Meister said.
Meister said the former California governor and “Terminator” star was released and traveled on after being held for over two hours.
The actor agreed to pre-pay potential taxes on the watch but the officers failed to get a credit card machine to work for an hour until they gave up and brought him to a bank and asked him to withdraw cash from an ATM to pay, a source close to the actor told CNN.
The ATM they brought him to had a limit that was too low, and the bank was closed.
When he returned, a new officer brought a new credit card machine that worked, the source added.

Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was handed a 2.5-year sentence on Tuesday which was commuted to a fine of 27,300 Turkish Liras ($910 USD) after he accepted the charge of “reckless killing” for fatally striking Yunus Emre Gocer, a married father of two, in late November, according to Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber.
The case initially sparked controversy in Turkey after Mohamud left the country following the deadly incident, prompting criticism of perceived inaction by police and prosecutors. An arrest warrant for Mohamud was dropped when he returned to Turkey in order to give a statement in court on Friday, according to TRT.
Mohamud was not required to be in court on Tuesday when the verdict in the case was read. He was originally handed a 3-year prison sentence, which was decreased to 2.5 years for “good conduct,” according to TRT. According to Turkish penal code, the court can opt to convert a sentence of that length to a fine, which it did, sparing Mohamud any prison time. His driver’s license will also be cancelled for six months, according to TRT.
Iyaz Cimen, the lawyer representing Gocer’s family, told CNN that his clients had agreed to drop their formal complaint against Mohamud. He would not say what, if any, deal with Mohamud prompted that decision, or whether the family would be financially compensated.
Mohamud’s case is one of two incidents involving the sons of prominent foreign officials that have raised questions about fairness in the justice system. In December, there was a second collision allegedly involving the son of a former Yemeni defense minister, who police say hit two pedestrians. One of the victims was seriously injured.
The two cases have no direct connection to one another, beyond the coincidental timing, and the harsh public spotlight cast on both – especially after early missteps and discrepancies by police and prosecutors in the first.
According to Turkish police, 40-year-old Mohamud, the son of Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, was behind the wheel of a black BMW with diplomatic plates in southwest Istanbul when it struck Gocer, a delivery driver on a scooter, on November 30.
According to a statement from the prosecutor, Gocer died on December 6 and “therefore the nature of the crime changed” from the charge of “reckless injury” to “reckless killing.” Two days later, an arrest warrant was issued.

Cimen, the lawyer representing Gocer’s family, told CNN in December that Mohamud had left the country on December 2, before the warrant was issued.
Cimen had previously told CNN that the initial police report suggested the victim had made an illegal lane change, but only after public scrutiny, and after the victim died and the charge became more serious, did a subsequent report cast doubt on the initial police assessment of what happened. That second report, written by independent experts, says that the “primarily negligent party” was Mohamud.
A third report, meant to resolve discrepancies between the initial police report and the subsequent expert report, produced a more mixed result. Published December 18 by the Traffic Specialization Department of the Forensic Medicine Institute, it affirmed that Mohamud was “primarily at fault,” but also found that Gocer was also “secondarily at fault.” The report says that Gocer was in front of Mohamud in the second-to-right lane, while Mohamud was behind in the right lane.
Gocer slowed to change lanes to the right, and that’s when he was hit. It blames Mohamud for failing to hit the brakes and slow down, but it also blames Gocer for failing to adequately check his mirrors to see Mohamud behind him and slowing to a stop on a road with a speed limit of 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour.
The perceived initial failings quickly led to public outrage, with motorcycle drivers and couriers staging a protest in December calling for justice for Gocer.
Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, said in December that he was glad the prosecutor’s office had issued the arrest warrant. The mayor had written on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the prosecutor’s office would need to explain discrepancies between the initial police report and the latest statement “which allowed the suspect to flee abroad.”
CNN reached out to the Somali consulate for comment in December but did not receive a response. In an interview with the Associated Press published December 14, the Somali president denied that his son had fled the country, saying that he left because he had business elsewhere and there was no arrest warrant for him. President Mohamud told the AP he was sorry for Gocer’s family for his loss, and said that he has advised his son to go back to Turkey for court proceedings. “The decision is his — but I am giving that advice,” he said.
At the time, Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported that Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc told reporters in Ankara he had personally spoken with the Somali justice minister.
“In the coming days, the defendant will come to Turkey and participate in the trial process,” he said, according to Anadolu. “”We will never allow any of our citizens to lose their rights and legal interests in favor of a foreigner. We will follow the incident to the end. We will work for justice to prevail.”

In the second, separate incident in early December in central Istanbul, Musaeed Ahmed Musaeed Hussein, the son of Yemen’s former Defense Minister Ahmed Musaeed Hussein, was behind the wheel of a vehicle that hit two people as they were crossing the street, according to the statement Hussein gave to prosecutors.One of them was a 71-year-old named Pakize Ozer, who was seriously injured, according to CNN Turk. “The complainant suddenly appeared in front of me. Since the sun was coming from the opposite direction, I didn’t see exactly where she was coming from,” he said in his statement to prosecutors. In that report he said that Ozer was not in a pedestrian crosswalk and he denied that he was at fault.
Hussein’s father was in the passenger seat at the time. CNN Turk reported in December that Ozer was in hospital in life-threatening condition, but Hussein’s lawyer, Kerim Bahadır Seker, now says that she has since left hospital. He says his client is currently under house arrest and a travel ban prevents him from leaving the country.
Last month, he told CNN Turk that his client was not speeding or under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the collision.
Grainy videos purportedly showing security camera footage of each crash have been widely broadcast on Turkish media, which has heavily covered both incidents."

CPNVYOB5Q4_7NZ75MXVB9GE3Z2,Unofficial US delegation says support for Taiwan remains ‘rock solid’ after voters defied China,"By Nectar Gan and Eric Cheung, CNN","4 minute read Updated 3:01 AM EST, Mon January 15, 2024",20240115,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/15/asia/us-unofficial-delegation-visit-taiwan-intl-hnk/,"Former senior US officials reaffirmed “rock solid” American support for Taiwan in a visit Monday after the self-ruled island defied threats from China by electing a new president loathed by Beijing.
Lai Ching-te, a staunch defender of Taiwan’s sovereignty and democracy, on Saturday won a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), shrugging off warnings from Beijing that his election would increase the risk of conflict.
In keeping with past US practice, the Biden administration dispatched an unofficial delegation to Taiwan following the election to meet the island’s current and incoming presidents. But the US reaction to the election has already sparked an angry response from China.
In a meeting with Taiwan’s incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen Monday, former US national security adviser Stephen Hadley congratulated Taiwan on the elections on behalf of the American people, praising the self-ruled island’s democracy as a “shining example for the world.”
Hadley reaffirmed that “the American commitment to Taiwan is rock solid, principled and bipartisan.”
“We look forward to continuity in the relationship between Taiwan and the United States under the new administration and for common efforts to preserve cross-strait peace and stability,” he said.

Former deputy secretary of state James Steinberg said the delegation traveled to Taiwan to “underscore the US bipartisan support for our long-standing friendship for Taiwan.”
During Tsai’s eight years in office, Taiwan has bolstered its ties with its democratic partners, especially the US, its biggest international backer, which increased support and arms sales to the island.
The delegation also met with Lai and Vice President-elect Hsiao Bi-khim, a well-known figure in Washington after serving as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States.
In the meeting, Lai called the US “Taiwan’s most important partner,” and expressed gratitude for its long-standing support to the island.
Lai vowed to build on Tsai’s efforts to defend peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. “And we hope that the United States will continue to support Taiwan to deepen our cooperation in this area,” he said.
“I believe that our relationship will continue to flourish as we work together, and it will become an important force in defending peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,” he added.
The visit came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday congratulated Lai on his win and Taiwan’s people “for once again demonstrating the strength of their robust democratic system and electoral process.”
In a statement, Blinken said the US looks forward to working with Lai and Taiwan’s leaders of all parties to “advance our shared interests and values, and to further our longstanding unofficial relationship.”
That statement prompted an angry response from Beijing, which views Taiwan as its own territory to be taken by force if necessary.
On Sunday, China’s Foreign Ministry said the statement “seriously violates the one-China principle” and US promises to only maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial ties with Taiwan.
“It also sends a gravely wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces. We strongly deplore and firmly oppose this, and have made serious representations to the US side,” the ministry said in a statement.
The Chinese embassies in Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada also lashed out at their host countries for congratulating Lai on his victory.
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa called Taiwan “an extremely crucial partner and an important friend” in her congratulatory message. The Chinese embassy in Tokyo said it “resolutely opposed” her statement, which it blasted as “a serious interference in China’s internal affairs.”
Taiwan was a Japanese colony for half a century until 1945.
Under Xi Jinping, China’s most powerful leader in a generation, Beijing has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan, and severed official communication with Taipei’s government since 2016. Lai’s election is unlikely to lead to a thawing of cross-strait ties any time soon.
Washington cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 after switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
Since then, the US has maintained close unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. But it has long remained deliberately vague on whether it will come to Taiwan’s defense in case of a Chinese attack.
Asked by reporters to comment on Taiwan’s election results Saturday, US President Joe Biden said: “We do not support independence.”"

The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, handed down the fine to Google, owned by Alphabet (GOOGL), in 2017 for using its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.
Juliane Kokott, Advocate General at the Court of Justice of the European Union, said judges should confirm the fine.
“Google … was leveraging its dominant position on the market for general search services to favor its own comparison shopping service by favoring the display of its results,” she said.
Judges, who follow the majority of such non-binding recommendations, will rule in the coming months.

Google said it would review the opinion and wait for the court ruling.
Irrespective of its appeal, the company continues “to invest in our remedy, which has been working successfully for several years, and will continue to work constructively with the European Commission,” a spokesperson said.
EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager is scheduled to meet Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and other Big Tech leaders in the United States later on Thursday to discuss competition and digital issues.
Google has also challenged two other EU rulings, regarding its Android mobile operating system and AdSense advertising service."

FY9FVZQY0B_EZR5OKEQL42U4TF,Why are Iran and Pakistan striking each other’s territory – and what does it have to do with the Middle East?,"By Sophia Saifi, Adam Pourahmadi, Azaz Syed and Jessie Yeung, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:34 PM EST, Thu January 18, 2024",20240118,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/18/world/iran-pakistan-attacks-tensions-explainer-intl-hnk/,"Pakistan and Iran have both conducted strikes on each other’s territories in an unprecedented escalation of hostilities between the neighbors, at a time when tensions have risen sharply across the Middle East and beyond.
The two countries share a volatile border, stretching about 900 kilometers (560 miles), with Pakistan’s Balochistan province on one side and Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province on the other.
Both nations have long fought militants in the restive Baloch region along the border. But while the two countries share a common separatist enemy, it is highly unusual for either side to attack militants on each other’s soil.
The latest strikes come as Iran’s allies and proxies in the Middle East – the so-called axis of resistance – launch attacks on Israeli forces and its allies against the backdrop of the war in Gaza.
Here’s what you need to know.
The opening salvo in this fast-moving sequence of events began Tuesday when Iran conducted strikes on Pakistan’s Balochistan province – killing two children and wounding several others, according to Pakistani authorities.
Iran claimed it had “only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan” and that no Pakistani nationals were targeted.
But the attack sparked anger in Pakistan, which called the strike “an egregious violation of international law and the spirit of bilateral relations between Pakistan and Iran.”
Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency said it had been targeting strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, or Army of Justice.
The separatist militant group operates on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border and has previously claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian targets. Its ultimate goal is independence for Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province.
Nuclear-armed Pakistan is majority Sunni – the dominant branch of Islam – while Iran and its “axis of resistance” is largely Shia.
Pakistan struck back two days later with what it called a “series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes” on several alleged separatist hideouts in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Announcing the strikes on Thursday, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said a number of militants were killed. At least 10 people — all Pakistani nationals — were killed, Tasnim reported, citing the deputy governor of Sistan and Baluchestan, who said authorities were investigating how those people had “settled in the village.”
Pakistan said it had for years complained that separatist fighters had “safe havens and sanctuaries” in Iran – and was forced to take matters into its own hands with Thursday’s strikes.
Pakistan and Iran’s struggle against separatists operating on either side of each other’s borders is not new.
Deadly clashes along the turbulent border have happened regularly over the years. Just last month, Iran accused Jaish al-Adl militants of storming a police station in Sistan and Baluchestan, which resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian police officers, according to Tasnim.
What is highly unusual, however, is each side’s willingness to hit targets across those borders, without informing each other first. And all this is happening against the backdrop of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which has sent repercussions coursing through the region.
The larger regional conflict may have emboldened Iran to be more proactive in pursuing targets beyond its borders, experts say – especially as the United States walks a tightrope between de-escalating hostilities and flexing its own military might to deter further moves by Iran.

The day before the strikes in Pakistan, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Iraq and Syria, claiming to be targeting a spy base for Israeli forces and “anti-Iran terror groups.”
Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah across the Lebanon border; and the US is fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked ships in the Red Sea in the name of revenge for Israel’s assault on Gaza.
“If you don’t censure Iran and its proxies … then there’s no cost for them to continue to pursue those activities,” said Karim Sadjadpour, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
He added that Iran’s dominant position in the Middle East, in contrast to conflict-ridden nations like Yemen and Syria, means it stands to gain from regional instability and “filling power vacuums.” And Iran’s activities now serve to further several of its main goals, which include empowering Palestinians and counteracting American influence in the Middle East, he said.
Retired US Army Gen. Wesley Clark, a former NATO supreme allied commander, said the various hostilities reflect Iran “striving to cement its role as a leader in the region.”
“It’s seeking regional hegemony,” he told CNN. “And when the United States and Israel are there, and Israel’s waging this campaign against Hamas, then Iran feels the need to strike back and assert itself.”
The Baloch people, also spelled Baluch, live where Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran meet. They have long exhibited a fiercely independent streak and always resented being ruled by both Islamabad and Tehran, with insurgencies bubbling across the porous border region for decades.
The area they live in is also rich in natural resources, but Baloch separatists complain that their people, some of the region’s poorest, have seen little wealth trickle down to their communities.
Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has witnessed a spate of deadly attacks in recent years, fueled by a decades-long insurgency by separatists who demand independence from the country, angered by what they say is the state’s monopoly and exploitation of the region’s mineral resources.
Iran has also faced a long history of insurgencies from its Kurdish, Arab and Baloch minorities.
Jaish al-Adl is just one of many separatist groups operating within Iran. It was originally part of a larger Sunni militant group called Jundallah, which fractured after its leader was executed by Iran in 2010, according to the US government’s National Counterterrorism Center. Jaish al-Adl emerged instead and has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US State Department.
The group often targets Iranian security personnel, government officials, and Shia civilians, according to the National Counterterrorism Center.
In 2015, the group claimed responsibility for an attack that killed eight Iranian border guards, with militants reportedly crossing into Iran from Pakistan. And in 2019, it claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that hit a bus carrying members of the Iranian military, killing at least 23 in Sistan-Baluchestan.
On Wednesday, a day after Iran’s strikes on Pakistan, Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for an attack on an Iranian military vehicle in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Iran’s strikes on Tuesday sparked a diplomatic spat, with Pakistan recalling its ambassador from Iran and suspending all high-level visits from its neighbor.
And after Pakistan’s strikes, Iran on Thursday demanded “an immediate explanation” from its neighbor, Tasnim reported – and the Iranian military conducted a large-scale exercise off the country’s southwest coast, involving the air force, naval forces and ground forces.
Nearby nations have weighed in, with Turkey’s foreign minister holding calls with his counterparts in both Iran and Pakistan. Afterward, he said neither country wanted to escalate tensions further.
India said it has “zero tolerance towards terrorism,” and that the attack was “a matter between Iran and Pakistan.” China urged both nations to exercise restraint, and the European Union said it was “gravely concerned by the spiral of violence in the Middle East and beyond.”
US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller also urged restraint on Thursday – but added he didn’t think the flare-up was “in any way, shape or form connected to Gaza.”
“But whenever you see things, see strikes in the region, given the tensions in the region, there is the risk for increase in conflict, which is something that we’re trying to avoid,” he said.
It is not clear whether either Iran or Pakistan would want to descend into full-blown hostilities over separatist groups that they both regard as an enemy.
Both sides issued statements after their respective strikes that hinted at a desire not to see things escalate.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry called Iran a “brotherly country” and emphasized the need to “find joint solutions.”

On the first of two days of hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), South Africa on Thursday argued that Israel’s air and ground assaults on Gaza were intended to “bring about the destruction” of its Palestinian population, and that comments made by Israeli leaders signalled their “genocidal intent.”
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s murderous rampage on October 7, when more than 1,200 people were killed and 240 hostages were taken back to Gaza. South Africa condemned Hamas’ attacks but said “nothing” could justify Israel’s response, which has killed more than 23,000 people in Gaza.
“The point is not simply that Israel is acting disproportionately. The point is that the prohibition on genocide is an absolute,” said Vaughan Lowe, one of the lawyers representing South Africa. “Nothing can ever justify genocide.”
Israel dismissed the case as “absurd blood libel,” and government spokesperson Eylon Levy said it is “tragic that the rainbow nation that prides itself on fighting racism will be fighting pro-bono for the anti-Jewish racists.”
Israel is facing a genocide case in international court. Could it halt the war in Gaza?
Israel is scheduled to deliver its response in court on Friday. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the country would make the case that the war was one of self-defense, and would show that Israel is doing its “utmost” under “extremely complicated circumstances” to avert civilian casualties.
The ICJ, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, was set up in June 1945 and hears cases brought by states accusing others of violating their UN treaty obligations. South Africa and Israel are signatories to the 1948 Genocide Convention, meaning they are obliged not to commit genocide and to prevent and punish it.
Experts say it is the first time that the Jewish state is being tried under the Genocide Convention, which was drawn up after World War II in light of the atrocities committed against the Jewish people during the Holocaust.
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them, and other countries who are party to the court have ignored its rulings in the past.
In an 84-page filing to the ICJ, South Africa argued that Israel is committing genocide by killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing serious mental and bodily harm, forced evacuation, widespread hunger, and by creating conditions “calculated to bring about their physical destruction.” It also accused Israel of failing to stem incitement to genocide in the public pronouncements of its officials.
During three hours of oral argument, lawyers representing South Africa asked the ICJ to order a suspension of Israel’s campaign in Gaza to protect the rights of Palestinians in Gaza “from imminent and irreparable loss.”
Such “provisional measures,” as they are known, function as a kind of restraining order to stop a dispute from escalating while the court considers the full merits of the case, which could take years. For provisional measures the court need only decide if prima facie, or “at first glance,” the acts complained of could fall foul of the genocide convention.
“It is not necessary for the court to come to a final view on the question of whether Israel’s conduct constitutes genocide. It is necessary to establish only whether at least some of the acts alleged are capable of falling within the provisions of the convention,” argued Adila Hassim, one of the lawyers representing South Africa.
In its opening remarks, South Africa said it “places Israel’s genocidal acts and omissions within the broader context of Israel’s 25-year apartheid, 56-year occupation, and 16-year siege imposed on the Gaza Strip.”
South Africa operated under a system of apartheid from 1948 until the early 1990s, and its governing African National Congress has long championed the Palestinian cause.
Ahead of the hearing South Africa was accused by Israel and others of hypocrisy for not also bringing a charge of genocide against Hamas, whose founding charter mandates the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel.
South Africa explained during the hearing that “Hamas is not a state and cannot be a party to the genocide convention,” and said the group would be accountable to “other bodies” such as the International Criminal Court, which tries individuals – rather than states – for crimes including war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a grouping of 57 Muslim countries, as well as Jordan, Turkey and Malaysia have so far backed South Africa’s case, while Israel’s allies have fiercely opposed it.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the case as “meritless,” and said it was “particularly galling given that those who are attacking Israel – Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, as well as their supporter of Iran – continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews.”
South Africa presented widely reported evidence that it said showed a “systematic pattern of conduct” by Israel “from which genocide can be inferred.” The UN defines genocide as an act “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”
“South Africa believes that the publicly available evidence of the scale of the destruction resulting from the bombardment of Gaza, and the deliberate restriction of food, water, medicines and electricity available to the population of Gaza, demonstrates that the government of Israel… is intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza as a group, and is doing nothing to prevent or punish the actions of others who support that aim,” said Lowe.
Citing previous CNN reporting that nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions that Israel has used in Gaza in its war with Hamas have been unguided “dumb bombs,” Vaughan said “it’s no use Israel saying it does whatever it can to minimize the deaths of innocent” Palestinians.
“The use of 2,000-pound bunker-busting bombs and dumb bombs in residential areas, and the relentless bombardment of Gaza… tell another story.”
Israel has repeatedly stressed that it is targeting Hamas – which has long been known to station military operations inside civilian buildings – rather than civilians in Gaza.
South Africa argued that the evacuation order issued by Israel to residents of northern Gaza on October 13 – the first of its kind – was itself “genocidal,” since “it required immediate movement… while no humanitarian assistance was permitted.” Israel said at the time that, by notifying the civilian population of a planned military attack, it was complying with international law.
As well as detailing the actions of the Israeli military, South Africa also cited public pronouncements by Israeli officials it alleged were genocidal in nature.
“Israel’s political leaders, military commanders, and persons holding official positions, have systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent,” argued Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.
Ngcukaitobi cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Israeli forces on October 28, ahead of the imminent launch of its ground offensive in Gaza.
“Remember what Amalek did to you,” Netanyahu said in his address, which Ngcukaitobi told the court “refers to a Biblical command by God to Saul for the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people known as the Amalekites.”
There is precedent for the court to grant the kind of emergency orders South Africa is calling for.
In January 2020, the court granted The Gambia’s request for provisional measures to protect the Rohingya people remaining in Myanmar from genocide. The Court has granted similar measures to protect Ukrainians from ongoing Russian aggression, and Bosnians during the Balkan Wars in the 1990s.
Max du Plessis, another of South Africa’s lawyers, said if the court failed to do so it risked treating Palestinians “differently, as less worthy of protection than others.”
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them. A 2022 report by Human Rights Watch found continued abuses against the Rohingya remaining in Myanmar, despite the provisional measures. Similarly, despite the court in March 2022 ordering Russia to immediately suspend its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow’s war rages on nearly two years later.
While an ICJ ruling against Israel may fail to constrain its military action, it could land a serious blow to Israel’s international reputation.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused South Africa of “functioning as the legal arm of Hamas” in furious comments on Thursday.
“Today we were witness to one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history, compounded by a series of false and baseless claims,” Lior Haiat, a spokesperson for the ministry, said on X.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also hit out at South Africa.
“Today, again, we saw an upside-down world, in which the State of Israel is accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting genocide,” he said during a televised speech Thursday.
“South Africa’s hypocrisy screams to the high heavens.”

H099GBH0II_FSPMF2F1I1WPI6T,Texas has until the end of today to stop blocking federal access to miles of the US-Mexico border,"By Alisha Ebrahimji, Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:57 PM EST, Wed January 17, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/us/texas-border-patrol-us-mexico/,"A migrant surge continues to overwhelm authorities at the US-Mexico border — and in US cities where many asylum-seekers are being sent.
Here are the latest developments:
The Biden administration has given Texas until the end of Wednesday to stop blocking the US Border Patrol’s access to 2.5 miles along the US-Mexico border that includes the area where a woman and two children drowned after state authorities last week barred federal agents from the zone, according to a Department of Homeland Security letter Sunday exclusively obtained by CNN.
The letter to Texas’ Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton says the state’s actions “have impeded operations” and are unconstitutional, and it cites the deaths – among the latest in the ongoing migrant crisis – near a city park abutting the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass where state authorities have erected fencing and kept out federal agents.
2 children and a woman drowned in the Rio Grande, authorities say, days after Texas blocked the feds amid migrant crisis
The Department of Homeland Security warns it will – by the end of Wednesday – “refer the matter to the Department of Justice for appropriate action and consider all other options available to restore Border Patrol’s access to the border” if Texas doesn’t confirm it will “cease and desist its efforts to block Border Patrol’s access in and around the Shelby Park area and remove all barriers to access to the U.S.-Mexico border,” the letter states.
“Texas’s failure to provide access to the border persists even in instances of imminent danger to life and safety,” the letter from Department of Homeland Security General Counsel Jonathan Meyer reads. “Texas has demonstrated that even in the most exigent circumstances, it will not allow Border Patrol access to the border to conduct law enforcement and emergency response activities.”
Paxton on Wednesday doubled down on the state’s actions, saying, “Texas will not surrender,” in a statement issued by his office.
Paxton responded to the federal government with a three-page letter claiming Texas has constitutional authority to defend its territory, a power he plans to continue to fight for in the courts, according to the letter.
In the letter, Paxton said Border Patrol personnel have access to Shelby Park to respond to medical emergencies.
The Wednesday deadline marks the latest signpost of intensifying tensions between state and federal officials as the White House and lawmakers challenge Texas’ policies, including a new law that makes entering the state illegally a state crime. Friction over the issue also has spilled into states where migrants have been sent by Texas officials or otherwise have gone and has prompted online anti-migrant rhetoric to swell.
The Biden administration also has asked the Supreme Court to intervene after Texas sued over Border Patrol agents’ practice of removing razor wire put in place by the state along part of the border near Eagle Pass. An appeals court ordered the agents to stop removing the wire while legal challenges play out, and the administration has asked the high court to step in on an emergency basis to wipe that order.
The drownings Friday “underscore that Texas is firm in its continued efforts to exercise complete control of the border and land … and to block Border Patrol’s access to the border even in emergency circumstances,” the Biden administration wrote late Monday in a filing to the Supreme Court in that case.
What we know about the drownings of 3 Mexican migrants near Eagle Pass, Texas
“It is impossible to say what might have happened if Border Patrol had had its former access to the area – including through its surveillance trucks that assisted in monitoring the area,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in the filing.
“At the very least, however, Border Patrol would have had the opportunity to take any available steps to fulfill its responsibilities and assist its counterparts in the Mexican government with undertaking the rescue mission,” she continued. “Texas made that impossible.”
The Texas Military Department, meanwhile, said by the time Border Patrol agents requested access to the site Friday night, “the drownings had occurred, Mexican authorities were recovering the bodies, and Border Patrol expressed these facts to the TMD personnel on site.”
“At no time did TMD security personnel along the river observe any distressed migrants, nor did TMD turn back any illegal immigrants from the US during this period,” the Texas Military Department said. “Also, at no point was TMD made aware of any bodies in the area of Shelby Park, nor was TMD made aware of any bodies being discovered on the US side of the border regarding this situation.”
The federal-state border standoff in Texas has prompted members of a kind of group known for using demonizing rhetoric and intersecting with extremists to issue a call on social media for people to travel to Eagle Pass in protest.
The group is urging “patriots” from across the country to go to Eagle Pass “to demand that elected officials honor their oath of office to defend the border against a ‘foreign invasion,’” according to a member’s online video that employs the term far-right groups use for the border crisis.
A property owner will let the group set up tents, campers and RVs, he says.
These “patriots,” however, are misinformed about border security and immigration policy, said Texas state Rep. Eddie Morales Jr., a Democrat who represents 11 counties in West Texas, including the city of Eagle Pass. Instead, they should camp outside Congress and demand lawmakers act on immigration, he said.
“The Republicans control the House of Representatives right now, if they were truly interested in solving this issue, they would fast track a border immigration and a border security bill by tomorrow,” Morales said.
Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber is monitoring the potential arrival this weekend of people from around the country and is concerned for the safety and security of the area due to the heated rhetoric on immigration, he told CNN.
Groups like this one that use “patriot” as part of their names have emerged since 2020 in an effort to get Donald Trump to form a third major political party, the Anti-Defamation League told CNN in a statement. While such groups are not inherently extremist, they engage in demonizing rhetoric, far-right policy causes and at times intersect with extremist groups and movements, it said.
A state away, Louisiana’s new Republican governor has directed state agencies to report any arrests of or funds spent on undocumented immigrants, he mandated in an executive order signed Friday.
﻿“The cost of illegal immigration in this state is falling on the shoulders of hard-working Louisianans,” Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement Tuesday. “This Executive Order will analyze data to determine the financial burden our citizens are being forced to carry because of those who do not follow the law.”
“Louisiana will always welcome those who legally immigrate, but taxpayers cannot continue to foot the bill for individuals who break the law and skip the line.”
The heads of every executive branch in the state must provide within 120 days a report to the governor’s office detailing any use “of public funds directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of illegal aliens,” the order says.
The governor directs the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections and the Superintendent of the Louisiana State Police to provide monthly reports on the number of people “charged or convicted of a criminal offense” and to note whether they are documented or undocumented, according to the order.
Law enforcement is also directed in the order to “regularly publish” to the public data regarding “arrests and convictions of illegal aliens,” their nationality, their offense, whether charged or convicted and report any “known or suspected gang affiliation” for arrested undocumented immigrants and where they were arrested.
This is a developing story and will be updated.

HYWMZUN1N4_L8K6ZDJAMQ2EA69,Why this American woman has ditched the US for Portugal,"By Silvia Marchetti, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:54 AM EST, Tue January 16, 2024",20240116,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/american-woman-ditched-us-portugal/,"Moving to a foreign country can be a scary decision. Particularly if it’s a country you’ve never even visited.
In 2021, Katie Meyer, a global hospitality communications professional from California, chose to do just that.
Meyer, who had previously lived and worked in London before returning to the US, relocated to Portugal during the Covid-19 pandemic, settling in the idyllic seaside resort of Cascais, close to Lisbon.
“My dream was to someday to return to Europe,” Meyer, 66, tells CNN. “Once remote work became standard and I sold my real estate in the US. I knew that relocation to Europe was a ‘now or never’ proposition.”
Her personal and professional travels had taken her to many countries in Europe throughout the years, but never Portugal.
While the sunny Mediterranean climate and Portugal’s laid-back vibe were part of the allure, Meyer was ready for a new chapter in her life.
Safety, quality of life, affordable medical care, and a relatively simple path to permanent residency and citizenship, were high on her list of priorities for her future country of residence, and Lisbon ticked all of her boxes.
Signs of the pandemic were still very evident when Meyer arrived in the Portuguese capital with five suitcases in tow in August 2021.
“Few hotels and restaurants open, a fraction of the number of usual tourists, mask-wearing the norm, I felt like I had Lisbon to myself,” she says.
Meyer rented an apartment for three months in Lisbon at first. But after exploring the area, she fell in love with the charms of nearby Cascais, a former fishing village that has been luring many expats recently.
This US couple sold their house and moved to Italy for good
She was struck by Cascais’ unplugged and somewhat sleepy feel, which was something she wasn’t accustomed to, and the fact that locals didn’t seem to use mobile phones at the market or cafes.
“Here, time stands still, and people relish time together,” she says. “Things take longer. In place of any sense of urgency you find a happier, more laid-back lifestyle.
“But one that can be very frustrating to Americans addicted to frenetic beats and trapped in the rat race.”
She says she was taken aback by the genuineness of the Portuguese people, their pride and joy in learning that an expat had chosen their country as a new home, and their willingness to help when she was struggling to communicate.
“Portuguese is a very difficult language to learn, but they are always willing to help with pronunciations and usage,” she says. “It is very much a welcoming culture.”
Later that year, Meyer bought a 95-square-meter, two-bedroom, split-level apartment with a roof terrace in a quiet neighborhood, close to cafés and cultural attractions.
Situated on a hill above the center of town, it offers striking views stretching from Cascais Bay and the ocean to the famous mountains and palaces of Sintra.
The purchase price was 595,000 euros (around $651,000). Even though Portugal saw an overall property price increase of 13.8% in 2021, with prices continuing to rise in the years since then, Meyer estimates that an apartment in a similar spot in California would have cost her at least triple.
Fortunately, Meyer was able to benefit from Portugal’s “golden visa” system, a five-year residence by investment program aimed at non-EU nationals, which is no longer available for real estate purchases.
To qualify, applicants were required to make a real estate purchase of a minimum of 500,000 euros ($547,000.)
The golden visa grants her visa-free travel through Europe’s Schengen Area. She also has the option to apply for Portuguese citizenship after holding a golden visa for five years, according to a recently amended law aimed at speeding up procedures.
They sold everything to become a digital nomad family. Here’s what happened next
But for Meyer, one of the cons to moving to a destination with such a slower-paced lifestyle has been getting through red tape, and she faced a wait of around two years to obtain her residency due to the Portugal’s previous long approval process.
“Word of mouth from others who have been through it reigns supreme,” she says. “And my advice would be to find a good attorney.”
Meyer says that Cascais’ strong sense of community played a part in her decision to build her new life there.
“People are very social and family-oriented,” she says. “On weekends I meet friends at the popular mercado, where, in addition to a farmers’ market, butchers, cheese and fishmongers, crafts, stands with clothing and household goods for sale, you can socialize and just watch the world go by.”
Savoring a creamy pastel de nata (egg or custard tarts) or a tosta mista (a grilled sandwich) at one of the local pastelaria shops is also a popular pastime here.
According to Meyer, the quality and speed of service in restaurants and hotels is slower than in the US, and deliveries and home repairs are also likely to take longer.
“On the upside, a restaurant server would never, ever present a bill without a customer asking for it,” she adds.
“That would be considered rude, even with a line of customers waiting for a table. And you won’t see people eating or drinking on the go, as you would in the US.”
Meyer has noticed that the absence of a tipping culture in Portugal is something that Americans find difficult to grasp.
“A small tip is always appreciated for good service and overall experience,” she adds. “But not mandatory. Americans over-tipping can even be considered rather vulgar in some circles.”
She’s picked up some local habits, like forsaking a clothes dryer, considered “the Portuguese way.”
However, Meyer hasn’t been able to give up air-conditioning – a 2022 study by real estate platform Idealista found that only one in four properties on the market in Portugal had air conditioning – and has a unit installed at her home.
Adapting to the local climate has also meant learning to deal with the high coastal humidity and the propensity for mold in winter.
“Due to different building standards than those we are accustomed to in the US, dampness and mold is common,” says Meyer.
“I’ve learned to live with various dehumidifying devices and the frequent airing out of my apartment during winter months. Just part of the new routine.”
Meyer’s also had to adapt to the intricately-designed cobblestones on the sidewalks of Portugal – calcada portuguesa – which can be “beautiful to the eye but treacherous to the body.”
“I slipped and fell on these slick stones several times when I first arrived, and quickly learned that this is simply a rite of passage,” she says, adding that she now wears sneakers to tackle them. “In Portugal, it’s function over style in the shoe department.”
She’s also had to get used to the Portuguese queuing systems. The phrase, “take a number,” has all-new meaning in Portugal, says Meyer.
“To get served at post offices, hospitals and pharmacies requires you go to a machine for a senha, a piece of paper containing a code indicating your place in line,” she explains.
“You may proceed to a desk only once your number is illuminated on a screen and called.”
However, Meyers feels that the affordable cost of living in Portugal outweighs any challenges, even though prices have risen in the years since she’s been there.
“When I arrived an Uber ride within the greater Cascais area started at 1.50 euros (around $1.64),” she says. “Today that is closer to 3.50 euros or 4 euros (about $4.38.)
“Recently, I had friends tell me that a round trip Uber ride they took in NYC – from Lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side – was $100, including tip, of course. Sticker shock is common for anyone living in Portugal and returning to the US.”
Back in late 2021, Meyer says that lunch for two (a fish, steak or stew main, vegetable and potatoes, two glasses of wine, bread and bottled water) would cost her 16 euros (around $17.50.) More recently, the price was 22 euros (around $24,) which she still considers to be a relative bargain.
Although Meyer has adapted well, she says she’s still trying to fully absorb the Cascais vibe and feel like a local.
“When living outside of the US, I consider myself first and foremost a foreigner,” she says.
“I know that I must adapt to a new and different culture, not vice versa. Embracing that mindset is fundamental to living abroad.”
Meyer gets homesick from time to time, but says she has no plans to return to the US, and wouldn’t swap her new life for anything.
“I miss my friends and family in the US, but living in a safe, peaceful, affordable and eye-opening environment is an indisputable trade-off,” she says.
“Portugal is a pretty wonderful travel destination – and I’ve had more US visitors these past two years than I probably would have had time to see if I were still living in the US.”"

Meyer gets homesick from time to time, but says she has no plans to return to the US, and wouldn’t swap her new life for anything.
“I miss my friends and family in the US, but living in a safe, peaceful, affordable and eye-opening environment is an indisputable trade-off,” she says.
“Portugal is a pretty wonderful travel destination – and I’ve had more US visitors these past two years than I probably would have had time to see if I were still living in the US.”"

The Pacific Island nation of Nauru on Monday announced it had severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan and established ties with China, a decision confirmed by Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry.
The move is the latest blow to Taiwan’s efforts to retain its dwindling number of diplomatic allies, and comes just two days after Taiwan’s voters defied China’s threats to elect a new president loathed by Beijing.
Lai Ching-te, the current vice president and a staunch defender of Taiwan’s distinct identity and sovereignty, won the presidential election on Saturday, handing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a historic third straight term.
Beijing had repeatedly warned Taiwan’s voters that his election would increase the risk of conflict.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as its own territory, despite having never controlled it, and has ramped up diplomatic pressure on Taipei in recent years, including by poaching its allies.
During the DPP’s eight years in power, Taiwan has lost 10 diplomatic allies to China.
Who is Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s new President?
On Monday, Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry condemned China in “the strongest possible terms” for Nauru’s diplomatic switch, which it said came at “a key moment” following the presidential election.
“China’s move is to suppress Taiwan’s democratic achievements,” Taiwan’s Deputy Foreign Minister Tien Chung-kwang told reporters.
Tien added that the severance of ties was a “very sudden move” by the Nauru government, which had congratulated Lai’s presidential victory over the weekend.
Tien said Taiwan will immediately suspend all official interactions with Nauru “to defend national dignity,” including closing its embassy and asking the Pacific Island nation to close its embassy in Taiwan.
Tien also claimed that Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry had received information that Chinese officials had courted politicians in Nauru with offers of economic assistance.
He refused to put a figure on the alleged inducement, but said it was “beyond what we are able to assist our diplomatic allies with.”
In a regular news briefing Monday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson did not divulge whether Beijing had pledged financial aid to Nauru, but welcomed its move.
“It is Nauru’s right decision made on its own volition as an independent sovereign nation to announce its recognition of the one-China principle, its severance of ties with Taiwan and resumption of diplomatic relations with China after Taiwan’s election,” spokesperson Mao Ning said. “This also shows that the one-China principle is a general trend and the common aspiration of the people.”
This is the second time Nauru has severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The Pacific Island country first cut ties in 2002, followed by a resumption in 2005.
The Nauru government said its resumption of diplomatic relations with China was “in the best interests” of the country and its people.
“This means that the Republic of Nauru will no longer recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China’s territory, and will sever ‘diplomatic relations’ with Taiwan as of this day and no longer develop any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan,” it said in a statement.
Unofficial US delegation says support for Taiwan remains ‘rock solid’ after voters defied China
Nauru’s switch of allegiance leaves Taiwan with only 12 diplomatic allies, mostly small nations in the Pacific Ocean and Latin America, and the Vatican.
Nauru’s announcement came as an unofficial US delegation reaffirmed “rock solid” US support for Taiwan during a visit to the island to meet its current and incoming presidents.
Washington cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 after switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
But since then, the US has maintained close unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
Many other Western nations, including several in Europe, have also retained informal relations with Taipei in the guise of trade offices.
Analysts say these unofficial relationships with powerful Western nations are in many ways more consequential than the official diplomatic ties it maintains with a handful of smaller countries.
However, formal diplomatic relations allow those countries to advocate on behalf of Taiwan in international bodies that the island is locked out of, such as the United Nations.

The event, which raised €1.31m in total, was attended by US Climate Envoy John Kerry along with many other climate action visionaries. Art pieces and unique jewelry were also auctioned off.
“Amidst the ongoing fight against pollution, I also witness the progress that has been achieved. We have come a long way. Today, so many people are here to be part of the solution,” Schwarzenegger said at the dinner. “I extend my gratitude to everyone who has joined my fight against pollution.”
Schwarzenegger is facing criminal tax proceedings for failing to declare the Audemars Piguet watch to customs officers in Munich after he got off a flight from Los Angeles, a Munich Customs press officer told CNN Wednesday.
“He did not declare a product. A product that was imported from non-EU countries in order to remain in the EU. And this process applies to everyone,” press officer Thomas Meister said.
Meister said the former California governor and “Terminator” star was released and traveled on after being held for over two hours.
The actor agreed to pre-pay potential taxes on the watch but the officers failed to get a credit card machine to work for an hour until they gave up and brought him to a bank and asked him to withdraw cash from an ATM to pay, a source close to the actor told CNN.
The ATM they brought him to had a limit that was too low, and the bank was closed.
When he returned, a new officer brought a new credit card machine that worked, the source added.

K8EBKZ83AO_MO01V1CS6BX42FL,"Who is Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s new President?","By Nectar Gan, CNN","8 minute read Updated 9:58 PM EST, Sat January 13, 2024",20240114,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/14/asia/profile-lai-ching-te-taiwan-new-president-intl-hnk/,"Lai Ching-te, a former doctor from a poor mining family, was propelled into politics by a military crisis in the Taiwan Strait 27 years ago.
Now, the soft-spoken political veteran is tasked with preventing another one from happening as the newly elected leader of the self-ruled island that China’s Communist Party has vowed to one day absorb.
On Saturday, Lai, 64, the current vice president from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), won a widely watched election to become Taiwan’s next president.
His victory handed the DPP a historic third consecutive term, delivering a snub to years of growing threats from Taiwan’s much-larger authoritarian neighbor, China.
“The election has shown the world the commitment of the Taiwanese people to democracy, which I hope China can understand,” Lai told thousands of jubilant supporters at a rally after his win.
Lai, who has long faced Beijing’s wrath for championing Taiwan’s sovereignty, said as president he has “an important responsibility to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” pledging to pursue dialogue with China under the principles of dignity and parity.
“At the same time, we’re also determined to safeguard Taiwan from continuing threats and intimidation from China,” he told reporters ahead of his victory speech.
Under leader Xi Jinping, China’s most assertive leader in a generation, Beijing has ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on Taiwan, which it views as its own territory to be seized by force if necessary.
Tensions across the Taiwan Strait are at their highest since 1996, when China fired missiles into waters off Taiwan’s coast to intimidate voters ahead of the island’s first free presidential election – after the nascent democracy emerged from decades of its own authoritarian rule.
For Lai, then a fresh-faced doctor at a university hospital in the southern city of Tainan, that missile crisis became his “defining moment.”
“I decided I had a duty to participate in Taiwan’s democracy and help protect this fledgling experiment from those who wished it harm,” he wrote in The Wall Street Journal last year.
Lai hung up his white coat to run for office – first becoming a legislator, then a popular two-term mayor of Tainan, before serving as the premier and – since 2020 – the vice president of incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen.
The doctor-turned politician has now broken the “eight-year curse” of Taiwan politics – a popular term nodding to the fact that, until Lai’s victory, no political party had ever stayed in power for more than two terms since Taiwan became a democracy.
Lai called his foray into politics an “unexpected journey.”
Growing up in poverty in a mining village near the northern coast of Taiwan, Lai had dreamed of becoming a doctor since childhood. He had five siblings, and his mother raised them alone by doing odd jobs. His father, a coal miner, died in a work accident when Lai was a small child.
Lai was too young to remember his father. “But one day I suddenly realized, the biggest asset my father left me was that my family was poor,” he said at an event in March last year.
“Growing up in such a family, we will be more mature, have more willpower, and have more courage to overcome difficulties.”
After completing a bachelor’s degree in physical medicine and rehabilitation in Taipei, Lai went to Tainan for medical school.
He was a few years into a promising career as a physician in Tainan when a local DPP official approached him. He asked the popular doctor to help a DPP politician campaign for local elections.
It was 1994, less than a decade after the DPP first emerged from Taiwan’s democracy movement against the authoritarian rule of the Kuomintang (KMT).
Before lifting martial law in 1987 and transitioning slowly toward free elections, the KMT ruled Taiwan with an iron fist for nearly four decades after fleeing to the island from mainland China after losing the civil war to the Communist forces there.
Tens of thousands of political opponents were killed or jailed during what came to be known as the “White Terror” and the DPP was formed by many veterans of those who had campaigned for democracy.
While Lai was in college in Taipei, he and his roommates had closely followed news of the KMT’s brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. “I was full of doubts and concerns for the future of this country,” he said in video released by his presidential election campaign.
Lai agreed to help the DPP with the local election, but the candidate lost in the end.
A year later, some democracy activists invited Lai to join the DPP to run for the legislature.
He initially rejected the idea. “I was born and raised in a rural, impoverished place, and I had always wanted to be a doctor. Now, I’ve finally made it this far to become a chief physician,” he said in the campaign video.
But his political friends refused to give up. Months later, crisis flared in the Taiwan Strait as China held live-fire exercises and fired missiles toward Taiwan, giving Lai a final push across the line.
“Instead of criticizing the ruling government at the time from my clinic, wouldn’t it be better to come out and follow the vanguards of the democratic movement and actually do something for Taiwan?” he said in the video.
“I also thought that in this life, if I could find a project that makes me feel passionate to embark on, it would be a life worth living.”
In the lead-up to the election, China made no secret of its desire to prevent a Lai victory.
Chinese officials repeatedly framed the vote as a choice between “peace and war” – echoing a talking point of the KMT’s Hou Yu-ih, Beijing’s preferred candidate – while railing against Lai for triggering “cross-strait confrontation and conflict.”
Hailing from a more radical wing of the DPP, Lai was once an open supporter of Taiwan independence – a red line for Beijing.
His views tempered as he rose through the ranks. But China never forgave him for his comments from six years ago, in which he described himself as a “practical worker for Taiwan independence.”
Lai now says he favors the current status quo, proclaiming that “Taiwan is already an independent sovereign country” so there is “no plan or need” to declare independence.
That deliberately nuanced stance mimics his outgoing predecessor Tsai, Taiwan’s first female president, who was unable to stand again because of term limits.
Beijing cut off official communications with Taipei after Tsai took office in 2016 and ramped up its campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally, something that looks set to continue when Lai is inaugurated and fully takes over in May.
In many ways Beijing’s rhetoric towards Lai is even more hostile than how it viewed Tsai.
China’s government and state media regularly rebuke Lai, calling him a dangerous separatist, “troublemaker” and “war maker,” while rejecting his repeated offers for talks.
One such offer was made to China’s top leader, Xi.
In May last year, at a quick-fire Q&A session with students at his alma mater, National Taiwan University, Lai named Xi as the head of state he would most like to have dinner with.
If he had a chance to dine with Xi, Lai said, he would advise the Chinese leader to “chill out a little.”
“No need to be so stressed,” he said.
Asked about Lai’s invitation, Beijing said his comments were “weird” and accused Lai of “trying to put on the cloak of goodwill” given that his “Taiwan independence nature” had not changed.
Lai’s running mate Hsiao Bi-khim, who was elected vice president Saturday, was also openly loathed by Beijing. Hsiao, who recently served as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States, was sanctioned twice by China for being a “diehard secessionist.”
Lai earned more than 40 percent of the popular vote, while the KMT scooped up 33 percent and a newer opposition party, the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP), racked up 26 percent.
The DPP lost its majority in the legislature, taking 51 of the 113 seats, meaning Lai may find himself more constrained than Tsai and needing to rely on political alliances to pass legislation.
Hours after Lai declared victory, China dismissed the outcome of Taiwan’s elections, saying the DPP “does not represent mainstream public opinion” on the island.
“Taiwan is China’s Taiwan,” China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement on Saturday night.
“This election cannot change the shared hope from compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to get closer and closer, it moreover cannot stop the inevitable destiny that our motherland will be united.”
But that assertion could not be further from Taiwan’s mainstream public opinion.
Under Xi’s strongarm tactics, Taiwan’s public has shifted determinedly away from China. Less than 10 percent now support an immediate or eventual unification, and less than 3 percent identify primarily as Chinese.
The majority of Taiwanese want to maintain the current status quo and show no desire to be ruled by Beijing.
“We have been bullied for years on end. I just can’t stand kneeling down to their demands and their meddling with our elections. We want to keep our free style of living and our democracy,” Yang Wei-ting, a 27-year-old civil servant, said amid cheers and celebrations at Lai’s rally.
“I think the most important part for us is to work with like-minded partners around the globe, and tell China that we’re not alone and we’re not scared. We’re standing in the face of an authoritarian regime, but we’re backed by many like-minded countries.”

LV2QJBQB5T_71SJ47HE2NYBVDC,Why are Iran and Pakistan striking each other’s territory – and what does it have to do with the Middle East?,"By Sophia Saifi, Adam Pourahmadi, Azaz Syed and Jessie Yeung, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:34 PM EST, Thu January 18, 2024",20240118,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/18/world/iran-pakistan-attacks-tensions-explainer-intl-hnk/,"Pakistan and Iran have both conducted strikes on each other’s territories in an unprecedented escalation of hostilities between the neighbors, at a time when tensions have risen sharply across the Middle East and beyond.
The two countries share a volatile border, stretching about 900 kilometers (560 miles), with Pakistan’s Balochistan province on one side and Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province on the other.
Both nations have long fought militants in the restive Baloch region along the border. But while the two countries share a common separatist enemy, it is highly unusual for either side to attack militants on each other’s soil.
The latest strikes come as Iran’s allies and proxies in the Middle East – the so-called axis of resistance – launch attacks on Israeli forces and its allies against the backdrop of the war in Gaza.
Here’s what you need to know.
The opening salvo in this fast-moving sequence of events began Tuesday when Iran conducted strikes on Pakistan’s Balochistan province – killing two children and wounding several others, according to Pakistani authorities.
Iran claimed it had “only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan” and that no Pakistani nationals were targeted.
But the attack sparked anger in Pakistan, which called the strike “an egregious violation of international law and the spirit of bilateral relations between Pakistan and Iran.”
Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency said it had been targeting strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, or Army of Justice.
The separatist militant group operates on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border and has previously claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian targets. Its ultimate goal is independence for Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province.
Nuclear-armed Pakistan is majority Sunni – the dominant branch of Islam – while Iran and its “axis of resistance” is largely Shia.
Pakistan struck back two days later with what it called a “series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes” on several alleged separatist hideouts in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Announcing the strikes on Thursday, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said a number of militants were killed. At least 10 people — all Pakistani nationals — were killed, Tasnim reported, citing the deputy governor of Sistan and Baluchestan, who said authorities were investigating how those people had “settled in the village.”
Pakistan said it had for years complained that separatist fighters had “safe havens and sanctuaries” in Iran – and was forced to take matters into its own hands with Thursday’s strikes.
Pakistan and Iran’s struggle against separatists operating on either side of each other’s borders is not new.
Deadly clashes along the turbulent border have happened regularly over the years. Just last month, Iran accused Jaish al-Adl militants of storming a police station in Sistan and Baluchestan, which resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian police officers, according to Tasnim.
What is highly unusual, however, is each side’s willingness to hit targets across those borders, without informing each other first. And all this is happening against the backdrop of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which has sent repercussions coursing through the region.
The larger regional conflict may have emboldened Iran to be more proactive in pursuing targets beyond its borders, experts say – especially as the United States walks a tightrope between de-escalating hostilities and flexing its own military might to deter further moves by Iran.

The day before the strikes in Pakistan, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Iraq and Syria, claiming to be targeting a spy base for Israeli forces and “anti-Iran terror groups.”
Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah across the Lebanon border; and the US is fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked ships in the Red Sea in the name of revenge for Israel’s assault on Gaza.
“If you don’t censure Iran and its proxies … then there’s no cost for them to continue to pursue those activities,” said Karim Sadjadpour, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
He added that Iran’s dominant position in the Middle East, in contrast to conflict-ridden nations like Yemen and Syria, means it stands to gain from regional instability and “filling power vacuums.” And Iran’s activities now serve to further several of its main goals, which include empowering Palestinians and counteracting American influence in the Middle East, he said.
Retired US Army Gen. Wesley Clark, a former NATO supreme allied commander, said the various hostilities reflect Iran “striving to cement its role as a leader in the region.”
“It’s seeking regional hegemony,” he told CNN. “And when the United States and Israel are there, and Israel’s waging this campaign against Hamas, then Iran feels the need to strike back and assert itself.”
The Baloch people, also spelled Baluch, live where Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran meet. They have long exhibited a fiercely independent streak and always resented being ruled by both Islamabad and Tehran, with insurgencies bubbling across the porous border region for decades.
The area they live in is also rich in natural resources, but Baloch separatists complain that their people, some of the region’s poorest, have seen little wealth trickle down to their communities.
Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has witnessed a spate of deadly attacks in recent years, fueled by a decades-long insurgency by separatists who demand independence from the country, angered by what they say is the state’s monopoly and exploitation of the region’s mineral resources.
Iran has also faced a long history of insurgencies from its Kurdish, Arab and Baloch minorities.
Jaish al-Adl is just one of many separatist groups operating within Iran. It was originally part of a larger Sunni militant group called Jundallah, which fractured after its leader was executed by Iran in 2010, according to the US government’s National Counterterrorism Center. Jaish al-Adl emerged instead and has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US State Department.
The group often targets Iranian security personnel, government officials, and Shia civilians, according to the National Counterterrorism Center.
In 2015, the group claimed responsibility for an attack that killed eight Iranian border guards, with militants reportedly crossing into Iran from Pakistan. And in 2019, it claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that hit a bus carrying members of the Iranian military, killing at least 23 in Sistan-Baluchestan.
On Wednesday, a day after Iran’s strikes on Pakistan, Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for an attack on an Iranian military vehicle in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Iran’s strikes on Tuesday sparked a diplomatic spat, with Pakistan recalling its ambassador from Iran and suspending all high-level visits from its neighbor.
And after Pakistan’s strikes, Iran on Thursday demanded “an immediate explanation” from its neighbor, Tasnim reported – and the Iranian military conducted a large-scale exercise off the country’s southwest coast, involving the air force, naval forces and ground forces.
Nearby nations have weighed in, with Turkey’s foreign minister holding calls with his counterparts in both Iran and Pakistan. Afterward, he said neither country wanted to escalate tensions further.
India said it has “zero tolerance towards terrorism,” and that the attack was “a matter between Iran and Pakistan.” China urged both nations to exercise restraint, and the European Union said it was “gravely concerned by the spiral of violence in the Middle East and beyond.”
US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller also urged restraint on Thursday – but added he didn’t think the flare-up was “in any way, shape or form connected to Gaza.”
“But whenever you see things, see strikes in the region, given the tensions in the region, there is the risk for increase in conflict, which is something that we’re trying to avoid,” he said.
It is not clear whether either Iran or Pakistan would want to descend into full-blown hostilities over separatist groups that they both regard as an enemy.
Both sides issued statements after their respective strikes that hinted at a desire not to see things escalate.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry called Iran a “brotherly country” and emphasized the need to “find joint solutions.”
That echoed the Iranian foreign minister, who called Pakistan a “friendly country” earlier this week and said their strikes were proportionate and only aimed at militants."
M8KU4231RL_FDOWXYNIASBJZ32,Texas has until the end of today to stop blocking federal access to miles of the US-Mexico border,"By Alisha Ebrahimji, Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:57 PM EST, Wed January 17, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/17/us/texas-border-patrol-us-mexico/,"A migrant surge continues to overwhelm authorities at the US-Mexico border — and in US cities where many asylum-seekers are being sent.
Here are the latest developments:
The Biden administration has given Texas until the end of Wednesday to stop blocking the US Border Patrol’s access to 2.5 miles along the US-Mexico border that includes the area where a woman and two children drowned after state authorities last week barred federal agents from the zone, according to a Department of Homeland Security letter Sunday exclusively obtained by CNN.
The letter to Texas’ Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton says the state’s actions “have impeded operations” and are unconstitutional, and it cites the deaths – among the latest in the ongoing migrant crisis – near a city park abutting the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass where state authorities have erected fencing and kept out federal agents.
2 children and a woman drowned in the Rio Grande, authorities say, days after Texas blocked the feds amid migrant crisis
The Department of Homeland Security warns it will – by the end of Wednesday – “refer the matter to the Department of Justice for appropriate action and consider all other options available to restore Border Patrol’s access to the border” if Texas doesn’t confirm it will “cease and desist its efforts to block Border Patrol’s access in and around the Shelby Park area and remove all barriers to access to the U.S.-Mexico border,” the letter states.
“Texas’s failure to provide access to the border persists even in instances of imminent danger to life and safety,” the letter from Department of Homeland Security General Counsel Jonathan Meyer reads. “Texas has demonstrated that even in the most exigent circumstances, it will not allow Border Patrol access to the border to conduct law enforcement and emergency response activities.”
Paxton on Wednesday doubled down on the state’s actions, saying, “Texas will not surrender,” in a statement issued by his office.
Paxton responded to the federal government with a three-page letter claiming Texas has constitutional authority to defend its territory, a power he plans to continue to fight for in the courts, according to the letter.
In the letter, Paxton said Border Patrol personnel have access to Shelby Park to respond to medical emergencies.
The Wednesday deadline marks the latest signpost of intensifying tensions between state and federal officials as the White House and lawmakers challenge Texas’ policies, including a new law that makes entering the state illegally a state crime. Friction over the issue also has spilled into states where migrants have been sent by Texas officials or otherwise have gone and has prompted online anti-migrant rhetoric to swell.
The Biden administration also has asked the Supreme Court to intervene after Texas sued over Border Patrol agents’ practice of removing razor wire put in place by the state along part of the border near Eagle Pass. An appeals court ordered the agents to stop removing the wire while legal challenges play out, and the administration has asked the high court to step in on an emergency basis to wipe that order.
The drownings Friday “underscore that Texas is firm in its continued efforts to exercise complete control of the border and land … and to block Border Patrol’s access to the border even in emergency circumstances,” the Biden administration wrote late Monday in a filing to the Supreme Court in that case.
What we know about the drownings of 3 Mexican migrants near Eagle Pass, Texas
“It is impossible to say what might have happened if Border Patrol had had its former access to the area – including through its surveillance trucks that assisted in monitoring the area,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in the filing.
“At the very least, however, Border Patrol would have had the opportunity to take any available steps to fulfill its responsibilities and assist its counterparts in the Mexican government with undertaking the rescue mission,” she continued. “Texas made that impossible.”
The Texas Military Department, meanwhile, said by the time Border Patrol agents requested access to the site Friday night, “the drownings had occurred, Mexican authorities were recovering the bodies, and Border Patrol expressed these facts to the TMD personnel on site.”
“At no time did TMD security personnel along the river observe any distressed migrants, nor did TMD turn back any illegal immigrants from the US during this period,” the Texas Military Department said. “Also, at no point was TMD made aware of any bodies in the area of Shelby Park, nor was TMD made aware of any bodies being discovered on the US side of the border regarding this situation.”
The federal-state border standoff in Texas has prompted members of a kind of group known for using demonizing rhetoric and intersecting with extremists to issue a call on social media for people to travel to Eagle Pass in protest.
The group is urging “patriots” from across the country to go to Eagle Pass “to demand that elected officials honor their oath of office to defend the border against a ‘foreign invasion,’” according to a member’s online video that employs the term far-right groups use for the border crisis.
A property owner will let the group set up tents, campers and RVs, he says.
These “patriots,” however, are misinformed about border security and immigration policy, said Texas state Rep. Eddie Morales Jr., a Democrat who represents 11 counties in West Texas, including the city of Eagle Pass. Instead, they should camp outside Congress and demand lawmakers act on immigration, he said.
“The Republicans control the House of Representatives right now, if they were truly interested in solving this issue, they would fast track a border immigration and a border security bill by tomorrow,” Morales said.
Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber is monitoring the potential arrival this weekend of people from around the country and is concerned for the safety and security of the area due to the heated rhetoric on immigration, he told CNN.
Groups like this one that use “patriot” as part of their names have emerged since 2020 in an effort to get Donald Trump to form a third major political party, the Anti-Defamation League told CNN in a statement. While such groups are not inherently extremist, they engage in demonizing rhetoric, far-right policy causes and at times intersect with extremist groups and movements, it said.
A state away, Louisiana’s new Republican governor has directed state agencies to report any arrests of or funds spent on undocumented immigrants, he mandated in an executive order signed Friday.
﻿“The cost of illegal immigration in this state is falling on the shoulders of hard-working Louisianans,” Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement Tuesday. “This Executive Order will analyze data to determine the financial burden our citizens are being forced to carry because of those who do not follow the law.”
“Louisiana will always welcome those who legally immigrate, but taxpayers cannot continue to foot the bill for individuals who break the law and skip the line.”
The heads of every executive branch in the state must provide within 120 days a report to the governor’s office detailing any use “of public funds directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of illegal aliens,” the order says.
The governor directs the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections and the Superintendent of the Louisiana State Police to provide monthly reports on the number of people “charged or convicted of a criminal offense” and to note whether they are documented or undocumented, according to the order.
Law enforcement is also directed in the order to “regularly publish” to the public data regarding “arrests and convictions of illegal aliens,” their nationality, their offense, whether charged or convicted and report any “known or suspected gang affiliation” for arrested undocumented immigrants and where they were arrested.
This is a developing story and will be updated.

O3JC8KL52K_SOC05765BZA61LK,China says it’s easier than ever for Americans to visit the country,"By Lilit Marcus and Veronica Lin, CNN","4 minute read Published 8:50 PM EST, Tue January 9, 2024",20240110,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/travel/american-tourist-visas-china-intl-hnk/,"For years, Americans interested in visiting China had to endure a thorough visa process, which required pre-booking hotels and flights and handing their passports over to an embassy or consulate for an undetermined period.
But as of January 1, 2024, some of those restrictions have dropped or loosened, making it easier than ever for US citizens to obtain a Chinese tourist visa.
Americans have the seventh most powerful passport in the world, meaning there are a whopping 187 countries and territories that US citizens can visit either without a visa or by getting one immediately on arrival – a list that includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, but not mainland China.
Elsewhere in the region, US passport holders can visit Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore on vacation visa-free for 30-90 days.
As a result, China has been further down the bucket list for many American travelers, who considered the country “too hard” to visit.
China tries to lure foreign tourists with expanded visa-free scheme after weak post-pandemic bounce back
Now, Americans who want to get a Chinese tourist visa (L-visa) no longer have to submit proof of a round-trip flight booking, a hotel reservation, an organized itinerary or a letter of invitation.
The Chinese embassy in Washington announced the newly relaxed guidelines on December 29, 2023, citing the desire “to further facilitate people-to-people exchanges.”
State-run media outlet Xinhua also reported that the Civil Aviation Administration of China plans to increase nonstop flights between the two countries.
Sam Fleischmann, a Pittsburgh-based education consultant planning to visit China in April, said he’s more inclined to do so now that certain restrictions have been lifted.
“If I’m in a city to do consultancy for two weeks, but I have other opportunities to go to a different city, it’s nice to have the flexibility that I don’t need my return ticket,” says Fleischmann. “I think spontaneous travel is one of the most beautiful things about traveling.”
For his next trip to Hong Kong, he’s considering staying in Shanghai for a few days thanks to the six-day visa-free transit policy, where citizens of 53 countries can enter and stay in designated cities and provinces in China without a visa if they meet certain criteria.
It’s not just Americans who stand to benefit from China opening up.
In November, China announced a trial program to allow visitors from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia to enter visa-free for 15 days.
Soon after, China and Thailand announced intentions of a reciprocal visa-free program, which the Chinese Foreign Ministry said would “serve the fundamental interests of both peoples.”
Visas weren’t the only challenge for Western tourists going to China that the country has addressed.
Last year, the country’s main digital payment systems, WeChat Pay and Alipay, opened up to users with non-Chinese credit cards and bank accounts, thus eliminating a major pain point for foreign visitors.

Since last July, visitors have also been able to link their Visa and Mastercard accounts to China’s most popular mobile payment platforms – allowing them to book taxis, ride the subway and pay for goods and services at millions of outlets across the near-cashless country, though a fee may be added for larger transactions.
However, one thing that hasn’t eased is the US State Department’s guidance on going to China. It lists China as a level three or “orange” country, which means “reconsider travel.”
The guidance reads: “Reconsider travel to Mainland China due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans, and the risk of wrongful detentions.”
China enforced one of the world’s strictest lockdowns during the pandemic, which battered the economy. The consequences of these policies can be seen in the slowdown and dismal economic results last year.
“The impact of Covid lockdowns communicated to the rest of the world in the sense that China was closed and closing off, and so by changing these rules, it sends the message that it’s opening back up,” says Hong Kong University tourism professor Benjamin Iaquinto.
“The economy in China is not doing so well. And this is probably going to help contribute to boosting it back up again, there are also concerns with its international reputation,” he added.
However, according to Iaquinto, geopolitical tensions – including “volatile” US-China relations – mean that these changes might not be permanent.
“If there’s some type of blowup between the two countries, not necessarily in terms of war, but some type of political argument,” he said, “that might result in China responding by reversing those changes.”

O79SVUTX41_PKG9KHR19QIKDVM,South Africa accuses Israel of genocide and urges top UN court to halt Gaza war,"By Christian Edwards, CNN","7 minute read Updated 10:12 PM EST, Thu January 11, 2024",20240111,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/11/middleeast/south-africa-israel-genocide-icj-hague-day-one-intl/,"South Africa accused Israel of genocide in an unprecedented case at the United Nations’ top court, saying the country’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza” and calling for the court to order a halt to Israel’s military campaign in the enclave.
On the first of two days of hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), South Africa on Thursday argued that Israel’s air and ground assaults on Gaza were intended to “bring about the destruction” of its Palestinian population, and that comments made by Israeli leaders signalled their “genocidal intent.”
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s murderous rampage on October 7, when more than 1,200 people were killed and 240 hostages were taken back to Gaza. South Africa condemned Hamas’ attacks but said “nothing” could justify Israel’s response, which has killed more than 23,000 people in Gaza.
“The point is not simply that Israel is acting disproportionately. The point is that the prohibition on genocide is an absolute,” said Vaughan Lowe, one of the lawyers representing South Africa. “Nothing can ever justify genocide.”
Israel dismissed the case as “absurd blood libel,” and government spokesperson Eylon Levy said it is “tragic that the rainbow nation that prides itself on fighting racism will be fighting pro-bono for the anti-Jewish racists.”
Israel is facing a genocide case in international court. Could it halt the war in Gaza?
Israel is scheduled to deliver its response in court on Friday. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the country would make the case that the war was one of self-defense, and would show that Israel is doing its “utmost” under “extremely complicated circumstances” to avert civilian casualties.
The ICJ, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, was set up in June 1945 and hears cases brought by states accusing others of violating their UN treaty obligations. South Africa and Israel are signatories to the 1948 Genocide Convention, meaning they are obliged not to commit genocide and to prevent and punish it.
Experts say it is the first time that the Jewish state is being tried under the Genocide Convention, which was drawn up after World War II in light of the atrocities committed against the Jewish people during the Holocaust.
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them, and other countries who are party to the court have ignored its rulings in the past.
In an 84-page filing to the ICJ, South Africa argued that Israel is committing genocide by killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing serious mental and bodily harm, forced evacuation, widespread hunger, and by creating conditions “calculated to bring about their physical destruction.” It also accused Israel of failing to stem incitement to genocide in the public pronouncements of its officials.
During three hours of oral argument, lawyers representing South Africa asked the ICJ to order a suspension of Israel’s campaign in Gaza to protect the rights of Palestinians in Gaza “from imminent and irreparable loss.”
Such “provisional measures,” as they are known, function as a kind of restraining order to stop a dispute from escalating while the court considers the full merits of the case, which could take years. For provisional measures the court need only decide if prima facie, or “at first glance,” the acts complained of could fall foul of the genocide convention.
“It is not necessary for the court to come to a final view on the question of whether Israel’s conduct constitutes genocide. It is necessary to establish only whether at least some of the acts alleged are capable of falling within the provisions of the convention,” argued Adila Hassim, one of the lawyers representing South Africa.
In its opening remarks, South Africa said it “places Israel’s genocidal acts and omissions within the broader context of Israel’s 25-year apartheid, 56-year occupation, and 16-year siege imposed on the Gaza Strip.”
South Africa operated under a system of apartheid from 1948 until the early 1990s, and its governing African National Congress has long championed the Palestinian cause.
Ahead of the hearing South Africa was accused by Israel and others of hypocrisy for not also bringing a charge of genocide against Hamas, whose founding charter mandates the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel.
South Africa explained during the hearing that “Hamas is not a state and cannot be a party to the genocide convention,” and said the group would be accountable to “other bodies” such as the International Criminal Court, which tries individuals – rather than states – for crimes including war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a grouping of 57 Muslim countries, as well as Jordan, Turkey and Malaysia have so far backed South Africa’s case, while Israel’s allies have fiercely opposed it.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the case as “meritless,” and said it was “particularly galling given that those who are attacking Israel – Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, as well as their supporter of Iran – continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews.”
South Africa presented widely reported evidence that it said showed a “systematic pattern of conduct” by Israel “from which genocide can be inferred.” The UN defines genocide as an act “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”
“South Africa believes that the publicly available evidence of the scale of the destruction resulting from the bombardment of Gaza, and the deliberate restriction of food, water, medicines and electricity available to the population of Gaza, demonstrates that the government of Israel… is intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza as a group, and is doing nothing to prevent or punish the actions of others who support that aim,” said Lowe.
Citing previous CNN reporting that nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions that Israel has used in Gaza in its war with Hamas have been unguided “dumb bombs,” Vaughan said “it’s no use Israel saying it does whatever it can to minimize the deaths of innocent” Palestinians.
“The use of 2,000-pound bunker-busting bombs and dumb bombs in residential areas, and the relentless bombardment of Gaza… tell another story.”
Israel has repeatedly stressed that it is targeting Hamas – which has long been known to station military operations inside civilian buildings – rather than civilians in Gaza.
South Africa argued that the evacuation order issued by Israel to residents of northern Gaza on October 13 – the first of its kind – was itself “genocidal,” since “it required immediate movement… while no humanitarian assistance was permitted.” Israel said at the time that, by notifying the civilian population of a planned military attack, it was complying with international law.
As well as detailing the actions of the Israeli military, South Africa also cited public pronouncements by Israeli officials it alleged were genocidal in nature.
“Israel’s political leaders, military commanders, and persons holding official positions, have systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent,” argued Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.
Ngcukaitobi cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Israeli forces on October 28, ahead of the imminent launch of its ground offensive in Gaza.
“Remember what Amalek did to you,” Netanyahu said in his address, which Ngcukaitobi told the court “refers to a Biblical command by God to Saul for the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people known as the Amalekites.”
There is precedent for the court to grant the kind of emergency orders South Africa is calling for.
In January 2020, the court granted The Gambia’s request for provisional measures to protect the Rohingya people remaining in Myanmar from genocide. The Court has granted similar measures to protect Ukrainians from ongoing Russian aggression, and Bosnians during the Balkan Wars in the 1990s.
Max du Plessis, another of South Africa’s lawyers, said if the court failed to do so it risked treating Palestinians “differently, as less worthy of protection than others.”
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them. A 2022 report by Human Rights Watch found continued abuses against the Rohingya remaining in Myanmar, despite the provisional measures. Similarly, despite the court in March 2022 ordering Russia to immediately suspend its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow’s war rages on nearly two years later.
While an ICJ ruling against Israel may fail to constrain its military action, it could land a serious blow to Israel’s international reputation.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused South Africa of “functioning as the legal arm of Hamas” in furious comments on Thursday.
“Today we were witness to one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history, compounded by a series of false and baseless claims,” Lior Haiat, a spokesperson for the ministry, said on X.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also hit out at South Africa.
“Today, again, we saw an upside-down world, in which the State of Israel is accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting genocide,” he said during a televised speech Thursday.
“South Africa’s hypocrisy screams to the high heavens.”

PLVFNACGD1_WGTFS82WGT3ZQ6J,READ: President Joe Biden’s statement on strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen,By CNN Staff,"2 minute read Published 11:31 PM EST, Thu January 11, 2024",20240112,cnn.com,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/11/politics/read-biden-statement-airstrikes-houthis-yemen/,"President Joe Biden said airstrikes launched by the US and UK against Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen were “in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea.”
The president ordered the strikes just days after what the US military called a “complex attack” by the Iranian-backed militants on Red Sea shipping.
Read Biden’s full statement on the coalition airstrikes in Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen below:
Today, at my direction, U.S. military forces—together with the United Kingdom and with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands—successfully conducted strikes against a number of targets in Yemen used by Houthi rebels to endanger freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most vital waterways. These strikes are in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea—including the use of anti-ship ballistic missiles for the first time in history. These attacks have endangered U.S. personnel, civilian mariners, and our partners, jeopardized trade, and threatened freedom of navigation. More than 50 nations have been affected in 27 attacks on international commercial shipping. Crews from more than 20 countries have been threatened or taken hostage in acts of piracy.  More than 2,000 ships have been forced to divert thousands of miles to avoid the Red Sea—which can cause weeks of delays in product shipping times. And on January 9, Houthis launched their largest attack to date—directly targeting American ships. The response of the international community to these reckless attacks has been united and resolute. Last month, the United States launched Operation Prosperity Guardian—a coalition of more than 20 nations committed to defending international shipping and deterring Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.  We also joined more than 40 nations in condemning Houthi threats. Last week, together with 13 allies and partners, we issued an unequivocal warning that Houthi rebels would bear the consequences if their attacks did not cease. And yesterday, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution demanding the Houthis end attacks on merchant and commercial vessels. Today’s defensive action follows this extensive diplomatic campaign and Houthi rebels’ escalating attacks against commercial vessels. These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes. I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary."

The event, which raised €1.31m in total, was attended by US Climate Envoy John Kerry along with many other climate action visionaries. Art pieces and unique jewelry were also auctioned off.
“Amidst the ongoing fight against pollution, I also witness the progress that has been achieved. We have come a long way. Today, so many people are here to be part of the solution,” Schwarzenegger said at the dinner. “I extend my gratitude to everyone who has joined my fight against pollution.”
Schwarzenegger is facing criminal tax proceedings for failing to declare the Audemars Piguet watch to customs officers in Munich after he got off a flight from Los Angeles, a Munich Customs press officer told CNN Wednesday.
“He did not declare a product. A product that was imported from non-EU countries in order to remain in the EU. And this process applies to everyone,” press officer Thomas Meister said.
Meister said the former California governor and “Terminator” star was released and traveled on after being held for over two hours.
The actor agreed to pre-pay potential taxes on the watch but the officers failed to get a credit card machine to work for an hour until they gave up and brought him to a bank and asked him to withdraw cash from an ATM to pay, a source close to the actor told CNN.
The ATM they brought him to had a limit that was too low, and the bank was closed.
When he returned, a new officer brought a new credit card machine that worked, the source added.

“In the past year of 2023, China’s economy has generally rebounded and improved,” the country’s second highest official told the meeting of global business and political leaders.
The Chinese government had earlier said that it was targeting a growth rate of around 5% for 2023, and is set to announce its annual GDP figures for last year on Wednesday.
While this expansion would mark a significant pick-up over 2022, when China’s economy grew by just 3%, it is still one of the country’s economic worst performances in over three decades.
Barring the pandemic years through 2022, when China’s growth was disrupted by strict lockdowns and other restrictions, 5.2% is the country’s slowest pace of annual growth since 1990, when the economy expanded by 3.9% because of international sanctions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
The country has been beset by a series of economic problems, including a real estate crisis, record youth unemployment, deflation, and a rapidly ageing population. International economists have widely projected China’s growth to slow to around 4.5% this year.
Those problems have sent investors rushing for the exits. China’s stock markets were the biggest losers in 2023. The country’s blue-chip CSI 300 index fell more than 11%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down 14%. Meanwhile, the MSCI World index closed the year 22% higher, its biggest annual jump since 2019.
“Even if there are twists and turns in China’s economic operation, its overall long-term positive trend will not change,” said Li. The premier is the most senior Chinese leader to attend the Davos forum in person since President Xi Jinping in 2017.
Li also tried to reassure international investors, who have become increasingly wary of China’s tough business environment and slowing growth.
“Investing in the Chinese market is not a risk but an opportunity,” he said.
The country has about 400 million people in the middle-income group, and that number is expected to double to 800 million in the next 10 years, Li said.
“The momentum for consumption … is very strong,” he added.
Ongoing urbanization will create huge demand in sectors such as housing, education, medical and elderly care, he said, adding that there are still nearly 300 million rural Chinese who will eventually migrate to cities.
There is also a lot of room for investments in upgrading urban transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, he noted.
Li also pledged to create “first-class” operating environment for international businesses in China.
“No matter how the world’s situation changes, China will adhere to its fundamental national policy of opening up, and its door will only get wider and wider,” he said.
His remarks come as Beijing intensifies its efforts to revive the economy and woo foreign investment back into the country. Foreign companies have grown wary of Beijing’s rising scrutiny and are pulling out. In the third quarter, a measure of foreign direct investment (FDI) into China turned negative for the first time since 1998.
On Monday, Li met with Swiss President Viola Amherd and said the two countries would deepen economic ties and start talks to upgrade their free-trade agreement, according to a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry.
In November, Xi visited the United States for the first time in more than six years, where he met with President Joe Biden to amend ties between the two countries. In a meeting with top American business executives, Xi pledged to make it easier for foreigners to invest and operate in his country.

S31X7N3TH2_KN2HHF9X9KPFX0K,Why are Iran and Pakistan striking each other’s territory – and what does it have to do with the Middle East?,"By Sophia Saifi, Adam Pourahmadi, Azaz Syed and Jessie Yeung, CNN","7 minute read Updated 9:34 PM EST, Thu January 18, 2024",20240118,cnn.com,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/18/world/iran-pakistan-attacks-tensions-explainer-intl-hnk/,"Pakistan and Iran have both conducted strikes on each other’s territories in an unprecedented escalation of hostilities between the neighbors, at a time when tensions have risen sharply across the Middle East and beyond.
The two countries share a volatile border, stretching about 900 kilometers (560 miles), with Pakistan’s Balochistan province on one side and Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province on the other.
Both nations have long fought militants in the restive Baloch region along the border. But while the two countries share a common separatist enemy, it is highly unusual for either side to attack militants on each other’s soil.
The latest strikes come as Iran’s allies and proxies in the Middle East – the so-called axis of resistance – launch attacks on Israeli forces and its allies against the backdrop of the war in Gaza.
Here’s what you need to know.
The opening salvo in this fast-moving sequence of events began Tuesday when Iran conducted strikes on Pakistan’s Balochistan province – killing two children and wounding several others, according to Pakistani authorities.
Iran claimed it had “only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan” and that no Pakistani nationals were targeted.
But the attack sparked anger in Pakistan, which called the strike “an egregious violation of international law and the spirit of bilateral relations between Pakistan and Iran.”
Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency said it had been targeting strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, or Army of Justice.
The separatist militant group operates on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border and has previously claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian targets. Its ultimate goal is independence for Iran’s Sistan and Baluchestan province.
Nuclear-armed Pakistan is majority Sunni – the dominant branch of Islam – while Iran and its “axis of resistance” is largely Shia.
Pakistan struck back two days later with what it called a “series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes” on several alleged separatist hideouts in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Announcing the strikes on Thursday, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said a number of militants were killed. At least 10 people — all Pakistani nationals — were killed, Tasnim reported, citing the deputy governor of Sistan and Baluchestan, who said authorities were investigating how those people had “settled in the village.”
Pakistan said it had for years complained that separatist fighters had “safe havens and sanctuaries” in Iran – and was forced to take matters into its own hands with Thursday’s strikes.
Pakistan and Iran’s struggle against separatists operating on either side of each other’s borders is not new.
Deadly clashes along the turbulent border have happened regularly over the years. Just last month, Iran accused Jaish al-Adl militants of storming a police station in Sistan and Baluchestan, which resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian police officers, according to Tasnim.
What is highly unusual, however, is each side’s willingness to hit targets across those borders, without informing each other first. And all this is happening against the backdrop of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, which has sent repercussions coursing through the region.
The larger regional conflict may have emboldened Iran to be more proactive in pursuing targets beyond its borders, experts say – especially as the United States walks a tightrope between de-escalating hostilities and flexing its own military might to deter further moves by Iran.

The day before the strikes in Pakistan, Iran launched ballistic missiles at Iraq and Syria, claiming to be targeting a spy base for Israeli forces and “anti-Iran terror groups.”
Meanwhile, heavy fighting continues between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah across the Lebanon border; and the US is fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked ships in the Red Sea in the name of revenge for Israel’s assault on Gaza.
“If you don’t censure Iran and its proxies … then there’s no cost for them to continue to pursue those activities,” said Karim Sadjadpour, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
He added that Iran’s dominant position in the Middle East, in contrast to conflict-ridden nations like Yemen and Syria, means it stands to gain from regional instability and “filling power vacuums.” And Iran’s activities now serve to further several of its main goals, which include empowering Palestinians and counteracting American influence in the Middle East, he said.
Retired US Army Gen. Wesley Clark, a former NATO supreme allied commander, said the various hostilities reflect Iran “striving to cement its role as a leader in the region.”
“It’s seeking regional hegemony,” he told CNN. “And when the United States and Israel are there, and Israel’s waging this campaign against Hamas, then Iran feels the need to strike back and assert itself.”
The Baloch people, also spelled Baluch, live where Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran meet. They have long exhibited a fiercely independent streak and always resented being ruled by both Islamabad and Tehran, with insurgencies bubbling across the porous border region for decades.
The area they live in is also rich in natural resources, but Baloch separatists complain that their people, some of the region’s poorest, have seen little wealth trickle down to their communities.
Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has witnessed a spate of deadly attacks in recent years, fueled by a decades-long insurgency by separatists who demand independence from the country, angered by what they say is the state’s monopoly and exploitation of the region’s mineral resources.
Iran has also faced a long history of insurgencies from its Kurdish, Arab and Baloch minorities.
Jaish al-Adl is just one of many separatist groups operating within Iran. It was originally part of a larger Sunni militant group called Jundallah, which fractured after its leader was executed by Iran in 2010, according to the US government’s National Counterterrorism Center. Jaish al-Adl emerged instead and has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US State Department.
The group often targets Iranian security personnel, government officials, and Shia civilians, according to the National Counterterrorism Center.
In 2015, the group claimed responsibility for an attack that killed eight Iranian border guards, with militants reportedly crossing into Iran from Pakistan. And in 2019, it claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that hit a bus carrying members of the Iranian military, killing at least 23 in Sistan-Baluchestan.
On Wednesday, a day after Iran’s strikes on Pakistan, Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for an attack on an Iranian military vehicle in Sistan and Baluchestan.
Iran’s strikes on Tuesday sparked a diplomatic spat, with Pakistan recalling its ambassador from Iran and suspending all high-level visits from its neighbor.
And after Pakistan’s strikes, Iran on Thursday demanded “an immediate explanation” from its neighbor, Tasnim reported – and the Iranian military conducted a large-scale exercise off the country’s southwest coast, involving the air force, naval forces and ground forces.
Nearby nations have weighed in, with Turkey’s foreign minister holding calls with his counterparts in both Iran and Pakistan. Afterward, he said neither country wanted to escalate tensions further.
India said it has “zero tolerance towards terrorism,” and that the attack was “a matter between Iran and Pakistan.” China urged both nations to exercise restraint, and the European Union said it was “gravely concerned by the spiral of violence in the Middle East and beyond.”
US State Department spokesperson Matt Miller also urged restraint on Thursday – but added he didn’t think the flare-up was “in any way, shape or form connected to Gaza.”
“But whenever you see things, see strikes in the region, given the tensions in the region, there is the risk for increase in conflict, which is something that we’re trying to avoid,” he said.
It is not clear whether either Iran or Pakistan would want to descend into full-blown hostilities over separatist groups that they both regard as an enemy.
Both sides issued statements after their respective strikes that hinted at a desire not to see things escalate.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry called Iran a “brotherly country” and emphasized the need to “find joint solutions.”
That echoed the Iranian foreign minister, who called Pakistan a “friendly country” earlier this week and said their strikes were proportionate and only aimed at militants."
T6QED8EOWK_NA2N98KPGPRW4L6,Taiwan voters dismiss China warnings and hand ruling party a historic third consecutive presidential win,"By Eric Cheung, Wayne Chang, Nectar Gan and Jerome Taylor, CNN","6 minute read Updated 4:43 PM EST, Sat January 13, 2024",20240113,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/13/asia/taiwan-presidential-election-results-intl-hnk/,"Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party pulled off a historic third consecutive presidential victory on Saturday as voters shrugged off warnings by China that their re-election would increase the risk of conflict.
Lai Ching-te, Taiwan’s current vice president, declared victory on Saturday evening while his two opposition rivals both conceded defeat.
“This is a night that belongs to Taiwan. We managed to keep Taiwan on the map of the world,” Lai told thousands of jubilant supporters at a rally after his win.
“The election has shown the world the commitment of the Taiwanese people to democracy, which I hope China can understand,” he added.
China responded soon after the vote by saying “Taiwan is part of China.”
Lai’s running mate Hsiao Bi-khim, who recently served as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States, was elected Vice President.
The counting of votes has concluded, with Lai – the candidate of Taiwan’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) – receiving just over 40% of the total votes, according to Taiwan’s Central Election Commission (CEC).
Taiwan’s opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party candidate Hou Yu-ih garnered 33.49% of the votes, with Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) candidate Ko Wen-je received 26.45%. More than 14 million people took part, meaning that voter turnout came in at just over 71%.
The boisterous election campaign, an illustration of Taiwan’s vibrant democratic credentials, was fought over a mixture of livelihood issues as well as the thorny question of how to deal with its giant one-party state neighbor, China, which under leader Xi Jinping has grown more powerful and bellicose.
The result shows voters backing the DPP’s view that Taiwan is a de facto sovereign nation that should bolster defenses against China’s threats and deepen relations with fellow democratic countries, even if that means economic punishment or military intimidation by Beijing.
It is also a further snub to eight years of increasingly strongarm tactics towards Taiwan under Xi who has vowed that the island’s eventual “reunification” with the mainland is “a historical inevitability”.
Following Taiwan’s election result, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said no matter “whatever changes take place in Taiwan, the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change.”
The spokesperson continued: “The one-China principle is the solid anchor for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. We believe that the international community will continue to adhere to the one-China principle and understand and support the Chinese people’s just cause of opposing ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist activities and striving to achieve national reunification.”
A spokesperson for China’s Taiwan Affairs Office earlier insisted the election result “does not represent the mainstream view on the island.”
Other world powers have congratulated Lai, with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying the vote demonstrated “the strength of [Taiwan’s] robust democratic system and electoral process.”
Like outgoing president Tsai Ing-wen, who cannot stand again because of term limits, Lai is openly loathed by China’s Communist Party leaders and his victory is unlikely to lead to any improvement in ties between Beijing and Taipei.
China cut off most communications with Taipei after Tsai took office and ramped up diplomatic, economic and military pressure on the self-ruled island, turning the Taiwan Strait into one of the world’s major geopolitical flash points.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it. While successive Chinese Communist leaders have vowed to eventually achieve “reunification,” Xi has repeatedly said the Taiwan issue “should not be passed down generation after generation,” linking the mission to his mid-century goal of “national rejuvenation.”
The DPP emphasizes that Taiwan is not subordinate to the Chinese Communist Party, and that its future Taiwan must only be decided by its 23.5 million people.
In the run up to Saturday’s vote, Beijing warned Taiwan’s voters to “make the right choice” and “recognize the extreme danger of Lai Ching-te’s triggering of cross-strait confrontation and conflict.”
His running mate Hsiao has been sanctioned twice by China for being a “stubborn secessionist.”
Speaking to the media ahead of his victory speech on Saturday night, Lai called his win a “victory for the community of democracies.”
“We are telling the international community that between democracy and authoritarianism, we still stand on the side of democracy,” he said.
“I will act in accordance with our democratic and free constitutional order in a manner that is balanced and maintains the cross-strait status quo,” he added. “At the same time, we are also determined to safeguard Taiwan from continuing threats and intimidation from China”.
“In the future, we hope that China will recognize the new situation, and understand that only peace benefits both sides of the strait,” he added.
Lai’s victory comes as the US is trying to stabilize fraught relations with China and prevent competition from veering into conflict. During Tsai’s administration, Taiwan bolstered ties with the United States, its biggest international backer, which increased support and arms sales to the island.
US officials have said that Washington will uphold its longstanding policy toward Taiwan no matter who takes on the top job. The Biden administration will dispatch an unofficial delegation – including former senior officials – to Taipei following the election in keeping with past practice, according to senior officials.
The delegation visit “will be a signal, a very symbolic way of supporting Taiwan,” said T.Y. Wang, a professor at Illinois State University.
Saturday’s result is another major blow for Taiwan’s Kuomintang, which back warmer relations with Beijing and have not held the presidency since 2016.
Beijing made little secret of its desire to see the KMT return to power. During campaigning the KMT accused Lai and the DPP of needlessly stoking tensions with China.
Lev Nachman, a political science professor at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University, said that while Lai has to make some economic adjustments given deep public grievances over low wages and unaffordable housing, on issues like foreign policy and cross-strait relations he is expected to largely follow Tsai’s approach.
“So much of (Lai’s) campaign has been trying to reassure not just a domestic audience, but international audience that he is Tsai Ing-wen 2.0,” he said.
That will not be welcome in Beijing.
Days before the election, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said by following Tsai’s path, Lai is pursuing a path of provocation and confrontation and will bring Taiwan “closer and closer to war and recession.”
Analysts say China could escalate economic and military pressure on Taiwan to show its displeasure in the coming days and weeks, or save a more forceful response for May, when Lai takes office.
“There’s multiple times that China could cause a fuss over a DPP victory, either now or later this year,” Nachman said.
And Beijing has a wide range of coercive measures in its toolbox too.
In the lead-up to the vote, China ended preferential tariffs for some Taiwanese imports under a free trade agreement. It could broaden the scope of goods targeted, or even suspend the agreement altogether.
China can also further ramp up its military pressure on Taiwan, sending more fighter jets and warships close to the island’s skies and waters, a tactic it has deployed with increased frequency in recent years.
But Taiwan’s security officials said ahead of the vote that they didn’t expect large-scale military actions from China right after the election, citing unsuitable winter weather conditions, troubles in the Chinese economy, and efforts by Beijing and Washington to stabilize ties following a bilateral summit in November.
And while an escalation of military tension could increase the risks of accidents and miscalculations, it doesn’t necessarily portend an imminent conflict in the Taiwan Strait, analysts noted.
“Just because the DPP is in power doesn’t mean China’s going to war,” said Nachman.
“The last eight years have obviously been uncomfortable with the DPP in power, but it hasn’t led to war, they’ve been able to find an uncomfortable middle ground. And the hope is that even with a Lai presidency that we can continue to have this sort of uncomfortable silence without having to go to war.”"
THEKYAKZ2P_LDPJ0IRLL93LWCH,Pakistan condemns deadly Iranian missile strike on its territory as tensions spike across region,"By Jonny Hallam, Asim Khan and Helen Regan, CNN","6 minute read Updated 5:15 PM EST, Wed January 17, 2024",20240117,cnn.com,https://us.cnn.com/2024/01/17/middleeast/iran-missile-attack-pakistan-intl-hnk/,"Pakistan has strongly condemned an Iranian airstrike inside its borders that killed two children, calling it an “unprovoked violation of its airspace” and warning of retaliation.
Iran said it used “precision missile and drone strikes,” to destroy two strongholds of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, known in Iran as Jaish al-Dhulm, in the Koh-e-Sabz area of Pakistan’s southwest Balochistan province, according to Iran’s state-aligned Tasnim news agency.
Tuesday’s attack comes after Iran launched missiles in northern Iraq and Syria Monday, in the latest escalation of hostilities in the Middle East where Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza risks spiraling into a wider regional conflict.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said the attack on its territory killed “two innocent children” and warned Iran of “serious consequences.”
It described the airstrike as an “unprovoked violation of its airspace by Iran … inside Pakistani territory.”
“It is even more concerning that this illegal act has taken place despite the existence of several channels of communication between Pakistan and Iran,” the ministry said.
Pakistan on Wednesday recalled its ambassador from Iran and suspended all Iraninan high-level visits.
“Last night’s unprovoked and blatant breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty by Iran is a violation of international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,” Mumtaz Baloch, a spokesperson for Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry, said in a televised address.
She said the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan should not return from a current visit to Iran and warned “Pakistan reserves the right to respond to this illegal act.”
China urged Iran and Pakistan to exercise restraint in handling their ongoing conflict after the deadly strike. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday called on both countries to “avoid actions that would lead to an escalation of tension and work together to maintain peace and stability in the region.”
A spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs said the strike was “a matter between Iran and Pakistan,” but stressed India has “zero tolerance towards terrorism.”
Iran launches missile strikes in northern Iraq and Syria, claims to destroy Israeli spy base
The Jaish al-Adl militant group late Tuesday said Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had used six attack drones and a number of rockets to destroy two houses where the children and wives of its fighters lived.
Authorities in Balochistan province told CNN two girls had died and at least four people were injured. The girls, aged eight and 12, were killed in houses that were damaged in the attack in the village of Koh-e-Sabz in Kulag, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Panjgur district, on Tuesday evening, according to the district’s deputy commissioner Mumtaz Khetran.
Khetran also said a mosque near the homes was targeted and hit in the strikes.
Koh-e-Sabz — about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Pakistan’s border with Iran — is known to be the home of Jaish al-Adl’s former second-in-command Mullah Hashim, who was killed in clashes with Iranian forces in Sarawan, an Iranian region adjacent to Panjgur, in 2018.
Last month, Iran accused Jaish al-Adl militants of storming a police station in the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchistan, which resulted in the deaths of 11 Iranian police officers, according to Tasnim.
Jaish al-Adl, or Army of Justice, is a separatist militant group that operates on both sides of the border and has previously claimed responsibility for attacks against Iranian targets. Its stated goal is the independence of Iran’s Sistan and Baluchistan province, which neighbors Pakistan.
On Wednesday, it claimed responsibility for an attack on an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) vehicle in Sistan and Baluchistan that Iranian state media says killed one of its colonels.
Jaish al-Adl said on its official website that it had targeted an IRGC pick-up truck on the outskirts of Iranshahr.
Colonel Hossein Ali Javadanfar was killed in the attack, according to the IRGC’s Sepah news.
CNN cannot independently verify Jaish al-Adl’s claim.
Iran said Wednesday it “only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan” and that “none of the nationals of the friendly country of Pakistan were targeted” in the strike.
“We respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan. But we don’t allow our national security to be compromised and to be played with and we have no reservation when it comes to our national interests,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
The strikes in Pakistan came a day after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards launched ballistic missiles, targeting what it claimed was a spy base for Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad in Erbil, northern Iraq, and at “anti-Iran terror groups” in Syria.
Iran said the strikes in Iraq were in response to what it said were Israeli attacks that killed Iranian Revolutionary Guard commanders, and claimed targets in Syria were involved in the recent dual bombings in the city of Kerman during a memorial for the slain Quds Force Commander Qasem Soleimani that left scores dead and wounded.
It defended the strikes as a “precise and targeted” operation to deter security threats, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said in a statement on Tuesday.
Iran’s attacks will further raise fears that Israel’s war in Gaza could widen into a full-scale war in the Middle East with grave humanitarian, political and economic consequences.
The attacks in Iraq and Syria were condemned by the United States as “reckless” and imprecise, while the United Nations said, “security concerns must be addressed through dialogue, not strikes.”
Iraq said it submitted a complaint to the UN Security Council and the UN on Tuesday. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said there are no Mossad-affiliated centers operating in Erbil in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region.
But, speaking to CNN’s Fareed Zakaria at Davos, Iran’s Foreign Minister repeated the country’s claim that the strike on Iraq was a response “against elements and agents of Mossad,” and said Iran has “very good relations” with both Iraq and Pakistan.
“We have talked and agreed for several times on the necessity of fighting terrorism,” he said, adding that the action taken by Iran “targeted Israel that remains a common enemy of both of us,” and that the country would respond to any attack “vigorously.”
He stressed that if Israel’s war in Gaza ends, then other conflicts across the Middle East would too. “If the genocide in Gaza stops, then it will lead to the end of other crises and attacks in the region,” Amir-Abdollahian said.
Israel’s relentless bombing of Gaza in response to Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks has killed more than 24,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, and wrought widespread devastation, as civilians live with the threat of imminent death – either by an airstrike, starvation or disease.
The conflict has escalated hostilities across the region, with Iran’s allies and proxies – the so-called axis of resistance – launching attacks on Israeli forces and its allies.
On Tuesday, the US military launched new strikes against Houthi targets inside Yemen, targeting anti-ship ballistic missiles controlled by the Iran-backed rebel group, a defense official told CNN.
A few hours later, the Houthis launched a missile into international shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea, hitting the M/V Zografia, a Maltese flagged bulk carrier, the official said.
The strikes are at least the third round of attacks the US military has launched against the Houthis’ infrastructure since last Thursday, when American and British conducted a joint operation that targeted command and control nodes and weapons depots used by the Houthis to launch missile and drone attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
US troops in Iraq and Syria have also repeatedly come under rocket and drone attacks from Tehran’s proxies. Last week, the US carried out a strike in Baghdad that killed a leader from an Iran-backed proxy group that Washington blamed for attacks against US personnel in the region.
And fighting has intensified between Israel and the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah, across the Lebanon border. On Sunday, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah vowed to press on with confrontations with Israeli forces on the Lebanon border until the end of the Israeli offensive in Gaza.

03B6WPFPPS_R6SIEEMK64ZJBRZ,Texas has until the end of today to stop blocking federal access to miles of the US-Mexico border,"Alisha Ebrahimji, Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt, CNN","January 17, 2024 at 4:57 PM·7 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/texas-until-end-today-stop-175227331.html,"A migrant surge continues to overwhelm authorities at the US-Mexico border — and in US cities where many asylum-seekers are being sent.
Here are the latest developments:
The Biden administration has given Texas until the end of Wednesday to stop blocking the US Border Patrol’s access to 2.5 miles along the US-Mexico border that includes the area where a woman and two children drowned after state authorities last week barred federal agents from the zone, according to a Department of Homeland Security letter Sunday exclusively obtained by CNN.
The letter to Texas’ Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton says the state’s actions “have impeded operations” and are unconstitutional, and it cites the deaths – among the latest in the ongoing migrant crisis – near a city park abutting the Rio Grande in Eagle Pass where state authorities have erected fencing and kept out federal agents.
The Department of Homeland Security warns it will – by the end of Wednesday – “refer the matter to the Department of Justice for appropriate action and consider all other options available to restore Border Patrol’s access to the border” if Texas doesn’t confirm it will “cease and desist its efforts to block Border Patrol’s access in and around the Shelby Park area and remove all barriers to access to the U.S.-Mexico border,” the letter states.
“Texas’s failure to provide access to the border persists even in instances of imminent danger to life and safety,” the letter from Department of Homeland Security General Counsel Jonathan Meyer reads. “Texas has demonstrated that even in the most exigent circumstances, it will not allow Border Patrol access to the border to conduct law enforcement and emergency response activities.”
Paxton on Wednesday doubled down on the state’s actions, saying, “Texas will not surrender,” in a statement issued by his office.
Paxton responded to the federal government with a three-page letter claiming Texas has constitutional authority to defend its territory, a power he plans to continue to fight for in the courts, according to the letter.
In the letter, Paxton said Border Patrol personnel have access to Shelby Park to respond to medical emergencies.
The Wednesday deadline marks the latest signpost of intensifying tensions between state and federal officials as the White House and lawmakers challenge Texas’ policies, including a new law that makes entering the state illegally a state crime. Friction over the issue also has spilled into states where migrants have been sent by Texas officials or otherwise have gone and has prompted online anti-migrant rhetoric to swell.
The Biden administration also has asked the Supreme Court to intervene after Texas sued over Border Patrol agents’ practice of removing razor wire put in place by the state along part of the border near Eagle Pass. An appeals court ordered the agents to stop removing the wire while legal challenges play out, and the administration has asked the high court to step in on an emergency basis to wipe that order.
The drownings Friday “underscore that Texas is firm in its continued efforts to exercise complete control of the border and land … and to block Border Patrol’s access to the border even in emergency circumstances,” the Biden administration wrote late Monday in a filing to the Supreme Court in that case.
“It is impossible to say what might have happened if Border Patrol had had its former access to the area – including through its surveillance trucks that assisted in monitoring the area,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in the filing.
“At the very least, however, Border Patrol would have had the opportunity to take any available steps to fulfill its responsibilities and assist its counterparts in the Mexican government with undertaking the rescue mission,” she continued. “Texas made that impossible.”
The Texas Military Department, meanwhile, said by the time Border Patrol agents requested access to the site Friday night, “the drownings had occurred, Mexican authorities were recovering the bodies, and Border Patrol expressed these facts to the TMD personnel on site.”
“At no time did TMD security personnel along the river observe any distressed migrants, nor did TMD turn back any illegal immigrants from the US during this period,” the Texas Military Department said. “Also, at no point was TMD made aware of any bodies in the area of Shelby Park, nor was TMD made aware of any bodies being discovered on the US side of the border regarding this situation.”
The federal-state border standoff in Texas has prompted members of a kind of group known for using demonizing rhetoric and intersecting with extremists to issue a call on social media for people to travel to Eagle Pass in protest.
The group is urging “patriots” from across the country to go to Eagle Pass “to demand that elected officials honor their oath of office to defend the border against a ‘foreign invasion,’” according to a member’s online video that employs the term far-right groups use for the border crisis.
A property owner will let the group set up tents, campers and RVs, he says.
These “patriots,” however, are misinformed about border security and immigration policy, said Texas state Rep. Eddie Morales Jr., a Democrat who represents 11 counties in West Texas, including the city of Eagle Pass. Instead, they should camp outside Congress and demand lawmakers act on immigration, he said.
“The Republicans control the House of Representatives right now, if they were truly interested in solving this issue, they would fast track a border immigration and a border security bill by tomorrow,” Morales said.
Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber is monitoring the potential arrival this weekend of people from around the country and is concerned for the safety and security of the area due to the heated rhetoric on immigration, he told CNN.
Groups like this one that use “patriot” as part of their names have emerged since 2020 in an effort to get Donald Trump to form a third major political party, the Anti-Defamation League told CNN in a statement. While such groups are not inherently extremist, they engage in demonizing rhetoric, far-right policy causes and at times intersect with extremist groups and movements, it said.
A state away, Louisiana’s new Republican governor has directed state agencies to report any arrests of or funds spent on undocumented immigrants, he mandated in an executive order signed Friday.
“The cost of illegal immigration in this state is falling on the shoulders of hard-working Louisianans,” Gov. Jeff Landry said in a statement Tuesday. “This Executive Order will analyze data to determine the financial burden our citizens are being forced to carry because of those who do not follow the law.”
“Louisiana will always welcome those who legally immigrate, but taxpayers cannot continue to foot the bill for individuals who break the law and skip the line.”
The heads of every executive branch in the state must provide within 120 days a report to the governor’s office detailing any use “of public funds directly or indirectly, to or for the benefit of illegal aliens,” the order says.
The governor directs the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections and the Superintendent of the Louisiana State Police to provide monthly reports on the number of people “charged or convicted of a criminal offense” and to note whether they are documented or undocumented, according to the order.
Law enforcement is also directed in the order to “regularly publish” to the public data regarding “arrests and convictions of illegal aliens,” their nationality, their offense, whether charged or convicted and report any “known or suspected gang affiliation” for arrested undocumented immigrants and where they were arrested.

Estonia, as well as Lithuania and Latvia, have been among Kyiv's staunchest supporters against Russian aggression, committing the highest gross domestic product (GDP) shares of all the allies.
Ukraine's head of state arrived in Tallinn earlier on Jan. 11 as a second step of his tour. A day earlier, Zelensky was in Lithuania, where he received a pledge of nearly $220 million for the next three years.
The president is scheduled to finalize his tour in Latvia.
During a joint press conference with Zelensky, Karis called on the EU to increase its military support for Ukraine as the country enters its third calendar year of an all-out war with Russia.
""Ukraine needs more and better weapons. The capacity of the EU's military industry must be increased so that Ukraine gets what it needs, not tomorrow, but today,"" Karis said.
Estonia's defense contributions to Ukraine have amounted to around 500 million euros ($550 million) since the start of the full-scale war, which is around 1.4% of the country's GDP.
Over the next four years, Tallinn pledged to allocate 0.25% of its GDP to military assistance for Kyiv.
Karis noted that Tallinn has concrete plans for helping Ukraine's reconstruction, adding it would be fair to use frozen Russian funds for this purpose.
Last November, an Estonian parliamentary committee approved a governmental bill to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine. The document still has to be approved by the majority in the parliament and signed by the president.

Karis also revealed that the topic of ceasefire is being raised in informal meetings among Western allies to ""test the mood."" The Estonian president pledged that the position of his country remains unchanged: ""There will be peace when Ukraine wins the war.""
Zelensky also ruled out a ceasefire with Moscow, saying that a ""pause would play into (Russia's) hands"" and could be used to ""crush"" Ukraine.
""Estonia's unwavering support for Ukraine, our people, and our defense is evident today, during my visit, and throughout the war,"" Zelensky said on the social media platform X.
""President Alar Karis and I discussed cooperation at the European institutions' level, our potential in Europe, frontline developments and prospects, and justice.""
Following his meeting with the Estonian president, Zelensky held a press conference with the country's prime minister, Kaja Kallas.
Zelensky thanked Kallas and her country for their support, noting that Estonia ""was with Ukraine since the very beginning (of the full-scale war)"" and underscoring Tallinn's military assistance and backing of EU aspirations.
Ukraine's president also appreciated Estonia's support for Kyiv's efforts to join NATO and in talks on security guarantees.
Responding to a journalist's question on concrete steps Estonia and other allies can take to aid Ukraine, Zelensky said that the EU's initiative of providing 1 million artillery shells should be finalized.
Ukrainian and Western officials warned that the EU plan to supply the full amount of promised shells by March will likely miss its deadline. In November, European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said that 480,000 rounds have been transferred or are on their way, less than half of the promised number.
Zelensky also emphasized the need for a united approach within the EU and NATO in supporting Ukraine, pointing out how a lack of consensus continues to stall 50 billion euros ($55 billion) in funding for Kyiv.
Zelensky further underscored the importance of cooperation in cyberspace security. Last December, Ukraine and 10 partner countries, including Estonia, launched the Tallinn mechanism, a joint initiative on combatting cyber threats.
Estonia is not the only Baltic country pledging additional support this week.
During Zelensky's trip to Vilnius, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda revealed that ""in January, we (Lithuania) will again send ammunition, generators, detonation systems, and in February - M-577 armored personnel carriers.""
Lithuania's newly-announced 2024-2026 support plan for Kyiv of 200 million euros ($219 million) focuses mainly on the Vilnius-led demining coalition, presented last July. The Baltic country also plans to train about 3,000 Ukrainian soldiers by the end of 2024.
Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Lithuania has committed extensive military support, including various munitions and NASAMS air defense launchers, and hosts a repair facility for Leopard 2 tanks damaged in Ukraine.
Lithuania has already provided Ukraine with around 500 million euros ($543 million) in defense assistance since the outbreak of the full-scale war.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was ""not swayed"" by Chinese ambassador Xiao Qian's comment a day earlier that a Chinese navy ship didn't use its sonar while Australian divers were in the water, and a Japanese boat could have been the source.
Albanese said in November a Chinese warship acted in a dangerous manner by using its sonar during an incident with an Australian navy vessel in Japan's waters that injured military divers who were clearing fishing nets from its propellers, and the incident had damaged ties.
China has previously rejected Australia's description of the incident, and at an annual press briefing on Wednesday, Xiao said China ""didn't initiate sonar"", adding there was a Japanese navy boat nearby. ""Whether there was sonar from the other party, we don't know,"" he told reporters.
Albanese said on Thursday, ""I think it is very clear what occurred.""
""I stand by the comments I made at the time, that it was wrong, that it shouldn't have occurred,"" he said in a media briefing.
Australia has said medical assessments found minor injuries to the divers involved were likely caused by the Chinese destroyer's sonar.
Japan's embassy in Australia said it didn't know what Xiao said.
""Generally speaking, however, Japan and Australia as the core of a partnership of like-minded countries in the Indo-Pacific region, unambiguously abide by the rule of law and have been promoting security cooperation across a wide range of areas,"" an embassy spokesman said in a statement.

South Africa's claim in ""unfounded"" and ""absurd,"" said Tal Becker, legal advisor to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
Victims of the Gaza war and the suffering of the civilian population were solely the responsibility of the terrorist organization Hamas. ""Israel is at war with Hamas not the Palestinian people,"" he told the judges.
Israel has invoked its right to self-defence following the attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian extremists from Gaza on October 7.
Becker also described the massacres in which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 kidnapped from Israel, around half of whom have been released so far.
""What Israel seeks is not to destroy a people but to protect a people, its people,"" Becker said.
This is the first time that Israel has faced a genocide accusation before the highest court of the United Nations.
On Thursday, the first day of hearings, South Africa put forward its contention that Israel is committing ""systematic"" acts of genocide, citing examples of military violence and statements by Israeli politicians and military brass.
More than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed amid Israel's military campaign in Gaza, with at least 70% of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health authority.
These initial court proceedings concern an urgent application by South Africa for the ICJ judges to order an end to Israeli military action.
The court, which is based in the Netherlands and is supposed to resolve conflicts between states, will decide on this in the coming weeks.
However, proceedings on the main issue - the genocide allegation - could take years to resolve.
Israel has repeatedly dismissed South Africa's claims as baseless.
The fight against Hamas in the Gaza Strip is ""in full compliance with international law,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday."

0A0N2X2DNL_MSQWVMA1F98ZLQY,Unofficial US delegation says support for Taiwan remains ‘rock solid’ after voters defied China,"Nectar Gan and Eric Cheung, CNN","January 15, 2024 at 4:01 PM·4 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/unofficial-us-delegation-says-support-080144089.html,"Former senior US officials reaffirmed “rock solid” American support for Taiwan in a visit Monday after the self-ruled island defied threats from China by electing a new president loathed by Beijing.
Lai Ching-te, a staunch defender of Taiwan’s sovereignty and democracy, on Saturday won a historic third consecutive term for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), shrugging off warnings from Beijing that his election would increase the risk of conflict.
In keeping with past US practice, the Biden administration dispatched an unofficial delegation to Taiwan following the election to meet the island’s current and incoming presidents. But the US reaction to the election has already sparked an angry response from China.
In a meeting with Taiwan’s incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen Monday, former US national security adviser Stephen Hadley congratulated Taiwan on the elections on behalf of the American people, praising the self-ruled island’s democracy as a “shining example for the world.”
Hadley reaffirmed that “the American commitment to Taiwan is rock solid, principled and bipartisan.”
“We look forward to continuity in the relationship between Taiwan and the United States under the new administration and for common efforts to preserve cross-strait peace and stability,” he said.
Former deputy secretary of state James Steinberg said the delegation traveled to Taiwan to “underscore the US bipartisan support for our long-standing friendship for Taiwan.”
During Tsai’s eight years in office, Taiwan has bolstered its ties with its democratic partners, especially the US, its biggest international backer, which increased support and arms sales to the island.
The delegation also met with Lai and Vice President-elect Hsiao Bi-khim, a well-known figure in Washington after serving as Taiwan’s top envoy to the United States.
In the meeting, Lai called the US “Taiwan’s most important partner,” and expressed gratitude for its long-standing support to the island.
Lai vowed to build on Tsai’s efforts to defend peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. “And we hope that the United States will continue to support Taiwan to deepen our cooperation in this area,” he said.
“I believe that our relationship will continue to flourish as we work together, and it will become an important force in defending peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,” he added.
The visit came after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday congratulated Lai on his win and Taiwan’s people “for once again demonstrating the strength of their robust democratic system and electoral process.”
In a statement, Blinken said the US looks forward to working with Lai and Taiwan’s leaders of all parties to “advance our shared interests and values, and to further our longstanding unofficial relationship.”
That statement prompted an angry response from Beijing, which views Taiwan as its own territory to be taken by force if necessary.
On Sunday, China’s Foreign Ministry said the statement “seriously violates the one-China principle” and US promises to only maintain cultural, commercial and other unofficial ties with Taiwan.
“It also sends a gravely wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces. We strongly deplore and firmly oppose this, and have made serious representations to the US side,” the ministry said in a statement.
The Chinese embassies in Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada also lashed out at their host countries for congratulating Lai on his victory.
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa called Taiwan “an extremely crucial partner and an important friend” in her congratulatory message. The Chinese embassy in Tokyo said it “resolutely opposed” her statement, which it blasted as “a serious interference in China’s internal affairs.”
Taiwan was a Japanese colony for half a century until 1945.
Under Xi Jinping, China’s most powerful leader in a generation, Beijing has ramped up economic, military and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan, and severed official communication with Taipei’s government since 2016. Lai’s election is unlikely to lead to a thawing of cross-strait ties any time soon.
Washington cut formal ties with Taiwan in 1979 after switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
Since then, the US has maintained close unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. But it has long remained deliberately vague on whether it will come to Taiwan’s defense in case of a Chinese attack.
Asked by reporters to comment on Taiwan’s election results Saturday, US President Joe Biden said: “We do not support independence.”

Option A involves creating a fund for Ukraine that would operate for four years within the EU budget. Option B is an extra-budgetary fund where EU member states can contribute. Option C involves the European Commission borrowing funds under its guarantee, allowing the EC to provide macrofinancial support as periodic borrowings from the Commission under guarantees, Chentsov said.
Hungary is aware of these alternatives and that no country can “continually play the veto game.”
The EU favors the first option as it is cheaper and more convenient. “I believe Option A will be adopted,” said Chentsov. “There might be some safeguards or financial metrics review options in the final decision.”

While the approval of the $54.3  billion aid for Ukraine is far off, bilateral assistance remains a possibility, Hungary stated on Jan. 18.
The EU is confident in approving the €50 ($54.3 USD) billion aid for Ukraine within a few weeks, NV  reported on Jan. 17.
Hungarian Prime Minister Orban blocked the adoption of an EU budget decision, which included a medium-term aid program for Ukraine, at the EU summit in December.
Ukraine will receive €50 billion in aid from the European Union, despite Hungary's opposition, Germany’s Foreign Ministry announced at the end of December.
The EU is preparing an alternative plan to provide Ukraine with €20 billion ($21.74 billion) in financial support, bypassing Orban's veto, the Financial Times reported.  The proposed mechanism could be used if Orban's veto is not overcome at the planned summit on Feb. 1.

0GCCWGEZS0_II3EW57THAAG56M,British prime minister visits Ukraine to give aid and reassurances of West's support against Russia,SAMYA KULLAB and HANNA ARHIROVA,"Updated January 13, 2024 at 2:08 AM·4 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/uk-prime-minister-kyiv-announce-074649713.html,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak unveiled new military funding for Ukraine on Friday during a visit to Kyiv aimed at reassuring the country that the West is still providing support nearly 23 months after Russia’s invasion.
The package, worth 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) over the next fiscal year, is the largest the U.K. has given to Ukraine since the war began, surpassing previous annual commitments by 200 million pounds ($233 million), the British government said.
“I am here today with one message: The U.K. will ... not falter,” Sunak said. “We will stand with Ukraine, in their darkest hours and in the better times to come.”
The package will pay for long-range missiles, thousands of drones, air defense, artillery ammunition and maritime security, according to Sunak's office. It comes at a time when other financial aid from the U.S. and Europe is tied up by political wrangling,
“We are not walking away,” Sunak said at a news conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Ukrainian officials welcomed the U.K. announcement, pointing to it as evidence that Western support for its fight against its bigger neighbor is not waning, as some have feared.
“This is a signal to the world: Ukraine is not alone,” Zelenskyy said.
Sunak and Zelenskyy signed a bilateral security agreement for the next 10 years. It will remain in effect until Ukraine acquires its hoped-for NATO membership, Zelenskyy said. Details of the agreement are to be released later, officials said.
Kyiv has been urging the West to send more of the kind of aid the U.K. is providing as the grinding war brings little change along the front line and both sides turn to long-range strikes.
Sunak said he made Ukraine his first foreign trip of the year to send a “strong signal” of support, representing ""the seriousness of the situation here and our determination to stand with Ukraine” amid competing claims for international attention.
Russian President Vladimir Putin “needs to recognize we’re not going anywhere,” he said.
“We are here for Ukraine to win,” said Sunak, who noted that supporting Kyiv was a way to protect global security. “If Putin wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there.”
Sunak’s visit came hours after the British and U.S. militaries bombed Yemen, hitting more than a dozen sites used by the Iranian-backed Houthis.
Thursday’s strikes were a reminder of another war, which has raged for years in the Arab world’s poorest nation. The attack also risked triggering a wider regional conflict over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Those concerns have drawn attention away from Ukraine’s struggle — a shift that Zelenskyy is trying to counter through diplomacy.
Sunak first visited Ukraine in November 2022, soon after he became prime minister, and Britain is one of Ukraine's most vocal backers. It is the second-biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the U.S., giving a total of 4.6 billion pounds ($5.8 billion) in 2022 and 2023.
Ukraine and Russia are seeking to replenish their arsenals this year, military analysts say, in anticipation of possible major ground offensives in 2025.
Sunak said the U.K. aid is the biggest single package from any nation for drones, which have become a key battlefield weapon.
The roughly 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line has been largely static during winter, and both Ukraine and Russia need artillery shells, missiles and drones that enable longer-range strikes.
Ukraine says Moscow is receiving artillery shells and missiles from North Korea and drones from Iran. On Jan. 4, the White House cited U.S. intelligence officials as saying that Russia acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and is seeking them from Iran.
Zelenskyy is pushing Kyiv’s Western allies to provide more support on top of the billions of dollars in military aid the country has already received.
He visited Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia this week in search of new pledges. The Baltic countries are among Kyiv’s staunchest supporters, and they promised more missiles, drones, howitzers and artillery shells.
Zelenskyy has warned that Ukraine particularly needs air defense systems. Recent Russian barrages — more than 500 drones and missiles were fired between Dec. 29 and Jan. 2, according to officials in Kyiv — are using up Ukraine’s resources and leaving it vulnerable.
Sunak said that the U.K. recognizes that Ukrainian security “is our security,” as Kyiv's forces stand up to Putin.
“Today we are going further — increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones, and signing a historic new security agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term,” he said.
A plan by the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden to send $60 billion in new funding to Kyiv is being held up in Congress. Europe’s pledge in March to provide 1 million artillery shells within 12 months also has fallen short, with only about 300,000 delivered by the end of last year.

“And we’re asking you simply to be human beings, to see them,” said Romi Cohen
She’s come to Seattle, pleading for you to recognize that her brother’s life matters after he was taken hostage by Hamas.
She asks you to consider her brother, not in terms of politics, but in terms of humanity.
For 19 years, Nimrod Cohen has been by his sister’s side. Now their lives have been ripped apart.
“I just miss him because he’s my best friend,” said Romi. “We’ve always been two and now I’m one, and I feel like I’m not complete without him.”
Nimrod and his friends were near the Israel-Gaza border on October 7th. The Cohens haven’t seen him since, except in images released by Hamas.
“Our family is broken, said Father Yehuda Cohen,” My family is not complete, so we can’t have a normal life.”
They are among a group of families who just landed in Seattle, trying to keep Israeli hostages in the spotlight.
They hope by sharing their nightmare the war and hostage crisis come to an end.
“I just want him back and time is running out and we need to bring him home because maybe if we don’t do it soon enough, it will be too late,” said Romi.
The Cohens are tortured by waiting for horrible news, others are tortured by what they already know.
“This is Eli, the terrorists broke into [Kibbutz] Be’eri and, killed his wife, Leanne, and his two daughters,” said 16-year-old Harel Sharabi, “And they were my best friends.”
Since Oct. 7, she’s gotten drips of information, all of it bloody.
At least five family members were murdered with their homes burned to the ground. Her Uncle Ellie was also kidnapped.
“I always wonder if Ellie and the rest of the other hostages will ever smile like that again,” continued Harel.
She knows she won’t, but she’s among those who have packed up their grief and traveled thousands of miles, helpless but hopeful.
“We need your help,” said Romi. “And we’re asking you simply to be human beings, to see them.”"

US officials say warship-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles and fighter jets hit 16 sites, including in the capital, Sanaa, and Hudaydah, the Houthi Red Sea port stronghold.
The strikes are in response to repeated attacks by the Iran-backed group on commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
The Houthis, who back Hamas, said at least five of their number were killed.
The group claims to be targeting ships linked to Israel - saying the attacks are in response to Israel's campaign in the Gaza Strip - and have also launched a series of drones and missiles towards Israel.
The Houthi targets in Yemen early on Friday included logistical hubs, air defence systems and arms depots, US officials told the Associated Press news agency.
US President Joe Biden, quoted by Reuters news agency, said the US and UK military had successfully launched strikes against Houthi targets with support from countries including Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.
""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,"" Mr Biden said.
He added that he ""will not hesitate"" to order further military action if necessary.
Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said in response that there was ""absolutely no justification"" for the attacks and that the group would continue to target Israeli ships.
Iran and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah - both Houthi allies - have also condemned the strikes.
US and UK hint at action after largest Red Sea attack
Who are the Houthi rebels attacking Red Sea ships?
What do Red Sea assaults mean for global trade?
These are the first such actions by the US military in the Red Sea since the Houthi drone and missile attacks on shipping began in November.
The Houthis, who control a large part of Yemen, have been targeting merchant vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden with missiles and drones - putting lives at risk, threatening the global economy and destabilising the region.
Four RAF Typhoon jets flying from Akrotiri in Cyprus also conducted air strikes on two Houthi targets in Yemen using Paveway bombs, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale reports.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the strikes in a statement on Friday morning, calling them ""limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defence"".
Mr Sunak denounced the ""reckless actions"" of the Houthi militia, who he said had carried out a series of ""dangerous and destabilising attacks"" against commercial shipping in the Red Sea despite repeated warnings from the international community.
He added that the UK would ""always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade"".
On 9 January, HMS Diamond, along with US warships, successfully repelled the largest attack from the Houthis in the Red Sea to date. On the same day, the Houthis said they targeted a US ship providing support to Israel - the 26th attack on commercial shipping in the Red Sea since 19 November.
Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have increased 500% between November and December. The threat has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December.
The International Chamber of Shipping says 20% of the world's container ships are now avoiding the Red Sea and using the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa instead."

A U.S. owned and operated container ship was struck by an anti-ship ballistic missile from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, U.S. Central Command said in a statement Monday.
The strike took place around 4 p.m. local time and hit a vessel named M/V Gibraltar Eagle, which did not incur significant damage and continued its journey. Additionally, the statement said no casualties or injuries resulted from the attack.
U.S. Central Command said that an anti-ship ballistic missile had been fired toward Southern Red Sea commercial shipping lanes earlier that day, at around 2 p.m. local time. The missile failed in flight and impacted on land in Yemen. There were no injuries or damage reported, according to the statement.
Reuters reported that three missiles were fired in total, with only one impacting the vessel.
Eagle Bulk Shipping, the company that operates the ship, released a statement Monday saying: ""As a result of the impact, the vessel suffered limited damage to a cargo hold but is stable and is heading out of the area.” It added that the vessel was carrying a cargo of steel products and confirmed that all staff on board were uninjured.
The attack from the militia group—who are closely aligned with Iran and control the nation's capital Sanaa—comes in response to airstrikes carried out by the U.S. and U.K. on Thursday. The two nations targeted 60 sites across 16 locations.
The Houthis called Thursday’s attack “barbaric” and in a separate statement called the U.K. and the U.S. “legitimate targets.” Speaking of the strikes, U.S. President Joe Biden said they would “not hesitate” to take further action against the Houthis if needed.
“These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation,” Biden said.
On Friday, tens of thousands of Yemenis gathered in several cities to reaffirm their support for Gaza despite the strikes against their nation.
Houthis have been targeting and intercepting commercial ships in the Red Sea using drones since Israel began its full-scale bombardment of Gaza in retaliation to Hamas’ surprise attack on Oct. 7. The group has targeted vessels with perceived links to Israel and its allies who have voted against a ceasefire in Gaza, where over 24,000 Palestinians have been killed.
The efforts are an attempt to create economic pressure on these nations and disrupt global supply chains, as around 12% of global trade passes through the Red Sea.
As a result, some shipping lines have been forced to redirect vessels via longer routes but there have been no casualties as a result of the attacks.

0VNVRQH0ZE_7P6PBQOF4TBVVG4,Two British brothers 'should be banned from Switzerland' for museum heist,"Thomas Mackintosh - BBC News, in Geneva","January 16, 2024 at 4:13 PM·3 min read",20240116,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/two-british-brothers-banned-switzerland-064621456.html,"Prosecutors have called for two British brothers to be banned from Switzerland for five years as punishment for their role in raiding a museum of iconic Chinese Ming Dynasty artefacts.
At a court in Geneva on Monday, Stewart and Louis Ahearne confessed to being part of a gang which burgled the Museum of Far Eastern Art in June 2019.
On top of the ban, prosecutor Marco Rossier said the court should jail the brothers for four years.
They will be sentenced on Tuesday.
Mr Rossier told the court the brothers, who are from south-east London - and a third man named in court by lawyers as Daniel Kelly - were all ""equally involved"" in the burglary.
He said Louis Ahearne carried out reconnaissance of the museum, while his older brother Stewart hired a Renault Captur car out in his name - which he then drove to and from the scene of the crime.
""Louis Ahearne booked the hotel room, the ski masks and clothing used in the burglary,"" Mr Rossier said.
""Everything was prepared and organised. Everything was very quick.""
Two bowls and a vase from the 14th Century were taken in the raid, Mr Rossier explained, adding one bowl was taken to a Hong Kong auction house by the three men. Stewart Ahearne left his passport details as they sold the item, the prosecutor added.
A second item, a vase, was recovered in central London as part of an undercover sting operation with Metropolitan Police officers posing as art buyers a year after the heist.
The third plundered artefact, a wine cup, has never been recovered.
Around 3.5m Swiss francs (£3.2m) worth of damage was caused to the Museum of Far Eastern Art which is based in a listed townhouse in Geneva's old town.
On Monday, Louis Ahearne said he carried out the burglary in order to ""clear a debt"" and Stewart Ahearne said he took ""full responsibility"" explaining he wanted to ""protect"" his younger brother.
Mr Rossier said the prosecution doubted the brothers' version of events as the third person was not in the court and is currently the subject of extradition proceedings to Japan.
The court also heard from Loris Bertoliatti, representing the Museum of Far Eastern Art, who said damage caused by a power saw, sledgehammer and crowbar cost the institution millions.
""They are a professional gang,"" he said. ""They were determined to sell the items. The victim is the museum. Lots of people were shocked by what happened.""
Stewart Ahearne's partner Nicola Barry was called as a witness on Monday and described the father-of-five as a ""kind, loving and nice person"" - adding his employer has committed to giving him a job when he is freed.
The brothers' mother, Suzanne Ahearne, said Louis Ahearne is a ""compassionate and empathetic"" person who had an ""unhappy childhood"".
She told the court since his extradition from the UK, he has been writing to his nine-year-old son from prison in Switzerland trying to ""give the guidance he never got"" from his father.
The Ahearnes' defence barristers will also provide mitigation before the president of the court Patrick Monney delivers his judgement.
The hearing continues."
10DK6GPMHU_MHITAZ3SSD7Y4BS,US and Allies Brace for Houthi Retaliation Against Airstrikes,"Mohammed Hatem, Dana Khraiche and Akayla Gardner","January 12, 2024 at 1:59 PM·5 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-allies-brace-houthi-retaliation-195422808.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Houthi rebels vowed to target US and UK commercial vessels a day after the allies launched airstrikes against the group in Yemen, fanning concern that the Israel-Gaza war is blossoming into the regional conflict with Iran that the Biden administration feared.

Western naval forces in the Red Sea were on guard for any retaliation from the Thursday night airstrikes as Houthi leader Mohammed Ali Al-Houthi told tens of thousands of supporters in Sanaa that counterattacks were “imminent.”
Those comments in turn prompted a fresh warning from President Joe Biden, who said he believes Iran doesn’t want war and that he considers the Houthis a terrorist group. That suggests the US might restore a terrorist designation revoked early in the administration. On Friday, a ship hauling Russian oil had a narrow miss with a missile fired from Yemen, according to the UK’s Royal Navy.
“I’ve already delivered the message to Iran — they know not to do anything,” Biden told reporters. “We will make sure that we respond to the Houthis as they continue this outrageous behavior, along with our allies.”
The back-and-forth prompted fresh worries that the round of allied airstrikes would fail to deter Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea, and that the turmoil that’s seen shipping companies route their vessels around the southern tip of Africa would continue unabated.
That would present a new set of challenges for Biden and allies that joined or supported the strikes, including the UK, which must decide to keep up their attacks — and risk new provocations of the Houthis’ main backer, Iran — or seek some other solution. Israel has said it won’t let up its attacks on Gaza in the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7 incursion — the Houthis’ initial justification for their strikes — and a diplomatic solution is unlikely.
Despite the escalating aggression, the strikes on Yemen will probably have a limited impact on the global economy, according to Ziad Daoud, chief emerging markets economist at Bloomberg Economics. The attacks are unlikely to draw Iran into the conflict directly, and shipping costs remain below their 2021 peak, he wrote in a note.
Oil prices rose after the airstrikes. Brent futures gained as much as 4.3% before paring their gains.
“Neither side is looking to have an all-out war, and they are badly mismatched,” Jon Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for International and Strategic Studies, wrote in a note of the US and Iran. “But that is not to say that the Houthis will stop attacking shipping, or that the United States will stop attacking the Houthis.”
Of the more than 100 precision-guided weapons fired at Houthi targets, more than 80 were Tomahawk cruise missiles, according to two American defense officials, who asked not to be identified discussing details that haven’t been widely released. In 2017, the US fired 59 Tomahawks at Syrian targets against the regime there in retaliation for President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemicals against civilians.
The Tomahawks aimed at Yemen were fired from the cruiser USS Philippine Sea, destroyers USS Mason and USS Gravely and submarine USS Florida, said an official. The latest version of the Tomahawk, which both the US and UK. navies have, can loiter over an area for hours, beam target images and battle damage assessments to commanders and be programmed to attack new stationary targets while overhead.
Shortly before the allied attack, the Houthis had launched a concentrated barrage of missiles and drones at ships in the Red Sea. Asked Friday if the group could conduct more such operations after the airstrikes, Lieutenant General Doug Sims said the allies had “degraded capability.”
How Iran-Backed Groups Are Widening Mideast Conflict: QuickTake
The strikes embroil the US in yet another fight with an Iranian proxy since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7. American forces have launched attacks in Syria and Iraq in recent weeks against Iranian-supported militias that have targeted American bases — so far without major casualties.
The strikes started about 2:30 a.m. Yemen time, with residents in Sanaa and Red Sea port city of Hodeida reporting huge explosions. Other Houthi-held towns were hit including Saada, Taiz and Hajjah, the group said.
The Houthis said there were 73 strikes in total and that five fighters were killed. It’s unclear if there were civilian casualties. The US military said 16 sites were hit including airports, radar installations and storage and launch sites for drones and missiles.
The Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Bahrain provided support as part of the mission, though they didn’t fire missiles.
Many companies have rerouted their ships away from the Red Sea — which links to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal — forcing their vessels on much longer routes around southern Africa. Volvo Car AB said Friday it will suspend production at its Belgian plant because of supply-chain disruptions, while Tesla Inc. shares dropped after warning of the impact on its sole European factory.
Saudi Arabia said it was following the latest events with “great concern,” highlighting how some of the US’s regional allies are uneasy about the strikes.
The kingdom borders Yemen and has been trying to forge a peace deal with the Houthis after failing to dislodge them from power for most of the past decade. The Houthis have attacked Saudi territory in the past, including in 2019 when they claimed a hit that briefly knocked out half the kingdom’s oil production.
The fighting in Gaza, at the same time, continues to rage and Israeli officials say it could go on for months, if not longer. More than 23,000 people have been killed there, according to health officials in the Hamas-run Palestinian territory.
Hamas, designated a terrorist group by the US and European Union, killed 1,200 people during its October incursion into Israel.

Widodo and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding to deepen bilateral relations on energy, according to live-streamed proceedings.
“Our countries create a new synergy as we cooperate to achieve energy security,” Marcos said in a briefing with Widodo, who’s commonly known as Jokowi, after their bilateral meeting in Manila on Wednesday.
The Philippines gets the bulk of its imported coal from Indonesia and Manila secured Jakarta’s assurance last year on steady access to the commodity. “In the field of economy, in order to enhance trade, we agreed to continue to open market access, and Indonesia seeks the Philippines’ support related to special safeguard measures on Indonesian coffee products,” Widodo said.
During the meeting, Widodo pushed for improvements in border security cooperation, and the settlement of continental shelf boundaries. He also pitched to sell anti-submarine warfare aircraft from Indonesia to the Philippine Navy.
The leaders also discussed the South China Sea, where tensions have recently heightened between China and the Philippines.
The Philippines last year signed a contract to acquire six light aircraft from state-owned PT Dirgantara Indonesia for its air force.
The Indonesian leader is on a three-day official trip to Manila and is scheduled to visit factories of instant coffee producer Kopiko Philippines Corp. and carrageenan supplier W Hydrocolloids Inc. He is set to visit Brunei and Vietnam next.

Argentina's security minister said the move against Adolfo Macías Villamar's family showed the country is a ""hostile territory for narco-criminals"".
The gang leader, known as Fito, is at large after escaping from an Ecuadorean prison earlier this month.
Ecuador is under a state of emergency as a nationwide search for the organised crime boss continues.
Argentine authorities released footage on Friday of several people they say have links to Fito under police escort aboard an air force plane.
Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich told a press conference they were detained at a property in the region of Córdoba and had been returned to Ecuador. She said eight people were deported in total, including associates and family members.
Interior Minister Guillermo Francos said Argentina would ""not be a den for criminals"".
The move comes as Ecuador's government continues to hunt Fito while attempting to quell an outbreak of gang-related disorder that has plunged the country into crisis.
Fito, who is head of the Los Choneros gang and has been accused of orchestrating earlier prison violence, vanished from his cell in a facility in the city of Guayaquil.
He has also been linked to the murder of Fernando Villavicencio, an anti-corruption presidential candidate who was shot dead last August.
In the aftermath of the escape, Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa declared war on the country's gangs and imposed tough security conditions, a stance which has been met with unprecedented levels of violence by Ecuador's gangs.
Earlier this week, authorities said they had regained control of the country's prisons after days of rioting - but the country's most wanted fugitive remains elusive.
Mr Noboa has called on authorities in neighbouring Colombia - where several powerful drug cartels are based - to begin searching for Fito, according to AFP news agency.
He has also reiterated plans to deport foreign criminals in a bid to alleviate overcrowding in Ecuador's volatile prisons."

Source: Ukrinform news agency, citing Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, Chairman of the Ukrainian Parliamentary Committee on Freedom of Speech, a lawmaker from the Holos (Voice) faction
Quote: ""Two big issues. The first is finding mechanisms to facilitate the release of captured journalists. The latest data indicates that over 25 of your colleagues are currently in captivity. They are not combatants; they are journalists who were doing their job and, according to civilised rules of warfare, should not have been held captive in principle, but the fact is the fact. We understand how uncivilised Russia is and how it has ignored any human rights at all.""
Details: The lawmaker noted that one of the priorities of his work as chairman of the committee is to protect the rights of journalists.
Yurchyshyn believes that, on the one hand, it is necessary to engage the international community as much as possible in freeing journalists, and on the other hand, ""jointly with monitoring organisations and journalistic associations, to prepare a component on liability in the International Criminal Court for crimes against freedom of speech, for crimes against journalists, and possibly to strengthen such liability by defining a range of concepts in Ukrainian legislation.""
At the same time, Yurchyshyn added, ""Unfortunately, it is not only Russia that hinders the proper work of journalists"".
Quote: ""We have a drop in investigations of crimes against journalists by almost 80% in 2022 compared to those in 2021. We can attribute everything to the war, but as a country that is joining the European community, for which the value of freedom of speech is one of the core pillars, we should definitely not allow this to happen.
That is why we have communicated with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, we are planning to do the same with the National Police and the Prosecutor General's Office, and we will hold hearings in the committee to investigate cases of impeding journalistic activity. We are waiting for the 2023 data to be available so that we can consider the actual information.""

During his Golden Globes acceptance speech Yeun spoke lovingly of his wife and the compassion he's been afforded.
“I’m just so thankful. I’m just the recipient of a long line of compassion and love and protection and goodwill, so I appreciate this,"" he said. “Joana, I love you. You are my strength.”
Here’s everything to know about Yeun and Pak's McCary’s love story.
Pak, a photographer originally from Fayetteville, Arkansas, met Yeun while she was attending Columbia College in Chicago, according to an interview the pair did with Martha Stewart Weddings. At the time, Yeun was peforming with the Second City comedy theater, also based in Chicago.
The couple began officially dating in 2009, the same year that Yeun was cast in the pivotal role of Glenn on ""The Walking Dead.""
“She walked into the bar where I was a really s---- bartender, and it was kismet,” said Yeun.
Yeun once shared a mishap from their early days of dating. In an interview with GQ, Yeun said he ""invited Jo out with two other friends who happened to be girls, which was the worst move of all time.""
He said, “Probably because I hadn’t been dating in so long, and by that point I was just like, ‘You know what? I’m just going to not let her know that I’m into her.’ I was playing dumb. Just lame-ass moves. Then we broke off on our own, and I saw her every day for the rest of the year.”
While Steven relocated to Los Angeles for the hit series, their relationship took a long-distance turn. Pak tells Martha Stewart Weddings that Yeun ""was based in Atlanta for half the year"" during the beginning of their relationship.
""I was in Chicago at the time. We appeared to be everywhere,"" she says.
Despite the distance, their relationship prevailed and the pair were engaged by August 2015.
The couple wed in a private ceremony on December 3, 2016, and exchanged vows in front of 220 guests, including Yeun's castmates, Norman Reedus (Darly) and Andrew Lincoln (Rick), from the hit AMC zombie series.

The duo, who are currently living in Los Angeles, wanted a vibrant celebration that would honor their common Korean ancestry and symbolize their shared life together. The pair donned traditional Korean attire for their wedding.
The couple announced the birth of their two children in now deleted Instagram posts, per People.
While the couple has kept their relationship private, Pak has often been pictured attending Yeun's events over their eight-year marriage.
One notable appearance was when Pak stepped out at the Oscars in 2021 for her husband, who received a first-time nomination for Best Actor in ""Minari.""
Yeun was the first Asian American actor to receive an Academy Award nomination for best actor.

Somalia's information minister told the BBC the plane did not have permission to be in the country's airspace.
The Ethiopian officials were visiting Somaliland to discuss a deal, which has sparked a huge row.
Somalia considers Somaliland to be part of its territory.
The agreement, signed on 1 January, would allow Somaliland to lease one of its ports to Ethiopia in exchange for a stake in Ethiopian Airlines and possible recognition of Somaliland as a sovereign state.
Somalia has reacted angrily to the deal, calling it an act of aggression.
On Wednesday, the Somali Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA) said flight ET8273 had broken international rules that flights must obtain clearance from countries they are passing through.
It had attempted to land at Somaliland's Hargeisa Airport.
Despite this incident, regular flights between the two countries are operating as usual, the SCAA said.
Ethiopia's government has not yet commented, but the head of Ethiopian Airlines confirmed that the plane in question had returned to the nation's capital, Addis Ababa.
Somaliland, a former British protectorate which declared independence from Somalia in 1991, has all the trappings of a country, including regular elections, a police force and its own currency.
But this has not been recognised by any country.
By ordering the Ethiopian plane out of its airspace, Somalia is sending a strong message that Somaliland is not an independent country.
Amid the row between Somalia and Ethiopia, both the US and the African Union have backed the territorial integrity of Somalia and urged all parties to cool tensions.

Earlier this month, Sarvamaa launched a petition to remove some of Budapest's membership rights due to the country's ""erosion of the rule of law"" and obstructive behavior in the face of EU consensus building.
The resolution, supported by 345 MEPs with 104 voting against and 29 abstaining, calls on the European Council to examine whether Hungary is committing a ""serious and persistent breach"" of the bloc's values under Article 7.2 of the EU treaty.
If 26 members, excluding the 27th member who is under consideration, agree that a breach is occurring, a qualified majority of the Council can suspend some of Hungary's membership rights, including voting rights, under Article 7.3 until all duties are fulfilled.
""The European Parliament has done its part; now it's up to Member States to follow through,"" Sarvamaa said on the social media platform X.
Earlier this week, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who is considered close to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, said he would fight against any attempts to restrict Hungary's EU rights. Bratislava's opposition could prevent consensus on Article 7.2.
Both Fico and Orban have repeatedly criticized Western support for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. Hungary also blocked the EU's long-term budget, including 50 billion euro ($54 billion) for Kyiv, during a European Council summit in December.
This aid is especially crucial now for Ukraine as assistance from the U.S. of over $60 billion remains stalled by domestic political infighting.
EU leaders are to reconvene to vote on the budget on Feb. 1. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the bloc is prepared to provide support for Ukraine even without Hungary's approval.
The EU Parliament's resolution condemned Hungary for blocking the funds. It also called for a probe of the European Commission's decision to unfreeze over 10 billion euros (roughly $11 billion) for Budapest ahead of the December summit.
The European Commission said that the decision was taken strictly due to procedural reasons, namely in response to judicial reforms undertaken by Hungary.
Although Orban blocked the funding for Ukraine, he allowed other EU leaders to reach a consensus on accession talks with Kyiv by leaving the room during a key vote.

NEAR KUPIANSK, Ukraine (Reuters) -Rows of white concrete barricades and coils of razor wire stretch across an open field for more than a kilometre. Trenches with rudimentary living quarters are being dug under cover of darkness. Artillery rumbles not far away.
New defensive lines visited by Reuters near the northeastern city of Kupiansk on Dec. 28 show how Ukraine has stepped up construction of fortifications in recent months as it shifts its military operations against Russia to a more defensive footing.
The defences, which bear some similarities to those rolled out in the Russian-occupied south and east, aim to help Ukraine weather assaults while regenerating its forces as Moscow takes the battlefield initiative, military analysts said.
""As soon as the troops are moving, traversing fields, you can do without fortifications. But when the troops stop, you need to immediately dig into the ground,"" a Ukrainian army engineer with the call sign Lynx told Reuters near Kupiansk.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that Ukraine was ""significantly enhancing"" fortifications on Nov. 28 after a counteroffensive that it launched in June was unable to rapidly punch through Russian lines.
Kyiv says it is unswayed in its ambition to retake all remaining occupied territory, but for now is focused on politically sensitive conscription reforms to replenish manpower and on addressing artillery shortages at the front.
Russia has been ramping up offensive pressure around eastern towns such as Kupiansk, Lyman and Avdiivka, and no longer needs to hold back its reserve troops for fear of a possible Ukrainian breakthrough, the military analysts said.
Zelenskiy said Ukraine's defensive constructions needed to be boosted and work on them accelerated around the three towns, in eastern parts of the Donetsk region, and in the regions of Kharkiv, Sumy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Rivne and Volyn.
Those regions stretch all the way up from Ukraine's east, along the border with Russia and Belarus, to its western ally Poland. Zelenskiy said the southern Kherson region, a swathe of which is still occupied, would also be reinforced.
DEFENSIVE POSTURE
There is no publicly available data for the intensity or scale of the fortification construction.
Ukraine has had defensive lines in some areas of the eastern Donbas region since 2014, when Russia backed militants who seized territory. It has been heavily dug in at places such as Avdiivka throughout the full-scale invasion.
Stronger fortifications would slow down Russian troops and suck fewer Ukrainian forces into defence, freeing them up from the front so they could, for instance, receive more training, said Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute.
""The Ukrainians are now shifting onto a defensive posture because their offensive has culminated,"" he said in a telephone interview, adding that Russia had retaken the initiative on the battlefield and was able to choose where to attack.
With Ukrainian artillery ammunition stocks declining, the rate of Russian casualties was falling, making it easier for Moscow to generate new units, which in time could allow them to open up new lines of attack, he added.
""On the Ukrainian side, they are trying to minimise their own casualties, but also regenerate offensive combat power,"" said Watling.
He said fortifications could also be used to defend Ukraine's flanks when it goes back on the offensive.
DRAGON'S TEETH
On Wednesday, Reuters reporters visited trenches being dug with an excavator and shovels at an undisclosed location in the Chernihiv region near the Russian border.
""When the civilians have done their job (building the positions), we will densely mine it,"" Serhiy Nayev, Ukraine's joint forces commander who oversees the northern military sector, told reporters at the site.
The military has expanded its defensive fortifications in the north by 63% in the last few months, Ukraine's joint forces quoted Nayev as saying on Thursday.
Last month, Reuters reporters visited newly built Ukrainian trenches in Chornobyl near the border with Belarus, a Russian ally used by Moscow as a staging ground for the February 2022 invasion.
A large military engineering vehicle churned through the snowy ground as it carved out a wide anti-tank ditch.
""(The works are ongoing) along the whole Northern Operational Zone. These works are currently underway in Sumy region, Chernihiv region, here in the Kyiv direction,"" Nayev said at the site.
""Concrete structures, barbed wire, ... 'dragon's teeth' (concrete barricades)...; they will be mined and barbed wire will be put on them. This will be a continuous concrete obstacle for armoured vehicles,"" he said.
Near Kupiansk, Ukraine's military showed Reuters reporters newly built defensive lines, but said the exact location could not be disclosed publicly for security reasons.
A military engineer using the call sign ""Lizard"" said they typically put down the ""dragon's teeth"" first, followed by coils of razor wire and then mines, if they use them.
""I believe most of these barriers should have been built much earlier, probably in the spring. It takes too much time,"" he said.
Several hundred metres behind the ""dragon's teeth"", work was underway to expand a network of personnel trenches reinforced with wooden beams where there were also living quarters and wooden bunk beds.
Lynx, the other serviceman, said Ukraine was trying to minimise the use of mines for its fortifications to avoid leaving dangerous munitions on its territory.
""This is our land. We wouldn't want to litter it so much,"" he said.

NASHUA, NH (NEXSTAR) – After relocating much of his campaign staff to South Carolina, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis returned briefly to New Hampshire for a town hall event in Manchester and one in Dover ahead of the primary on Tuesday.
Desantis bragged about how he led Florida out of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how Florida led the rest of the country.
“If it wasn’t for us in Florida, who knows what would’ve happened in this country,” he said. “We’re the ones that dragged this country out of lockdown and made sure that we could be free.”
DeSantis told his rally-goers that he is a different candidate than his Republican rivals, former President Donald Trump and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley.
“I think the choice on Tuesday is very simple. Donald Trump is running for his issues, Nikki Haley is running for the donors issues,” DeSantis said. “I’m running for your issues, and your family’s issues, and solely to turn this country around”
DeSantis took shots at both Trump and Haley. He’s fallen far behind in the polls in New Hampshire, polling at about 6%. However, he says he isn’t worried about what the polls say.
“I can tell you I mean people when I was governor, they would try to produce polls in advance saying I want going to win re-election,” DeSantis said. “Heck, I had polls coming out right before the election saying I was up 3 or 4 points. I won by 20.”
Governor DeSantis will be flying back to South Carolina Saturday for three events in Myrtle Beach, Florence, and Lexington. It is unclear when or if he’ll return to the Granite State.

""The truth is that we are getting our supplies currently from China, Russia and Congo for all these minerals that we need,"" Tom Berendsen, a Dutch Member of European Parliament (MEP) for the European People's Party, argued in favor of the policy.
""The supply chain is unstable, and the working conditions and environmental requirements in those countries are not up to our standards,"" Berendsen continued. ""In short, if we want to continue on the path of clean energy, and we want to do that, that also means making difficult choices.""
Norway’s government last week passed a bill that will make it the first country in the world to implement the controversial practice of commercial deep-sea mining.
SCIENTISTS AIM TO DRILL INTO A VOLCANO'S MAGMA CHAMBER TO UNLEASH POWERFUL ENERGY
The bill mainly empowers Norwegian companies to determine mining opportunities in the country’s territorial waters. Exploration of international waters has already occurred in some cases, but no country has pursued meaningful efforts to actually pursue proper mining operations until now.

Companies will use heavy machinery to scrape the nearby Arctic seabed for metals and minerals, such as magnesium, niobium and cobalt – vital materials in some industrial processes – according to Sky News.
The process could also yield significant amounts of copper and nickel, which also prove useful in the production of clean technologies such as car batteries, semiconductors and solar panels, according to Euronews.
The decision met with significant backlash from environmentalists and conservationists, and many in the European Parliament have been left scratching their heads over how the policy passed without significant support from the scientific community.
PENTAGON TO INSTALL SOLAR PANELS ON ROOFTOP AS PART OF BIDEN CLEAN ENERGY PUSH
""How has this proposal been approved when 800 scientists oppose it, and when the Norwegian Environmental Agency has given a negative opinion?"" César Luena, a Spanish MEP for the Socialists and Democrats (S&D), asked.
Luena demanded that the European Union – of which Norway is not a member – must ""act now"" to protect the seabed. Anti-drilling MEPs argue that Norway’s decision potentially breaches its obligations under the United Nations High Seas Treaty, the Paris Agreement and OSPAR Convention on the protection of the marine environment.
Right-wing lawmakers in the European Parliament have accused their left-wing counterparts of ""hypocrisy"" for opposing efforts to continue developing resource independence from nations like China and Russia, who remain powerful players in the energy space.
The European Commission and Parliament have urged the international community to support a moratorium on deep-sea mining until governments and the scientific community can better inform about the process and dangers of operations.
ALASKA OPENS 2024 SESSION WITH DEBATE ABOUT PAY RAISES, EDUCATION AND ENERGY
In a parliamentary question submitted in March 2023, Irish MEP Grace O’Sullivan from the European Green Party asked if the commission had any evidence of ""environmentally friendly"" underwater mining technologies and a summary of research demonstrating ""no harmful effects"" from mining.
O’Sullivan has remained one of the most ardent opponents of deep-sea mining, writing op-eds in local papers and championing any support for the moratorium, including when French President Emmanuel Macron at COP 27 called for a ban on current operations even as he remained open to continued exploration of its potential.
Norway’s decision is part of its effort to boost drilling operations in the Arctic waters, raising concerns about territorial disputes. Oslo approved stakes in 62 offshore oil and gas exploration licenses to 24 energy companies, including state-controlled Equinor, Reuters reported.
The number of awarded licenses and stakes increased by 50% over those awarded in 2023, though the number of companies involved in the process remained the same.
The increase involved drilling permits in the Arctic Barents Sea and the adjacent Norwegian Sea, the country's energy minister told a conference.
""Last year I asked companies to look more closely at Barents Sea opportunities... this award shows that more companies have responded positively and are taking responsibility,"" Minister of Energy Terje Aasland said.

Finland closed the border late last year after 1,300 migrants without proper documentation or visas had arrived across the frontier since September — an unusually high number, just months after Finland joined the NATO alliance.
Finland accused Russia of deliberating ushering the migrants to its normally heavily controlled border. The Kremlin denied the allegation, and says it regrets the Finnish border closures.
The latest closure will last until Feb. 11, Interior Minister Mari Rantanen said at a news conference in Helsinki, saying that authorities believe that Russia's campaign of manipulating undocumented migrants is continuing.
“There are people in nearby areas waiting for the border to open,"" Rantanen said.
The migrants who arrived in the later months of last year were mainly from the Middle East and Africa - particularly from Syria, Somalia and Yemen - and the vast majority of them have sought asylum in Finland. They are currently being kept at migrant reception centers across the country while waiting for decision from authorities.
Many people in Finland have characterized Moscow's alleged actions as retaliation for the Nordic country joining NATO in April of last year, but Finnish security experts have said Russia's main motive for such migrant maneuvers remains unclear.
Prime Minister Petteri Orpo's government originally chose to close the 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border in November, citing security concerns and Russia's “hybrid warfare.” It later opened two selected checkpoints in eastern and northern Finland on a trial basis, but the migrant influx continued.
All eight Finland-Russia border crossing points for passengers have been closed since Dec. 15. The southeastern rail checkpoint for cargo trains in Vainikkala remains open for now.
Finland, a nation of 5.6 million people, acts as the European Union’s external border in the north and makes up a significant part of NATO’s northeastern flank.

The fighting erupted on 7 October when Hamas carried out a deadly attack in southern Israel. Since then, Israel has relentlessly pounded the Gaza Strip with airstrikes and a ground offensive that have wrought unprecedented destruction, flattening entire neighbourhoods.
The offensive has displaced the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza, shuttered operations in more than half of Gaza's hospitals and caused widespread hunger, UN monitors say.
The Israeli military says it has now scaled back operations in the hard-hit north. In the south, though, where it says Hamas' leaders are hiding, it presses forward at full strength.
Meanwhile, Lebanon's Hezbollah militia and Israel have engaged in cross-border skirmishes nearly every day since the war began.
Here’s a look in numbers at the toll of the Israel-Hamas war, sourced from Palestinian Health Ministry and Israeli officials as well as international observers and aid groups.

1S0JI0R813_Q53JICREBV8RF1F,Rwanda leader ‘offers UK a refund’ over asylum seekers,Charles Hymas,"January 17, 2024 at 9:56 AM·3 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/rwanda-leader-offers-uk-refund-155618556.html,"Rwanda’s president has offered to repay millions of pounds that his country has received if Britain is unable to deport asylum seekers to the country.
Paul Kagame warned there were limits on how long attempts to implement an asylum deal with Britain could “drag on”.
The Rwandan leader was speaking in Davos on Wednesday before Rishi Sunak’s flagship Rwanda Bill was due to have its third reading, after a rebellion by 60 MPs demanding that he should toughen it up.
No asylum seekers have yet been sent to Rwanda, which has so far received £240 million from the UK as part of an economic and development deal between the two countries under which migrants will be deported to claim asylum in the African state.
Asked by the BBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, why his country was taking millions of pounds of UK money without taking any asylum seekers, Mr Kagame replied: “It’s only going to be used if those people will come.”
He added: “If they don’t come, we can return the money.”
Mr Kagame did not clarify how much of the money he would return, or when. Yolande Makolo, a Rwandan government spokesman, played down the scale of any payments, saying the country had “no obligation” to return any of the funds paid but if the UK requested a refund “we will consider this.”
“Under the terms of the agreement, Rwanda has no obligation to return any of the funds paid. However, if no migrants come to Rwanda under the scheme, and the UK Government wishes to request a refund of the portion of the funding allocated to support the migrants, we will consider this request,” she said.
“To talk about figures at this point is premature, as we are still awaiting the conclusion of the UK legislative process and remain committed to making the partnership work.”
Questioned by the BBC about the political and legal obstacles around the deal with his country, Mr Kagame said: “Ask the UK – it is the UK’s problem, not Rwanda’s problem.”
In an interview with The Guardian, Mr Kagame expressed frustration at the drawn-out debate about whether asylum seekers could be processed in Rwanda. “There are limits for how long this can drag on,” he said.
About £240 million had been paid to Rwanda so far as part of the deal, The Telegraph disclosed last year, while a further payment of £50 million is expected in the 2024-25 financial year.
Right-wing Tories have seized on Mr Kagame’s words as evidence that the Rwanda scheme must block international law to satisfy the Rwandan president.
A rebel source said: “As [illegal migration minister] Michael Tomlinson explained this morning, the Government’s plan is going to need hundreds of judges to clear thousands of claims which will take months and months at a bare minimum.
“Rwanda want a plan that works quickly, not one that satisfies the whims of our attorney general. The Government should therefore back our plan. At this rate, it will be Labour having to pay back the money.”
Mr Tomlinson told the BBC on Wednesday that he was confident the Bill would pass, before being considered by the House of Lords.
However, he acknowledged that the number of migrants deported to Rwanda would initially be “small” and that it would take “months” rather than days or weeks before numbers ramped up to “thousands”.

According to officials, Viacheslav Morozov - a Russian national and a professor of international politics at the University of Tarfu - is allegedly involved in intelligence activity meant to undermine Estonia’s national security.
The country’s Internal Security Service (ISS), which is investigating the case, didn’t provide any details on the nature of the intelligence allegedly collected by Morozov “as procedural steps are being taken to verify the accusation.”
Morozov had been associated with the University of Tarfu, Estonia’s largest and oldest, since 2010.
He worked there as a professor of EU-Russia studies between 2016-2023 and as a professor of international political theory until his detention.
Before moving to Estonia, Morozov had worked for Saint Petersburg State University, according to information on his Facebook profile.
The Estonian university confirmed it has terminated his contract on Tuesday.
“The current case is an addition to more than twenty previous ones and illustrates the desire of the Russian intelligence services to infiltrate various areas of Estonian life, including the scientific sector,” Margo Palloson, ISS Director General said in a joint statement with prosecutors.

According to Palloson, Russia's “intelligence interest in Estonia remains high” over 22 months from the beginning of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Later Tuesday, Palloson and State Prosecutor Triinu Olev told Estonian media outlets that Morozov was recruited as a spy by Russian special services several years ago and was on their payroll.
Palloson told Estonian public broadcaster ERR that Morozov held meetings in his home country with his Russian handlers “with some regularity.""
The former professor has remained in pretrial custody since 3 January, to prevent him from evading criminal proceedings and continuing to “commit offences at large.”"
1XCO8UYZPB_4RJ9T1XBBA4EVO8,NATO official warns of 'all-out war' with Russia within next 20 years,"Nate Ostiller, The Kyiv Independent news desk","January 19, 2024 at 6:48 PM·3 min read",20230119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/nato-official-warns-war-russia-104839714.html,"Civilians in NATO countries should be prepared for the prospect of an all-out war with Russia in the next 20 years, said Lieutenant Admiral Rob Bauer, Chair of the NATO Military Committee, in comments to reporters on Jan. 18.
NATO militaries have increased their capacity and preparedness since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While the prospect of the war escalating to an all-out clash between the alliance and Russia has so far been averted, there are concerns that the West has not truly accepted that it may still be a possibility.
Such a conflict would require the large-scale mobilization of civilians and the industrial base across the alliance, Bauer said.
“We have to realize it’s not a given that we are in peace. And that’s why we (NATO) are preparing for a conflict with Russia,"" he added.
U.S. General Christopher Cavoli, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, said on Jan. 18 that NATO will conduct its most extensive military exercise in recent decades, involving about 90,000 troops.
Despite this, there have been indications that the increase in defense production and general military preparedness has not been sufficient to shake off the complacency NATO has exhibited since the end of the Cold War.
As Russia has increasingly put its economy on a wartime footing, Europe has fallen short of even its pledges to deliver weapons to Ukraine, let alone prepare its own armies for war. Europe's supply of military equipment to Ukraine has already strained its capacity and stockpiles, creating concerns that it may take years to refill reserves, barring a full mobilization of industrial output.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz cautioned in January that Germany's military support for Ukraine is insufficient to compensate for the deficit from other EU countries.
Despite sanctions, Russia has also taken advantage of its alliances with Iran and North Korea, which have delivered large quantities of shells, drones, and other military equipment.
North Korea has allegedly provided Russia with more than one million shells, more than the EU has delivered to Ukraine.
“We need to be readier across the whole spectrum,” Bauer said. “You have to have a system in place to find more people if it comes to war, whether it does or not. Then you talk mobilization, reservists, or conscription.""
Some leaders have acknowledged the potential for danger, drawing historical parallels to the leadup to WWII, in which Europe was so hesitant to repeat the horrors of WWI that it appeased Nazi Germany, resulting in an even more destructive war.
U.K. Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Jan. 18 that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has meant that the current reality is ""like being a Foreign Minister or a leader in Europe in the 1930s.""
Recent comments by Swedish officials about the prospect of a future war sparked concern around the country, but Bauer said it was the right move.
It is important to realize that ""not everything is plannable and not everything is going to be hunky dory in the next 20 years,” Bauer said.

The U.S. and Britain on Jan. 11 attacked from air and sea Houthi military facilities in Yemen in response to the Iran-backed group’s attacks on Red Sea ships that have followed Israel’s invasion of Gaza.
Washington confirmed conducting launches with fighter jets and Tomahawk missiles on Jan. 11.
“Today, at my direction, U.S. military forces ... successfully conducted strikes against a number of targets in Yemen used by Houthi rebels to endanger freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most vital waterways,” U.S. President Joe Biden said.
Biden said the attacks were a response to the “more than 50 nations that have been affected in 27 attacks on international commercial shipping” in the Red Sea, which has resulted in crews from more than 20 countries being threatened or taken hostage in acts of piracy.
“More than 2,000 ships have been forced to divert thousands of miles to avoid the Red Sea – which can cause weeks of delays in product shipping times,” according to Biden.
Ten countries were involved in the strikes, including Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, the U.K., and the U.S.
A spokesperson for Yemen’s Houthis commented on the strikes on X, saying that the group would continue its attacks on Israeli ships or other vessels in the Red Sea that are going to Israel.

Ukraine’s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov has proposed on Jan. 14 an international working group on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine.Umerov presented the plan at the fourth meeting of national security advisors regarding the Peace Formula in Davos, Switzerland. He suggested creating a group at the level of Ministers of Defense and National Security Advisors to “jointly work out a mechanism for the withdrawal of (Russian) troops.”
“It's impossible to talk about restoring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine without the complete withdrawal and disarmament of Russian troops and terrorist organizations from the temporarily occupied territories,” Umerov wrote.President Volodymyr Zelensky presented the 10-point Ukrainian Peace Formula in 2022, which includes the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory. Currently, 83 countries support the peace plan.This is the second large-scale event organized in Switzerland to support Ukraine after the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Lugano in July 2022.
The Davos meeting had 39 countries from Europe, 18 from Asia, 12 from Africa, six from South America, three from North America and two from Oceania, Zelensky's Head of Office Andriy Yermak said.According to the Swiss Foreign Ministry statement, the main goal of the meetings is “to finalize the talks at the level of national security advisers on principles for a lasting and just peace in Ukraine.”
China needs to be involved in efforts to end Russia's war in Ukraine, Swiss Federal Councillor Ignazio Cassis told a news conference in Davos on Jan. 14.
China was not attended the meetings of national security advisers on Ukraine’s Peace Formula at Davos.
“China plays a significant role. We must find ways to work with China on this,” Cassis said after a meeting of top diplomats.
“A peace for the Ukrainian people is urgently necessary… We must do everything to end this war.”
The 10 different parts of Ukraine’s peace plan have been discussed with 10 working groups at the national security advisors level. Switzerland, in particular, has been involved in working groups on nuclear safety, food security, and the war's end.

Russia used 37 missiles, including six Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, and three attack drones to target regions across Ukraine in a mass attack on the morning of Jan. 13. One civilian reported injured.
Ukrainian air defenses shot down seven Kh-101 cruise missiles and one Kh-59 guided cruise missile launched by Russia overnight and interrupted the trajectories of over 20 other weapons using electromagnetic countermeasures, the Air Force reported on Jan. 13.
The Air Force believes Russia launched as many as 12 Kh-101 missiles and four Kh-59 missiles.
Russia launched missiles at the city of Shostka in Sumy Oblast in north-eastern Ukraine at around 7:30 a.m., injuring one woman and leaving 12,000 residents without heating for most of the morning, the region's Military Administration said.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, at least 26 buildings were damaged and preliminary information indicates that Russian forces used Kh-22 anti-ship missiles in the strike.
Explosions were heard in Chernihiv Oblast in the north of Ukraine. Governor Vyacheslav Chaus confirmed that air defense had been at work in the region and that Russia's attack had caused damage in an unspecified location.
The missiles were reportedly downed in Poltava, Dnipropetrovsk, Khmelnytskyi, Rivne oblasts.
Explosions were also heard in the city of Kropyvnytskyi, the regional capital of the Kirovohrad Oblast. Governor Andrii Raikovych also reported that there were no casualties in the region.
The attack come as part of another series of large-scale attacks across Ukraine. From December, Russian forces launched hundreds of missiles, loitering munitions across Ukraine, killing dozens and injured hundreds. Critical infrastructure and industrial, civilian, and military facilities have come under attack.
On Jan. 14, a Russian kamikaze drone struck a fire station and injured four firefighters in the village of Stanislav in Kherson Oblast, regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported.
The victims suffered concussions and cranial injuries, but all four declined hospitalization after receiving first aid, according to the report.
The day before, a Russian artillery barrage hit residential neighborhoods and water port infrastructure in Kherson, the regional capital, injuring six people were injured.

Neutra’s parents sat down with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell after standing on the border with Hamas-run Gaza “so close to Omer,” his mother, Orna Neutra, said at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. It was there that they and the families of other hostages held a vigil to mark 100 days passed since Oct. 7, when Hamas attacked Israel and abducted nearly 240 people, including many civilians.
“We are pressing for action from anybody that we see,” his father, Ronen Neutra, told Mitchell. “Whether it’s the State Department or FBI or Israeli authorities.”
“It’s been too long, it’s too dangerous,” agreed Orna.
Many hostages’ families are now pushing for a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, which promptly responded to the attacks with an offensive.
“Whatever they’ve achieved so far, they can continue doing that after they bring (the hostages) out alive,” said Orna.
The Neutras, who are both descended from Holocaust survivors, emigrated to the States from Israel in 2000.
Neutra enlisted in the IDF as part of a gap year before starting college. Though his parents were aware of the risks, Orna said they “could never imagine this situation.”
“He was in his tank with his team and they were ambushed” on the border of Gaza on Oct. 7, said his mother. “They forced them out and they took them.”
Hamas attacked Israeli civilians on Oct. 7 at the Nova music festival and in their homes, leaving an estimated 1,200 dead. While some hostages have been released amid brief ceasefires, more than 130 are still being held captive.
Over 24,000 Palestinians have been killed as part of the responding offensive, according to Gaza’s health ministry.

It declined to share any further details on the arrest. However, relations between Sweden and Iran have been tense since 2019 when Sweden arrested a former Iranian official for his part in the mass execution and torture of political prisoners in the 1980s.
""The embassy in Tehran is in contact with local authorities. The Foreign Ministry is in contact with relatives in Sweden,"" the ministry told Reuters in an email.
Iran, in late December, said it would keep seeking the release of the former Iranian official sentenced to life in prison in Sweden.
Earlier in December, Iran began the trial of a Swedish national, Johan Floderus, a European Union employee who has been imprisoned since April 2022. He is charged with spying for Israel and ""corruption on earth,"" a crime that carries the death penalty.
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson demanded the immediate release of Johan Floderus on December 11 last year.

No injuries were reported, both planes were of Boeing design, and the FAA says it will investigate the incident.
The left wing tip of Flight 11 from All Nippon Airways, a Japanese airline, struck the rear of Delta Air Lines Flight 2122 on Sunday around 6:30 p.m. Central Time, FAA spokesperson Tony Molinaro said. The All Nippon Airways flight was a Boeing 777, and the Delta Air Lines aircraft was a Boeing 717.
American aircraft manufacturer Boeing faces increasing scrutiny following a series of mechanical failures and subsequent grounding of its Boeing 737 Max 9 model after an emergency exit door failed and caused an emergency landing last week. It was not immediately clear what caused the incident on Sunday and whether it was related to a manufacturing flaw.
Boeing representatives did not provide a comment on Monday regarding the collision at O'Hare and instead directed The Associated Press to speak with the airlines involved and the FAA.
Delta spokesperson Emma Johnson said Monday afternoon by phone that an All Nippon Airways aircraft clipped a Delta plane while it was parking at a gate after arriving at O'Hare from Detroit.
“Customers deplaned normally at the gate and the aircraft is being evaluated by Delta’s maintenance technicians,” the company said in an emailed statement.
Raymond Bongalon, a customer service representative with All Nippon Airways, said Monday afternoon that the airline could not yet provide any information on what happened.
The airline's flight status search said Flight 11 was bound for Tokyo but canceled because of “aircraft inspection.”
The Chicago Department of Aviation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Nauru announced its decision to switch alliances after Taiwan overwhelmingly elected Lai Ching-te of the incumbent Democratic Progressive party president on Saturday.
Taiwan's foreign ministry confirmed Nauru's decision, and said the announcement was timed to undermine its democratic contest.
""With deep regret we announce the termination of diplomatic relations with Nauru,"" Taiwan's foreign ministry said in a statement published to X on Monday afternoon.
""This timing is not only China's retaliation against our democratic elections but also a direct challenge to the international order. Taiwan stands unbowed & will continue as a force for good.""
With deep regret we announce the termination of diplomatic relations with Nauru. This timing is not only China's retaliation against our democratic elections but also a direct challenge to the international order. Taiwan stands unbowed & will continue as a force for good.— 外交部 Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ROC (Taiwan) (@MOFA_Taiwan) January 15, 2024
Nauru, in a statement, said that it was in its ""best interests"" to recognize ""the One China principle.""
""This means that the Republic of Nauru will no longer recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China's territory, and will sever 'diplomatic relations' with Taiwan as of this day and no longer develop any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan,"" it said in a statement.
""This change is in no way intended to affect our existing warm relationships with other countries.""
With Nauru's decision, Taiwan has only 12 formal diplomatic relations remaining, including with the Holy See.
A Beijing foreign ministry spokesperson said Monday that China ""appreciates and welcomes"" the decision of Nauru to recognize the One China policy.
""There is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China,"" the spokesperson said.
""The Nauru government's decision of re-establishing diplomatic ties with China once again shows that the one China principle is where global opinion trends and where the arc of history bends.""
Though Taiwan has never been a part of mainland China, which was founded in 1949, Beijing claims sovereignty over the self-governing island, which it views as a wayward province that it has vowed to take back by force if necessary.
Eleven countries have severed diplomatic relations with Taiwan since 2016, as China forces those it has diplomatic relationships with to recognize the One China principle. Honduras was the most recent country to cut ties with the self-governing island, which it did in March.
Though the United States recognized the One China policy in 1979, it still maintains a partnership with Taiwan, which it has sought to deepen amid growing tensions with Beijing.
Late Monday, the United States issued a statement expressing disappointment over Nauru's decision.
""Taiwan is a reliable, likeminded, and democratic partner. The PRC often makes promises in exchange for diplomatic relations that ultimately remain unfulfilled,"" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement urging all countries to foster relations with Taiwan.
""The United States will continue to deepen and expand our engagement with Taiwan on our many shared interests and values, support Taiwan's meaningful participation in the international community and deepen our economic ties, consistent with our longstanding One China policy,"" he said."

Microsoft identified the cyber attacker as a group referred to as ""Midnight Blizzard,"" which it said has been connected to Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service by US and British governments.
""This threat actor is known to primarily target governments, diplomatic entities, non-government organizations, and IT service providers primarily in the US and Europe,"" Microsoft said in a blog post in August last year detailing an earlier cyberattack.
""Their focus is to collect intelligence through longstanding and dedicated espionage of foreign interests.""
Activity by Midnight Blizzard, also known as ""Nobelium"", has been traced to early 2018, according to Microsoft.
Microsoft's security team detected the latest attack on January 12, triggering defenses that blocked further access by the hackers, the company said.
The attack began in November of last year, with the hackers trying a password on an array of accounts and getting it right on an old test account, according to Microsoft.
The hackers then used that ""foothold"" to access some Microsoft corporate email accounts including those of senior leaders and security team members, taking emails and attached documents.
""The investigation indicates they were initially targeting email accounts for information related to Midnight Blizzard itself,"" Microsoft said.
There was no evidence the hackers accessed customer accounts, production systems, source code, or artificial intelligence software at Microsoft, according to the company.
""Given the reality of threat actors that are resourced and funded by nation states, we are shifting the balance we need to strike between security and business risk,"" Microsoft said.
""We will act immediately to apply our current security standards to Microsoft-owned legacy systems and internal business processes, even when these changes might cause disruption to existing business processes.""

2GJ8FOL7A0_YEZYCQRGS3HKQ10,Hungary signals to EU that it may lift veto on funding for Ukraine − Politico,Ukrainska Pravda,"January 17, 2024 at 1:39 AM·2 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/hungary-signals-eu-may-lift-073919352.html,"Hungary has signalled to the European Union that it is ready to withdraw its opposition to new long-term funding for Ukraine.
Source: European Pravda, citing Politico
Details: Several European diplomats and officials, speaking to the publication, have reported that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is approaching a compromise on the use of funds from the European Union budget to support Ukraine, even if it does not meet the demands he put forward after the EU summit in December 2023.
In December, Orbán blocked a four-year funding package for Ukraine worth €50 billion. The publication notes that since then, both sides have been engaged in delicate negotiations to find a solution for approving assistance at the EU leaders' summit on 1 February.
Diplomats and officials say that, despite the lack of consensus within the EU regarding Hungary's demands, the European Union is confident that an agreement can be reached in the coming weeks.
While there is some willingness in Brussels to offer certain concessions to Orbán to reach a deal, most national capitals have rejected Hungary's attempt to split the financing for Ukraine into annual tranches, requiring unanimous approval each year.
Because, in practice, this would give Orbán the right to block EU funding for Ukraine annually or demand concessions from Brussels in exchange for lifting the veto. An EU diplomat called it ""very unlikely"" that member states would decide to give Hungary ""the chance of regular blackmailing"".
Another proposal from Hungary involves a mid-term review of financing in 2025. However, even this option is deemed unacceptable by strong supporters of Kyiv, as it would once again ""create chaos"" in 12 months. Sources noted that this contradicts the logic of the EU's seven-year budget, which aims to ensure stability and predictability.
Sources say a potential compromise could involve the European Commission reimbursing Hungary for interest payments on loans obtained post-pandemic. The Commission is also considering introducing an ""emergency brake"", allowing any country opposing financing for Ukraine to suspend payments and defer discussions to the EU leaders' summit. However, this option would not allow any EU member state to veto payments.
The consensus is that any final compromise must include certain concessions to Hungary – sufficient for Orbán to claim victory at home.
Two diplomats noted that Budapest's repeated veto on funding for Ukraine would prompt EU capitals to call for the application of the so-called Article 7 procedure, which could suspend Hungary's voting rights in EU decision-making.
Background: On 16 January, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán once again expressed his opposition to the European Union’s plan to commit €50 billion to four years of macro financial aid for Ukraine, saying that help for Ukraine should not ""harm the EU's budget"".

2JQ9CE2SM1_S7FUQQZQLFPR3WC,South Korea says North Korea may sell new type of ballistic missiles to Russia,Ukrainska Pravda,"January 11, 2024 at 3:03 PM·4 min read",20240111,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/south-korea-says-north-korea-070347244.html,"Shin Won-sik, Minister of Defence of South Korea, has said that North Korea may sell Russia new types of tactical missiles in addition to the alleged supply of short-range ballistic missiles for Moscow's use in the war with Ukraine.
Source: Shin Won-sik in an interview with Yonhap
Details: Shin Won-sik also said that North Korea could test a solid-fueled intermediate-range ballistic missile as early as this month and could launch a long-range missile to escalate already high tensions ahead of key elections in South Korea and the United States.
Shin Won-sik stated that the weapons system, revealed by North Korean state-owned media outlets during leader Kim Jong Un's visit to a munitions factory earlier this week, appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons.
Quote: ""North Korea first test-fired a close-range ballistic missile in April 2022. It is a new type of weapon with an estimated range of 100-180 kilometres.""
Details: Defence Ministry of South Korea described North Korean missiles mounted on mobile launchers as short-range ballistic missiles, which are about 5 metres long and have a range of less than 300 kilometres.
Shin suggested that Kim's recent visit to munitions factories could be linked to North Korea's possible arms sales to Russia as the two countries strengthen their military cooperation.
Quote: ""North Korea said it will deploy (CRBMs) with front-line troops. Given the recent arms trade, (I think) North Korea could sell them to Russia.""
More details: Shin hinted at North Korea's alleged sale of KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles to Russia.
Recently, the White House declassified intelligence data showing that North Korea has provided Russia with ballistic missile launchers and several ballistic missiles with a range of 900 kilometres.
Shin estimated that as of the end of December, North Korea had provided Russia with about 5,000 weapons containers that could hold about 2.3 million 152mm shells or about 400,000 122mm artillery shells.
The South Korean minister expressed concern over Russia's alleged provision of technological assistance to North Korea's weapons programme in exchange for arms trade, including Pyongyang's spy satellite.
""North Korea's spy satellite launched in November is considered rudimentary. If Russia continues to offer technological assistance, the satellite's capability is expected to improve,"" Shin said.
The minister said that North Korea is likely to stage various forms of provocations ahead of South Korea's parliamentary elections in April and the US presidential election in November to protect its strategic interests.
Shin said Pyongyang was preparing to test launch a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile after two tests of solid-fuel engines in November, weighing the possibility of launching it as soon as this month.
Seoul's officials believe Pyongyang's developing solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile, which is harder to detect because of its shorter preparation time, could potentially target US military bases in Japan and Guam.
Shin also suggested that North Korea could launch normal-angle intercontinental ballistic missiles to test atmospheric entry technology and the ability to deliver precision strikes.
Last year, Pyongyang launched five intercontinental ballistic missiles, including three Hwasong-18 solid-fuel missiles, which were launched at high angles and flew about 1,000 km.
Experts believe that if launched on a normal trajectory, these intercontinental ballistic missiles can reach a distance of 12,000-15,000 km, demonstrating the ability to hit the US mainland.
""As all of the ICBMs were launched at lofted angles, the reliability of their reentry technology and precision strike capabilities have not yet been verified. This year, there is a possibility of (ICBM) launches with the real range and at normal angles,"" he said.
Shin said that buffer zones created under the 2018 inter-Korean military accord ""no longer exist"" following North Korea's latest artillery fire near the tense western maritime border.
Since last month, North Korea has been rebuilding some of its destroyed guard posts in the demilitarised zone with concrete structures.
Shin said the North could also conduct a seventh nuclear test to create a ""smaller, lighter"" nuclear weapon, adding that its Punggye-ri test site was ready to conduct a nuclear test ""at any time"".
The minister emphasised that North Korea's status as a nuclear power is unacceptable and should not be recognised, and its further pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles will only lead to the strengthening of international sanctions.
Quote: ""Nuclear development is not 'the sword of omnipotence' but 'a poisoned chalice' to Kim Jong-un and he should be aware of it,"" he said.
Background: On 8-9 January, the leader of North Korea (DPRK) Kim Jong Un inspected the work of the country's main military factories and made several threatening statements to South Korea, in particular, assured that in the event of a confrontation, he would turn it into ashes.

Iran has a special responsibility when it comes to its ""proxies,"" NATO spokesman Dylan White said.
""The Houthi attacks must come to an end,"" he said.
Since the outbreak of the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas in October 2023, the Iran-backed Houthis have repeatedly attacked ships with an alleged Israeli connection in the Red Sea.
Major shipping companies are increasingly avoiding the route forcing them to divert along a much longer and costly route around South Africa.
In response, the United States, Britain and other Western allies launched airstrikes on several Houthi positions in Yemen in the early hours of Friday.
The NATO spokesman called these strikes defensive and aimed at preserving freedom of navigation on one of the world's most important waterways."

Schwarzenegger, 76, was detained for three hours at the airport in Germany, a source familiar with the incident told CBS News. The Hollywood star and former California governor was planning on auctioning the watch at his charity auction in Kitzbuhel, Austria on Thursday.
According to a news release, Schwarzenegger is scheduled to appear at an event to raise funds for The Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative, which supports climate projects around the globe.
The actor was never asked to fill out a declaration form, the source said, and tried to pay the taxes for the watch at the airport but the credit card machine wasn't working, the source said. Schwarzenegger was then brought to an ATM to withdraw money but the limit was too low, and then the bank was closed, so customs officers finally brought in a credit card machine that worked, the source said.
Once the watch is auctioned, the source said, the Schwarzenegger Climate Initiative will properly report it, as all of Arnold's non-profits do. Schwarzenegger was expected to be allowed to continue his journey but ""the watch will probably have to stay,"" customs spokesman Thomas Meister told Agence France-Presse.
The watch was custom-made for Schwarzenegger by luxury Swiss watchmaker Audemars Piguet, Bild reported.
A criminal procedure investigation for possible tax evasion is currently ongoing, the customs spokesperson told CBS News.

Fico said he was set to travel to Ukraine on Wednesday to meet his counterpart Denys Shmyhal for talks in the border city of Uzhhorod.
While one reason for the visit was to present a further aid package for Ukraine, he would also make clear the Slovakian positions diverging from Ukraine's wishes, the premier said.
""I will tell him that we will block and veto Ukrainian accession to NATO, because it would be nothing but the basis for a third world war,"" Fico said.
Slovakia, which has been a member of NATO since 2004, was long one of Ukraine's staunchest supporters in its defensive campaign against the full-scale Russian invasion launched in February 2022.
However, when Fico's left-wing nationalist government took over last October, it decided to no longer supply Kiev with weapons, though Bratislava continues to send mine-clearing systems and diesel generators in the event of Russian attacks on power plants, for example.
Fico said on Saturday that Slovakia was in favour of Ukraine joining the European Union, as long as the country fulfils the same conditions as other candidates.
The premier, criticized by his opponents as ""pro-Russian,"" once again emphasized that Slovakia would no longer supply weapons from its army stocks to the neighbouring country, but would continue to allow arms sales by Slovakian defence companies.
There will be no joint press conference following the meeting with Shmyhal because the Ukrainian sides had rejected this, Fico said."
2Z2HX0LEKP_QKTCISGAVOFYO6E,"After Canton plant closure, NC leaders in talks with Pactiv Evergreen over $12M incentives","Joel Burgess, Asheville Citizen Times","Updated January 16, 2024 at 1:38 PM·3 min read",20240116,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/canton-plant-closure-nc-leaders-101700526.html,"Top state officials and an Illinois company that shut down the Canton paper plant half a year ago ― throwing more than 1,000 out of work ― last spoke just before Christmas in ongoing talks about whether the state will take back $12 million in economic incentives the mill received.
That is according to a spokesperson for Gov. Roy Cooper who updated the Citizen Times Jan. 12 on what the offices of Cooper and Attorney General Josh Stein have characterized as ongoing discussions with the company Pactiv Evergreen, a maker of food packaging such as milk cartons.
""Our office continues to engage with the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, local officials and Pactiv to reach a resolution that best supports the needs of the community, including the repayment of state incentive funds,"" said Cooper spokesperson Jordan Monaghan.
A month before the 115-year-old iconic paper mill shut down Cooper and Stein said if the plant closed they would look to enact ""clawback"" provisions of the $12 million Job Maintenance and Capital Development grant that the state gave Pactiv.
Six months after the May 24 closure, the funds are not back in state hands.
A spokesperson for Stein confirmed AG's office confirmed Stein and staff have been in ""continued conversations"" with Pactiv and other parties for the past eight months.
""Our position continues to be that Pactiv’s decision to close the paper mill constituted a breach of the JMAC agreement that requires repayment of the full $12 million it received in incentives,"" spokesperson Nazneen Ahmed said, adding that Stein will ""continue to work on behalf of the residents of Canton and North Carolina’s taxpayers.""
Stein is running to replace fellow Democrat Cooper when the governor retires at the end of this year.
The Citizen Times reached out to Pactiv and the commerce department.
Once owned by Champion, the United Steelworkers union bought the mill in 1999 and formed Blue Ridge Paper. Struggling with consistent financial losses, the mill workers sold the factory in 2010 to Evergreen Packaging, a New Zealand company owned by billionaire Graeme Hart.
By 2015 the company was facing a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requirement to replace old coal-fired boilers. New natural-gas powered boilers would cost $50 million including new supply lines, Evergreen said.
In a last-minute vote the General Assembly approved the incentives, giving the company $12 million over six years. The company was required to employ at least 800 full-time employees for at least 10 years.
At the time, the mill employed about 1,000 people with an average annual wage, including benefits, of $78,300.
The state has succeeded before in recapturing incentives, said UNC School of Government public law professor Tyler Mulligan.
""A well-known example is the Dell incentive package. When Dell closed its manufacturing facility in the Triad, it agreed to pay back the State and local incentives it had received,"" he said.
But whether that will work is unclear, according to Mulligan. Typically, paybacks are only required for JMAC grants when a company fails to meet a minimum capital investment, he said. In its message to the commerce department, the Citizen Times requested a copy of the contract.
Evergreen merged with Pactiv in 2020.
Pactiv drew the ire of officials when last year before announcing the closure and layoffs, corporate officers declared they would pay a bonus to shareholders and sold more than $600,000 in stock. Then the price nosedived.
Republican Congressman Chuck Edwards, whose 11th District covers most of Western North Carolina, including Canton, called for a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. It's not clear if the SEC has taken any action. Investigations by the regulatory body are done privately and only become known to the public with the filing of an enforcement action.

2Z3FRBBVRT_H33K25RAZG9TFK3,Europe is probably buying record amounts of Russian oil from Indian refiners,Jennifer Sor,"January 17, 2024 at 7:18 AM·2 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/europe-probably-buying-record-amounts-231820242.html,"Russian crude is likely being shipped to Europe in record amounts, according to Kpler data.
India, one of Russia's largest crude customers, shipped tons of refined oil to the EU.
Refined oil purchases from India notched their highest level in the last seven years of recorded data.
Record amounts of Russian crude are probably being sold to Europe by Indian refiners, a new analysis says.
India has become one of Russia's largest oil customers in recent years, snapping up an average 1.75 million barrels of crude a day in 2023, according to Kpler data analyzed by The Independent. That's a 140% increase from what India purchased from Russian sources in 2022, when it was already gorging on discounted Russian crude in the months after the invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, the European Union has grown into one of India's largest refined oil customers. The bloc purchased around 231,800 barrels a day of refined crude products from India last year, a 115% increase from the prior year, Kpler data shows.
That's the largest amount of refined oil Europe has purchased from India over the last seven years Kpler has recorded the data. It's likely the highest amount of refined oil Europe has ever purchased from the country, much of which is likely  Russian in origin, the analysis said.
Western nations banned Russian oil and slapped Russian oil traders with a $60 price cap last year in an attempt to crimp Moscow's war revenue. But Russia has likely found ways to avoid those rules, some industry experts say, such as by reportedly putting together a secretive fleet of oil ships, raising shipping costs on its crude, and swapping oil with middle-men like India.
India has held a strategically neutral stance on Russia's war with Ukraine, and has continued to purchase Russian oil while selling its refined oil products to the West. High amounts of Indian fuel was being shipped to New York last year, according to Kpler data analyzed by Bloomberg, which was likely also Russian in origin.
Still, India's purchases of Russian oil have pulled back in recent months, partly due to pressure to maintain good ties with the US, as well as reported payment issues with Russian oil suppliers. Russian oil shipments to India plummeted to an 11-month low in December, according to ship-tracking data analyzed by Reuters.

30KLNEAT2Q_TFP7EOIG0ERVRUQ,"Ladapo’s escalating vaccine war is a DeSantis campaign strategy, critics argue","Steven Lemongello, Caroline Catherman, Orlando Sentinel","January 13, 2024 at 9:00 PM·7 min read",20240113,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ladapo-escalating-vaccine-war-desantis-130000571.html,"Florida Surgeon General Joe Ladapo’s campaign against COVID-19 vaccines has intensified in the past few weeks before Gov. Ron DeSantis’ crucial tests in the Iowa presidential caucuses and New Hampshire primary. And experts say that’s not a coincidence.
“It’s one thing for a large state’s leading health officer to be an advocate for shared values,” said Kenneth Goodman, the director of the University of Miami Institute for Bioethics and Health Policy. “It’s another to weaponize medical misinformation to trick citizens into voting for his boss.”
Ladapo called for a complete halt in the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines earlier this month. A few days later, he called the mRNA vaccines “the antichrist” on Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast.
Ladapo’s growing war against the vaccines comes in the wake of a surprise appearance with DeSantis on the presidential campaign trail in November. The New Hampshire event, dubbed a “Medical Freedom Town Hall,” was a rare move even as the lines between official and political events have been increasingly blurred by the DeSantis administration.
“It is a choice to be as public as Ladapo has been,” said Gregory Koger, a professor of political science at the University of Miami. “… It seems like an effort to kindle interest among a narrow fringe of anti-vaxxers.”
Ladapo claimed that DNA fragments used in the vaccine’s development could integrate into human DNA, resulting in various problems, including cancer. Federal leaders and others in the scientific community fired back, saying the possibility of that happening was theoretical and implausible.
Florida surgeon general calls to pause COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, citing discredited theory
Dr. Kenneth Alexander, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Nemours Children’s Health in Orlando, dismissed the allegation as recycled rhetoric from anti-vaccine circles. “These are the claims you’ve heard from anti-vax people for decades,” he said.
He emphasized that the COVID-19 vaccines are “probably the most studied vaccines in history,” with over a billion doses administered.
“I would argue that the U.S. has the best post-marketing surveillance of vaccines in the world. We’re not seeing any of this stuff,” he said.
DeSantis, who appointed Ladapo in late 2021, shifted from a governor who traveled the length of the state to promote the COVID-19 vaccines earlier that year to one who later called for a grand jury to investigate “wrongdoing” by their creators.
His eventual turn against what he calls “the jab” came after he gained national attention for his stance against most COVID restrictions, despite his shutdown of the state in May 2020 that closed bars and limited capacity at restaurants through the summer.
But the same “Free State of Florida” pandemic-era rhetoric that propelled him to prominence has since faded as an issue in the Republican presidential primary.
DeSantis, Trump seek to rewrite history on COVID response
DeSantis trails former President Donald Trump by huge margins in most state polls and is battling former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for second place in Iowa and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for third in New Hampshire.
“There probably is a narrow market for that,” Koger said of anti-vaccine sentiment. “He’s campaigning for small slices of the Republican electorate in both states, and in Iowa he needs to appeal to people who want to get up out of their homes on a cold January night and go to a high school gym for a couple hours.
“And anti-vax people might fit that description. … He can use every additional voter he can get.”
Dave Peterson, a political scientist at Iowa State University, said Iowa’s Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, a key DeSantis endorser, “was very, very similar to DeSantis on COVID, and part of her popularity in the party was her COVID policy. So maybe he is trying to remind them of that.”
But, he added, “at some point, a lot of folks have moved on from that. If that is a campaign strategy, it’s a surprise to me at least. I don’t think it would be a very effective one.”
DeSantis campaign spokesman Bryan Griffin did not respond to a request for comment on whether Ladapo was doing the campaign’s bidding.
In New Hampshire, the “Live Free or Die” state, the Republican Party has a reputation for being individualistic and libertarian-leaning. But even there, said Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, COVID is not a major issue.
“There is some of that kind of anti-vaccine sentiment up here,” Scala said. “But what I’ve been more struck by is how COVID has really declined in relevance for Republican voters in this cycle. … It’s certainly not any sort of magic rocket fuel. It just doesn’t matter.”
Ladapo’s campaign appearance in New Hampshire in November was part of the campaign’s repeated attempts to attack Trump, whose administration launched the vaccine initiative called Operation Warp Speed.
While Ladapo told the crowd he had “nothing against Mr. Trump,” according to CNN, DeSantis used the event to slam Trump’s pandemic record and vowed to radically reform the nation’s health agencies.
One group backing DeSantis even used artificial intelligence to create a fake image of Trump hugging his White House health adviser Anthony Fauci, a hated figure on the right.
“I think DeSantis was hoping he would be able to kind of connect Trump to Fauci and that would pay dividends, but I just don’t see it,” Scala said. “Part of that is, no one’s figured out how to make something stick to Trump.”
In New Hampshire, Ladapo claimed to be surprised to find himself on the campaign trail.
“On the spectrum of ‘where do you want to spend your time and your energy and your life,’ politics was about as far away as you can imagine for me,” he said, according to CNN.
But Ladapo has been at the center of a political firestorm over mRNA vaccines for years. His statements this month were just the latest in a series of recommendations criticized by some experts as contributing to vaccine hesitancy without adequate evidence.
Previously, Ladapo advised against COVID-19 vaccines for healthy kids, then men ages 18-39, and later recommended against them for those under 65, culminating in this month’s call to end their use entirely. All these recommendations contradicted guidelines from the CDC and FDA, prompting leaders of those agencies to publicly rebuke him.
While Ladapo has conducted analyses of vaccine safety data through the Florida Department of Health, which he says support his positions, others in the medical community have criticized these studies.
“I think they’re poorly done. They’ve been unpublished. And they’ve been misuses of databases,” Alexander said. “We’re doing bad research, and publishing bad guidance that contradicts what public health experts around the world are saying.”
In a prior interview with the Sentinel, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf questioned the quality of an October 2022 report from the Florida Department of Health on the risk of cardiac-related death post-vaccine, stating it “lacked the quality of analysis needed to draw a conclusion.”
Public records from FDOH obtained by the Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun Sentinel showed that Ladapo removed analyses from the paper, pre-publication, that would have weakened the association between vaccination and cardiac-related death.
Ladapo said that was a normal part of the revision process, but others in the health research field previously told the Orlando Sentinel and Sun Sentinel his revisions took out necessary context and constituted scientific fraud.
Joseph Ladapo says anti-vaccine crusade was God’s plan. It cost him his peers’ trust
Several instances where Ladapo cited peer-reviewed, published studies by other researchers to support his recommendations against the COVID vaccine were also met with rebuttals.
Researchers accused him of misrepresenting their conclusions, with one scientist accusing him of “cherry-picking” sentences from her paper to support his argument in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times.
In his appearance on Bannon’s show, he called the mRNA vaccines “the antichrist of all products. … It’s just complete disrespect to the human genome and the importance of protecting it and preserving it. And that is our connection to God.”
In the end, if Ladapo’s latest attacks on COVID vaccines were partly a continuation of his insertion into the DeSantis campaign, it would probably be for naught, Scala said.
“DeSantis’ campaign in New Hampshire is one long painful example of inability to move the needle,” Scala said. “This is just one more example.”"

Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia have been among Kyiv's staunchest supporters against Russian aggression, committing the highest gross domestic product (GDP) shares of all the allies. Estonian President Alar Karis pledged earlier in January to allocate 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) for Kyiv through 2027.
Ratnik said that the bulk of the additional aid announced on Jan. 19 would be used for development through the Estonian Center for International Development (ESTDEV), while one million euros ($1.09 million) would be set aside for humanitarian aid.
An additional 200,000 euros ($218,000) will be earmarked for Estonian businesses working in Ukraine.
Citing information from the World Bank, ESTDEV CEO Klen Jaarats said that more than 400 billion euros ($435 billion) would likely be required for Ukraine's reconstruction, meaning that Estonia's donation ""is a valuable, but very small, contribution.""
Beyond supporting Ukraine, Estonia has taken active steps to contribute to Russia's isolation and curbing Russian malign influence in the country, which has a significant minority of ethnic Russians.
Estonian authorities announced on Jan. 18 that they had not renewed the residence permit of Metropolitan Eugene, the head of the Moscow Patriarchate's branch in Estonia. Despite warnings from authorities, Metropolitan Eugene (also known as Valery Reshetnikov) continued to voice support for Russia's war against Ukraine.
""Reshetnikov's actions pose a threat to security,"" authorities said. The non-renewal of his residence permit means that Metropolitan Eugene must leave the country by Feb. 6.
Ukraine has long accused the Moscow Patriarchate's representatives in Ukraine of serving as the Kremlin's propaganda arm in the war.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) placed Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, on a wanted list in December 2023. Patriarch Kirill is a staunch supporter of Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Russia's war against Ukraine.
According to the Soviet archives, the bishop was a KGB agent and spied on Switzerland in the 1970s, using his role as an official representative at the World Council of Churches.
Estonia also announced on Jan. 18 that it was ending its legal assistance agreement with Russia, lowering cooperation on judicial matters to the level of all other third-party countries.
“One of the preconditions for the agreement is trust in the legal system of the other country and we have no trust in Russia,"" said Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna.
Previously, Estonia and Russia had an agreement stemming from the 1990s on mutual assistance with criminal and common law cases.

Source: UK Ministry of Defence's review on 17 January
Details: UK intelligence noted that Russian A-50 long-range detection and control aircraft ""almost certainly"" exploded and crashed in the western waters of the Sea of Azov on 14 January, while a damaged Il-22M reportedly managed to land at a Russian airport.
Quote: ""The possible successful targeting of an A-50 MAINSTAY by Ukraine is significant. It is likely that Russia will now be forced to reconsider limiting the operational areas of its aircraft. The A-50 is critical to the Russian air surveillance picture over the battlespace.""
More details:
UK intelligence stated that Russia has only eight operational A-50s, and this is likely to cover its operational needs for the near future. However, in the long term, the loss of this aircraft could have an impact, as fewer of these aircraft means more work for the remaining ones and their crews.
Background:
Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, announced that the downing of the two aircraft was the result of an operation by the Ukrainian Air Force.
Colonel Yurii Ihnat, spokesman for Ukraine's Air Force, in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda has explained that the loss of one A-50 long-range radar detection aircraft cannot fundamentally impact the balance of forces using aviation on the front. However, it is undoubtedly a significant loss and will likely compel Russia to exercise more caution in the skies.
In a previous review, UK intelligence said that Russia's successes in Avdiivka were limited and came at a high price.

According to Ukraine's air force, Russia launched 37 missiles and three drones. Eight missiles were downed, it said in a statement on social media.
The air force's spokesperson said earlier this week that Ukraine was now suffering from a deficit of air defence missiles. It was not immediately clear whether this or any other factor was the reason for the low hit rate.
Most of the types of missile used overnight were extremely fast-moving ballistic types, the air force said. These are far harder to shoot down.
""It should be noted that more than 20 of all the listed (weapons) which were not included in the number of the downed, did not reach their targets as a result of active countermeasures by electronic warfare,"" the statement said.
There were no details on the targets of the strike.
Air defences shot down Russian missiles in at least five regions across Ukraine, according to local officials from those provinces.
The large south-eastern city of Dnipro was struck, the local governor said, also without providing detail as to what was hit.
Police in the northern region of Chernihiv posted a picture of a large crater made by a downed missile.
""As a result of being hit by the debris of an enemy missile, several private homes and non-residential buildings were damaged, one building was practically destroyed,"" the police wrote. No people were hurt but a dog was killed, police said.

“Anyone thinks this is only about us, this is only about Ukraine, they are fundamentally mistaken,” Zelensky said in a speech, according to The Associated Press. “Possible directions and even timeline of a new Russian aggression beyond Ukraine become more and more obvious.”
The Ukrainian president said his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, “embodies war” and won’t change, per the AP.
“After Feb. 24, nothing harmed our coalition more than this concept. Every ‘Don’t escalate’ to us, sounded like ‘You will prevail’ to Putin,” Zelensky said.
Zelensky’s visit to Davos was the first he had made since the war in Ukraine began in 2022. He had previously spoken via video.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Zelensky on Tuesday, according to a press release from the State Department.
“They discussed the importance of continued global assistance to support Ukraine as it fights for its freedom and sovereignty,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said. “They also spoke about efforts to support Ukraine’s economic resilience and recovery, including through private sector investment.”
“The three additionally discussed ongoing anti-corruption reform efforts to bolster Ukraine’s economic recovery and continue its trajectory towards Euro-Atlantic integration,” Miller continued.
Miller also said Sullivan and Blinken “strongly reiterated the United States’ enduring support for Ukraine and its territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s illegal war of aggression.”
Last week, House Democrats pushed back against House Speaker Mike Johnson’s (R-La.) requests for heightened new border security measures in exchange for aid to Ukraine. The Speaker has said his caucus would be against new aid to the war-torn Eastern European country unless it came along with provisions from a previously passed GOP border bill.

3A9FT2WFWE_ZF2V84NHU6FFCEB,Pakistan and Iran agree to 'de-escalate' after trading air strikes,AFP,"January 20, 2024 at 12:56 AM·3 min read",20240119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/pakistan-holds-emergency-security-meeting-080803376.html,"Pakistan and Iran ""agreed to de-escalate"" tensions Friday, Islamabad said, after trading deadly airstrikes on militant targets in each other's territory this week.
The rare military actions in the porous border region of Baluchistan -- split between the two nations -- had stoked regional tensions already enflamed by the Israel-Hamas war.
Iran carried out a missile and drone attack on what it called ""terrorist"" targets in Pakistan on Tuesday night, with Pakistan in turn striking militant targets inside Iran on Thursday.
Pakistan recalled its ambassador from Tehran and said Iran's envoy -- on a visit home -- was blocked from returning to Islamabad.
The United Nations and the United States appealed for restraint, while China offered to mediate.
But after speaking by phone, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani and his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian agreed ""close coordination on counter terrorism and other aspects of mutual concern should be strengthened"".
""They also agreed to de-escalate the situation,"" according to a summary of the conversation released by Islamabad's foreign ministry.
After the call, Amir-Abdollahian said in a statement ""the cooperation of the two countries to neutralise and destroy terrorist camps in Pakistan is essential"".
The muted rhetoric matched analysts' predictions that both sides would seek to defuse the confrontation.
Tehran and Islamabad have both insisted they hit their own domestic militants sheltering on foreign territory.
""The upshot of the new situation is that the two countries are seemingly and symbolically even,"" said Antoine Levesques, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
- Border closure fears -
Meanwhile on Friday, Pakistan Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar held an emergency security meeting with military and intelligence chiefs.
""The forum reiterated the unflinching resolve that sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan are absolutely inviolable,"" said a summary released by Kakar's office.
""Any attempt by anyone to breach it on any pretext will be responded with [the] full might of the state.""
But the summit also said Pakistan and Iran should ""address each other's security concerns in the larger interest of regional peace and stability"".
Caretaker leader Kakar cut short his visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland following the strikes, which came with national elections due in three weeks.
A collective death toll of 11 -- mostly women and children -- was reported from both sides of the border that bisects an arid region where militant movements have simmered for decades.
In the remote villages near the strike site in Panjgur district, where mobile signal is rarely available, farmers pieced together the events from reports passed on from visiting security officials who set up checkpoints in the area.
""Helicopters were flying overhead and going in the direction of where the Iranian strike hit, but we didn't know what had happened,"" Maulana Mohammad Sadiq, 42, the prayer leader of a small seminary around five kilometres (three miles) from where a missile hit, told AFP on Thursday.
Villagers feared that deteriorating relations between the two sides could lead to border closures and cut off residents from Iranian trade, which the area relies on for employment and food imports.
""If Iranians close the border, the people will starve and it will cause more militancy because youth will join the separatist organisations,"" said 55-year-old Haji Mohammad Islam.
Baluch separatists have been waging a low-level insurgency against Pakistani authorities from the largely ungoverned, impoverished region fighting for a better share of mineral resources.
Rights groups say the military's crackdown on the insurgency has included widespread enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.
Militancy has also risen sharply along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan further north, after the Taliban's return to power there in 2021.

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, made the comments in response to a visit by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to Kyiv to announce an increase in military funding to help Ukraine purchase new military drones.
""I hope that our eternal enemies - the arrogant British - understand that deploying an official military contingent to Ukraine would be a declaration of war against our country,"" Medvedev wrote on the Telegram messaging app.
Medvedev, whose frequent and harsh public statements diplomats say give an indication of hawkish thinking at the top of the Kremlin, also asked how the Western public would feel if Sunak's delegation came under fire from cluster munitions in the centre of Kyiv, something he said had recently happened to Russian civilians in the city of Belgorod.
Belgorod, in southern Russia, is located close to the Ukrainian border and has been targeted by Ukrainian rockets and drones in recent months.
In the incident referred to by Medvedev on Dec. 30, Russia said at least 20 people had been killed, including two children, and 111 injured in what it called an ""indiscriminate"" Ukrainian strike using cluster bombs.
Ukrainian news outlet RBC-Ukraine quoted unnamed sources as saying Ukrainian forces had directed fire at military targets in Belgorod in response to the massive Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities the previous day.
Medvedev cast himself as a liberal moderniser when he was president from 2008-2012, but now presents himself as one of the fiercest anti-Western Kremlin hawks.

Trevon Morgan was walking to a store on the morning of Aug. 24, 2023 near where he lived in the Inner Sunset District when a person who appeared to be mentally ill and unhoused started following him and yelling racial slurs, the public defender’s office said.
Morgan went into the store and when he came out, the harassment continued, escalating into a verbal argument. A bystander, who like the person yelling at Morgan was white, drove up alongside them and took the side of the man who was yelling.
Santa Clara swimming facility closed indefinitely
The bystander called the police, claiming that Morgan had threatened to kill and rob him, and that Morgan had dented his car. None of this was true, the public defender said, or supported by evidence.
In body-worn camera footage, one of the responding officers could be seen expressing skepticism regarding the bystander’s claims. The footage also revealed the man admitting that the damage to his car predated the incident.
Despite this skepticism, Morgan was arrested based on false accusations. He was charged with felony attempted robbery of the bystander’s reading glasses. The judge released him from custody under the condition that he wear an ankle monitor and be subject to home detention.
As a result, Morgan lost his job as a security guard and was not able to provide for his pregnant girlfriend.
“The allegations in this case were reminiscent of other ‘Karen’ cases where someone called the police on a Black person who had done nothing wrong. Here, the complaining witness racially profiled Mr. Morgan, who is Black, assumed the worst about him and falsely accused him of wrongdoing based on the color of his skin,” said Deputy Public Defender Ilona Yañez, who represented Morgan. “Police and prosecutors pursued this case without any corroborating evidence of a crime, despite the numerous glaring red flags as to the complaining witness’s credibility, and in so doing perpetuated this vigilante’s racism.”
A San Francisco jury acquitted Morgan after just 45 minutes of deliberation.

3NOHFIFFA2_47045MS0N33UVKL,Israel pushes ahead with Gaza offensive approaching 100 days of war,Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud,"Updated January 14, 2024 at 3:58 AM·4 min read",20240113,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-presses-gaza-offensive-approaching-113414447.html,"By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Bassam Masoud
DOHA/GAZA (Reuters) -Israel kept up bombardments in the Gaza Strip on Saturday, vowing to press ahead with its offensive to destroy the Islamist movement Hamas as the war approaches the 100-day mark with no end in sight.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not be deterred by a case before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, where it is fighting accusations that the campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide.
""No one will stop us - not The Hague, not the Axis of Evil, no one,"" he told a news conference, referring to Hamas and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and Houthi militias which have offered their support.
More than three months after the Oct. 7 attack on Israel which triggered the war, more than 20,000 Palestinians have been killed and Gaza is a wasteland of rubble, with all but a handful of its 2.3 million population squeezed into a tiny corner at the southern end of the enclave.
In the southern city of Rafah, an Israeli air strike on a house sheltering two displaced families killed 10 people, the Gaza health ministry said.
Holding up a photo of a dead girl with a piece of bread in her hand, Bassem Arafeh, a relative, said the families in Rafah had been eating dinner when the house was struck on Friday night.
""This child died while she was hungry, while she was eating a piece of bread with nothing on it, where is the International Criminal Court to see how the children die?"" Arafeh said. ""Where are the Muslims ... and the world leaders?""
Israel says it targets militants and does all it can to minimize harm to non-combatants as it wages urban warfare against Hamas in the densely populated Palestinian enclave.
But the scale of the killing in Gaza and the dire humanitarian situation has shocked world opinion and fuelled growing calls for a ceasefire, with South Africa launching a case before the ICJ accusing Israel of genocide.
Israel has rejected the accusation as a gross distortion, saying its actions in Gaza have been taken in self defence after Hamas gunmen attacked a string of communities in southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing more than 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and taking some 240 as hostages.
It says the attack, which Hamas leaders have said they would carry out again, showed its existence as a state was under threat unless the movement is destroyed.
The Israeli military, which says it has killed more than 8,000 fighters, has announced a new phase in combat, withdrawing some forces from northern Gaza, while maintaining operations in the south, where senior Hamas leaders including the movement's leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar, are believed to be hiding.
On Saturday, it said its forces had killed numerous militants in the southern area of Khan Younis and in the central Gaza Strip. It said it was looking into the reported strike in Rafah.
Hamas said its fighters fired at an Israeli helicopter in southern Gaza's Khan Younis.
In the central Gaza Strip, residents reported intense gunbattles and tank shelling and Israeli air strikes in Al-Bureij, Al-Nusseirat and Al-Maghazi, areas housing refugees and descendants of the 1948 war.
HEALTH SYSTEM 'COLLAPSED'
The Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra said Israeli strikes killed 135 Palestinians and wounded 312 in the past 24 hours. In total, he said 23,843 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed since Oct. 7.
As the fighting continued, the head of UNWRA, the U.N. aid agency for Palestinians, said the death and destruction over the past 100 days was ""staining our shared humanity"".
At Nasser Hospital, a handful of doctors said they were struggling in a now ""collapsed"" healthcare system.
Reuters footage showed patients lying on stretchers on the floor inside corridors and doctors using their phone flashlights to examine patients' eyes.
""Most of the medical supplies in the ICU are missing,"" said doctor Mohammad Al-Qidra. ""We don't have empty beds, no treatments. Most of the medicines inside the emergency room are not enough for patients. We are trying to find alternatives.""
Hospital wards are being shared by many of the displaced.
""When we ask for medicine, they tell us they don't have it, and the situation is bad. We are here in cold and windy weather,"" said Mahmoud Jaber, who has been displaced from his home in Gaza City.
In the occupied West Bank, where violence had already been on the rise before Oct. 7 and has increased since, three Palestinians who were armed with knives, a rifle and an axe tried to break into a Jewish settlement and were killed, the Israeli military said.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said the dead were aged 15, 17 and 19. An Israeli soldier was wounded in an exchange of fire with the assailants as they breached the outer fence of the settlement Adora, near the Palestinian city Hebron, Israel said.

3OZPVFIY70_LPJWJ0HR480MREG,Here's how Singapore Airlines airlifted a giant panda cub and sent it on its journey home to China,Kwan Wei Kevin Tan,"January 18, 2024 at 12:19 PM·3 min read",20240118,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/heres-singapore-airlines-airlifted-giant-041904549.html,"Singapore's first giant panda cub, Le Le, traveled to China on Tuesday.
The panda cub took a 4.5-hour-long flight to China via Singapore Airlines.
The flag carrier said it spent the past five months preparing for Le Le's trip home.
Singapore Airlines was given a monumental task in January: They were put in charge of sending Le Le, a 2.5-year-old giant panda cub, to China.
Born in August 2021, Le Le was Singapore's first giant panda cub. The cub's parents, Kai Kai and Jia Jia, traveled to Singapore on loan in 2012. Both pandas are set to return to China in 2027.
Le Le, however, has to be separated from his parents. Due to conservation concerns, China requires host countries to return any cubs born there.
The journey back home was a complicated one to execute.
""The Singapore Airlines team has spent the last five months poring through every little detail to prepare for this special flight,"" said Gajandran Sokayan, an assistant manager at the airline who oversees dangerous goods and special cargo.
Le Le made one last public appearance in Singapore on December 13 at River Wonders, Singapore's river-themed wildlife park. The cub went into quarantine for the big journey on December 14.
The zoo's team then used positive reinforcement training to familiarize the cub with a custom travel crate.
The crate was equipped with removable plywood boards for feedings and checks.
On the day of the big move, Le Le's crate had to be transported from the zoo to the airport with an air-conditioned truck. The truck's temperature was kept between 12 and 16 degrees Celsius to keep things nice and cool for the furry traveler.
After arriving at the airport, Le Le's crate had to be secured to a pallet before loading it onto the plane. This pallet also contained travel essentials for the giant panda cub. The total weight of the palletized crate was around 600 kilograms.
The pallet was then loaded through the nose of SIA's Boeing 747-400F freighter aircraft. Like the reefer truck, the plane had to be pre-cooled one hour before boarding.
The pallet was then locked in position on the aircraft before takeoff to reduce movement during the flight.
Le Le didn't travel alone — he was accompanied by a keeper and veterinarian from Singapore and a zookeeper from China.
The giant panda cub was also served a special in-flight meal during his journey — bamboo, bamboo shoots, fruit, pellets, and water.
SIA said in a press release on Wednesday that Le Le arrived safely in China on January 16. The panda cub is now being quarantined, and the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda will soon assign Le Le to a new, permanent home.

Capelouto,"January 10, 2024 at 9:45 AM·2 min read",20240110,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-prepares-defend-itself-court-174557434.html,"Insights from CNN, Times of Israel, and Mail & Guardian
Hearings are set to begin Thursday in the International Court of Justice over South Africa’s accusations that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.
South Africa filed a case claiming that Israel was in violation of the 1948 Genocide Convention — which was crafted following the Holocaust — over its assault on Gaza. The accusations, which Israel has pledged to rebuff in court, could impact the trajectory of the war.
The ICJ has never found a state to be directly responsible for genocide, so such a ruling would place Israel in “legally uncharted territory,” a Tel Aviv-based international law professor said. While it could take years for a final ruling, the court could grant an injunction in the short-term to cease the fighting in Gaza, CNN noted. Though the court’s rulings are binding, it can’t guarantee compliance — but experts said that if Israel ignores a court order, that could damage its standing among allies like the U.S.
Israel, which is likely to argue its actions in Gaza equate to self-defense, has called the accusations “blood libel.” Its allies also have accused the South African government of holding double standards, citing its failure to arrest former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir who was accused of war crimes and genocide. A U.S.-based genocide expert whose parents are Holocaust survivors told The Times of Israel that the term “genocide” is ”used willy-nilly by people,” and that Israel is “not intending to destroy the Palestinian people.”
South Africa’s anti-Israel stance stems from its longstanding support for the Palestinian cause and deteriorating relations with the Israeli government. Israel had a close military alliance with the white, apartheid regime that ruled over South Africa. “There’s an affinity for the Palestinian struggle which is seen as very close to the South African struggle,” a former member of the South African Parliament from the ruling ANC party said. At the same time, some in the country all but gave up on international law and courts decades ago, according to local paper Mail & Guardian: In the 1960s, Ethiopia and Liberia filed a case against apartheid South Africa, but the ICJ dismissed it."

The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) organisation said it had received a report of a missile being fired 90 nautical miles southeast of Yemen's port city of Aden.
""The master reported a missile landing in the water 400-500 metres away, and being followed by three small craft,"" the UKMTO advisory note said, adding that there were no injuries or damage.
Ambrey said: ""This was the second tanker mistakenly targeted by the Houthis whilst carrying Russian oil.""
Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi militants, who control much of Yemen, have launched wave after wave of exploding drones and missiles at Western commercial vessels in the Red Sea since Nov. 19, in what they say is a protest against Israel's military operations in Gaza.
The United States and Britain carried out strikes from the air and sea against Houthi military targets in Yemen overnight. Russia, an ally of Iran and a partner of key Arab powers, denounced the strikes and called for an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council.
""A Panama-flagged tanker sighted three skiffs while transiting eastbound through the International Recommended Transit Corridor,"" the Ambrey report said, adding that the vessel reported a missile hitting the water.
Ambrey assessed that the vessel was mistakenly targeted based on outdated publicly available information linking the vessel to the United Kingdom.
""This appeared to be five months old but was still listed as UK-affiliated on a public maritime database,"" the report said.

Fox News is told there were attacks on more than a dozen Houthi targets by air, surface, and subsurface platforms. The attacks were carried out with support from Australia, the Netherlands, Bahrain, and Canada. A U.S. defense official says the U.K. contributed aircraft.
President Biden said he'd authorized the strikes ""in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea—including the use of anti-ship ballistic missiles for the first time in history.""
IRAN IDENTIFIES ALLEGED MASTERMIND BEHIND SOLEIMANI MEMORIAL BOMBINGS THAT LEFT NEARLY 100 DEAD: REPORT
These Houthi attacks, Biden said, have endangered U.S. personnel and its allies and have threatened freedom of navigation.
""These targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most critical commercial routes,"" the president said.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
""I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.""
The strikes came shortly after the White House called a lid on President Biden's engagements for the evening as he was not expected to discuss the matter publicly. It also follows news that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had not notified the president or other officials of his whereabouts for several days while he was in the ICU at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
A joint statement from the governments of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Southers Korea, and others said in a joint statement that the strikes ""were intended to disrupt and degrade the capabilities the Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of international mariners in one of the world's most critical waterways.""
In anticipation of the attack, Houthi forces transported some weapons and equipment and fortified others, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a U.S. defense official. Local reports indicated Houthi militants were evacuating the Red Sea city of Hodeidah.
The group's leader, Abdel-Malek al-Houthi vowed in a televised speech earlier Thursday that any U.S. attack on Yemen's Houthis would not go without a response. He said any such response would be bigger than the recent strike in which its drones and missiles targeted a U.S. ship in the Red Sea.
""Any American attack will not remain without a response. The response will be greater than the attack that was carried out with twenty drones and a number of missiles,"" he said.
TIME FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN TO FOLLOW ‘THE GIPPER’ AND INVOKE THE REAGAN DOCTRINE AGAINST IRAN
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak briefed his cabinet of ministers late Thursday on the imminent military intervention.
British media also reported that other political figures, including the leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, as well as the speaker of the House of Commons, had been briefed by the government.
White House national security spokesperson John Kirby called on the Houthis earlier Thursday to ""stop these attacks,"" saying that the terrorist group would ""bear the consequences for any failure to do so.""
The joint strike came after Iranian forces seized an oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman early Thursday morning. The seized vessel was in transit to Turkey when the Iranian naval forces boarded and seized the vessel, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters.
""The key for military action in Yemen is to respond in a way that does not lead to a never-ending tit-for-tat. That has been the administration’s approach in Syria and Iraq, and it has failed,"" said Richard Goldberg, a Senior Adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies and a former National Security Council official told Fox News Digital in a statement.
""The president needs to fundamentally change the calculus for Iran and its proxies. Has President Biden ordered the Houthis to be re-listed as a foreign terrorist organization? President Biden ordered the $10 billion for Iran to be frozen? Will any IRGC targets in Yemen, or Iran's intelligence cargo ship be targeted? These are all relevant questions that help inform what the policy is and whether deterrence will actually be restored.""
UN TEACHERS CELEBRATED OCT. 7 ATTACK, PRAISED HAMAS TERRORISTS AS ‘HEROES’ ON TELEGRAM: WATCHDOG
Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi militants have stepped up attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea in recent weeks in protest against Israel's war in Gaza. Various shipping lines have suspended operations, instead taking the longer journey around Africa.
Fourteen countries, including the U.S., issued a joint statement last week saying: ""The Houthis will bear the responsibility for the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, or the free flow of commerce in the region's critical waterways.""
The U.S. military said the Houthis earlier on Thursday had staged their 27th attack on shipping since Nov. 19, firing an anti-ship ballistic missile into international shipping lanes in the Gulf of Aden.
Earlier this week, U.S. and British naval forces shot down drones and missiles fired by the Houthis toward the southern Red Sea after the Royal Navy warship HMS Diamond was attacked.
The Houthis, who seized much of Yemen in a civil war, have vowed to attack ships linked to Israel or bound for Israeli ports. However, many of the targeted ships have had no links to Israel.

NATO is mobilizing 90,000 troops as part of its biggest military drill since the Cold War. The exercise, coined Steadfast Defender 2024, will include at least 1,100 combat vehicles, 80 aircraft, and 50 naval vessels from all 31 NATO member states, as well as from NATO candidate Sweden.
The drill will start next week and last until May, NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander said at a press conference Thursday. The drill comes after a host of European leaders warned that Russia remains a real threat, despite expending a significant amount of its manpower and resources in Ukraine.
On Friday, the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania also announced they will build a common defensive line along their borders with Russia and Belarus to ensure they are prepared to ward off any future Russian attack. Earlier this week, the prime minister of Estonia warned that Europe has three to five years until the Kremlin rebuilds its forces and poses a serious threat to NATO’s eastern flank.
The drill will allow NATO to practice its first major defense plan in decades, which the alliance approved last year as it sought to increase its readiness for a conventional war after decades of preparing for low-intensity conflicts and peacekeeping operations. The defense plan “will reassure those allies most exposed to potential Russian aggression and improve the ability of all of the allies to act effectively together,” defense expert Kori Schake wrote in The Atlantic. European officials are increasingly sounding the alarm about the Russia threat, with the German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius warning that an attack could be possible in five to eight years. Earlier this month, Sweden’s commander-in-chief caused panic among the country’s children by announcing on a kids television show that war could come to Sweden.
Despite frequent warnings about European security, the continent has been slower to ramp up its production of military equipment than its militaries would have liked. “The uncomfortable truth,” analysts from The International Institute for Strategic Studies wrote, “is that European countries have hardly prepared for war at all.” Last year, the European Union delivered less than half of the one million artillery shells it had promised to Ukraine by spring of this year. Most of the shells the EU did provide came from existing reserves, raising questions about whether the EU will be able to continue supplying Ukraine at the same rate once European stockpiles empty out. While several countries are ramping up their production — both Finland and Norway have announced major funding packages for their arms industries in the past weeks — defense companies have warned that without further investment they will be unable to develop the production capacity European countries hope to build.
The coming military drill will also allow NATO to continue integrating its newest member, Finland, as well as Sweden, which is expected to join NATO eventually despite sustained Hungarian opposition to its membership application. The two countries will strengthen NATO’s military capacities in the Baltics, with analysts frequently quipping that the Baltic Sea has become a “NATO lake.” The Baltics have been a concern for NATO for decades: One war game conducted by the think tank RAND in 2016 concluded that Russian forces could reach the capitals of Estonia and Latvia within less than three days in the event of a full-scale invasion. But Finland’s accession has also created a new challenge for the alliance, which now has to manage an 800-mile border with Russia that is “highly exposed to Russian military threats,” according to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies."

The U.K.-Ukraine Agreement on Security Cooperation, which makes good on a pledge made along with other G7 nations last summer at the NATO summit in Lithuania, commits Britain to provide ""swift and sustained"" defense assistance should Russia ever attack Ukraine again in the future, Downing Street said in a news release.
The boosted 2024-25 military funding package, up from $2.95 billion in 2022 and 2023, will give Ukraine access to Britain's latest and best weapons systems, including long-range missiles, air defense and maritime security equipment and artillery ammunition.
Around 8% of the funding package will go on a major push to rapidly procure and produce thousands of surveillance, long-range strike and sea drones to give Ukraine the edge in defending civilians by providing the capability to target Russian forces on land and at sea.
""I am in Ukraine to deliver a simple message. Our support cannot and will not falter. To all Ukrainians, Britain is with you -- for as long as it takes,"" Sunak wrote in a post on X.

""The U.K. is already one of Ukraine's closest partners because we recognize their security is our security. Today we are going further -- increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones, and signing a historic new Security Agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term.""
Sunak will also announce another $23 million in aid for humanitarian projects and protecting Ukraine's power grid bringing the total military and economic support from Britain, including Storm Shadow cruise missiles and 14 Challenger 2 tanks, to $15.3 billion.
The British leader's show of support comes as Zelensky is pushing Ukraine's Western allies for more military backing amid fears that ""war fatigue"" is setting in and events in the Middle East are diverting attention as the second anniversary of Russia's invasion approaches.
Zelensky made an unexpected visit to Ukraine's Baltic allies Wednesday for meetings with leaders on security and shoring up European support for his country's military struggle.
U.S. President Joe Biden's $105 billion supplemental national security package, which includes military funding for Ukraine and Israel, has been stalled in Congress since October in a partisan row over funding earmarked for securing the U.S.-Mexico border.
Biden threatened to veto an amended Republican-approved bill boosting the aid Israel would receive and he and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have since insisted that increased military aid to Israel must be paired with more funding for Ukraine.
House Democrats made it clear Thursday that any increase would have to be conditional on Israel adhering to ""the international rules of war.""
""I do not think that the United States should be funding any offensive aid that is assisting Israel unless they are abiding by those laws,"" said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
""I would support conditions to funding aid to Israel."""

4JPB7GX0KL_PKNKW19QR7WHOKA,Andy Burnham flew to Japan to sign Fujitsu contract for Manchester Investment zone,Henry Bodkin,"January 21, 2024 at 12:54 AM·4 min read",20240120,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/andy-burnham-flew-japan-sign-165437574.html,"Andy Burnham has signed a major new deal with Fujitsu despite publicly railing against the wrongful prosecution of sub-postmasters which the tech giant enabled.
The Mayor of Greater Manchester flew to Tokyo last month to sign an “exploratory agreement” with the firm for its assistance in the development of Manchester’s Investment Zone.
He described the partnership as a “massive boost” for the city, while a colleague said it would make Manchester “more efficient”.
Since the airing of the hugely successful ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office, Mr Burnham has taken to the airwaves to denounce the treatment of sub-postmasters, hundreds of whom had their lives ruined after Fujitsu’s faulty Horizon software falsely indicated they had lost or stolen money.
Mr Burnham compared their treatment to that of victims of the Hillsborough disaster and the Grenfell Tower fire.
The Horizon System Helpdesk, which notoriously told desperate sub-postmasters they were the only ones reporting issues, had a call centre in Manchester.
Mr Burnham said Post Office bosses were “guilty of treating people appallingly for years” and called for the Government-owned company to be stripped of its powers to prosecute independently.
However, in respect of the scandal he appears to have made no mention of the Japanese multinational company, whose bosses have admitted to Sir Wyn Williams’s public inquiry that it knew of bugs in the Horizon software from as early as 1999.
Fujitsu is now under fierce scrutiny for its role, referred to by one High Court judge as the worst miscarriage of justice in British legal history, which included actively assisting the Post Office with its prosecutions, for which the company earned up to £20,000 per case.
The firm has now undertaken not to bid for any further government contracts until the public inquiry is complete.
MPs on the Treasury Committee have also written to 21 public sector organisations demanding to know what deals have been struck with Fujitsu since 2019.
That is the year when in a landmark case the High Court ruled that prosecutions were wrongly brought based on the faulty Horizon system.
Any such concerns about the company did not prevent Mr Burnham attending a formal signing ceremony at Fujitsu’s Shiodome City global headquarters in December, alongside the firm’s chief technology officer Vivek Mahajan and a fellow Labour politician, Manchester City Council leader Bev Craig.
He also posed for photographs next to the bullet train and later lauded on Twitter, Greater Manchester’s “most successful trade mission yet”.
The trip, which included visits to other Japanese firms, was supported by the former Tory cabinet minister Greg Clark in his role as the Prime Minister’s Trade Envoy to Japan.
Fujitsu has longstanding ties with Greater Manchester.
The company has a three-building campus opposite the Greater Manchester Police headquarters.
It was also the first tenant of the Central Park enterprise hub, which opened in 2005.
The firm installed the smart Manchester Airport’s passport control, and it has strong links with the University of Manchester, with collaborations stretching back 75 years in the early days of computing.
Although details of the “exploratory partnership” are opaque, including the value of the contract, the deal will see Fujitsu support Greater Manchester in the development of its investment zone, a huge project the authority hopes will create thousands of jobs and bring in billions of  pounds over the next decade.
James Daly, the MP for Bury North, said: “I’m extremely concerned that Mr Burnham has apparently entered into a deal with Fujitsu, bearing in mind that he has known, as everyone has, for many years the role that Fujitsu played in the terrible prosecution of sub-postmasters.
“He needs to be upfront with the people of Greater Manchester about why he has signed this deal and how much it will cost them.”
Greater Manchester Combined Authority said no public funds had yet been spent or earmarked on the project.
Mr Burnham said on Sunday: “Fujitsu is a large, long-standing employer in Greater Manchester, and it is right that we work closely with them.
“Of course, the public inquiry is bringing new information into the public domain all the time and we will wait for its conclusions before taking any decisions.”
Fujitsu has been approached for comment.

4P5DNZVJC6_4HL946AC7YUMR4L,North Korea launches suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile that can reach distant US bases,HYUNG-JIN KIM,"Updated January 14, 2024 at 11:29 PM·4 min read",20240114,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-launches-ballistic-missile-061018218.html,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired a suspected intermediate-range ballistic missile into the sea on Sunday, South Korea’s military said, two months after the North claimed to have tested engines for a new harder-to-detect missile capable of striking distant U.S. targets in the region.
The launch was the North’s first this year. Experts say North Korea could ramp up its provocative missile tests as a way to influence the results of South Korea’s parliamentary elections in April and the U.S. presidential election in November.
South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that it detected the launch of a ballistic missile of an intermediate-range class from the North’s capital region on Sunday afternoon. It said the missile flew about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) before landing in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
The Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launch a provocation that poses a serious threat to peace on the Korean Peninsula. It said South Korea’s military will maintain its readiness to overwhelmingly respond to any provocations by North Korea.
The South Korean assessment suggests North Korea could have launched a new intermediate-range ballistic missile, whose solid-fuel engine the North said it had tested in mid-November.
The missile is mainly designed to hit U.S. military bases in the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, which is about 3,400 kilometers (2,110 miles) from Pyongyang, the North’s capital. With a range adjustment, the missile can also be used to attack closer targets — the U.S. military installations in Japan’s Okinawa island, according to Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy in Seoul.
Built-in solid propellants make missile launches harder to detect than liquid-fueled missiles, which must be fueled before launch and cannot last long. North Korea has a growing arsenal of solid-fuel short-range missiles targeting South Korea, but its existing Hwasong-12 intermediate-range missile is powered by liquid-fuel engines.
Japan’s Defense Ministry said its analysis showed the missile traveled at least 500 kilometers (300 miles) at the maximum altitude of 50 kilometers (30 miles), data that suggest North Korea may have fired a short-range and not an intermediate-range missile.
Japan and South Korea said they closely exchanged information about the launch with the United States, but they didn’t immediately explain the discrepancy in data.
In a trilateral call later Sunday, senior diplomats from South Korea, the U.S. and Japan condemned the North Korean launch and stressed that a North Korean provocation would lead to the three countries strengthening their security cooperation, according to South Korea’s Foreign Ministry.
The last time North Korea performed a missile launch was Dec. 18, when it test-fired its Hwasong-18 solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missile, the North’s most advanced weapon. The Hwasong-18 is the country’s only known solid-fuel ICBM and it’s designed to strike the mainland U.S.
On Jan. 5, North Korea fired a barrage of artillery shells near the disputed western sea boundary with South Korea, prompting South Korea to conduct similar firing exercises in the same area. The site is where the navies of the two Koreas have fought three bloody sea battles since 1999, and attacks blamed on North Korea killed 50 South Koreans in 2010.
In recent days, North Korea has also been escalating its warlike, inflammatory rhetoric against its foes ahead of an election year in South Korea and the U.S. Last week, leader Kim Jong Un called South Korea “our principal enemy” and threatened to  annihilate it if provoked.
Experts say Kim likely wants to see South Korean liberals win the election in a blow to conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has taken a hard line on the North. They say Kim also wants former U.S. President Donald Trump to be elected again because he may believe he could win U.S. concessions if Trump returns to the White House.
Kim has been pushing hard to enlarge his nuclear and missile arsenals since his high-stakes diplomacy with Trump broke down in 2019. In recent months, North Korea has also been expanding its military and other cooperation with Russia.
The U.S. government said it has evidence that missiles provided by North Korea to Russia had been used in the war in Ukraine. In a joint statement last week, the U.S., South Korea and their partners said the missile transfer supports Russia’s war of aggression and provides North Korea with valuable technical and military insights.
North Korea and Russia announced Sunday that North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui will visit Russia from Monday to Wednesday at the invitation of her Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov.
“Pyongyang’s show of force should be of concern beyond Seoul, as its military cooperation with Moscow adds to the violence in Ukraine, and because it may be more willing to challenge the U.S. and its allies while global attention is fixed on the Middle East,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.

(AP) — A Missouri lawsuit accusing China of hoarding masks and other protective gear during the COVID-19 pandemic can move forward, federal judges ruled Wednesday.
A panel of the U.S. Eighth District Court of Appeals panel, however, otherwise agreed with a lower court's 2022 ruling that tossed out Missouri's case entirely, finding that federal rules prohibit a sovereign foreign entity from being sued in American courts. The state alleged that China's officials were to blame for the pandemic because they didn't do enough to slow its spread.
The appeals panel found that only one claim may proceed: an allegation that China hoarded personal protective equipment.
“Missouri’s overarching theory is that China leveraged the world’s ignorance about COVID-19,” Judge David Stras wrote in the ruling. “One way it did so was by manipulating the worldwide personal-protective-equipment market. Missouri must still prove it, but it has alleged enough to allow the claim to proceed beyond a jurisdictional dismissal on the pleadings.”
Chief Judge Lavenski Smith dissented, writing that the whole lawsuit should be dismissed.
“Immunity for foreign states under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, while not impenetrable, is quite stout and stronger than the claim alleged in this case,” Smith wrote. “It is certainly not strong enough to justify judicial intervention into an arena well populated with substantial political and diplomatic concerns.”
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey, whose office filed the lawsuit, lauded the ruling Wednesday on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“We are headed back to court to pursue remedies,” he posted.
The lawsuit, filed in April 2020, alleged that Chinese officials were “responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians.”
Neither the Chinese government nor any other Chinese defendant named in the case has responded to the lawsuit in court.
The Lawyers for Upholding International Law and The China Society of Private International Law filed briefs defending China against the lawsuit. Associated Press emails and voice messages left with lawyers for the groups were not immediately returned Wednesday.
China has criticized the lawsuit as “very absurd” and said it has no factual and legal basis. Legal experts have mostly panned it as a stunt aimed at shifting blame to China for the COVID-19 pandemic."

4VUGZTWPX2_CAORODOHIGFAY7T,Roxanna Asgarian's 'We Were Once a Family' and Amanda Peters' 'The Berry Pickers' win library medals,HILLEL ITALIE,"January 20, 2024 at 8:09 AM·4 min read",20240120,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/roxanna-asgarians-were-once-family-160941619.html,"NEW YORK (AP) — In the childhood home of author Roxanna Asgarian, there were restrictions on how often the television could be on and which programs could be watched.
Books were placed under a much looser set of rules.
“Mom would take us to the library and gave us totally free reign,” says Asgarian, a Las Vegas native who is now a freelance journalist in Dallas. She is one of this year's winners of an Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence, presented by the American Library Association.
“There were no limits and that was very helpful to me because I could follow my interests; I read Roald Dahl's books, one by one. I think when it comes to books and readings you have to be able to find what's interesting to you and pursue that. It helps you come to a love of reading. ”
On Saturday, the library association announced that Asgarian had won the nonfiction medal for “We Were Once A Family: Love, Death, and Child Removal in America,” her investigation into the Hart family murder-suicide from 2018, when a couple drove off a cliff with their six adopted children in the back. The fiction medal was awarded to Amanda Peters for her novel “The Berry Pickers,” a multi-generational story centered around the disappearance of a young Mi’kmaq girl from a blueberry field in Maine.
Each winner receives $5,000 and will be honored in June during the ALA's annual conference, being held this year in San Diego.
“Amanda Peters’ stunning prose and evocative narrative enraptured us with the grief and longing of her characters. Roxanna Asgarian’s blending of journalism, narrative nonfiction, and heartbreak tears back the veil on the child removal systems in the United States,"" Aryssa Damron, chair of the awards' selection committee, said in a statement.
Finalists for the Carnegie prizes were Jesmyn Ward’s “Let Us Descend” and Christina Wong’s and Daniel Innes’ “Denison Avenue” in fiction, and Jake Bittle’s “The Great Displacement: Climate Change and the Next American Migration” and Darrin Bell’s “The Talk” in nonfiction.
Peters, a native of Falmouth, Nova Scotia, has been a library patron for much of her life and received a master's in library and information studies from Dalhousie University. Now an associate professor at Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, she remembers her high school library as the setting for a personal breakthrough: When she checked out a copy of John Steinbeck's “Of Mice and Men,"" the classic novella about two migrant workers and the tragedies that overcome them.
“I was 16 and sitting in the library and it changed the trajectory of my reading career,"" said Peters, who read the book at home. “It was such an emotional read. I had enjoyed books before, but this made me realize what a book can really do. It can make you feel so intensely. My mom came into my bedroom and I was crying, and she was like, ‘What’s wrong?'”
Peters says when she travels she still likes to visit a library before even going to a bookstore, sometimes looking through a given title at the library and deciding whether eventually to buy it. During a trip to New York City while she was working on “The Berry Pickers,” she visited the famed research section of the 5th Avenue branch of the New York Public Library.
“I was there (in New York) with some friends and they went shopping, but I wanted to visit the library so I took my computer and sat for a couple hours and wrote,” she said. “Such a beautiful spot.”
Asgarian said that Houston's African American History Research Center was vital for her reporting in “Once We Were a Family,” part of which is set in the city's historic Fourth Ward, a former Black Freedmen's Town established after the Civil War. The library was once a Black elementary school, attended by some of the people in her book.
“The research center was super, super valuable to me because of all the historical documents it held and the news clippings about the neighborhood,"" Asgarian said.
The Carnegie Medals were established in 2012 with the help of a grant from Carnegie Corporation of New York. Previous winners include Jennifer Egan, James McBride and Bryan Stevenson."

4XTG6M8JOJ_WN51D28TVH8ZWDM,Opinion: War is a way of life for the Houthis,"Opinion By Peter Bergen, CNN","January 18, 2024 at 3:58 AM·12 min read",20240116,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/opinion-war-way-life-houthis-192158173.html,"Editor’s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN’s national security analyst, a vice president at New America, a professor of practice at Arizona State University and the host of the Audible podcast “In the Room” also on Apple and Spotify. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
“We think of war as a last resort. They think of it as a way of life.” That’s the way Elisabeth Kendall describes the Houthis, a Yemeni militant group that has attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea in nominal support of Hamas, becoming the target of missile and air strikes by the US and UK last week.
Kendall, the head of Girton College at Cambridge University, is an expert on Yemen, a country where she has done extensive fieldwork for more than a decade. Kendall’s expertise in Arabic poetry piqued her interest in the country, which she first visited in 2012.
The Houthis are Zaydis, a minority Shiite Muslim sect that makes up around a third of Yemen’s overall population. They have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country. In 2014, the Houthis captured the Yemeni capital Sanaa, sparking a civil war with the government, which was backed by the US and Saudi Arabia. The Houthis today control essential parts of Yemen, including Sanaa, the populous north of the country, and the critical port of Hudaydah, which sits on the Red Sea approaches to the Suez Canal.
I spoke to Kendall on Sunday to get her take on who the Houthis are and what motivates them. Kendall thinks last week’s US and UK strikes on Houthi targets will not do much to deter the Houthis. She also explained how and why Iran and the Houthis have grown closer in recent years. Kendall also suggested that any future conflict with the Houthis would likely be long-lasting.
Our discussion was edited for clarity.
PETER BERGEN: What did you make of the US and UK strikes in Yemen last week against multiple Houthi targets?
ELISABETH KENDALL: I could understand why they happened and the rationale behind them. I think they’re probably ill-advised because I don’t think they’re going to do what they are intended to do. I don’t think they’ll deter the Houthis. They will have the opposite effect.
This is such an unequal war because the whole character of war has changed. It’s not about the biggest military. It’s more about who has the biggest appetite to just keep going. The Houthis know we’re not going to launch a land war because not only would it be unbelievably unpopular with all our allies in the Arab world, but it would be immensely unpopular back home as well with voters who don’t want to see us mire ourselves in another Afghanistan or another Iraq. And we’ve seen from both of those countries that it doesn’t matter if you have a stronger military. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going to win.
The Houthis have been fighting in civil wars in Yemen on and off since 2004. Let’s say you’re 22 years old, and you’re in the Houthi territories, particularly those up in the north, which is very populous. You will barely remember anything other than war. And that’s really important because we think of war as a last resort. They think of it as a way of life.
BERGEN: The US and UK aim is to try and restore deterrence so that the Houthis stop attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Are you saying that the deterrence won’t necessarily be restored?
KENDALL: I would have favored building up legitimate institutions inside Yemen to undermine the Houthis. I think having strikes on Arab soil by the US and the UK at a time when we’re already pretty unpopular around the Arab world just plays into their hands.
So, I think it plays into their narratives of the US and its allies as the aggressors, and at a time when Israel’s already bombing mercilessly in Gaza — this just makes it seem as though this really is a war against Muslims. Of course, we know better than that, but it’s very easy to frame it like that on their part.
The Houthis have this massive advantage, which is that they don’t care about casualties, and they also don’t have to be accurate, as we have to be accurate when we’re operating in these theatres because we don’t want to kill civilians. All they have to do is lob missiles and drones into the Red Sea to have the effect that they want, which is to disrupt global shipping, rattle financial markets, create fear and look heroic at the same time. So, by taking out some of their launch sites, we have probably taken out some of their capability, but they will have expected that. They will have hidden some of their military assets.
BERGEN: What do the Houthis believe?
KENDALL: Their slogan is “God is great, death to the US, death to Israel, curse the Jews, and victory for Islam,” a slogan adopted in the early 2000s. So, it’s been with them for about 20 years, but it’s not something that they’ve lived with since the foundation of Israel.
BERGEN: The Houthis practice a particular form of Shi’ism that is fairly distinct from the clerics in Iran and also, obviously, very distinct from the Sunni Islam practiced by Hamas. My impression was always that the Houthis were kind of a ragtag militia that didn’t have much of a relationship with Iran a decade ago, but when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia entered the civil war in Yemen in 2015, dropping bombs on Houthi targets, Iran got much more involved, and they’ve been arming the Houthis with armed drones and ballistic missiles and other kinds of more advanced weaponry.
KENDALL: They have been getting ever closer to Iran. Now, when I first started really looking at the relationship between Iran and the Houthis with a paper that I did for the Atlantic Council in 2017 called “Iran’s Fingerprints in Yemen,” there really wasn’t that much evidence of Iran’s influence on the Houthis.
Now, as the civil war in Yemen proceeded, the Houthis needed their weapons replenished, and what they were being replenished with was increasingly sophisticated in terms of attack drones and missiles, and it was very clear that that was coming from Iran. And some of it was definitely being smuggled overland from the east of Yemen, where I was working. And it was a cheap option for Iran.
Saudi Arabia had three publicly stated war aims. One was to support the so-called internationally recognized government. Another was to prevent Yemen from fragmenting and, of course, to safeguard its own southern border. And number three was to contain the influence of Iran.
You could argue it didn’t really achieve any of those. In fact, it achieved the opposite. But I think we also need to be aware that we don’t know what would have happened had the Saudis not entered the war in 2015. It could be that the Houthis could have taken over all of Yemen.
The Saudis have flown 25,000 airstrikes over the Houthis. There’s nothing left to bomb. They’re bombing things for the second or third time, though there has now been a truce for more than a year, and the bombings have stopped.
BERGEN: So, the Houthis have obviously sustained a tremendous beating from the Saudis from the air for more than seven years. You mentioned a figure of 25,000 bombings. That would seem to suggest that they can weather the kind of strikes that the US and the UK have undertaken?
KENDALL: Yes.
Not only have the Iranians been supplying weapons, but there have been some insidious cultural influences. The Houthis have had religious indoctrination, and they seem much more Iranian-Shi’i than they do Zaydi now. (Zaydi Shi’ism, practiced by the Houthis, differs from the orthodox Shi’ism practiced by the clerics running Iran.) And when the Houthi leader speaks, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, it’s almost like he’s the mouthpiece of God. And that really wasn’t the case previously. We also see the Houthis carrying a lot of green banners. These weren’t parts of their natural Zaydi roots. So, they have become increasingly “Iranian-ized,” if that’s a word.
BERGEN: How did that happen?
KENDALL: Well, by intention on the part of Iran and also by necessity, because the Houthis didn’t have other allies.
BERGEN: Is there evidence of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard trainers training the Houthis? Or Houthis going to Iran for training?
KENDALL: Well, we know that the Houthis’ leadership goes to Iran, and the training that IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) have come to Yemen to assist, and Hezbollah trainers have been in Yemen.
BERGEN:  So, how do the Houthis get their funding?
KENDALL: Well, they get some from Iran. But, of course, they also control a lot of coastline and ports and imports and aid, and they can weaponize aid and food that’s coming in. They can impose taxes. And, of course, the leadership has got very well-lined pockets because there’s a war economy. Smuggling is a massive business, and a lot of people have gotten rich on the back of it.
BERGEN: The UN did say, until maybe Gaza replaced Yemen, that Yemen was the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Is that accurate as far as you’re concerned?
KENDALL: I think it has been an absolute catastrophe. I’m not in a position to judge it against other catastrophes, and I do think the UN has a slight tendency to exaggerate whatever it is raising money for in the moment. But there’s no doubt that millions of people have been suffering very badly. At one point, more than a million cases of cholera, and things like measles, came back as killer diseases.
The Houthis have not been brilliant at governing; there is rubbish in the streets, and there has been hunger, very severe hunger. It’s like slowly boiling a frog in Yemen. Because it’s such a community, you don’t go hungry immediately. Whole communities gradually go hungry because they share, and then they share until they’ve got nothing left. And so you sort of starve gradually, and that has been what’s happening.
The Houthis consider that to be something quite useful for organizing journalists’ trips to hospitals, getting lots of photo opportunities and then blaming Saudi Arabia and the West.
BERGEN: There’s a lively debate in Washington about whether or not to designate the Houthis as a terrorist organization, which former President Donald Trump did and then President Joe Biden revoked and now is reconsidering. What do you think of that debate?
KENDALL: I think it’s a bit of a red herring. I don’t think it would make the slightest bit of difference whether the US designated them or not. The only people who would suffer would be the Yemeni people, and that was why the designation was removed by Biden because it’s going to be very awkward for aid organizations to get in to do their work once the Houthi-controlled ports and the Houthi companies are designated. The other issue with it is that people forget that Trump only did this during his last days in office. It was a parting gift to the Saudis and something to hamstring Biden. So, it wasn’t as though this was anything that Trump considered a really good idea. He left it as a mess for Biden, who then had to revoke it and therefore look weak.
The other thing that’s really important here is that if the Houthis were designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, that would make this Yemeni peace process that the United Nations Special Envoy announced on December 23 very difficult because, on the one hand, you’d have America seeing them as a terrorist organization, and the United Nations trying to mediate a power-sharing government recognized by the international community with this group of terrorists. So, probably, the domestic peace talks would fall through, and America would be blamed.
BERGEN: Hezbollah in the early 1980s was just a small rag-tag militia in southern Beirut with some Iranian support. Today, they effectively control the government of Lebanon, are very well armed, and are a more effective military force than the Lebanese army.
I use the phrase “ragtag militia” to describe the Houthis in the pre-2014 time period. Are they on the way to becoming a Hezbollah-like entity? They obviously control the capital of Yemen. They obviously are well-armed. They can strike neighboring countries, not only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but even trying to target Israel.
KENDALL: Yes, I think it’s a good analogy. I think they’re on the way to becoming Hezbollah.
BERGEN: Proxy relationships can vary from fully cooperative to somewhat fraught, and Hezbollah is fully cooperative with Iran. How would you define the relationship with the Houthis and Iran? Are the Houthis a fully blown proxy of Iran, or do they follow their own path?
KENDALL: Yeah, I think it is slightly different from Hezbollah. They’re not joined at the hip with Iran in the way that Hezbollah are, and I don’t also think — so quite an important point here too — is that I don’t think there’s a great sense of brotherhood and loyalty between Hezbollah and the Houthis.
The Houthis are really a bit of a wild card in the Arab world. People don’t quite know what to make of them, and they’re quite hot-headed. They’re fine to collaborate when it suits them, and they have no problem stabbing you in the back when it doesn’t which is what happened to Ali Abdullah Saleh. (In 2015, Saleh, the longtime Yemeni dictator, joined the Houthi rebels, only to be later murdered by the Houthis when Saleh seemed to be trying to make peace with the Saudis.)
They’re not a direct proxy, and Iran has no command and control directly. Of course, it would hamper their cause significantly if Iran stopped supplying them with weapons, but it wouldn’t stop them.

Details: Poland is negotiating with Ukraine on the introduction of import licences that would limit the import of not only grain, but also fruit, vegetables, poultry, eggs and sugar from Ukraine. The European Commission proposed such a solution last year, but now the Polish authorities intend to introduce a new measure, namely, verification of reliability of Ukrainian licences.
Although such a solution would not be entirely in line with the principles of the free market, Brussels is ready to agree to it, provided that the Polish-Ukrainian dispute is resolved.
So far, however, as RMF FM noted, Ukraine is in no hurry to compromise on the licence issue. Polish diplomats suspect that Kyiv may be waiting for another agreement. It is about the EU regulation on the extension of duty-free trade.
Confidence that the European Commission will not abandon duty-free imports from Ukraine will allow Kyiv to take a better position in negotiations with Warsaw.
It is reported that as soon as the licences are introduced, Poland will lift the current embargo on Ukrainian imports.
""If this situation continues, the EC will initiate a procedure for violating EU law,"" the EU diplomat said.
More favourable solutions are also being prepared in a regulation to be adopted by Brussels next week. As RMF FM has found out, this concerns a new provision to strengthen the safeguard clause. Until now, the emergency brake on excessive imports from Ukraine could only be activated if problems arose across the EU market. On the contrary, the new proposal provides for its activation even in the event of regional disruptions.
In such a situation, in two weeks' time, the EC could impose temporary trade restrictions on Ukraine for a period of four months. Only then would the EC conduct an in-depth analysis.
The emergency brake would mean that restrictions (e.g. quotas) could be imposed in case of, for example, excessive sugar imports from Ukraine.
Background:
It was reported that the ministers of agriculture of Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary demanded the imposition of import duties on Ukrainian grain due to alleged unfair competition in a joint letter to the European Commission.
In September 2023, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary announced restrictions on imports of Ukrainian grain after the European Commission decided not to extend the ban on imports to five EU countries neighbouring Ukraine.
In response, Ukraine filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation against these three countries, and other EU members condemned their unilateral restrictions.

The deployment, which Shapps characterised as the UK's biggest to NATO in four decades, is aimed at ""providing vital reassurance"" over the ""menace"" posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin following his invasion of Ukraine, Shapps said.
The British personnel -- from the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy and Army -- will deploy across Europe and beyond for the military alliance's latest ""Exercise Steadfast Defender"", alongside personnel from 31 other member countries and Sweden, which is a candidate to join the transatlantic alliance.
""Today's NATO is bigger than ever but the challenges are bigger too,"" Shapps said in a wide-ranging speech in London, in which he warned ""the international rules-based order"" was facing rising dangers.
""And that's why the UK has committed... the totality of our air, land and maritime assets to NATO"", he went on.
""In 2024 I am determined to do even more and that's why I can announce today the UK will send in some 20,000 personnel to lead one of NATO's largest deployments since the end of the Cold War.""
The UK contingent will include fighter jets and surveillance aircraft, the navy's most advanced warships and submarines, and a full range of army capabilities, including special operations forces.
London will send a so-called Carrier Strike Group -- which features its flagship aircraft carrier and F-35B fighter jets and helicopters -- to the exercises in the North Atlantic, Norwegian Sea and Baltic Sea.
Meanwhile some 16,000 soldiers will be deployed across eastern Europe from next month to June, taking with them tanks, artillery, helicopters and parachutes.
- 'Hard-headed' -
Shapps used his most high-profile speech since being appointed to the post in August to argue that the post-Cold War ""peace dividend"" has ended and Western allies must face down foes including China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.
""It's been replaced by a period of hard-headed realism,"" he said, adding that NATO's adversaries ""are more connected with each other"" than ever and Western allies ""stand at a crossroads"".
""Our adversaries are busily rebuilding their barriers, old enemies are reanimated, battle lines are being redrawn, the tanks are literally on Ukraine's lawn and the foundations of the world order are being shaken to their core.""
Shapps also addressed the joint UK-US strikes against Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen last week. The Huthis have repeatedly attacked shipping in the Red Sea in recent months, in protest at the war in Gaza.
The UK minister said the strikes were intended ""as a single action"".
But asked if further military action was planned, he replied: ""I can't predict the future for you.""
""We will not put up with a major waterway... being closed on a permanent basis"" to international shipping, Shapps added.

Transport company Wincanton, founded to transport milk in 1925, has agreed to a £765m takeover from a subsidiary of CMA CGM.
CMA CGA is owned by French billionaire Rodolphe Saadé and his family, who are worth an estimated $9.8bn (£7.7bn). The offer represents a 52pc premium to Wincanton’s share price.
Alongside milk delivery, Wincanton’s main business involves running warehouses and transporting goods for the likes of Sainsbury’s, Argos, Morrisons and Waitrose. A major fixture for UK supply chains, it is best known for its blue and white lorries on UK motorways.
The company will quit the London stock market once the deal completes, removing the last major listed logistics operator amid an exodus of companies.
James Wroath, Wincanton chief executive, said: “This offer will enable Wincanton to continue and accelerate the progress that has been made, providing an excellent partner with the balance sheet strength that will allow the pursuit of both existing and new growth opportunities.”
Wincanton is the latest independent logistics firm to succumb to a takeover after Clipper Logistics and DX Group were also sold.
Wincanton employs 20,000 people, including 5,000 drivers, in the UK and occupies more than 16m sq ft of warehouse space.
CMA CGA is buying the company through its subsidiary Ceva Logistics.
Mr Saade’s father, Jacques Saadé, founded CMA as Compagnie Maritime d’Affrètement in the early 1980s. He went on to reap the benefits of growing shipping trade in China.
CMA merged with Compagnie Generale Transatlantique in 1999 and is today the world’s third largest container line. French state fund BPIfrance also has a small stake of 3pc.
CMA CGM has an eye-catching headquarters in Marseilles designed by superstar architect Zaha Hadid.
Wincanton was founded in 1925 as a subsidiary of the West Surrey Central Dairy Company, later known as Cow & Gate. A deal with the Milk Marketing Board for farm collection of milk in the 1950s boosted the company. Today it ships products for the likes of Arla and Freshways under its “bulk liquid transport solution” offering.
A new fleet of Volvo tankers acquired in 2020 allowed it to transport 89,000 litres of milk from British farms per day. However, it recently lost a contract with Müller for milk delivery, reducing its reliance on milk to less than 1pc of revenues.
Latest company results show it turned over £1.5bn last year and made a £62m pre-tax profit.

Erdoğan had already made the comparison between Netanyahu and the Nazi leader in late December when speaking about Israel's response to Hamas and other militants, who massacred people in Israel in a surprise October 7 attack.
More than 1,200 people in Israeli communities near the border with the Gaza Strip were killed and some 240 were taken hostage.
Israel has retaliated with a massive bomb and ground campaign in Gaza.
Hamas authorities in Gaza said on Friday that more than 24,000 Palestinians have now been killed there as a result of the war.
Erdoğan contended that Western countries remained silent in face of Israel ""brutally murdering...children, babies, and women"" in Gaza.
""They were content to simply watch the barbarities that amount to genocide by today's Führer Netanyahu and his team, blinded by blood and hate,"" Erdoğan told a naval platforms delivery ceremony in the Western province of Yalova.

“We have to take into account that Vladimir Putin will one day even attack a Nato country,” said Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister.
“Our experts expect a period of five to eight years in which this could be possible,” he told Der Tagesspiegel, a German newspaper. “At the moment I don’t think a Russian attack is likely.”
Europe is dealing with a “military threat situation … that has not existed for 30 years,” he added. “We hear threats from the Kremlin almost every day – most recently against our friends in the Baltics.”
The Baltic nations are taking steps to increase border security given those increased security concerns after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on Friday signed an agreement to build bunkers over the next few years to bolster the defences along their borders with Russia and Belarus, a staunch ally of Moscow.
Under the agreement, signed in Riga, the three countries will “construct anti-mobility defensive installations in the coming years to deter and, if necessary, defend against military threats”, the Estonian defence ministry in a statement.
The plan, and Mr Pistorius’s comments, came the day after a top Nato military official warned that civilians in the West must prepare for the possibility of all-out war with Russia in the next 20 years, and be ready to mobilise if necessary.
While various militaries are primed for the outbreak of war, the general public must also be ready for a conflict that would mean a wholesale change in their lives, said Adml Bauer, a Dutch naval officer who chairs the Nato military committee.
“We have to realise it’s not a given that we are in peace,” he said. “And that’s why we [Nato] are preparing for a conflict with Russia.
“But the discussion is much wider. It is also the industrial base and also the people that have to understand they play a role.”
Finland, which became Nato’s latest member when it joined last April, does not see any immediate military threat from Russia, the country’s prime minister said on Friday. “I don’t see any immediate military threat from Russia against Finland,” Petteri Orpo said. “We in Finland sleep peacefully at night, because we are well prepared.”
Concerns over global peace have grown, too, as the Israel-Hamas war continues and has begun to spill over in the Middle East.
With Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine approaching its two-year anniversary, global stockpiles of weapons and ammunition have been whittled down significantly.
Adml Bauer warned that more preparation is needed now to ensure there aren’t shortages of materiel in the future.
“You need to be able to fall back on an industrial base that is able to produce weapons and ammunition fast enough to be able to continue a conflict if you are in it,” he said.
The EU has been unable to deliver on plans to send one million 155mm artillery shells to Kyiv by Februrary, impacting the ability for the Ukrainian military to return fire against the Russians.
Meanwhile, in Washington, US support for Ukraine has ground to a halt in the face of mounting opposition from Republicans.
Europe, said Adm Bauer, must be ready to defend itself if it can no longer count on the US for support.
“We have a nuclear shield with the Americans and the French have the ‘force de frappe’,” Mr Pistorius said, referring to the French nuclear deterrent. “There are no signs that the nuclear shield will evaporate or be dismantled. If this threatens to happen, we as Europeans must deal with it together.”

Flat terrain and lots of drones mean defenders see the tanks coming, an expert told BI.
Ukraine stopped attempting such attacks, while Russia persisted despite frequent defeats.
Neither Russia nor Ukraine has been able to pull off successful tank assaults — and there is a clear reason.
The flat terrain and number of drones in the sky make it too hard to surprise the other side, an expert told Business Insider.
Riley Bailey, a Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War think tank, said the attacks were unlikely to work without surprise.
""A lot of mechanized maneuver warfare on some level rests upon surprise on being able to rapidly advance and catch your enemy off guard,"" he said.
""By all indications, along the current front line, that's not really possible.""
One reason is the flat landscape in eastern and southern Ukraine — there is nowhere to conceal columns of armored vehicles.
In some areas ""it's all flat and you can see anyone coming from kilometers away,"" Bailey said.
Another reason is that there are so many drones in the sky.
Both Russia and Ukraine are relying heavily on both surveillance and attack drones, with soldiers describing skies full of them during some battles.
Surveillance drones are used to watch the enemy, and often provide targeting data for artillery and other long-range weapons.
The attack drones are weapons themselves, which have in some cases damaged and disabled armored vehicles and tanks.
Both Russia and Ukraine have experienced losses when trying to use columns of tanks and armored vehicles.
But Russia has experienced it on a much wider scale, repeatedly seeing big losses, while Ukraine pivoted away from the strategy much faster, Bailey said.
Russian tank defeats took place in Bucha in 2022, in Vuhledar in early 2023, and repeatedly in the eastern town of Avdiivka around the end of 2023.
Russia and Ukraine are still fighting for Avdiivka, which has become one of the war's hot spots.
Russia's losses there included 44 tanks in a single day, according to Ukraine. US intelligence said in December that Russia had lost more than 220 tanks and 13,000 men at Avdiivka since it launched an offensive there in October.
Ukraine, meanwhile, saw big vehicle losses at the start of its counteroffensive in the summer, but it changed tactics quickly, Bailey said. No reports of any mass Ukrainian tank and vehicle losses have emerged since.
The lack of any vehicle and tank breakthroughs, and the difficulty both sides have with trying to surprise each other, has contributed to the grinding nature of the battle, where neither side is making any big breakthroughs.
Heavy defenses laid by Russia, including minefields, have also helped keep the battlefield static. Ukraine says its allies are not sending the weapons it needs to achieve a breakthrough.

According to Forbes, a Kh-59 air-launched guided missile costs US$500,000, so four such missiles cost US$2 million.
The price of a Kh-31P air-launched guided missile, according to Forbes, is US$500,000, so the total cost of the missiles launched is US$1 million.
The cost of a Kh-22 missile is estimated at US$1 million, which means that the total cost of the missiles launched is US$6 million.
The price of an S-300 anti-aircraft missile is at least US$2 million, so the total cost of launched missiles of this type is US$14 million.
The price of a Kh-47M2 Kinzhal aeroballistic missile is US$10 million, and the total cost of missiles launched is US$60 million.
A Kh-101 missile costs US$13 million per unit, and the total amount of such missiles launched is US$156 million.

The military targets included logistical hubs, air defense systems and weapons storage and launching locations, they said.
President Joe Biden said the strikes were meant to demonstrate that the U.S. and its allies “will not tolerate” the militant group’s ceaseless attacks on the Red Sea. And he said the U.S. and its allies only made the move after attempts at diplomatic negotiations and careful deliberation.
“These strikes are in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea — including the use of anti-ship ballistic missiles for the first time in history,” Biden said in a statement. “These attacks have endangered U.S. personnel, civilian mariners, and our partners, jeopardized trade, and threatened freedom of navigation.”
Associated Press journalists in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, heard four explosions early Friday local time but saw no sign of warplanes. Two residents of Hodieda, Amin Ali Saleh and Hani Ahmed, said they heard five strong explosions hitting the western port area of the city, which lies on the Red Sea and is the largest port city controlled by the Houthis. Explosions also were heard by residents of Taiz, a southwestern city near the Red Sea.
The strikes marked the first U.S. military response to what has been a persistent campaign of drone and missile attacks on commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. And the coordinated military assault comes just a week after the White House and a host of partner nations issued a final warning to the Houthis to cease the attacks or face potential military action. The officials confirmed the strikes on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. Members of Congress were briefed earlier Thursday on the strike plans.
The warning appeared to have had at least some short-lived impact, as attacks stopped for several days. On Tuesday, however, the Houthi rebels fired their largest-ever barrage of drones and missiles targeting shipping in the Red Sea, with U.S. and British ships and American fighter jets responding by shooting down 18 drones, two cruise missiles and an anti-ship missile. And on Thursday, the Houthis fired an anti-ship ballistic missile into the Gulf of Aden, which was seen by a commercial ship but did not hit the ship.
In a separate statement, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the Royal Air Force carried out targeted strikes against military facilities used by the Houthis.
Noting the militants have carried out a series of dangerous attacks on shipping, he added, “This cannot stand. He said the U.K. took “limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defense, alongside the United States with non-operational support from the Netherlands, Canada and Bahrain against targets tied to these attacks, to degrade Houthi military capabilities and protect global shipping.”
The rebels, who have carried out 27 attacks involving dozens of drones and missiles just since Nov. 19, said Thursday that any attack by American forces on its sites in Yemen will spark a fierce military response.
“The response to any American attack will not only be at the level of the operation that was recently carried out with more than 24 drones and several missiles,” said Abdel Malek al-Houthi, the group’s supreme leader, during an hour-long speech. “It will be greater than that.”
The Houthis say their assaults are aimed at stopping Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But their targets increasingly have little or no connection to Israel and imperil a crucial trade route linking Asia and the Middle East with Europe.
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution Wednesday that demanded the Houthis immediately cease the attacks and implicitly condemned their weapons supplier, Iran. It was approved by a vote of 11-0 with four abstentions — by Russia, China, Algeria and Mozambique.
Britain’s participation in the strikes underscored the Biden administration’s effort to use a broad international coalition to battle the Houthis, rather than appear to be going it alone. More than 20 nations are already participating in a U.S.-led maritime mission to increase ship protection in the Red Sea.
U.S. officials for weeks had declined to signal when international patience would run out and they would strike back at the Houthis, even as multiple commercial vessels were struck by missiles and drones, prompting companies to look at rerouting their ships.
On Wednesday, however, U.S. officials again warned of consequences.
“I’m not going to telegraph or preview anything that might happen,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters during a stop in Bahrain. He said the U.S. has made clear “that if this continues as it did yesterday, there will be consequences. And I’m going to leave it at that.”
The Biden administration’s reluctance over the past several months to retaliate reflected political sensitivities and stemmed largely from broader worries about upending the shaky truce in Yemen and triggering a wider conflict in the region. The White House wants to preserve the truce and has been wary of taking action in Yemen that could open up another war front.
The impact on international shipping and the escalating attacks, however, triggered the coalition warning, which was signed by the United States, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Separately, the U.S. called on the United Nations Security Council to take action against the Houthis and warned their financier Iran that it has a choice to make about continuing to provide support to the rebels.
Transit through the Red Sea, from the Suez Canal to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, is a crucial shipping lane for global commerce. About 12% of the world’s trade typically passes through the waterway that separates Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, including oil, natural gas, grain and everything from toys to electronics.
In response to the attacks, the U.S. created a new maritime security mission, dubbed Operation Prosperity Guardian, to increase security in the Red Sea, Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden, with about 22 countries are participating. U.S. warships, and those from other nations, have been routinely sailing back and forth through the narrow strait to provide protection for ships and to deter attacks. The coalition has also ramped up airborne surveillance.
The decision to set up the expanded patrol operation came after three commercial vessels were struck by missiles fired by Houthis in Yemen on Dec. 3.
The Pentagon increased its military presence in the region after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel to deter Iran from widening the war into a regional conflict, including by the Houthis and Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria.

5QKFSJDPVH_K9WDR4ZBJWL9W21,South Korea: Pyongyang may send new models of tactical guided missiles to Russia,The Kyiv Independent news desk,"January 11, 2024 at 4:50 AM·2 min read",20240111,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/south-korea-pyongyang-may-send-105030031.html,"North Korea may sell Russia new types of tactical guided missiles, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik said in an interview with the Yonhap News Agency published on Jan. 11.
The news came amid reports that Russia is already using North Korean weapons to strike Ukraine.
A few days earlier, the White House confirmed media reports of North Korean missile shipments to Moscow, saying that Russia had already attacked Ukraine with them at least three times — on Dec. 30, Jan. 4, and Jan. 6.
The Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post reported that Moscow had received “several dozen ballistic missiles”, while Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) says it has no evidence that this had happened.
Shin drew links between North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un's recent visit to munitions factories and possible arms supplies to Russia amid deepening Russia-North Korean military cooperation.
The weapons system, unveiled by North Korean state media during Kim's most recent vist last week, appears to be close-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying tactical nuclear weapons.
Shin added that Pyongyang conducted its first test launch in April 2022, calling the missile “a new type of weapon with an estimated range of 100–180 kilometers.”
""North Korea said it will deploy (close-range ballistic missiles) with front line troops. Given the recent arms trade, (I think) North Korea could sell them to Russia,"" the South Korean Minister said, hinting at the possible sale of KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles to Russia.
The U.S. and nearly 50 allies published a joint statement on Jan. 9 condemning North Korea's alleged transfer of ballistic missiles to Russia and calling for an immediate end to the supply of weapons.
Along with reports of North Korean missiles being delivered to Russia, there have been reports of Moscow's plans to receive new missiles from Iran, which supplied kamikaze drones used by Russia for regular attacks on Ukraine.
Air Force spokesperson Yurii Ihnat said Ukraine could not confirm these reports.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - About two-thirds of Canadians surveyed this month said American democracy cannot survive another four years of Donald Trump in the White House, and about half said the United States is on the way to becoming an authoritarian state, a poll released on Monday said.
The November U.S. election is likely to pit President Joe Biden against Trump, who is the clear frontrunner to win the Republican nomination as voting in the presidential primary race kicks off in Iowa on Monday.
Sixty-four percent of respondents in the Angus Reid Institute poll of 1,510 Canadians said they agreed with the statement: ""U.S. democracy cannot survive another four years of Donald Trump."" Twenty-eight percent disagreed.
The Jan. 6, 2021 attack on Capitol Hill by Trump supporters seeking to block certification of Biden's 2020 election win shocked many Canadians, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly blamed Trump for inciting the mob.
Trump has vowed if elected again to punish his political enemies, and he has drawn criticism for using increasingly authoritarian language.
Three times as many Canadians say a Biden victory would be better for Canada's economy (53%) than a Trump win (18%), according to the poll which was seen exclusively by Reuters. The poll, taken between Jan. 9-11, had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points
Forty-nine percent of people said the United States is on the way to becoming an authoritarian state and 71% of Canadians say the concept that the rule of law applies equally to everyone is weakening in the United States.
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment
about the poll.
""What we're seeing is people quite alarmed about the prospect of a return of Donald Trump,"" said Shachi Kurl, president of Angus Reid Institute.
The polling is also ""an indictment"" of ""how poorly Canadians now view the democratic institutions and the checks and balances that in the past people on both sides of the border took for granted,"" she added.
American allies around the world and financial markets are watching the election with unease given the isolationism and the protectionist trade policies of Trump's presidency. Because of their proximity and economic ties, Canadians have more at stake than most countries.
Two-thirds of Canada's 40 million people live within 100 km (62 miles) of the U.S. border, and the trade relationship with the United States is of existential importance to Canada.
Three-quarters of all exports go to the southern neighbor, and half of its imports come from the United States, including 60% of all imported fresh vegetables.
""One can make the argument that there's no country that would be more negatively affected by a Trump win than Canada,"" said Kim Nossal, a professor of political studies at Queen's University in Kingston and author of ""Canada Alone: Navigating the Post-American World"".
In his first term, Trump forced the renegotiation of the North American trade pact and clashed with Trudeau, who he once called ""very dishonest and weak"".
Trump's ""mercantilist view involves thinking of Canada and every other so-called friend of the United States as no friend at all, but just a bunch of free-riders sucking off the wealth of the United States,"" Nossal said. ""He is the ultimate protectionist.""
There is a provision in the new North American trade pact that requires it to be reviewed for renewal after six years, or during the next American president's term in 2026.

""Let us not forget this (...) People need peace, the world needs peace,"" the pope said after the weekly Angelus prayer.
In the prayer, he urged people not to forget those suffering due to the ""cruelty of war"" in several parts of the world. He has repeatedly called for peace in Ukraine and in the war in Gaza.
""Let us pray that those who have power over these conflicts reflect on the fact that war is not the way to resolve them, as it sows death among civilians and destroys cities and infrastructure,"" the pope said.

6MEDZFX11R_R9CNUKEFF9PNSVZ,Father of American teen killed in West Bank by Israeli fire rails against US support for Israel,JULIA FRANKEL and NASSER NASSER,"January 21, 2024 at 2:15 AM·4 min read",20240120,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/father-american-teen-killed-west-181550155.html,"AL-MAZRA'A ASH-SHARQIYA, West Bank (AP) — The father of an American teen killed by Israeli fire in the occupied West Bank railed against Washington's military support for Israel, as hundreds of mourners buried the 17-year-old in the family's ancestral Palestinian village Saturday.
The death of Tawfiq Ajaq on Friday drew an immediate expression of concern from the White House and a pledge from Israeli police to investigate.
It was the latest fatal shooting in the West Bank, where nearly 370 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza more than three months ago. The Biden administration has repeatedly expressed concern about violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in recent months.
During Saturday's funeral, the teen's father criticized the long-standing U.S. support for Israel. “They are killer machines,” he said of Israeli forces. “They are using our tax dollars in the U.S. to support the weapons to kill our own children.”
Tawfiq Ajaq was born and raised in Gretna, Louisiana, near New Orleans, relatives said. His parents brought him and his four siblings to the village of Al-Mazra’a Ash-Sharqiya last year so they could reconnect with Palestinian culture.
On Saturday, crowds of Palestinians pulsed through village streets, following men who held aloft a stretcher with the teen's body, wrapped in a Palestinian flag.
Hafez Ajaq implored Americans to “see with their own eyes” the ongoing violence in the West Bank.
“The American society does not know the true story,” he said. “Come here on the ground and see what’s going on. ... How many fathers and mothers have to say goodbye to their children? How many more?”
The circumstances of the shooting remained unclear.
Ajaq's relative, Joe Abdel Qaki, said that Ajaq and a friend were having a barbecue in a village field when he was shot by Israeli fire, once in the head and once in the chest.
Abdel Qaki said he arrived at the field shortly after the shooting and helped transport Ajaq to an ambulance. He said Israeli forces briefly detained him and other Palestinians at the scene, asking for their IDs before the men could get to Ajaq.
He said Ajaq died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital.
Israeli police said they received a report Friday regarding a “firearm discharge, ostensibly involving an off-duty law enforcement officer, a soldier and a civilian.” Police did not identify who fired the shot, though it said the shooting targeted people “purportedly engaged in rock-throwing activities along Highway 60,"" the main north-south thoroughfare in the West Bank.
Al-Mazra’a Ash-Sharqiya is located just east of the highway.
Police said the incident would be investigated. Investigations of those involved in fatal shootings of Palestinians by Israel's police and military have rarely yielded speedy results, and indictments are uncommon.
Asked about the shooting, U.S. national security spokesman John Kirby said that officials at the White House were “seriously concerned about these reports.”
“The information is scant at this time. We don’t have perfect context about exactly what happened here,” Kirby said. “We’re going to be in constant touch with counterparts in the region to — to get more information.”
Since Oct. 7, when Hamas staged its deadly attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostage, Israeli forces have clamped down on suspected militants in the West Bank, carrying out near nightly arrest raids.
The Palestinian Health Ministry says 369 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7. Most of the Palestinians were killed during shootouts in the West Bank that the Israeli military says began during operations to arrest Palestinian gunmen. In several documented instances, Israeli forces and settlers have killed Palestinians who witnesses report were not engaged in violence.
The U.S. has given military and diplomatic support to Israel's war on Hamas, but has urged Israel to scale back the intensity of its attacks. Nearly 25,000 Palestinians have been killed so far in Israel's offensive, Gaza health officials said.
Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek those territories for a future independent state.

The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia was developing relations with ""our partner"" North Korea, Reuters reported. The comment came as a delegation led by North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui arrived in Moscow on Sunday and will spend Monday through Wednesday for talks, according to North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova confirmed Choe’s meeting with her Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Choe's visit would include discussions about the agreements reached between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they met at Russia's Vostochny satellite launch center last year.

The spokesperson accused North Korea and Russia of ""maintaining illegal cooperation activities, including arms exchanges"" following Kim’s visit to Russia in September, when he met with Putin.
The United States and South Korea have officially claimed North Korea is providing Russia with weaponry, including artillery and missiles, to help refill its supplies drained by its war in Ukraine. In return, North Korea allegedly receives technological and military insights.
The Biden administration also claims it has evidence that missiles used by Russia in Ukraine were provided by North Korea.
In a joint statement last week, the U.S., South Korea and their partners criticized the alleged partnership, saying the missiles support Russia’s war.
Both Russia and North Korea have denied arms transfers to Russia.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova in a statement noted that the two countries are part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a grouping that Russia helped found.
""It is regrettable that this is happening between friendly SCO countries, with which we are developing partnership relations. Further aggravation of the situation plays into the hands of those who are not interested in peace, stability and security in the region,"" said Zakharova.

More than one thousand migrants have entered Finland through its eastern border in recent months, creating an opportunity for recruitment.

""A person can be persuaded to cooperate in various ways, for example by exerting pressure or by linking a request for cooperation to the conditions of leaving the country or by promising money,"" SUPO said.
Although this is not a widespread phenomenon, the Border Guard Service believes that there may be thousands of people in Russia near the Finnish border who are willing to cross the border illegally.
Criminals, members of criminal organizations, soldiers disguised as civilians, and other people who might pose a threat to national security could be among those who have already entered Finland illegally, according to the Central Criminal Police (CCP).

However, it is unclear whether these individuals have been uncovered, since the large number of migrants has complicated and delayed their identification.
On Nov. 30, Finland closed all checkpoints along its border with Russia in response to a significant increase in undocumented third-country nationals seeking asylum at the border with the help of Russian border guards
More than 800 migrants from countries like Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen entered Finland via Russia in recent weeks, the country's Border Guard Service reported earlier.
Previously, the average flow of migrants was less than one per day.
Finnish President Sauli Niinistö believes that an artificial migration crisis at the Finnish-Russian border organized by Moscow is part of a ""broader picture"" and is a way for the Kremlin to destabilize the West, Yle reported on Dec. 2.
Norway could support the Finnish government's decision and also close its border crossing with Russia, Norwegian Minister of Justice Emilie Enger Mehl said earlier. Estonia made a similar statement a day later.

Estonia may close border crossing points with Russia ""very swiftly"" due to a significant increase in the number of people crossing since Finland began blocking the border with Russia, Eve Kalmus, head of the Estonian Boarder Guard Directorate, told Yle on Dec. 2.
The Narva checkpoint in Estonia sawa surge in traffic after Finland closed its border crossings with Russia. About 1,000 more people crossed the Estonian-Russian border as compared to before.
The increase is almost entirely due to traffic from Finland to Russia.

The woman used public transportation to travel to various settlements in the region, including Kurakhove, Myrnohrad, Selydove, Novohrodivka, and Mykhailivka, in order to identify and record Ukrainian positions. She then transmitted this information to her Russian handlers in the form of text messages and electronic map notations via an anonymous messaging app. In return, she received monetary ""rewards"" on her bank card.
The enemy used the information to plan military operations, in particular rocket and artillery attacks on Ukrainian troops. However, the SBU’s prompt actions against the suspected traitor allowed them to secure Ukrainian military positions and transportation routes, the SBU said.

“We hear threats from the Kremlin almost every day... so we have to take into account that Vladimir Putin might even attack a Nato country one day,” Mr Pistorius said.
While a Russian attack is not likely “for now,” he added: “Our experts expect a period of five to eight years in which this could be possible.”

Protests in support of a jailed rights activist in Russia have spread to a regional capital, according to Russian local media, writes Lily Shanager.
At least seven people have reportedly been arrested at the demonstration in Ufa, the capital of the Bashkortostan republic.
This is the third protest in a week in support of Fail Alsynov, who was sentenced on Wednesday to four years in a penal colony for inciting ethnic hatred – a charge he denies.
His supporters say the charge is retribution for Mr Alsynov’s activism in defence of the Bashkir people and outspoken criticism of military mobilisation in the region.
Britain’s new security agreement with Kyiv is a “game-changer” that strikes at the heart of the “Russian empire”, a Ukrainian spy chief has said.
Oleksandr Lytvynenko, head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, said the move would bring Ukraine into the “Western security space” and pave the way for Nato membership.
He wrote in The Economist: “This was the third agreement of its kind between a former Soviet republic and another country. The first two... have had some impact on the South Caucasus but were not game-changers.
“The agreement between Ukraine and Britain could prove much more significant. It is the first of its kind to touch the core of the former Russian empire; Mr Putin considers Ukraine to be an integral part of “historical” Russia.
“It is the first between Ukraine and a major power which enshrines emerging geopolitical reality in a legal agreement.”
The pact sets out the intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training that Britain will provide for Ukraine, and pledges to lend “swift” support in the event of another Russian invasion.
One senior Nato official believes we could be at war with Russia within the next 20 years. Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, thinks it could take less than half that time.
But Nato has been riven by rows between member states, only a handful of whom actually meet the defence spending target.
And the commitment of its most powerful member, an increasingly isolationist US, is looking uncertain. Is Nato ready for a war with Russia?
A Ukrainian drone has caused a huge fire to break out at a Russian oil depot in the Bryansk border region.
Footage published on social media shows thick black smoke pouring into the sky from the inferno, apparently caused when four oil tankers were set alight.
More than a dozen fire engines rushed to extinguish the fire in the town of Klintsy, where residents have been evacuated, on Friday morning. Separate footage from Alexander Bogomaz, the regional governor, shows fire crews vainly attempting to contain the blaze.
Early reports indicated there were no casualties, although Baza – a Russian Telegram channel with links to the security services – said one person was injured.
Ukraine’s intelligence directorate took credit for the strike, saying the move would give troops breathing space amid pressure across the front line while hampering Russia’s supply chain.

Measures believed to be under discussion include more trade restrictions and clamping down on Moscow’s ability to evade sanctions through third-party countries and companies within the bloc.
A 61-year-old retired airline pilot has been jailed for over eight years in prison after allegedly planning to join the Ukrainian army.
Igor Pokusin, who was born in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, was charged with “treason” based on wiretapped calls with relatives in Ukraine, rights groups said.
Prosecutors alleged that Mr Pokusin, who according to local media suffers from multiple health problems, planned to travel to Ukraine to “fight against the Russian army”.
Mr Pokusin denies the claims. He has previously served a six-month sentence for pouring paint on a pro-army banner in March 2022 and writing the words “Glory to Ukraine” in a Siberian museum.
Emergency services have failed to bring the fire at an oil depot in western Russia under control, which is now more than three times its original size.
Russian state media reports that the blaze now covers some 1,800 square metres.
Ukraine’s foreign minister has urged allies to “strangle” Russia’s arms production by closing loopholes in their sanctions regimes.
Dmytro Kuleba claimed Moscow had circumvented bans on the exports of military goods via “dual use” goods containing parts that can be used for arms.
“The West must get serious about strangling Russia’s ability to produce weapons,”  he said in a social media post.
“Up to 95 per cent of the foreign-produced critical components found in Russian weapons destroyed in Ukraine come from Western countries.”
Russia has moved its remaining A-50 spy planes back into its territory in a bid to protect them for Ukrainian attacks, according to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).
It comes after Kyiv shot down one of the £235 million surveillance aircraft last week as it patrolled the Sea of Azov region.
The MoD noted that another A-50 has now been sighted over Russia’s Krasnodar region. “This activity is highly indicative of a reduced risk appetite for the airframes and an attempt to preserve remaining A-50 MAINSTAY at a loss to its overall effectiveness over Ukraine,” it said.
Known as the “flying radar”, the Soviet-designed planes can detect ground targets for up to 186 miles and hunt down jets and missiles from up to 400 miles away.

With Russian forces stuck in a stalemate on the front lines in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin is facing a drain on the Kremlin coffers that threaten to sink his war machine.
Russia’s oil and gas revenues have plummeted by 37pc in just one year, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).
A combination of falling prices and Western sanctions are driving Putin’s revenues steadily down even though he is pumping more oil, the report says.

Ukraine’s intelligence directorate says it struck a Bryansk oil depot to give its troops breathing space as Russia ramps up pressure across the front line.
In a statement given to RBC-Ukraine, the GUR said: “Such events regularly occur at military facilities on the territory of the aggressor state.
“It is clear that when it comes to an oil depot that is involved in the supply of fuel and lubricants... this complicates logistics for the occupiers. This disrupts supply schedules, security schedules.
“Accordingly it provides additional opportunities, spare time and increases the room for manoeuvre for our defenders.”
Vladimir Putin could declare war on Nato in less than a decade, Germany’s defence minister has claimed.
Boris Pistorius made the comments to Der Tagesspiegel, a German newspaper, after a top Nato official warned of an all-out war with Russia breaking out within 20 years.
News agency AFP reports that Ukrainian security sources have claimed credit for the attack on the Bryansk oil depot. Ukrainian media made similar claims earlier this morning.
A former Ukrainian prime minister has been indicted on charges of advocating for the overthrow of the Ukrainian constitution and justifying Russia’s invasion, according to reports.
Mykola Azarov, who was in office from 2010 until the EuroMaidan revolution in 2014, now lives in Russia, regularly promoting Kremlin talking points on state propaganda channels.
“Prosecutors have submitted to court an indictment in the criminal proceedings against the former prime minister of Ukraine,” the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office said.
Lord Cameron has warned against a 1930s-style appeasement of Vladimir Putin – as Poland condemned “pocket Chamberlains” who it said were willing to sell out Ukraine.
On Thursday, the Foreign Secretary urged Britain’s allies not to push for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow, arguing that unifying behind Ukraine was ultimately the best way to end the war.
His comments came after reports that European and American officials have been pushing Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, to consider peace talks with Russia amid concerns that the conflict has reached a stalemate.

A Russian drone operator known as “Moses” who claimed the lives of hundreds of Ukrainian troops has been killed in an airstrike, according to reports.
Pro-Russian military bloggers uploaded drone footage of the fatal explosion in Krynky, a village in the southern Kherson region.
Posts on the “Moses” Telegram channel, apparently uploaded by family members, say his death was confirmed by his wife. “Dear comrades, even we (relatives) do not know any other information except that he died,” one message adds.
One blogger, Romanov, refers to the drone operator as “one of the best”, claiming he had killed 498 Ukrainian soldiers and destroyed 31 boats.
Kyiv’s grip on a Dnipro River bridgehead is slipping as troops are ground down by Russian assaults, the Financial Times reports.
A Ukrainian reconnaissance soldier claims they are taking heavy casualties while holding the position on the river’s east bank, which they established in November last year. Russia is said to outnumber them at least five-to-one.
Ukraine is further hamstrung because it cannot transport heavy weapons across the river on the small boats troops use to stay undetected.
The Russian parliament intends to formally question France’s National Assembly on claims that French mercenaries have been fighting for Ukraine.
Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of the State Duma, announced the move after the Kremlin said on Wednesday that its forces had killed dozens of foreign guns-for-hire – mostly French citizens – in a missiles strike.
It did not provide evidence to support its claim. France has denied the allegations, insisting it has no mercenaries in Ukraine “unlike certain others”.
Ukraine says its military has hit six targets in the last day using aircraft and missiles, striking “areas of concentration of personnel, weapons and enemy control points”.
One of them is presumably an oil depot in Bryansk, Russia, which was set ablaze in a drone attack this morning. There are not believed to be any casualties.
Russian troops are advancing across the front line and are concentrating their attacks on the Luhansk region, Radio Free Europe reports.
Citing a report from Ukraine’s general staff, it adds that Russian commanders are intent on capturing Sinkovka in Kharkiv, and are storming the village “without regard for losses”.
A drone attack on a Russian oil depot was coordinated by Ukraine’s military intelligence service, sources told RBC-Ukraine.
The publication reports that the defence ministry’s Main Directorate of Intelligence was responsible for the strike, and had also hit a gunpowder factory in Tambov.
Civilians must prepare for all-out war with Russia in the next 20 years, a top Nato military official has warned.
While armed forces are primed for the outbreak of war, private citizens need to be ready for a conflict that would require wholesale change in their lives, Adml Rob Bauer said on Thursday.
Large numbers of civilians will need to be mobilised in case of the outbreak of war and governments should put in place systems to manage the process, Adml Bauer told reporters after a meeting of Nato defence chiefs in Brussels.

Russia shot down two more drones over the Bryansk region this morning, the local governor says.
Alexander Bogomaz said air defences had shot down the unmanned vehicles over the Pogarsky and Unechsky districts, adding that they did not cause any casualties or damage.
The third drone has caused a large fire to break out at an oil depot in the Klintsovsky district.
A reported Ukrainian drone strike on a Bryansk oil depot has caused a fire that extends for “one thousand square metres”, according to Russian state media. Four oil tanks are burning.
A prominent military think tank has authenticated claims that a Ukrainian air strike sank a Russian warship near Sevastopol last month.
Atesh, the Ukrainian resistance movement, said on Thursday it had uncovered a sunken Tarantul-class corvette in occupied Crimea while undertaking reconnaissance.
It speculated that the vessel had been struck several weeks ago by Kyiv’s maritime drones, adding: “The Russians lost another important weapon in the Black Sea. For which we congratulate everyone.”
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a US think tank, has now confirmed the claim using satellite imagery of the coordinates provided by the group, finding that the ship sank between December 28 and 31. Russian and Crimean officials have previously said the attacks had been repelled.
Despite its lack of naval power, Ukraine has inflicted a series of humbling blows on Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, which was forced to withdraw the bulk of its ships from the Crimean capital in October.

A transgender woman is suing the City of New York for $22 million after she was placed in a Rikers Island male detention center, where she was allegedly assaulted and harassed.
Ali Miles, who goes by Dylan, was held at Rikers Island from June 14, 2022, to July of the same year. She was later transferred to Arizona.
Miles was charged with a slew of crimes in June 2022, including felony-level stalking, making a false report of a crime and aggravated harassment.
Miles is suing the New York City Department of Correction, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation and a handful of individuals for the treatment she received in the prison, which allegedly included rape, physical assault and harassment.

The lawsuit references the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) of 2003, which seeks to mitigate and eradicate rape incidents in correctional facilities.
The lawsuit document, which was filed in August 2023 and obtained by Fox News Digital on Saturday, establishes that Miles was born a biological man, but identifies as a transgender woman.
""Miles wears women’s clothing and in all appearance expresses as a person of the female gender,"" the lawsuit states.
According to the lawsuit, Miles was ""placed in a men’s housing unit despite her objections, court orders, and her requests to be housed with women."" Miles' attorney also claims that the defendants ""delayed and denied her access to healthcare.""

""[Miles] was raped/sodomized on two (2) separate occasions by the same male inmate, was assaulted and battered by the same male assailant causing fractured ribs, and suffered permanent blindness as the result of being doused in the face with chemicals,"" the document says. ""All of this caused her painful and longlasting harm.
""Defendants’ unlawful conduct was a direct result of [Rikers'] pervasive, practices, and customs of discrimination, deliberate indifference, against transgender people.""
Miles' lawyer also argued that New York authorities ""ignored her repeated pleas for help and for protection from the threats and sexual victimization to which they had exposed her.""

According to the lawsuit, a corrections officer told Miles that ""We don't do the trans thing here"" — which the lawsuit argues is a violation of civil rights law.

The man died later, police say.
Representatives from the Maryland Attorney General’s office were present after the fatal shooting to investigate.
Around 11:25 a.m., officers responded to a 911 call regarding a domestic disturbance involving a man with a gun at a hotel on the 400 block of Reisterstown Road, said Joy Stewart, Baltimore County Police spokesperson, at a news conference Tuesday.
When officers arrived, they were told the man left on foot. As officers searched the area, they found the man with his gun inside the BP gas station on the 500 block of Reisterstown Road, Stewart said.
When officers approached the man in the gas station, he pointed his weapon at the officers, Stewart said. As a response, officers created a barricade outside and waited until he left the gas station, Stewart said.
When the man exited the gas station, he “engaged” the officers, Stewart said at the news conference. Three officers, who were wearing body cameras, fired at the man, and the suspect was shot in turn, Stewart said.
Police later declined to say what they meant by “engaged,” stating that the events leading up to the shooting are under investigation by the Attorney General’s office’s Independent Investigations Division. That office said in a news release that police fired their weapons after the man exited the store, and it did not respond to a request seeking clarification on what the police department meant.
After officers tried to provide medical aid to the man, he was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Stewart said. Officers recovered the gun, and there were no officers or bystanders injured from the shooting, she said.
Investigators toiled around a BP gas station on the 500 block of Reisterstown Road, where they placed evidence markers between gas pumps cordoned off by crime scene tape, while more Baltimore County officers blocked off the nearby Howard Johnson by Wyndham hotel. Cars hurried through the rain, beeping at one another as they merged away from cones surrounding the shooting scene.
The Independent Investigations Division of the Office of the Attorney General will investigate the shooting, and the officers involved are on administrative leave. The office said Tuesday night that the names of the deceased and the officers involved are generally released within 48 hours of a death, and the body camera footage within 20 days."

He said this during a joint press conference with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.
Ukraine's head of state arrived in Latvia earlier on Jan. 11 as the final step in his tour of the Baltic countries.
""Today I also informed the president of Ukraine about the next aid package, which includes howitzers, 155 mm ammunition, anti-tank weapons, rockets, grenades, helicopters, drones, communication devices, generators, as well as (other) equipment,"" Rinkevics said.
A staunch supporter of Ukraine against Russian aggression, Latvia committed over 1% of its gross domestic product to military assistance for Kyiv, one of the highest shares of all the allies.
""I am grateful to Latvia for the latest military aid package for Ukraine and a clear understanding that the strength of Ukrainian warriors, positions, and future is the strength that secures Latvia's independence as well,"" Zelensky said on the social media platform X.
Riga also undertook to lead a drone coalition, one of the several military capability coalitions formed to support Kyiv, Rinkevics noted.
The Latvian president further said that the prime ministers of Latvia and Ukraine will sign a memorandum on military cooperation and an intergovernmental assistance agreement later on Jan. 11.
As part of non-military assistance, Latvia's parliament voted to provide over 500 million euros ($547 million) for Ukraine's reconstruction over the next three years, focusing on Chernihiv Oblast, according to Rinkevics.
As part of his Baltic tour, Zelensky also visited Lithuania on Jan. 10 and Estonia a day later, receiving new pledges of long-term assistance from both countries. While Vilnius promised almost $220 million in the next three years, Estonia announced assistance of $1.3 billion until 2027.

No one was hurt and the ship is still afloat.
The attack appears to be in retaliation for last week’s air strikes by U.S. and United Kingdom military forces on Houthi targets in Yemen.
President Biden ordered the strikes to respond to Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) says Congress should have been consulted about the strike.
“It is Congress that has the right to declare war, not the president of the United States,” he said.
Houthi rebels say they will continue attacking the U.S. and other ships in the Red Sea until Israel ends its war on Hamas in Gaza.
But Israel says it will fight on, it’s been 100 days since Hamas’ attack on Israel.
“Israel has a right to respond to this horrific terrorist attack from Hamas,” Sanders added, but he’s been critical of Israel’s unrelenting attacks in Gaza.
“You do not have a right to go to war against an entire people, women and children,” he said.
Over the weekend, thousands gathered in the nation’s capital to call for an end to the fighting in Gaza. Palestinian authorities say 24,000 people have been killed.
Iowa Republican Joni Ernest (R-Iowa) warns that six Americans are still being held hostage by Hamas.
“They are being tortured. They have been raped. They have been denied medication, ” she said.

7E0KXJPIB7_CI1BM4AI4WCM1YB,FM calls for UK parliament recall over Yemen air strikes,BBC,"January 13, 2024 at 2:39 AM·4 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/fm-calls-uk-parliament-recall-104743273.html,"Scotland's first minister Humza Yousaf has called for the UK parliament to be recalled over the air strikes in Yemen.
The UK and US strikes against Houthi rebel sites have been described by Rishi Sunak as ""necessary and proportionate"" to protect the global shipping in the Red Sea.
The targeted strikes on military facilities took place overnight.
Humza Yousaf said there were ""significant questions"" to be asked and answered about military action.
Strikes on Houthis in Yemen self-defence, says PM
Follow live: US and UK strike Houthi rebel targets in Yemen
Chris Mason: Landmark moment for Sunak with Yemen strikes
He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""Let there be no equivocation that the SNP align ourselves with the UN security resolution, which is essentially calling for the Houthi rebels to stop their attacks in the Red Sea.
""But of course the UK's record on military intervention, particularly in the Middle East, is not a good one.
""Before action was taken, the correct and appropriate thing to have done would have been to have recalled parliament, who have given serious detail about any proposed military action.""
He added: ""There are significant questions around the action taken. What is the end goal? What will be deemed as a success?""
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said the strikes against the Iranian-backed group, who he accuses of threatening UK ships, was in ""self-defence"".
In response, Houthi officials have warned that the UK and US will ""pay a heavy price"".
The US-led strikes are the first against the Houthi militia since it started targeting international shipping in the Red Sea last year.
The Houthis control much of Yemen and say they are supporting Hamas by targeting ships heading to Israel.
More than 60 targets at 16 locations used by the Houthi rebels in Yemen were struck, the US Air Force said.
Mr Sunak accused the Houthi rebels of threatening UK and international ships and causing major disruption to the trade route.
""Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week, "" the prime minister said.
""This cannot stand. The United Kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade.""
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Royal Air Force typhoons conducted two precision strikes on Houthi sites, including an airfield used to launch drones and missiles over the Red Sea and another site used to launch attack drones.
Responding to the attacks, a Houthi leader warned the US and UK will ""soon realise"" that the strikes on Yemen were ""the greatest folly in their history"".
The group maintains they will continue attacking ships in the Red Sea heading to or associated with Israel.
Meanwhile, Mr Yousaf's wife, Nadia El-Nakla, has confirmed her sister-in-law and her four children had escaped Gaza.
Her brother is a doctor at Al-Nassar Hospital. He is still in the territory with other relatives.
Ms El-Nakla's parents returned to Scotland in November after being trapped in Gaza for four weeks when the war with Israel broke out during a family visit.
In a statement she said: ""I'm pleased that my sister-in-law, Doaa, and their four children have escaped from Gaza, and are now safe.
""However, my brother Mohamed remains there along with my 93-year-old grandmother and many wider family members.""
British-Palestinians call for visa scheme for trapped relatives
What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?
Ms El Nakla, who is a Dundee councillor, said families in Gaza were ""still suffering after the loss of entirely innocent men, women and children"".
She urged the UK government to launch a resettlement scheme for Palestinians, similar to the Ukraine Family Scheme visa.
She added: ""I will continue to raise my voice to stop the killing and suffering of the innocent people of Gaza, and call for an immediate and urgent ceasefire.""
A UK government spokesperson said: ""Over 300 British nationals and their dependants have so far left Gaza, and we are working around the clock to get the rest of those out who want to leave.
""We have a team on the ground in Cairo and at the Rafah crossing as required to provide consular assistance.
""Any dependants of British citizens who need a visa can apply for one.
More than 23,350 people - mostly women and children - have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
During the initial Hamas attacks on Israel some 1,300 people were killed - mainly civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage."

Details: The search for a new PR agency in Ukraine in the autumn of 2023 set requirements that prohibited references to the war in PepsiCo's advertising activities, including:
mentioning war, hostilities, aggression, military personnel, the Ukrainian Armed Forces;
supporting Ukraine or the Ukrainian Armed Forces;
negative connotations, creating a sense of ""danger"".
At the same time, PepsiCo is still operating in the Russian market and paying taxes. The National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) reported that PepsiCo paid US$115 million in taxes to the Russian coffers. The company also has 20,000 employees and 40,000 agricultural workers in Russia.
Even though the company has formally stopped selling its main product, Pepsi Cola, it is still available on Russian shelves through what is known as ""parallel imports"".
Background: On 21 September 2023, wreckage from a downed Russian missile hit the territory of PepsiCo's plant and warehouse in the town of Vyshneve (Kyiv Oblast). The warehouse was partially destroyed.

“I confirmed to him that Switzerland is ready to organize a conference,” Amherd said during a joint press conference with Zelenskyy. “We have agreed that we will examine the details of the next steps in depth to ensure that the peace process is a success.”
The two presidents said the Ukrainian and Swiss teams will begin preparations for the Global Peace Summit in Switzerland as early as Tuesday. No details were provided about when or how such a summit could take place, and Russia hasn't been involved in the process.
“This summit is intended to infuse the necessary energy into everything that has already been achieved and to determine that the end of the war must be fair, and the restoration of the strength of international law – complete,” Zelenskyy said.
Talks of a peace summit come as Ukrainian military chiefs said Monday their forces had shot down a Russian early warning and control plane and a key command center aircraft, which if confirmed would be a feat for Ukraine in the almost two-year war.
On Sunday, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, took part in Swiss-hosted talks in Davos among dozens of national envoys about Zelenskyy's 10-point peace formula — which ultimately aims to feed into the possible peace summit.
As for who might attend, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was open “to all countries in the world that respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity ... So draw conclusions about whom we invite.”
He conveyed Ukraine’s strong desire for countries from the Global South to be present.
“It is important for us to show that the whole world is against the aggression of Russia and the whole world is for a fair peace,” Zelenskyy said. “If countries truly want the war to end, they will support our plan,” but added it was an “open plan” that would welcome proposals from other countries.
Switzerland, which has long touted its neutrality, has been at pains to strike the right balance over Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine that began in February 2022. The Swiss have lined up with European Union sanctions on Russian people and interests over the conflict.
Zelenskyy’s trip to Switzerland, where he also met with parliamentary leaders on Monday, includes a visit Tuesday to the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in the eastern town of Davos.
The meeting in Bern came hours after Amherd hosted Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang, who is also on his way to the elite gathering in Davos. It was not immediately clear whether he would meet Zelenskyy there.
Zelenskyy noted China's “significant role in the world” and said Kyiv “would very much like China to be involved in our (peace) formula and engaged in the (peace) summit.” However, he added, ""not everything depends on our will ... we hope that all civilized countries will be involved in the peace summit.”

Saudi Arabia, which has in recent months engaged in peace talks with Yemen's Houthis, was closely monitoring the situation with ""great concern,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.
""The kingdom emphasizes the importance of maintaining the security and stability of the Red Sea region, as the freedom of navigation in it is an international demand,"" the ministry added.
The Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group that controls much of Yemen after nearly a decade of war against a Western-backed and Saudi-led coalition, has emerged as a strong supporter of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in its war against Israel.
The group has been attacking commercial ships it says are linked to Israel or bound for Israeli ports.
The chief negotiator for the Houthis, Mohammed Abdulsalam, said on Thursday the group's attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea do not threaten its peace talks with Saudi Arabia.

Burkinabe international Ouattara was forced off with an ankle injury during Cherries’ 3-1 defeat away Tottenham Hotspur at the end of December, leaving doubts over his ability to compete in the Africa Cup of Nations.
However, Burkina Faso called up the 21-year-old, with Ouattara travelling to join up with his country in the Ivory Coast.
Ouattara was not listed in the matchday squad for their opening 1-0 win over Mauritania, but Burkina Faso boss Hubert Velud says that he will be available for their second match against group favourites Algeria this afternoon (2pm).
Asked about Ouattara, Iraola told the Daily Echo: “We don't exactly know the situation, once he's there.
“I hope he has recovered and he plays and we receive the player in very good form, he does as best as he can because he is someone important for the national team.
“But we really don't know his exact situation and how he how he feels.
“But I hope if the manager has said this that he's recovering well.”
Asked if Cherries contemplated rejecting the call up in order to allow Ouattara to fully recover from injury, Iraola replied: “I don't think the clubs have this power right now.
“If the national team calls you, you have to go.
“I think it's nothing else to think about. It works like this.”"

As international support for Kyiv softens, Zelensky arrived in Switzerland to reinvigorate confidence among allies and partners.
""I appreciate your willingness to hear answers to really important questions. When will the war end? Is the third world war possible? Is it time to negotiate with Putin?"" Zelensky opened his address to the forum.
Ukraine's head of state stressed that previous worries about escalation into a larger-scale war, which delayed resolute actions against Russia or vital military supplies for Ukraine, have proven void.
""Time was lost because of calls not to provoke escalation. Many of our most experienced warriors who have been fighting since 2014 have lost their lives,"" the president stressed.
""Every 'don't escalate' addressed to us sounded like 'you will win' to (Vladimir) Putin. We asked for new types of weapons, and in response, we heard: 'don't escalate.' But then the weapons arrived, and there was no escalation.""
Zelensky emphasized that Russia's aggression poses a threat not only to Ukraine but to the wider world, as evidenced by Moscow's actions in Syria and Africa. He also noted that all efforts to negotiate peace with Putin have failed, as the Kremlin's leader himself seeks war.
""In any violent confrontation, there is always a moment when the catastrophe can be stopped. Ukraine is such an opportunity,"" Zelensky said in his speech.
""And all of us in the free world must be steadfast in our aspirations, actions, and goals just as Putin is forthright in his doomed ambitions.""
Zelensky's speech comes at a critical time, as over $100 billion in EU and U.S. funds remain stalled by political infighting.
At the sidelines of the forum, Zelensky met a number of senior political leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, and U.S. Secretary of State to discuss future support.
Washington, Ukraine's leading military donor, warned that it had delivered its final military aid package to Kyiv unless Congress approves additional funding. The aid bill has yet to pass either chamber of the U.S. legislature as political disputes between the Republican and Democratic parties persist.
Talks with von der Leyen also came at an important moment. Zelensky said that the two leaders agreed to start screening Ukrainian legislation in preparation for the accession process, as the EU recently greenlighted admission negotations with Kyiv.
One unresolved issue remains the 50-billion-euro funding package for Ukraine, which is currently stalled by Hungary. The bloc's leaders are expected to reconvene on the matter on Feb. 1.
During his address, the president further said that now is the time to invest in just and stable peace.
""Every reduction in pressure on the aggressor adds years to the war. But every investment in the defender's confidence shortens the war.""

The president's visit to Davos was also an opportunity to meet face-to-face CEOs of the world's business and financial giants.
Prior to his address, Zelensky attended meetings with international business leaders, seeking to increase investment in Ukraine's reconstruction and industry.
""We need you in Ukraine to build, to reconstruct, to restore our lives,"" Zelensky told investors.
""Each of you can be even more successful with Ukraine.""
Kyiv sorely needs a financial boost as its infrastructure and economy continue to suffer under Russian aggression while Western funding simmers down.
The World Bank estimated that the total recovery cost for the coming years may amount to over $400 billion. One proposed way to collect these funds without burdening Ukraine's or its allies' budgets is confiscating Russian assets frozen on Western accounts.
Speaking at the forum, Zelensky called for a ""strong decision"" this year, which would allow Russian state and oligarchic assets to fund Ukraine's defense and reconstruction.
""Putin loves money above all else. The more billions he, his oligarchs, friends, and accomplices lose, the more he will regret starting this war.""
The U.S., with the support of the U.K., Japan, and Canada, are reportedly preparing viable options for confiscating Russian assets, which should be discussed during a G7 meeting in February.
Germany, France, Italy, and the EU expressed some reservations, fearing potential legal pitfalls, the Financial Times wrote.
U.S. Special Representative for Economic Recovery in Ukraine Penny Pritzker said during the forum on Jan. 15 that any decision on confiscation must be collective action and is unlikely to be taken quickly.
In his closing words in the address, Zelensky asked the forum's attendees to take part in building a just peace in Ukraine and invited them to the upcoming Global Peace Summit, which Switzerland agreed to host.
A day prior to the World Economic Forum, Davos hosted an advisory meeting on Ukraine's peace formula, a fourth such gathering in preparation for the summit.
""Today, our teams have already started work on organizing such a summit. Not the Third World War, but the Global Peace Summit.""

""After very positive experiences in various European markets, we are now also examining how we can set up our Group-owned retail branches more independently in Germany,"" the carmaker said in a written statement.
""A potential sale to experienced and renowned dealer groups is being evaluated and cannot be ruled out,"" it added.
According to Germany's Handelsblatt daily, which first reported the review, Mercedes-Benz's supervisory board is expected to approve the plans on Friday.
""Each branch will be examined individually and on a branch-specific basis,"" Mercedes-Benz said in its statement, ruling out the closure of branches as this was not the subject of review.
The review would concern 20 branches with 80 dealerships and 8,000 employees, the Handelsblatt reported, estimating each branch to be worth up to 40 million euros ($43.50 million).
Potential buyers must, among other things, bring ""automobile retail expertise"" to the table and hold on to job guarantees in Germany, the carmaker said.
""The aim is to secure the long-term sustainability of regional jobs as well as the existence and competitiveness of the branches.""
Mercedes-Benz has in previous years sold various showrooms in the UK, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Czech Republic.

The Hungarian MEPs questioned whether the “forced takeover of state-owned media, bypassing national laws” was compatible with the rule of law and the principles of media freedom and pluralism. They also doubted the Commission's commitment to ensuring consistent standards for all member states, regardless of their governments and political positions.
""We can all easily imagine what action the EU Commissioner for Transparency and Values, Vera Jourova, would have taken if this had happened in Budapest under the administration of Prime Minister Viktor Orban,"" their complaint reads.

The European Commission, which in recent years has been ""militant"" in demanding accountability for violations of the rule of law and press freedom in Hungary, is now allegedly ""silent"".
""You have three weeks to reply to the urgent written inquiry addressed to the European Commission, or six weeks in other cases,"" wrote the MEPs.
A petition was launched in the European parliament on Jan. 10 to strip Hungary of its voting rights in the EU Council for its continued attempts to block the unanimous decisions of the rest of Europe.
Article 7 of the EU Treaty allows for the possibility of suspending EU membership rights, particularly voting rights in the EU Council, if a country ""seriously and persistently"" violates the bloc's fundamental principles.
The EU has previously suspended funds to Hungary for failing to respect the rule of law.
However, the European Commission recently agreed to release one-third of the approximately 30 billion euros frozen for Hungary in order to garner Hungary’s support for Ukraine's accession to the EU.
During the vote on EU accession, Orban left the hall to avoid taking part. It was reported at the time that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had asked Orbán to go ""drink coffee outside the room.""

Efforts to push Budapest to lift its veto on the 50 billion euro aid package for Ukraine were less successful, and Hungary vetoed the aid package. The issue will be considered again in January 2024.
Orban wants the EU to pay all frozen funds to Budapest in return for the veto being lifted.

Mayor Vadim Kstenin said that some residents had been evacuated from their homes to a nearby school after debris sparked small fires and windows were shattered, adding: “The introduced state of emergency in the city will... allow for a prompt implementation of measures to replace them.”
Yelena Fedyainova, whose six-year-old boy was injured in one of the attacks, said the drones first struck on Tuesday morning at about 2.30am local time (11.30pm GMT Monday) and destroyed the window of her apartment. “There was a blow and a flash,” she said. “I grabbed the child - there were shards everywhere and smoke.”
The governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, announced that a girl aged around 10 was also injured when drone debris fell onto her apartment building. “The girl, born in 2013, suffered cut wounds to her arm, leg and neck. Medical assistance was provided at the scene,” he said in a statement.
Pictures distributed by Mr Gusev showed a blackened residential building, where the child was injured by fragments of a drone that was shot down.
The Russian defence ministry said it had destroyed five drones and intercepted three others overnight over the Voronezh region, and also intercepted four drones in the nearby Russian Belgorod region. Some of Russia’s border regions have announced voluntary evacuations over the strikes.
Voronezh, a city home to more than one million people, lies some 250 kilometres from the border with Ukraine. As the administrative centre of the region, it has a nearby air base where some Sukhoi Su-34s bombers are based. Russia often deploys these fighter-bomber aircraft during air strikes on Ukraine.
There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities. Kyiv has intensified its air attacks in recent months in what it says are strikes targeting Russian military infrastructure to undermine Moscow’s war efforts.
Earlier this month, Russia admitted it had accidentally bombed Voronezh but stressed there were no casualties.

85V50808AB_50NCUTXZCAD56XD,Former US officials to visit Taiwan for post-election talks,Reuters,"January 14, 2024 at 3:17 PM·2 min read",20240114,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/former-us-officials-visit-taiwan-071714299.html,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Two former senior U.S. officials will arrive in Taiwan on Sunday for post-election talks and underscore the U.S. government's ""longstanding interest"" in peace across the Taiwan Strait, the de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei said.
Lai Ching-te from Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential election on Saturday and will take office on May 20.
In a show of support for the government, a senior administration official said last week that President Joe Biden planned to send an unofficial delegation to the Chinese-claimed island.
The Biden administration has feared that the election, transition and new administration would escalate conflict with Beijing.
The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which handles relations in the absence of official diplomatic ties, said former National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley and former Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg would visit.
""As we have done previously following a Taiwan presidential election, the U.S. government has asked former senior officials to travel in their private capacity to Taiwan,"" AIT said, adding its U.S.-based Chair Laura Rosenberger would be accompanying.
""On Jan. 15, they will meet with a range of leading political figures and convey congratulations from the American people to Taiwan on its successful elections, support for Taiwan's continued prosperity and growth, and our longstanding interest in cross-Strait peace and stability.""
Two sources familiar with the trip, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media, told Reuters such a post-election visit by former senior U.S. officials was routine and not out of the ordinary.
Before the poll China repeatedly called Lai a dangerous separatist. China has stepped up its military and political pressure against Taiwan over the past four years.
Lai and current President Tsai Ing-wen reject Beijing's sovereignty claims and say only Taiwan's people can decide their future. Both have offered talks with China but been rebuffed.

She did, however, add that territorial disputes have to be resolved peacefully because “the world doesn’t need another crisis.""
Annalena Baerbock, who held talks with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and other top officials while visiting Manila, said Germany was ready to help de-escalate growing tensions.
She added that it was crucial to set up “mechanisms” to resolve the disputes peacefully and foster dialogue.
""There are truly rough winds blowing across the South China Sea and this is happening in the middle of one of the most dynamic economic regions of the world,” she told a news conference in Manila.
“It is now important to set up mechanisms to solve tensions together in a peaceful way,” she said without elaborating. “I think we all agree that the world doesn’t need another crisis. There are too many crises at once.”
In a symbolic gesture of Germany’s support for the Philippines, Baerbock visited the coast guard headquarters in Manila and boarded a patrol ship, where she briefly flew one of a number of surveillance drones that Germany donated to the Philippines.
Philippine coast guard officials said the drones would help the country defend its territorial interests in the South China Sea, enforce maritime laws and undertake search and rescue missions during accidents at sea.
Chinese officials have not yet issued a reaction.
The decades-long territorial dispute escalated last year between Beijing and Manila, sparking fears it could degenerate into a major conflict that could involve the United States - a longtime treaty ally of the Philippines.
Chinese coast guard ships and accompanying vessels used military-grade laser and water cannons against Philippine coast guard and supply vessels and undertook dangerous manoeuvres near disputed shoals, prompting the Philippines to file a large number of diplomatic protests against China, Philippine officials said.
The US has repeatedly warned it is obligated to defend the Philippines if its forces, aircraft and ships come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea. China has warned the US and its allies not to meddle with what it says is a purely Asian dispute and build up its forces in the region, warning of unspecified consequences.

China's actions in the South China Sea, which have led to minor collisions with Philippine vessels, are of concern to Germany and other European countries, Baerbock said, “because such risky manoeuvres violate rights and opportunities for economic development of your own country and other littoral states.”
“They also put into question the freedom of navigation and international law, affecting all countries worldwide,” she said, adding that China’s claims “are not covered by international law.”
The German foreign minister, the first to visit the Philippines in about a decade to bolster ties, cited a 2016 ruling by a United Nations-backed arbitration panel that invalidated China’s extensive territorial claims on historical grounds. China refused to participate in the arbitration, dismissed its ruling as a sham and continues to defy it.
Baerbock said the arbitration ruling was “crystal clear.”"
8GAXQ6XADK_IV8LQ9IDZLU23X7,Nauru cuts diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of China,Kelly Ng - BBC News,"January 15, 2024 at 8:24 AM·3 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/nauru-cuts-diplomatic-ties-taiwan-073434992.html,"One of Taiwan's last diplomatic allies has cut ties with the island in favour of Beijing, just days after a new president was voted in in Taipei.
Nauru, a tiny Micronesian island, was just one of 12 countries that kept diplomatic ties with Taipei.
But in recent years, Beijing - which insists Taiwan is part of China - has been poaching its diplomatic allies.
Taiwan suggests this latest loss is related to the weekend's election results, which angered China.
The election saw voters pick pro-sovereignty candidate William Lai as their next president, a man Beijing has labelled a ""troublemaker"" over remarks he made in the past supporting Taiwanese independence, which it sees as a red line.
""This timing is not only China's retaliation against our democratic elections but also a direct challenge to the international order,"" Taiwanese officials said after Nauru's government announced it would ""no longer recognise [Taiwan] as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China's territory"".
How China is poaching Taiwan's friends
Taiwan elects pro-sovereignty leader, angering Beijing
In a media conference on Monday, Taipei's deputy foreign minister Tien Chung-kwang accused China of taking advantage of recent ""political fluctuations"" in Nauru to ""buy over"" the country with financial aid.
""China thinks it can suppress Taiwan with such methods, I think it is wrong. The world has noticed Taiwan's democratic development. If [Beijing] continues to use such despicable methods to seize Taiwan's diplomatic relations, democratic countries all over the world will not recognise it,"" Mr Tien said.
Still, his ministry remains ""on strong alert"" to combat further moves from China to isolate Taiwan on an international stage, he said.
China - which sees the self-ruled island of 23 million as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - welcomed Nauru's decision.
""The decision of the government of Nauru to resume diplomatic relations with China fully demonstrates once again that the one-China principle is the will of the people and the trend of the times,"" China's foreign ministry said.
This is not the first time Nauru has cut ties with Taiwan, which considers itself distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders.
In 2002, Nauru made a similar diplomatic switch to China - it later restored relations with Taiwan in May 2005.
Analysts said the move by Nauru was not unexpected.
""The likelihood that Nauru would switch recognition from Taiwan to China has been on the cards for a while,"" said Anna Powles, associate professor in security studies at New Zealand's Massey University.
The speed at which Australia pursued a treaty offering climate refuge to Tuvalu citizens late last year reflected concerns that Tuvalu, another Pacific nation, was ""under pressure to switch recognition to China"", Ms Powles said.
""These concerns extended to Nauru,"" she said.
""China is always looking to erode Taiwan's influence, especially in the Pacific, where many small nations are looking for development gains,"" said Mihai Sora, a research fellow in the Pacific Islands Program at Lowy Institute, a think tank based in Australia.
""As Taiwan has fewer diplomatic allies around the world, each one becomes more important in its claim to sovereignty... And it is quite possible that China will continue to look for opportunities to erode that."""

Three of the four Arkansas representatives voted in favor of the continuing resolution’s passage, with a no vote made by Rep. Bruce Westerman.
Congressional leaders reach deal to avert government shutdown
While the Natural State representatives were not enthused by the CR’s passage, and the quartet all indicated they remained concerned with national borders and budget, ongoing issues for the House’s GOP majority.
Westerman defended his no vote by saying the debate on spending is ongoing but no closer to resolution.
“Today, I voted against the temporary spending bill passed by the House to extend the expiration dates for the appropriations process. This was the fourth continuing resolution voted on by the House in the past year,” Westerman said. “In September, we had the opportunity to pass a solution that would have kept the government open, secured the border, cut reckless government spending, and established a bicameral Fiscal Commission.”
Hunter Biden agrees to private deposition with Republicans after months of defiance
Rep. French Hill also referred border security and budget issues, but said they were a reason to pass the measure, saying they have always been core Republican issues.
“House Republicans are still negotiating conservative, common-sense policies to reflect in our final 2024 spending provisions, including securing our border and returning toward a balanced budget,” Hill said. “It is crucial that we keep our government open as we continue to work with the Senate and White House on passing government spending for this fiscal year, which is why I supported this bill.”
Speaker Johnson rejects hard-line tactics in move to avoid shutdown
Rep. Rick Crawford highlighted the frustration of working in a politically divided legislature against the importance of keeping the government open.
“Speaker Johnson is fighting hard for spending reductions but his hands are full. The final deal must have concurrence among the House, Senate and White House, the latter two of which, are controlled by the other party,” Crawford said. “Shutting down the government in this instance costs the taxpayers even more money – and that is interest-bearing debt we cannot afford.”
Rep. Steve Womack said a shutdown is not the answer to the problem and called the continuing resolution as “sad reality.”
“The continuing resolution is a sad reality of both the broken budget process and a divided government,” “Shutting down the government isn’t the answer,” Womack said, adding, “Voting to extend current funding levels to buy the time necessary to finish FY24 Appropriations was the only practical outcome. Trying to blame our nation’s $34 trillion debt on discretionary spending is intellectually dishonest.”
Congressional leaders reach deal to avert government shutdown
The resolution is identical to one passed earlier in the Senate and is expected to be signed into law by President Joe Biden. With its passage, government services such as military payroll and food distribution programs will remain in operation.

The predominantly older supporters of the nationalist conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) were gathered in front of the parliament building in Warsaw early Thursday evening.
They waved Polish flags and placards reading: ""This is Poland, not Tusk's country.""
PiS party leader Jarosław Kaczyński told the demonstrators: ""This is not a Polish government.""
The PiS frequently accuses Tusk, a former European Council president, of acting on behalf of Germany.
The ""Protest of Free Poles"" organized by the populists who were voted out of office in October was originally intended to voice anger at the restructuring of the public media system.
Tusk's government has begun reorganizing the TVP television channel, Polish radio and the PAP news agency - all of which the PiS had steadily brought under its control during its eight years in power.
However, the arrest this week of two former government ministers with the ousted PiS party who were sentenced to two years in prison on corruption charges has shifted the focus of the demonstration.
The arrest of former interior minister Mariusz Kamiński and his deputy Maciej Wąsik has driven Poland to the brink of a constitutional crisis.
The two politicians were arrested on Tuesday and taken to prison after initially seeking refuge with President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, in the presidential palace.
The PiS describes the two as ""political prisoners"" and Kamiński has gone on hunger strike.
Duda announced shortly before the start of the demonstration that he would try pardoning the pair for a second time."

8UFX5WR5R0_HZQ6W8IZLCXQPUC,White House says 'it's the right time' for Israel to scale back Gaza war as fighting hits 100 days,"JOSEF FEDERMAN, SAMY MAGDY and KAREEM CHEHAYEB","Updated January 14, 2024 at 11:01 PM·7 min read",20240114,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/fire-lebanon-kills-2-israeli-143550969.html,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The White House said Sunday that “it’s the right time” for Israel to scale back its military offensive in the Gaza Strip, as Israeli leaders again vowed to press ahead with their operation against the territory’s ruling Hamas militant group.
The comments exposed the growing differences between the close allies on the 100th day of the war.
Also Sunday, Israeli warplanes struck targets in Lebanon following a Hezbollah missile attack that killed two Israeli civilians — an older woman and her adult son — in northern Israel. The exchange of fire underscored concerns that the Gaza violence could trigger wider fighting across the region.
The war in Gaza, launched by Israel in response to the unprecedented Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, has killed nearly 24,000 Palestinians, devastated vast swaths of Gaza, driven around 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents from their homes and pushed a quarter of the population into starvation.
Speaking on CBS, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. has been speaking to Israel “about a transition to low-intensity operations” in Gaza.
“We believe it’s the right time for that transition. And we’re talking to them about doing that,” he said on “Face the Nation.”
Israel launched the offensive after the Hamas attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 others hostage. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead until Hamas is destroyed and all of the more than 100 hostages still in captivity are freed.
The war has sent tensions soaring across the region, with Israel trading fire almost daily with Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group and Iranian-backed militias attacking U.S. targets in Syria and Iraq. In addition, Yemen’s Houthi rebels have been targeting international shipping, drawing a wave of U.S. airstrikes last week.
Hezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said his group won’t stop until a cease-fire is in place for Gaza.
“We are continuing, and our front is inflicting losses on the enemy and putting pressure on displaced people,” Nasrallah said in a speech, referring to the tens of thousands of Israelis who have fled northern border areas.
In other developments, tens of thousands of people in Europe and the Middle East took to the streets Sunday to mark the 100th day of the war. Opposing demonstrations either demanded the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas or called for a cease-fire in Gaza.
In Israel, supporters of the hostages and their families wrapped up a 24-hour protest in Tel Aviv calling on the government to win their immediate release.
Late Sunday, Hamas released a short video in which three Israeli hostages, presumably speaking under duress, pleaded with their government to end the war and bring them home. It was not clear when the video was taken. At the end of the clip, Hamas said it would provide an update on their fate Monday.
Hamas has released several videos of this kind, in an apparent effort to pressure Israel to agree to its demand of ending the war ahead of negotiations on a possible release of all hostages in exchange for most or all Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE
The unprecedented level of death and destruction in Gaza has led South Africa to lodge allegations of genocide against Israel at the International Court of Justice. Israel denies the accusations and has vowed to press ahead with its offensive even if the court in The Hague issues an interim order for it to stop.
Israel has also been under growing international pressure to end the war in Gaza, but it has so far been shielded by U.S. diplomatic and military support. Israel argues that any cease-fire would hand victory to Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007 and is bent on Israel’s destruction.
“It’s been 100 days, yet we will not stop until we win,” Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Sunday.
But differences with the Americans have begun to emerge. During a visit to the region last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken renewed his calls on Israel to do more to reduce civilian casualties and increase the supplies of desperately needed humanitarian aid entering Gaza.
In recent weeks, Israel has scaled back operations in northern Gaza, the initial target of the offensive, where weeks of airstrikes and ground operations left entire neighborhoods in ruins.
Kirby, the White House spokesman, acknowledged that Israel had taken some “precursory steps” toward scaling back the offensive. But he said there was more to do.
“We’re not saying let your foot up off the gas completely and don’t keep going after Hamas,” he said. “It’s just that we believe the time is coming here very, very soon for a transition to this lower intensity phase.”
FEARS OF A SECOND FRONT
The deadly Hezbollah missile strike in northern Israel renewed concerns about a second front erupting into full-blown war.
It came shortly after the Israeli army said it killed three Lebanese militants who tried to infiltrate Israel.
Late Sunday, the Israeli military said it had struck Lebanon in response to the missile strike. Israeli officials said a woman in her 70s and her son, in his 40s, were killed in the town of Yuval.
The army’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Israel would not tolerate attacks on civilians.
“The price will be extracted not just tonight, but also in the future,” he said.
Yuval is one of more than 40 towns along Israel’s northern border evacuated by the government in October. Israeli media reported that the family stayed in the area because they work in agriculture.
Tensions have also spread to the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Palestinian health officials say nearly 350 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire in confrontations throughout the war.
On Sunday, the Israeli army said troops opened fire after a Palestinian car breached a military roadblock in the southern West Bank and an attacker fired at soldiers. Palestinian health officials said two Palestinians were killed.
Late Sunday, Palestinian health officials said two teenage boys were killed by Israeli fire. The army said it shot them after they threw a bomb at an army base.
ISRAEL STRIKES CENTRAL, SOUTHERN GAZA
Israel has launched major operations against the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza.
“No one is able to move,” said Rami Abu Matouq, who lives in the Maghazi camp. “Warplanes, snipers and gunfire are everywhere.”
In the central town of Deir al-Balah, health officials said at least 15 people were killed in Israeli strikes late Saturday.
At the entrance of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, men lined up to pray for the dead, their bodies wrapped in white shrouds. The bodies were put on the back of a pickup truck before they were taken to be buried.
Meanwhile, the Egyptian TV station Al-Ghad said a cameraman was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza. The channel said Yazan al-Zwaidi was apparently in a crowd of people at the time. Details were not immediately available, and the Israeli military had no comment.
The internet advocacy group Netblocks said communications in Gaza were still out after a 48-hour outage. The Palestinian telecommunications operator in Gaza, Jawwal, said two of its employees were killed Saturday when they were hit by a shell while fixing lines in Khan Younis.
The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that hospitals had received 125 bodies in the last 24 hours, bringing the overall death toll to 23,968. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around two-thirds of the dead are women and minors. It says over 60,000 people have been wounded.
Israel says Hamas is responsible for the high civilian casualties, saying its fighters make use of civilian buildings and launch attacks from densely populated urban areas. The military says 189 soldiers have been killed and 1,099 wounded since the start of the ground offensive.

8W5BYCB82E_LPNQ2WTD2DPBZSU,Ukraine says it shot down 2 Russian command and control aircraft in a significant blow to Moscow,ILLIA NOVIKOV,"Updated January 15, 2024 at 9:42 PM·3 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-claims-shot-down-2-105547871.html,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The Ukrainian air force shot down a Russian early warning and control plane that can spot targets up to 650 kilometers (400 miles) away and a key command center aircraft that relays information to troops on the ground in a significant blow for the Kremlin’s forces, Ukraine’s military chief said Monday.
The planes are fundamental tools in helping orchestrate Russian battlefield movements in Ukraine. Shooting them down, if confirmed, would be a landmark feat for Ukraine in the almost two-year war, as fighting along the front line is largely bogged down in trench and artillery warfare.
Russia has largely ensured its air dominance during the war, as Ukraine fights with its fleet of Soviet-era warplanes against Moscow's more more modern aircraft.
Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian armed forces, didn't say how the two aircraft — a Beriev A-50 and an Il-22 — were brought down, but Ukraine has received sophisticated air defense systems from its Western allies.
Zaluzhnyi also did not say where the interceptions occurred, though he attached a video to his social media post with an airplane tracker showing two targets disappearing above the Azov Sea, which lies between Ukraine and Russia, north of the Crimea Peninsula and the Black Sea.
There was no immediate official comment from Moscow. Russian war bloggers said both planes had come under friendly fire, though they presented no evidence of that. They claimed the Il-22 was damaged but made a successful landing.
The A-50, which is topped with a large radar, typically carries a crew of 15. The Russian air force reportedly has been operating a fleet of nine such aircraft.
A February 2023 drone attack at an airfield in Belarus damaged a parked A-50, but Russian and Belarusian officials described the damage as minor.
The Il-22 is an airborne command post. It oversees military operations and sends radio signals to troops on the front line. The Russian air force reportedly has a dozen such planes.
Ukraine is eager to impress its Western supporters with its ability in deploying the advanced weapons it has received.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was due to meet Swiss President Viola Amherd in Bern later Monday before attending the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday.
Ukrainian officials are striving to keep world attention on the war amid concerns that the conflict is slipping down the list of global priorities.
The United Nations appealed Monday for $4.2 billion to help people in Ukraine and displaced outside the country this year.
Martin Griffiths, the U.N.’s humanitarian chief, acknowledged that “the competition for funding is getting greater” because of crises elsewhere, including the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.
Russia, meanwhile, was looking to deepen its ties with North Korea, whose foreign minister began a three-day visit to Moscow on Monday.
The Kremlin is eager to replenish its weapons stockpiles. It has in recent times turned to Iran and North Korea for supplies.
Pyongyang has likely supplied several types of missiles to Russia to support its war in Ukraine, along with its widely reported shipments of ammunition and shells, the U.S. and its allies have alleged.
Russian and Iranian defense and foreign ministers spoke by phone Monday to discuss bilateral military and military technical cooperation and regional security issues, according to official statements. They noted that the two countries are preparing to sign a landmark cooperation treaty.
Ukraine is also determined to build up its stocks for a protracted conflict and is “dramatically expanding” its domestic manufacturing capacity for military items, a U.S. think tank said.
Ukraine is well-positioned to succeed in its plans to make up for any shortfall in Western-supplied weaponry, the Institute for the Study of War said.
“Ukraine is heavily industrialized, with a highly educated and technically sophisticated population,” the think tank said late Sunday. “It had a massive arms industry during the Soviet period and continued to be a significant arms exporter after independence.”

8WCFM58PCN_27GNUJNC1NYMF9Y,China to pile on pressure after rebuke from Taiwan's voters,Oliver HOTHAM,"January 14, 2024 at 2:45 PM·4 min read",20240114,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/china-pile-pressure-rebuke-taiwans-064507921.html,"China's campaign of warplanes, balloons and fearsome rhetoric to intimidate voters in Taiwan's elections may have failed, but few expect President Xi Jinping to deviate from his strategy of maximum pressure.
Taiwan voters on Saturday elected independence-leaning Lai Ching-te as president, handing an unprecedented third consecutive term to the Democratic Progressive Party, which Beijing strongly opposes.
China, which split with Taiwan at the end of a civil war in 1949, regards the island as a renegade province that must eventually be reunified, by force if necessary.
In the days leading up to the vote, China demanded voters reject Lai's ""evil path"" and make the ""right choice"", while raising the spectre of war if the DPP retained power.
The rhetoric was backed by China continuing its near-daily military presence around Taiwan. Over the past 18 months, China has also held two rounds of large-scale war games in which it sent warplanes and ships to encircle the island.
After Lai's win, Taiwan told China to ""face reality"".
But China's campaign of intimidation, which has become widely regarded as one of Xi's signature policies, is likely to grow, according to analysts.
""We can expect Beijing to ratchet up tension and coercion against Taipei,"" Lyle Morris, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told AFP.
""The era of two political parties on both sides of the strait... hashing out some kind of political consensus on unification is slipping away and Beijing knows it.""
- No compromise -
China's official reactions immediately after the vote, while relatively muted, also signalled no room for compromise.
""Whatever changes take place in Taiwan, the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.
On state-controlled media, some commentary was far more strident.
Influential Chinese nationalist political commentator Hu Xijin wrote that the choices of Taiwan's voters were irrelevant.
""Strength and the existence of the option to use force are the prerequisites for peaceful unification,"" he wrote on social media site Weibo.
""In his first speech after winning the election, Lai didn't dare to sound as brash as he had previously -- isn't that because of fear?""
- Pressure campaign -
China must contend with the fact that its threats may even have pushed voters into the hands of the ""separatist"" forces it is set against.
China's leaders have seen a similar dynamic before.
In 1996, Beijing launched a series of missile tests near the island in a failed bid to stop voters from electing independence-leaning Lee Teng-hui.
Xi and his officials could take heart from the fact that many in Taiwan saw a vote for Lai as a vote for continuity -- and not for full independence, one expert said.
""Taiwan's voters demonstrated their preference for preserving the status quo, not for shifting the terms of relations across the Taiwan Strait,"" Ryan Hass, a former US diplomat and a China scholar at the Brookings Institution, told AFP.
""China's leaders understand this,"" he said. ""While Beijing does not celebrate the status quo, there are no indications that it will soon launch conflict to alter it.""
The clock is ticking: CIA director William Burns said last year that President Xi Jinping had ordered his military to be ready to carry out a successful invasion of the island by 2027.
That ""timetable remains the same"", Hong Kong-based Chinese politics expert Willy Lam told AFP.
""The key factor is the Xi leadership's perception of the gap between (his) forces on the one hand, and those of the US and its Asian allies such as Japan on the other.""
On Pingtan island -- China's closest point to Taiwan's main island this week -- one local told AFP that he felt unification was closer than ever.
""Hong Kong has returned, Macau has returned, it's just Taiwan,"" Chen Suqing, a 75-year-old retired businessman, said.
""We must liberate Taiwan in this generation,"" he said.
""If Taiwan is not unified and becomes independent, we will fight.""

Annalena Baerbock, who held talks with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and other top officials while visiting Manila, said Germany was ready to help de-escalate growing tensions and added that it was crucial to set up “mechanisms” to resolve the disputes peacefully and foster dialogue.
""There are truly rough winds blowing across the South China Sea and this is happening in the middle of one of the most dynamic economic regions of the world,” she told a news conference in Manila, speaking through an interpreter.
“It is now important to set up mechanisms to solve tensions together in a peaceful way,” she said without elaborating. “I think we all agree that the world doesn’t need another crisis. There are too many crises at once.”
In a symbolic gesture of Germany’s support for the Philippines, Baerbock visited the coast guard headquarters in Manila and boarded a patrol ship, where she briefly flew one of a number of surveillance drones that Germany donated to the Philippines.
Philippine coast guard officials said the drones would help the country defend its territorial interests in the South China Sea, enforce maritime laws and undertake search and rescue missions during accidents at sea.
Chinese officials did not immediately issue a reaction.
The decades-long territorial dispute escalated last year between Beijing and Manila, sparking fears it could degenerate into a major conflict that could involve the United States, a longtime treaty ally of the Philippines.
Chinese coast guard ships and accompanying vessels used military-grade laser and water cannons against Philippine coast guard and supply vessels and undertook dangerous maneuvers near disputed shoals, prompting the Philippines to file a large number of diplomatic protests against China, Philippine officials said.
The U.S. has repeatedly warned it is obligated to defend the Philippines if its forces, aircraft and ships come under an armed attack, including in the South China Sea. China has warned the U.S. and its allies not to meddle with what it says is a purely Asian dispute and build up its forces in the region, warning of unspecified consequences.
China's actions in the South China Sea, which have led to minor collisions with Philippine vessels, are of concern to Germany and other European countries, Baerbock said, “because such risky maneuvers violate rights and opportunities for economic development of your own country and other littoral states.”
Baerbock held the news conference with her Philippine counterpart, Enrique Manalo.
“They also put into question the freedom of navigation and international law, affecting all countries worldwide,” she said, adding that China’s claims “are not covered by international law.”
The German foreign minister, the first to visit the Philippines in about a decade to bolster ties, cited a 2016 ruling by a United Nations-backed arbitration panel that invalidated China’s extensive territorial claims on historical grounds. China refused to participate in the arbitration, dismissed its ruling as a sham and continues to defy it.
Baerbock said the arbitration ruling was “crystal clear.”

""We hope negotiations will close a deal very soon,"" Efrat Machikawa, whose uncle, Gadi Mozes, was abducted, said at a press conference at the Israeli embassy in Berlin on Monday.
She said she plans to ask German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at a meeting later on Monday to thank Qatar for its efforts to mediate and negotiate for the release of the hostages.
The Palestinian militant group Hamas released 105 of the hostages abducted from Israel during a negotiated pause in fighting in November. Israel in exchange agreed to release 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
But there are currently no concrete prospects for further releases.
According to Israeli estimates, more than 130 hostages are still being held in the Gaza Strip, although 25 of the remaining hostages are believed to be dead.
Militants from Hamas and other Palestinian extremist groups abducted around 240 people from Israel during unprecedented Hamas-led attacks on October 7 that included brutal massacres of Israeli civilians.
Machikawa is one of 21 relatives of hostages who visited Berlin to mark the 100th day since the devastating October 7 attacks.
""Extremists are a global problem,"" she said. ""We should join forces.""
The relatives include mothers, fathers, wives and siblings of people being held in the Gaza Strip. Some brought hourglasses with them as a sign of dwindling time to secure their release.
Hagit Chen said that her son, 19-year-old Itay Chen, does not have access to enough food or medicine.
Raz Ben Ami, who herself was held captive by Hamas but was released in November, also made the trip to Berlin. Her husband, Ohad Ben Ami, remains a hostage in the Gaza Strip."
9B9N4TGOC7_RICGIAK5VCYTCGC,Cambridge students stage ‘die-in’ at Barclays bank to protest against Israel and fossil fuels,Felix Armstrong,"January 20, 2024 at 9:14 AM·3 min read",20240120,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/cambridge-students-stage-die-barclays-151412435.html,"Pro-Palestinian campaigners joined environmental activists in staging a sit-in at Barclays bank in Cambridge – calling for an end to the bank’s “investment” in Israel’s operations in Gaza and its funding of the fossil fuel industry.
A group of 15 student and local campaigners occupied Barclays’ St Andrew’s Street branch on Saturday, staging a three-hour “die-in” on the floor of the bank before leaving and marching through the town centre.
The protesters claimed that Barclays is “complicit” in Israel’s killing of thousands of civilians in Gaza, with accusations that the bank also holds more than £1 billion in shares and provides £3 billion in loans to companies whose weapons, components and military technology are being used in its military operations.
One banner held up outside the building read: “Barclays; blood on your hands”.
There were similar protests outside the branches of Barclays in Hitchin and Stevenage, Hertfordshire.
While activists occupied the branch, others outside chanted “Israel is a terrorist state” and “from the river, to the sea, Palestine will be free” – both slogans regarded by some as offensive and anti-Semitic.
Business continued inside the bank while police maintained a low key presence outside. At one stage branch staff briefly shut the doors of the building before the activists left at around 12.30pm.
Before the start of a march through the centre of Cambridge passers-by outside the bank were handed leaflets urging them to close their Barclays accounts.
One activist said: “Barclays must immediately withdraw its financial support for companies that manufacture arms used by the Israeli military.”
An activist who took part in the sit-in said: “We had a really peaceful sit-in, we did some die-ins, some meditation, we were holding banners and placards, we did some origami of cranes, which are a symbol of peace, and we also made a paper chain with lots of messages to Barclays for all the harm that they’re causing.”
The occupation was organised by a coalition of anti-war and environmental campaigns, including student groups Cambridge Climate Justice and Cambridge University PalSoc, and local groups Cambridge Palestine Solidarity Campaign and Cambridge Stop the War.
The campaigners are also criticising the bank for its links to the fossil fuel industry, following the launch of a career boycott of Barclays last month, when students from across the country pledged not to work for the firm.
Barclays has recently come under pressure from the University of Cambridge, which is reportedly considering ending its two centuries-long association with the bank, in favour of a partner which does not “finance fossil fuel expansion”.
Jenny, an organiser with Cambridge Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, said outside the bank: “We see our demands as being interconnected because the oppression of many people around the world, generally not of rich Western countries, is tied up with climate change.”
A member of the Organisation of Radical Cambridge Activists said: “What we’re trying to achieve is to make people divest from Barclays, that is change their account to other banks that are committing not to invest in those kinds of genocidal activities.”
Just Stop Oil were also present at the occupation, saying: “Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are suffering utterly unimaginable atrocities. Meanwhile, Barclays is rolling in profits from the billions they lend to kill, be that through arms or oil.”
Barclays said it was committed to respecting human rights as defined by the International Bill of Human Rights.
A Barclays spokesman said: “As a universal bank, Barclays provides a range of client services in relation to the shares of publicly listed companies, including those in the Defence and Security sector.
“Such client-driven activities may result in Barclays holding shares in those companies, for example, through hedging positions, market making, custody and underwriting activity.
“Barclays does not itself intend to make any direct strategic equity investments in the Defence and Security sector.”

9CW63V8J5X_U0EK847ENBCGKAI,Iran warns air strike on Syria will not go unanswered,"Vicky Wong and Frank Gardner, Security Correspondent - BBC News","January 21, 2024 at 4:20 AM·4 min read",20240120,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/senior-iran-revolutionary-guard-officials-115824851.html,"Iran's president said an air strike on the Syrian capital that killed five senior members of Iran's security forces will not ""go unanswered"".
Ebrahim Raisi said Israel was to blame for the attack, which also killed a number of Syrian forces.
Israel has not commented. For years it has carried out strikes on Iranian-linked targets in Syria.
Such strikes have intensified since the Israel-Gaza war began following Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel.
In a statement posted on the president's officials website, Mr Raisi expressed his condolences to the families of the ""high-ranking martyrs"".
He vowed to avenge their deaths, and described the attack as a ""cowardly assassination of five of Iran's most distinguished advisors"".
The statement described the strike as ""terrorist and criminal"" and said it ""shows the height of [Israel's] desperation and weakness against the combatants of the resistance front"".
""It will not remain unanswered,"" said the statement.
Iran's foreign ministry said the attacks were an ""aggressive and provocative"" act by Israel, urging international actors to condemn them.
Senior figures among the Iranian Revolutionary Guard - a major military, political and economic force in Iran - have been present in Syria since the civil war began there in 2011, helping to support the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against widespread rebellion to his rule.
Saturday's attack took place in the Mazzeh neighbourhood, south-west Damascus, an area home to a military airport, as well as the UN headquarters in Damascus, embassies and restaurants.
Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency said the attacks killed the IRGC's Syria intelligence chief and his deputy, as well as other Guard members.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based campaign group, said 10 people were killed in the strikes, including leaders of the Revolutionary Guard.
The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency quoted a military source as saying it had managed to stop some of the missiles, but that the attacks - which it said had hit a residential building - killed and injured some civilians. Buildings were also destroyed, it said.
A resident told AFP news agency that they saw ""explosions"" in the western Mazzeh area and ""a large cloud of smoke"".
""The sound was similar to a missile explosion, and minutes later I heard the sound of ambulances,"" he added.
Videos, which the BBC has not verified, showed a large cloud of smoke and buildings destroyed.
Last month a suspected Israeli air strike just outside Damascus killed a senior IRGC commander.
The Middle East has been on heightened alert since 7 October, when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,300 people, mainly civilians, and taking 240 hostages back to Gaza. More than 132 hostages are thought to still be held in the territory.
Iran's sudden strikes show just how perilous region has become
More than 24,900 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its military response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel says its ground and air operation in Gaza is aimed at destroying Hamas.
The conflict has raised concerns about a wider war spreading around the region, particularly between fierce rivals Israel and Iran, and amid a series of overlapping crises.
Israel is targeting the Palestinian group Hamas, which is supported by Tehran. It has been carrying out precision strikes across the border in Syria for some time now, bombing weapons supplies heading for its Iran-backed foe, Hezbollah, or taking out key figures in that supply chain, and it is also exchanging fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria are also targeting US forces in the region, and the US and UK have struck the Houthis - another Iran-backed group - in Yemen, who have been attacking ships in the Red Sea.
Fears about an even wider conflict were further heightened this week, when Iran exchanged strikes with its neighbour Pakistan.
On Tuesday, Iran admitted carrying out a missile and drone attack in south-western Pakistan, killing two children, saying it was targeting an ""Iranian terrorist group"" in Pakistan.
Days later, Islamabad hit back, launching strikes it said were targeting ""terrorist hideouts"" in south-eastern Iran, killing nine people.
Although both sides insisted they were targeting militant bases in each other's countries, Iran and Pakistan withdrew their ambassadors from the respective capitals.
But following talks, diplomatic ties were restored.
Iran has hit targets in Pakistan, Syria and Iraqi Kurdistan, Turkey has also bombed Kurdistan, while Jordan has attacked drug smugglers across its border with Syria.
The US is still hitting ISIS in Syria and simultaneously fighting off drone strikes by Iran's proxies there and in Iraq.
There is no common policy behind these attacks, other than the well-worn pretext of ""acting in national self defence""."
9CYGM2F0NM_8M9WEY1Q57ANDKJ,Taiwan’s president-elect meets US delegation as China rages at result of election,Alisha Rahaman Sarkar,"January 15, 2024 at 7:30 PM·3 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/taiwan-president-elect-meets-us-113011667.html,"A US delegation on Monday said America's commitment to Taiwan was ""rock solid” as it met with the island’s president-elect despite multiple warnings from China.
The delegation, led by former national security adviser Stephen Hadley, also met outgoing president Tsai Ing-wen in a show of support for the government.
The visit comes a day after Lai Ching-te from Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) swept the presidential polls in a crucial election for the self-governed island amid a concerted campaign of pressure by China.
Beijing, which has branded Mr Lai a separatist and “troublemaker”, claims the self-governed island to be its own territory and repeatedly criticised the US for backing its democratic process.
The Chinese foreign ministry criticised the ""incorrect actions"" of the US and other Western nations, including the UK and Canada, in congratulating the president-elect.
Mr Lai's victory prompted Nauru – a small Pacific island nation – to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan on Monday and restore bilateral relations with China instead, saying the move was in the country's ""best interest"".
Mr Hadley said he and other US delegates were in Taiwan to convey congratulations on behalf of the American people over the conduct of the election.
""Taiwan's democracy has set a shining example for the world, a democratic success story based on transparency, the rule of law and respect for human rights and freedoms,"" Mr Hadley said, in comments released by the Taiwanese presidential office.
""We are honoured to have the opportunity to meet with you today to reaffirm that the American commitment to Taiwan is rock solid, principled and bipartisan and that the United States stands with its friends,"" he added.
""We look forward to continuity in the relationship between Taiwan and the United States under the new administration, and for common efforts to preserve cross-strait peace and stability.""
As of Monday, Taiwan shares official diplomatic ties with just 12 nations, but maintains robust trade relations with Western democracies, including the US.
Mr Lai met the group later at party headquarters and expressed his desire for the US to continue to support Taiwan and deepen cooperation with the island.
He said his administration will ""keep defending peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"" as his predecessor has done. Mr Lai is expected to take office on 20 May.
Ex-deputy secretary of state James B Steinberg affirmed bipartisan support for Taiwan ""based on our unofficial but warm relationship, our insistence on exclusively peaceful means to address the cross (Taiwan Strait) issues, the importance of dialogue and the avoidance of unilateral efforts to change the status quo"".
President Tsai said following the election that Taiwan's ""need to continue to progress and move forward remains unchanged"". ""We hope that Taiwan-US relations continue to advance and serve as a key driving force in regional and global prosperity and development,"" she said.
Mr Lai followed his predecessor Ms Tsai’s example by not actively campaigning for a Taiwanese declaration of independence, a contentious issue even among Taiwanese. Instead, he said Taiwan’s elections and self-governance showed the island was already “a sovereign country” and that he would “build on this foundation” if elected.
Joe Biden reiterated longstanding US policy on the matter on Saturday, just after Mr Lai’s victory was confirmed, saying: “We do not support independence... [for Taiwan].”
The US switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 and has long said it does not support a formal declaration of independence by Taiwan.
While Mr Lai won the election, the DPP lost its majority in parliament, potentially making it much harder for him to pass legislation."

Brent climbed 1.1% to settle above $78 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate advanced to settle above $72 a barrel. Prices spiked even higher early in the session before paring gains alongside equities as investors gauged whether the escalation will spark a broader conflict in the Middle East.
President Joe Biden said on Thursday that strikes had been conducted against a number of targets used by the Iran-backed group. The move had an immediate impact on shipping, with at least one major tanker owner saying it has paused voyages. In response, the Houthis said all US and UK interests are now legitimate targets.
Global benchmark Brent is now testing its 50-day moving average for the first time since October. If prices breach the level, it could spur additional buying by algorithms and technical traders.
“Energy markets have been significantly underpriced for the ongoing rise in geopolitical risks,” said Dan Ghali, a commodity strategist at TD Securities. If Brent ends up breaking above $81 a barrel, it could propel buying and “ force algos to start acquiring net long positions.”
Earlier this week, Houthis had launched their largest assault to date on shipping in the Red Sea, prompting warnings of retaliation from Washington. Iran also seized a tanker off the coast of Oman, further inflaming the situation. Tensions in the Middle East have been rising since Hamas’s attack on Israel on Oct. 7. The Houthis started attacking ships in mid-November, ostensibly in support of Hamas, and have said they won’t back down until Israel ends its assault on Gaza.
The assaults prompted many commercial shippers to redirect vessels around the southern tip of Africa, rather than risk a passage through the waterway that links to the Suez Canal. Until now, oil tanker markets had largely avoided the worst of that impact.
Traders are keeping a close eye on whether Iran will be drawn into the conflict as it could threaten oil supplies in a region that produces a third of the world’s crude. The war-risk premium had previously been easing amid ample output from non-OPEC+ producers and slowing demand growth.

Details: Sunak explained the essence of the security obligations under the agreement.
""The first thing that this agreement does, in general, is to formalise our current security agreements. The second is to ensure that this support is long-term so that Russia understands that we are standing with Ukraine,"" Sunak said.

""If Russia attacks again, we will provide the support that Ukraine needs: fast and reliable security support and modern weapons (for defence) on land, at sea and in the sky; economic support; and we will impose sanctions that will have a price for Russia. There is a clear and important commitment to this,"" Sunak said.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, for his part, clarified that the agreement provides for time for consultations with partners in the event of a repeat of Russian aggression.
""This is a formalised commitment from our partners. If there is a recurrence of the Russian Federation’s aggression, an appropriate time is provided during which we consult with our partners in accordance with this agreement,"" Zelenskyy said.
""We will understand the amount of assistance that we will need in the event of a new attack by the Russian Federation,"" Zelenskyy added.
Update: According to the published text of the agreement, ""In the event of future Russian armed attack against Ukraine, at the request of either of the Participants, the Participants will consult within 24 hours to determine measures needed to counter or deter the aggression"".
Background: As reported, Rishi Sunak, during a visit to Kyiv, announced a large package of military assistance for Ukraine worth £2.5 billion.

9KZUU20W8J_QT96NCOVXHSBTJ0,Baby milk: Big supermarkets cut price of Aptamil formula,"Sam Gruet - Business reporter, BBC News","January 16, 2024 at 5:28 AM·2 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/baby-milk-big-supermarkets-cut-212808032.html,"Asda, Tesco & Sainsbury's have joined Iceland in cutting the cost of Aptamil baby formula.
It comes after manufacturer Danone cut the price it charges retailers for the majority of its baby milk range by 7%.
Asda said from Monday its customers would also be able to pay for formula using rewards scheme vouchers for the first time.
The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said prices for baby formula milk had risen by a quarter in two years.
The regulator found competition was hampered because shoppers were reluctant to switch brands, either because they were recommended by friends and family or because their baby would only drink one.
There are rules banning retailers from advertising discounts on infant formula - for babies up to six months - because it might discourage breastfeeding.
In August Iceland called on the government to ""immediately"" update existing legislation so that retailers were allowed to tell the public when they reduce the price of formula.
The supermarket said at the time it still endorsed breastfeeding, yet rising costs were ""placing unbearable pressure on parents who choose to or have no alternative"" to using formula milk.
Iceland was the first supermarket to announce a price reduction, saying Danone's cuts would be reflected in its stores. Asda said it would continue to work with its manufacturing partners to make sure price reductions were passed on to customers.
Kris Comerford, Asda's chief commercial officer, said the supermarket understood that baby formula was a ""vital necessity"" for many.
He said: ""Whilst we respect the regulations in place regarding the sale of baby formula, we want to do everything we can to help families manage their budget and keep their family fed.""
A Sainsbury's spokesperson said the supermarket was passing on cost savings to customers. Okmirt
Baby formula price cut helps new parents
'Money is tight, but I won’t buy a cheaper baby formula'
Rising baby milk prices 'devastating family budgets'
In November, the CMA found just two suppliers accounted for 85% of infant formula sales and there was ""very limited availability"" of cheaper own-brand alternatives.
New parents could make significant savings of £500 in the first year of a baby's life on formula milk products by shopping around, the CMA added.
Danone told the BBC it would ""continue to engage"" with the CMA investigation.
The rise in costs has correlated with a spike in formula thefts as part of a surge of shoplifting during the cost of living crisis.
Only one UK retailer, Aldi, sells its own brand. Morrisons and Lidl did not immediately reply to a request to comment."
9NXURICFSF_ITPG4BYF1DMOLWD,Yemen strikes: Houthis target ship after US 'terror' designation,"Matt Murphy - BBC News, Washington","January 18, 2024 at 6:12 AM·4 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/yemen-strikes-houthis-designated-terror-191735996.html,"Yemen's Houthis claim to have targeted a US-owned vessel in the Red Sea after Washington said it will re-designate the group as ""global terrorists"".
The group said they targeted the ""Genco Picardy"" bulk carrier with missiles which resulted in a ""direct hit"".
Washington's new designation of the Houthis will require US financial institutions to freeze Houthi funds and its members will be banned from the US.
The Houthi Red Sea attacks are a response to Israel's operation in Gaza.
Earlier this month, the UK and US launched air strikes on dozens of Houthi targets in Yemen in an attempt to stop the group from targeting vessels in the Red Sea.
On Wednesday evening, a Houthi spokesperson said the group had successfully targeted the Genco Picardy, and that the attack was a response to ""the American-British aggression against our country"".
Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder told reporters he was ""tracking reports of an attack"".
Earlier, the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said it received a report of an unnamed vessel being hit by an ""uncrewed aerial system"" in the Red Sea south of Yemen, and that a fire onboard had been extinguished.
US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the re-designation of the Houthis as ""global terrorists"" is in response to the Iran-backed group's attacks on commercial shipping in the region.
The move to re-designate the Houthis reverses Secretary of State Antony Blinken's 2021 decision to remove the rebels from the US Specially Designated Global Terrorist List (SDGT).
In a statement, Mr Sullivan said the recent Houthi attacks ""fit the textbook definition of terrorism"", as they have put US personnel in danger and jeopardized global trade operations.
""If the Houthis cease their attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the United States will immediately re-evaluate this designation,"" Mr Sullivan added.
In the waning days of the Trump administration officials imposed the SDGT and foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) labels on the Houthis.
This action was taken despite warnings from the UN and aid groups that it could push war-torn Yemen into a large-scale famine.
But in 2021, shortly after President Joe Biden's inauguration, that decision was reversed by Mr Blinken, the newly installed Secretary of State. He cited the dire humanitarian situation faced by the people of Yemen.
Speaking to reporters ahead of Wednesday's announcement, senior administration officials defended the decision to reinstate the SDGT designation but not the FTO designation, which they said had been taken to ensure the continued flow of aid into Yemen.
""It was the correct step to revoke,"" one official said, arguing that it was a move taken in ""recognition of a very dire humanitarian situation"" in the country and to ensure that ""US policies weren't impeding"" civilians' access to urgent aid.
But they accepted that the Houthis' campaign of attacks on commercial shipping, which has now seen dozens of missiles fired at vessels in the Red Sea, has become ""unacceptable"".
What do Red Sea assaults mean for global trade?
Strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen show war in Gaza has already spread
Red Sea attacks: Greek vessel hit by missile fired by Houthi rebels
The new SDGT designation will also bar people and companies in the US from offering any support to the Houthis.
However, officials were keen to emphasise that a range of exemptions will be worked into the new designation to ensure humanitarian aid continues to flow into Yemen, a country devastated by almost a decade of civil war.
""We are rolling out unprecedented carve outs and licenses to help prevent adverse impacts on the Yemeni people,"" said Mr Sullivan in his statement. ""The people of Yemen should not pay the price for the actions of the Houthis.""
The Houthis began attacking merchant vessels in November, saying they were responding to Israel's military operation in Gaza. Since then, the group has launched dozens of attacks on commercial tankers passing through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
In response, the US and UK launched a wave of air strikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January. The strikes - supported by Australia, Bahrain, the Netherlands and Canada - began after Houthi forces ignored an ultimatum to cease their attacks in the region.
Biden administration officials denied that the new terrorist designation was an acceptance that the air campaign may not deter further Houthi attacks.
""We see these sanctions as one piece of a broader effort to bring the Houthis back from the terror attacks they are currently committing,"" one official said. ""Our sanctions are best not seen in isolation but as part of a broader effort.""
In the wake of last week's strikes, the Houthis said the US and UK would ""soon realise"" the action was ""the greatest folly in their history"".
""America and Britain made a mistake in launching the war on Yemen because they did not benefit from their previous experiences,"" senior Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti wrote on social media.
Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated in 2015, when the Houthis seized control of large parts of the west of the country from the internationally recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an effort to restore its rule.
The fighting has reportedly left more than 160,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with two thirds of the population - 21 million people - in need of some form of aid."

In his reply to a question by Workers' Party and Sengkang Member of Parliament Assoc Prof Jamus Lim in Parliament on Wednesday (10 January), Wong, who is also the Minister for Finance, said, ""The Government’s decision to ban the use of e-cigarettes in 2018 was based on public health considerations, to protect our population from the harms of these products.

Prof Lim had asked whether the potential loss in tobacco tax revenue has been a factor in the decision by the government to ban e-cigarettes, and what are the practical limitations to introducing an equivalent nicotine tax on e-cigarette products, were they to be made legal.
Wong added that if the government were to legalise and tax e-cigarettes, ""the challenges would be similar to those we encounter for cigarettes and other tobacco products today"".

Grant Shapps said UK and US warships repelled ""multiple"" attack drones.
The Houthis launched 21 drones and missiles on Tuesday, the US Central Command reported.
US and UK warships have repelled the ""largest attack"" by Iran-backed Houthis to date in the Red Sea, UK Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement on Wednesday.
Shapps said the UK's HMS Diamond warship, alongside US warships, destroyed ""multiple"" attack drones using guns and ""sea viper"" missiles.
No injuries or damage to the UK warship were reported, he said.
The US Central Command (CENTCOM), which had previously reported on the attack, offered more details on the military operation.
It said US warships and the UK's HMS Diamond shot down 21 drones and missiles that Houthi rebels had fired toward international shipping lanes on Tuesday night at 9:15 p.m. local time.
The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, USS Gravely, USS Laboon, and USS Mason repelled what was the 26th Houthi attack on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea since November 19, per CENTCOM.
There were no injuries or damage reported, it added.
Previous attacks by Houthi rebels included 14 drone attacks on December 16, 17 drone and missile attacks on December 26, and attempts to hijack a cargo ship on December 31.
But Tuesday's attack was the biggest the US has repelled in the region.
The attacks targeting commercial and merchant vessels in the vital Red Sea waterway have had economists worried about the massive disruption they could have on the world economy, with some warning of inflationary pressures.
To prevent such a scenario, the Pentagon announced Operation Prosperity Guardian in mid-December 2023, a new multinational security operation designed to counter threats by Houthi forces against international maritime commerce heading or related to Israel.
More than 20 countries had joined the operation as of December 21, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a Pentagon news conference at the time.
However, the operation was criticized as just a ""Band-Aid"" to an escalating problem by Brian Raymond, the executive vice president of client risk management at international security firm Global Guardian.
Raymond told Business Insider that shooting down drones and missiles won't cut it and that negotiations in the region should take place to ""tamp down this activity.""
""When does this get addressed in a meaningful manner? We just can't keep shooting things down that come off the eastern or the western side of Yemen,"" Raymond said, adding that ""eventually something is going to happen that's much more catastrophic.""
In his statement on Wednesday, the UK defense minister said that the UK, alongside its allies ""have previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable, and if continued, the Houthis will bear the consequences.""

A1OF5W03RH_PJA72QBC9MR441H,"DeSantis Put Most Of His Chips On Iowa, Now Faces Do-Or-Die Test There",S.V. Date,"Updated January 16, 2024 at 5:40 AM·4 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/desantis-put-most-chips-iowa-103542567.html,"Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis leaves after speaking Friday at a Northside Conservatives Club Meeting in Ankeny, Iowa. The Arctic temperatures are raising concerns about turnout for the Iowa caucuses on Monday.
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — One year after leading the polls for the Republican presidential nomination, Ron DeSantis is just hours away from his moment of truth.
The Florida governor, fresh off his 20-percentage-point reelection win, was beating Donald Trump both in the first-in-the-nation voting state as well as in some national polls in early 2023. Today he heads into Iowa’s caucuses looking at a potential third-place finish behind both the coup-attempting former president as well as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.
Which, after having spent the better part of the last few months traveling back and forth across the state, would raise the question: What’s the point of staying in the race?
“I’m sure they’ll try to find a rationale to stay in but I really don’t see what it would be,” said David Kochel, a decadeslong Republican consultant from Iowa who points out that as weak as DeSantis’ position is in Iowa polling, it’s even worse in the next states to come. “He’s so far back in New Hampshire and South Carolina I can’t imagine he’ll get any attention over those weeks.”
Mike Murphy, a fellow longtime GOP consultant, had a more blunt assessment of a DeSantis third-place finish: “Get a fork. He would be done.”
DeSantis, for his part, at campaign stops in Dubuque and Cedar Falls did not mention Saturday’s Des Moines Register final pre-caucus poll that showed Haley moving past him into second place with 20% compared to DeSantis’ 16%. Trump held a large lead with 48%, although that was three points less than the last Register poll in December.
DeSantis did tell attendees that caucus night would be “fun” because he would be able to prove the media wrong with a strong finish.
One source in the campaign apparatus backing DeSantis, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said while a third-place finish would be disappointing, there were still good reasons for him to hang in there: “The uncertainty created by Trump’s age and legal challenges means that there is a strong rationale for the only candidate with broad support in the party to stay in the race.”
That analysis, of course, does not explain why DeSantis went from ahead of Trump a year ago to 30 points behind him, dropping steadily in the polls even as his campaign and his supporting superPAC spent at least $160 million boosting him.
“I don’t understand it either,” said Marylou Erlacher, a 76-year-old retiree who came out to the Chrome Horse Saloon in Cedar Rapids to hear him. She said one reason is probably that Haley is a more polished and empathetic speaker. “He just doesn’t have as much charisma.”
Scott Pinter, who is 58 and runs an industrial painting business and who also came out to the Cedar Rapids visit, said DeSantis had been drawing voters who liked Trump, but then abandoned DeSantis after Trump started getting indicted last year. He said DeSantis would have been better off waiting until 2028. “If Trump wasn’t there, he’d be my guy,” Pinter said, adding that he hoped DeSantis does not do anything to alienate Trump supporters like himself. “He’s just got to be careful he doesn’t ruin it for next time.”
A few hours and 135 miles west at Haley’s final pre-caucus campaign stop in Adel, Robb Ryerse said people are overthinking DeSantis’ fall.
“He’s a terrible candidate,” the 44-year-old pastor-turned-anti-Trump activist said. “Everything from his boots to the lifts in his shoes to his smile seems fake…. He doesn’t come across as a real person.”
The bitter cold weather forecast for Monday evening during the hours of the caucuses combined with DeSantis’ monthslong effort to build a massive operation to turn out his supporters could pay off with a performance that exceeds his polling.
If not, though, even his supporters wondered what the point would be of continuing. “None,” said one backer who helped raise tens of thousands of dollars for his campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He added that even a second-place finish should persuade DeSantis to drop out. “That’s the best thing for him. Finish close enough to get out with some pride.”"

After the West cut ties with Moscow following the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Moscow turned to internationally isolated North Korea for support.
Putin received North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the autumn when the two leaders are believed to have discussed arms deliveries by Pyongyang to Moscow.
North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui is currently on a three-day visit to Moscow, where she is scheduled to hold talks with her Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov. Peskov said that a meeting with Putin should not be ruled out.
Around 50 countries recently condemned the delivery of North Korean missiles to Russia and their deployment against Ukraine. Observers believe the two countries are seeking to expand their mutual arms trade, despite the criticism."

The timing, target, and execution of the attack all pointed to the Islamic State (despite Iranian officials pointing fingers at Israel and the United States for complicity), and a round-up of individuals in Iran with suspected terrorist ties reveals a concerted effort by the Islamic State to establish terrorist networks in the country. But more worrying, especially for European countries and other U.S. partners, is what this attack heralds from the Islamic State.
The Islamic State claimed the Kerman bombings as part of a new campaign dubbed, “Kill Them Wherever You Find Them,” launched in support of Palestinian Muslims. Within a 24-hour period, the Islamic State had claimed more than 30 different operations globally—from the Middle East to Africa to the Philippines—as part of this campaign, reanimating a seemingly dormant network. Few of the arguments made in the announcement itself are new. Pointing to the events in Gaza, the Islamic State called for supporters to target “Jews, Christians, and their allies” in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere.
One of the key distinctions between the Islamic State and other major jihadist groups is its focus on Iran. Unlike al-Qaeda, the Islamic State has actively targeted Iran and Shiites worldwide as perfidious enemies of Islam and ruthlessly condemned Sunni collaborators such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. This announcement was no different, emphasizing again the danger of the Shiites and their threat to Sunni Muslims. No doubt, the Kerman bombings were aimed in part at driving a wedge of suspicion between Shiite Iran and the Sunni jihadists it backs. As it has previously, the Islamic State is seeking to exploit regional tensions and moments of instability to create opportunities to advance its own cause, still pursuing reestablishing the Caliphate.
These bombings are simply another notch in the belt of Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K). What senior U.S. officials warned of in the aftermath of the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan—IS-K’s development of external attack capabilities to match its intent—has sadly been realized. And while the Kerman bombings are shocking given the terrorist outfit’s penetration of the tightly controlled Iranian society, they are part of a concerning trend. The group now threatens states neighboring Afghanistan and has extended its reach to include Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka. Reports from Kyrgyzstan of a foiled terror attack in late December reveal the outward progression of the Islamic State’s threat from Afghanistan.
Western states, particularly European ones, have felt much-needed relief from the Islamic State terror threat in recent years, especially after the collapse of the founding group in Iraq and Syria. But that lull in activity seems to be ending. Most  concerning is how IS-K has transformed into its primary operational node using tradecraft developed to support terrorism attacks as far afield as Europe. Like al-Qaeda, which experienced significant counterterrorism pressure in Afghanistan and focused instead on developing a threat node based in Yemen, the Islamic State has adapted. The difference is that the Islamic State seems to be mastering a remote management of its cells, including online recruitment, guidance, and training. It’s not clear yet from Iranian statements regarding the detained individuals whether the network behind the Kerman bombings was built remotely or not.
In the past few weeks, European security services have detained multiple individuals suspected of being part of an Islamic State attack network. The suspects have alleged ties to IS-K and may have sought to strike gatherings on Christmas or New Year’s in places like Cologne, Germany; Vienna, Austria; or Madrid, Spain. Over the summer, a joint Belgian, Dutch, and German anti-terrorist operation rolled up a network of individuals with ties to the Islamic State–Khorasan. Multiple European countries have raised their national terrorism threat alerts over this growing threat.
That the Islamic State has not been successful in re-terrorizing Europe is not for lack of effort—but is a testament to counterterrorism professionals’ ongoing vigilance against the threat.IS-K’s rising transnational capabilities strike at a volatile time. The events in Gaza have clearly motivated individuals to take up violent jihad, galvanizing the movement. The Islamic State’s signature ability to identify, recruit, and activate would-be terrorists—essentially finding the lone operatives who need only to be told where, when, and how to attack—may prove especially dangerous in this reenergized global threat environment. Though IS-K activity has continued to trend downward inside of Afghanistan, its projection outward is on the rise. That’s a trend that should worry Washington and other European capitals.

South Africa's claim is ""unfounded"" and ""absurd,"" said Tal Becker, legal advisor to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
Victims of the Gaza war and the suffering of the civilian population were solely the responsibility of the terrorist organization Hamas. ""Israel is at war with Hamas, not the Palestinian people,"" he told the judges.
As the proceeding ended on Friday at the UN's highest court, demonstrations were held by hundreds of Israeli and Palestinian supporters.
The ICJ is being asked to rule on two issues. The hearings that concluded on Friday concern an urgent application by South Africa for the ICJ judges to order an end to Israeli military action in Gaza. The second issue, whether Israel committed genocide, will take much longer.
The court is to decide as quickly as possible on the military action issue, court president Joan Donoghue said. A decision is expected before February 6, when the panel of judges is reassembled.
Israel has repeatedly rejected the request for an immediate ceasefire, invoking its right to self-defence following the attacks by Hamas and other Palestinian extremists from Gaza on October 7.
Becker also described the massacres in which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250 kidnapped from Israel, around half of whom have been released so far.
""What Israel seeks is not to destroy a people but to protect a people, its people,"" Becker said.
""Hamas has systematically and unlawfully embedded its military infrastructure in ... schools, mosques, hospitals and other sensitive sites. This is a preplanned, abhorrent method of warfare,"" he said.
This is the first time that Israel has faced a genocide accusation before the ICJ.
On Thursday, the first day of hearings, South Africa put forward its contention that Israel is committing ""systematic"" acts of genocide in Gaza, citing examples of military violence and statements by Israeli politicians and military brass.
More than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed amid Israel's military campaign in the coastal strip, with at least 70% of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health authority.
Israel has repeatedly dismissed South Africa's claims as baseless.
The fight against Hamas in the Gaza Strip is ""in full compliance with international law,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.
According to the UN Human Rights Office, Israel is violating basic principles of international humanitarian law in its military operations in Gaza and failing to take precautionary measures to protect the civilian population.
A spokeswoman for the UN office said on Friday in Geneva that violations of international humanitarian law increase the risk of being held accountable for war crimes.
The complaint at the world court particularly affects Israel because the country was founded in the wake of the Holocaust during which about 6 million Jews were murdered by Germany's Nazi regime.
The German government has clearly sided with Israel in the genocide proceedings concerning the Gaza war.
""We know that different countries have different assessments of Israel's operation in the Gaza Strip. However, the German government firmly and explicitly rejects the accusation of genocide now being made against Israel before the International Court of Justice,"" said government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit in Berlin on Friday.
""This accusation has no basis whatsoever.""
Hebestreit said that the German government also intends to take a corresponding stance in court if a main trial is held.
""The [German government] intends to intervene as a third party in the main hearing,"" he added.
Berlin considers itself particularly committed to the Convention against Genocide due to its historical responsibility for the crimes against humanity committed by the Nazis, he said.
""This convention is a central instrument of international law to implement the 'never again' principle. We firmly oppose any political exploitation,"" Hebestreit said.
Both South Africa and Israel have signed the Genocide Convention, thereby committing themselves not only not to commit genocide, but also to prevent it.
South Africa cited quotes from Israeli ministers in favour of the eradication of the Gaza Strip as evidence.
This was rejected by Israel's legal representatives, who argued that those were not the views of the collective government.
Decisions of the UN court are binding, but it does not have the means to enforce them.
A decision could damage Israel's reputation, however, and further increase international pressure to end the fighting in Gaza."

Rob Bauer warned Thursday that a larger war with Russia and other adversaries is a real threat amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
Bauer, chair of the Western security alliance’s Military Committee, said “not everything is going to be hunky dory in the next 20 years.”
“I’m not saying it is going wrong tomorrow, but we have to realize it’s not a given that we are in peace,” he said at a press conference in Brussels. “That’s why we have the plans, that’s why we are preparing for conflict with Russia and the terror groups if it comes to it.”
Bauer emphasized the security alliance is defensive and does not seek conflict or a wider war.
“But if they attack us, we have to be ready,” he added.
Bauer gave the dire warning as NATO announced large-scale exercises next week involving all 31 alliance members, as well as candidate nation Sweden.
The military drills, which run until May and are the largest since the end of the Cold War, will involve 90,000 troops and numerous vehicles, aircraft and ships spread across Europe.
When announcing the drills, NATO leaders emphasized this week that it was vital to prepare for conflict and maintain readiness, even as the alliance remains defensive by nature.
The U.S. is aiding two wars in Israel and Ukraine in one of the most volatile global security challenges it has faced in years.

Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has sparked concerns that a Russian victory could pave the way for subsequent attack on NATO countries, while the Biden administration is fending off attacks from Iranian-backed groups across the Middle East as Washington seeks to contain a wider regional war from spilling out.
Bauer said the Western world needs to prepare for a potential larger war, saying such an effort would involve a “whole of society” approach if the war ever came.
“You have to think about this,” he said. “We’re not seeking war as NATO, but we have to be ready for war. That is our job.”

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese state media warned on Friday that a report by a prominent U.S. think tank on the military uses of Chinese scientific research across the Indian Ocean gave ""ammunition"" to countries bent on concocting threats from China.
The report this week by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ""comes at a time when some countries need to manufacture a 'China threat' narrative in the Indian Ocean region and provides them with ammunition"", the state-controlled tabloid Global Times said in an editorial.
""The timing of this report is delicate,"" given that the Maldives and China are upgrading ties after the election of President Mohamed Muizzu, while Sri Lanka recently suspended foreign research vessels, including from China, from visiting its ports.
The CSIS study traced data over four years of deployments by nominally Chinese civilian oceanographic and energy research ships, concluding that the work would in part serve the Chinese navy's needs to project power into the region.
Detailed knowledge of ocean depths, currents and temperature was vital to China's growing submarine operations, the study said.
""While scientific and commercial benefits may accrue from Chinese oceanographic research, these activities may also prove crucial for the (People's Liberation Army) in expanding its operational reach and capabilities in the Indian Ocean,"" it said.
""This expansion poses a significant challenge to key regional players like India, as well as to the United States and its allies.""
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China's marine scientific research fully complied with the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.
""We hope that the relevant parties will take an objective view of China's marine scientific research activities and refrain from speculating through coloured glasses,"" Mao said.
The Chinese defence ministry did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment.
Reuters last month outlined extensive Chinese military vulnerabilities across the Indian Ocean, where the its navy lacks a hard base network and air cover despite its reliance on oil shipments through the region.
The Global Times defended ongoing research missions, saying China and regional partners were exploring the natural ecology of the region ""without any hidden agenda"".
""The Indian Ocean is one of the least understood oceans by the scientific community, and a fundamental reason is the lack of sufficient on-site observations.""

Details: According to Syrskyi, Ukraine also needs aircraft that can launch long-range cruise missiles.
He noted that the A-10 would give decisive support to ground troops, because these aircraft are designed to destroy ground targets: tanks, artillery, etc.
The commander added that attack helicopters such as AH-64 Apache, AH-1 Super Cobra and UH-60 Black Hawk could also play an important role.
For reference: The American A-10 Thunderbolt is a subsonic attack aircraft manufactured in the United States, it has been in service since the 1970s.

Credit - Jacquelyn Martin—AFP/Getty Images
This week marks three months of war that continues to devastate Gaza as the bodies and rubble pile up in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre. What are the lessons to be learned, so far, from a Middle East war like no other?
It is the first war, since Israel’s creation in 1948, that the Jewish state is fighting on six fronts. In addition to Gaza, there is a marked upsurge in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, with Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and other radical pro-Iran Shia groups in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, visiting Israeli leaders on Tuesday, expressed concern that the entire region may succumb to instability. The U.S. and Israel agree that Iran is not-so-secretly stirring up these conflicts, but the Biden Administration insists that Israel’s smartest move now would be to lower the level of combat in Gaza and to focus on an exit strategy. Yet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared recently that the war will continue for many months.
The first lesson is that Israel is barely capable of conducting battles on all these fronts at once. Lebanon is particularly vexing, as Netanyahu’s government threatens Gaza-like destruction if Hezbollah doesn’t pull back from Israel’s border, as tens of thousands of Israelis have been evacuated from their towns and farms in northern Israel. This stands in sharp contrast to years of boasting by the Israel Defense Forces and leaders that the IDF was capable of repelling all military challenges from any direction. There hasn’t been another disaster like Oct. 7, but the array of lethal threats suggests a worrying conclusion: that Israel is weaker than at any time in its 75-year history.
In 1967, the IDF astounded the world by defeating Egypt, Jordan, and Syria in six days—capturing the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and the Golan Heights. But in more than 90 days, it has not been able to achieve victory in Gaza; the total elimination of Hamas is a seemingly impossible goal. The Israeli military estimates that 8,000 Hamas fighters have been killed since the war began, among the more than 23,000 Gazans listed as dead by the Strip’s Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza’s launchers and rockets, especially the long-range ones which were reaching Tel Aviv, have also been destroyed. But Hamas is still able to fire an occasional barrage toward Israel, where almost all have been intercepted by the Iron Dome defense system.
A second lesson is that Israeli commando units—considered to be right up there with Seal Team 6 as the best in the world—have not been able to rescue the hostages. Only one was found and freed by the IDF, which later suffered the shame of shooting dead three Israelis who were shirtless and waving a makeshift white flag. Some 136 hostages, including eight U.S. citizens, remain in Gaza and an IDF spokesman tells us that around 25 of them are “known” to be dead. It is a macabre fact that both sides are holding corpses to be part of hostages-for-prisoners exchanges.
A third lesson is that while Israelis count on American support, the warm backing expressed by President Joe Biden has limits. He authorized $3 billion in military aid to Israel, including 14,000 missiles for Iron Dome, and is asking Congress for $14 billion more. Yet on Monday, Biden declared that he is “quietly” putting pressure on Israel to “significantly get out of Gaza.” Secretary Blinken may be finding, as he visits Israel and other countries in the region, that Netanyahu is slightly toning down the combat. But can Netanyahu keep fending off Biden and Blinken’s burning questions: When will you stop the war? When will you let in more aid to Gaza? And what is the plan for the “day after” as Washington looks to kickstart a moribund two-state solution.
A fourth lesson centers on Netanyahu himself. He is continuing to play politics, postponing any investigation into who’s to blame for the security failures of Oct. 7, while he tries to wear the mantle of a heroic wartime Prime Minister. Israeli columnists highlighted the CIA’s conclusion that he is prolonging the war for his own selfish interests, to remain in power as corruption charges continue to play out at a snail’s pace in court. To maintain his coalition, he keeps bending to the will of extreme rightwing cabinet ministers who are intent on retaining the West Bank forever—and now talk about taking over the Gaza Strip and expelling the 2.2 million Palestinians who live there.
Every Middle East crisis brings to mind some instances of missed opportunities: roads not traveled that could have led to more peaceful outcomes. We think of various trips to Saudi Arabia, at the time kept secret, by the then Mossad spy chief Tamir Pardo, the head of military intelligence General Aviv Kochavi, and the IDF chief of staff Benny Gantz. The head of Saudi intelligence, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, urged them to give up territories captured in 1967 and credibly commit to the two-state solution. But Netanyahu rejected the Saudi peace plan in favor of the status quo.
Since then, Netanyahu’s “divide and rule” tactics have backfired. For years, he let Qatar deliver billions of dollars to Hamas to prevent the emergence of a unified Palestinian leadership, recently boasting that he’s proud to have blocked the creation of a Palestinian state. That approach helped Hamas win more recruits and build up its military strength, including the construction of the tunnels that the IDF struggles to locate, clear, and destroy without killing all the hostages.
The results of Netanyahu’s narrow-minded path have led to catastrophe for both Israelis and Palestinians and nearly constant border fire between Israel and Hezbollah. Elsewhere in the region, trouble has been brewing with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels attacking international shipping in the Red Sea and the accelerated nuclear enrichment by Tehran—the kind of regional instability that President Biden feared.
Both the U.S. and Israel—as Middle East commentators declare with either alarm or pleasure—appear weak and vulnerable. There are more lessons still to be learned, and they are likely to be bitter ones.

“We have to take into account that Vladimir Putin will one day even attack a Nato country,” said Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister.
“Our experts expect a period of five to eight years in which this could be possible,” he told Der Tagesspiegel, a German newspaper. “At the moment I don’t think a Russian attack is likely.”
Europe is dealing with a “military threat situation … that has not existed for 30 years,” he added. “We hear threats from the Kremlin almost every day – most recently against our friends in the Baltics.”
The Baltic nations are taking steps to increase border security given those increased security concerns after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on Friday signed an agreement to build bunkers over the next few years to bolster the defences along their borders with Russia and Belarus, a staunch ally of Moscow.
Under the agreement, signed in Riga, the three countries will “construct anti-mobility defensive installations in the coming years to deter and, if necessary, defend against military threats”, the Estonian defence ministry in a statement.
The plan, and Mr Pistorius’s comments, came the day after a top Nato military official warned that civilians in the West must prepare for the possibility of all-out war with Russia in the next 20 years, and be ready to mobilise if necessary.
While various militaries are primed for the outbreak of war, the general public must also be ready for a conflict that would mean a wholesale change in their lives, said Adml Bauer, a Dutch naval officer who chairs the Nato military committee.
“We have to realise it’s not a given that we are in peace,” he said. “And that’s why we [Nato] are preparing for a conflict with Russia.
“But the discussion is much wider. It is also the industrial base and also the people that have to understand they play a role.”
Finland, which became Nato’s latest member when it joined last April, does not see any immediate military threat from Russia, the country’s prime minister said on Friday. “I don’t see any immediate military threat from Russia against Finland,” Petteri Orpo said. “We in Finland sleep peacefully at night, because we are well prepared.”
Concerns over global peace have grown, too, as the Israel-Hamas war continues and has begun to spill over in the Middle East.
With Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine approaching its two-year anniversary, global stockpiles of weapons and ammunition have been whittled down significantly.
Adml Bauer warned that more preparation is needed now to ensure there aren’t shortages of materiel in the future.
“You need to be able to fall back on an industrial base that is able to produce weapons and ammunition fast enough to be able to continue a conflict if you are in it,” he said.
The EU has been unable to deliver on plans to send one million 155mm artillery shells to Kyiv by Februrary, impacting the ability for the Ukrainian military to return fire against the Russians.
Meanwhile, in Washington, US support for Ukraine has ground to a halt in the face of mounting opposition from Republicans.
Europe, said Adm Bauer, must be ready to defend itself if it can no longer count on the US for support.
“We have a nuclear shield with the Americans and the French have the ‘force de frappe’,” Mr Pistorius said, referring to the French nuclear deterrent. “There are no signs that the nuclear shield will evaporate or be dismantled. If this threatens to happen, we as Europeans must deal with it together.”

The three countries have stepped up joint efforts to deter North Korea in recent years, including trilateral meetings and creating a missile warning data-sharing system.
Moscow and Pyongyang have strengthened their military cooperation since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
North Korea's transfer of short-range ballistic missiles and other weapons to Russia for use against Ukraine requires attention and coordinated action, Jung Pak, a U.S. senior official for North Korea, said at the Seoul meeting, as cited by Reuters.
According to the White House, Russia used North Korea-supplied ballistic missiles for the first time to attack Ukraine in late December and early January. Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Andrii Kostin later said that investigators have gathered preliminary evidence that Russia fired a North Korean missile at Kharkiv in its mass attack on Jan. 2.

North Korea has supplied Russia with around one million rounds of ammunition, Ukraine’s military intelligence official said on Jan. 15, while South Korea warned on Jan. 11 that its northern neighbor may also sell Russia new types of tactical guided missiles.
The U.S. assesses that in return for supplying the ballistic missiles, North Korea seeks from Russia fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic missile production equipment, and other advanced military technologies.
""The United States is also deeply concerned by the recent uptick in hostile rhetoric, particularly toward the Republic of Korea from the DPRK (North Korean) regime,"" Pak added in Seoul.
The meeting of the nuclear envoys took place days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for changing his country's constitution to declare South Korea its ""primary foe,"" saying Pyongyang had no intention of avoiding war should it happen.
Japan's envoy, Hiroyuki Namazu, condemned Pyongyang's recent launch of a hypersonic missile, adding there must be close monitoring of what Russia can provide to North Korea in exchange for arms, according to Reuters.
The U.S. and nearly 50 countries earlier called for an immediate end to the delivery of weapons from Pyongyang to Moscow.

Palm Parade Real Estate examined the average number of monthly Google searches made for different home aesthetics, paired with terms like “decor” and “style,” to name the most popular décor in each state.
How Franklin County homeowners can view and pay their new property tax bill
The most popular aesthetic in Ohio and 43 other states, Boho is described by Palm Parade as “a free-spirited and eclectic style that embraces a variety of patterns, textures, and brilliant colors characterizes the Boho or Bohemian approach to the home.” The company said tapestries, woven wall hangings, and diverse collections are common in Boho rooms.
“The Boho aesthetic is the most popular choice across the nation likely due to the fact that it allows people to express themselves openly, as well as allowing them to demonstrate their individuality through a combination of worldwide influences,” said Palm Parade in a release.
The Farmhouse aesthetic came second in Ohio, evoking “a sense of warmth and simplicity,” with exposed wooden beams and reclaimed accents. “It helps to create a warm and inviting ambiance with its neutral color palettes, particularly whites and muted tones,” said Palm Parade.

In third, Steampunk is defined by a combination of Victorian-era design, industrial components and futuristic fantasies. Palm Parade said this style is inspired by steam-powered machinery from the nineteenth century as well as speculative science fiction. The color scheme is rich and dark, with deep browns, burgundy, and metallic tones.
Grunge came in fourth, and is “raw, edgy, and effortlessly stylish style that draws inspiration from the alternative music and fashion subculture of the 1990s,” said Palm Parade. Grunge home décor components include plaid patterns, dark hues, and DIY touches, reflecting a “rebellious and nonconformist mentality.”

In Fifth, Art Deco is distinguished by a “lavish and glamorous design style” that originated in the 1920s and 1930s. It has bold geometric patterns, symmetrical shapes, and an opulent feel to it. Palm Parade said rich jewel tones, metallics, and high-contrast combinations are frequently used in the color pallet.

Ron DeSantis’ crucial tests in the Iowa presidential caucuses and New Hampshire primary. And experts say that’s not a coincidence.
“It’s one thing for a large state’s leading health officer to be an advocate for shared values,” said Kenneth Goodman, the director of the University of Miami Institute for Bioethics and Health Policy. “It’s another to weaponize medical misinformation to trick citizens into voting for his boss.”
Ladapo called for a complete halt in the use of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines earlier this month. A few days later, he called the mRNA vaccines “the antichrist” on Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast.
Ladapo’s growing war against the vaccines comes in the wake of a surprise appearance with DeSantis on the presidential campaign trail in November. The New Hampshire event, dubbed a “Medical Freedom Town Hall,” was a rare move even as the lines between official and political events have been increasingly blurred by the DeSantis administration.
“It is a choice to be as public as Ladapo has been,” said Gregory Koger, a professor of political science at the University of Miami. “… It seems like an effort to kindle interest among a narrow fringe of anti-vaxxers.”
Ladapo claimed that DNA fragments used in the vaccine’s development could integrate into human DNA, resulting in various problems, including cancer. Federal leaders and others in the scientific community fired back, saying the possibility of that happening was theoretical and implausible.
Dr. Kenneth Alexander, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Nemours Children’s Health in Orlando, dismissed the allegation as recycled rhetoric from anti-vaccine circles. “These are the claims you’ve heard from anti-vax people for decades,” he said.
He emphasized that the COVID-19 vaccines are “probably the most studied vaccines in history,” with over a billion doses administered.
“I would argue that the U.S. has the best post-marketing surveillance of vaccines in the world. We’re not seeing any of this stuff,” he said.
DeSantis, who appointed Ladapo in late 2021, shifted from a governor who traveled the length of the state to promote the COVID-19 vaccines earlier that year to one who later called for a grand jury to investigate “wrongdoing” by their creators.
His eventual turn against what he calls “the jab” came after he gained national attention for his stance against most COVID restrictions, despite his shutdown of the state in May 2020 that closed bars and limited capacity at restaurants through the summer.
But the same “Free State of Florida” pandemic-era rhetoric that propelled him to prominence has since faded as an issue in the Republican presidential primary.
DeSantis trails former President Donald Trump by huge margins in most state polls and is battling former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for second place in Iowa and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy for third in New Hampshire.
“There probably is a narrow market for that,” Koger said of anti-vaccine sentiment. “He’s campaigning for small slices of the Republican electorate in both states, and in Iowa he needs to appeal to people who want to get up out of their homes on a cold January night and go to a high school gym for a couple hours.
“And anti-vax people might fit that description. … He can use every additional voter he can get.”
Dave Peterson, a political scientist at Iowa State University, said Iowa’s Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, a key DeSantis endorser, “was very, very similar to DeSantis on COVID, and part of her popularity in the party was her COVID policy. So maybe he is trying to remind them of that.”
But, he added, “at some point, a lot of folks have moved on from that. If that is a campaign strategy, it’s a surprise to me at least. I don’t think it would be a very effective one.”
DeSantis campaign spokesman Bryan Griffin did not respond to a request for comment on whether Ladapo was doing the campaign’s bidding.
In New Hampshire, the “Live Free or Die” state, the Republican Party has a reputation for being individualistic and libertarian-leaning. But even there, said Dante Scala, a political scientist at the University of New Hampshire, COVID is not a major issue.
“There is some of that kind of anti-vaccine sentiment up here,” Scala said. “But what I’ve been more struck by is how COVID has really declined in relevance for Republican voters in this cycle. … It’s certainly not any sort of magic rocket fuel. It just doesn’t matter.”
Ladapo’s campaign appearance in New Hampshire in November was part of the campaign’s repeated attempts to attack Trump, whose administration launched the vaccine initiative called Operation Warp Speed.
While Ladapo told the crowd he had “nothing against Mr. Trump,” according to CNN, DeSantis used the event to slam Trump’s pandemic record and vowed to radically reform the nation’s health agencies.
One group backing DeSantis even used artificial intelligence to create a fake image of Trump hugging his White House health adviser Anthony Fauci, a hated figure on the right.
“I think DeSantis was hoping he would be able to kind of connect Trump to Fauci and that would pay dividends, but I just don’t see it,” Scala said. “Part of that is, no one’s figured out how to make something stick to Trump.”
In New Hampshire, Ladapo claimed to be surprised to find himself on the campaign trail.
“On the spectrum of ‘where do you want to spend your time and your energy and your life,’ politics was about as far away as you can imagine for me,” he said, according to CNN.
But Ladapo has been at the center of a political firestorm over mRNA vaccines for years. His statements this month were just the latest in a series of recommendations criticized by some experts as contributing to vaccine hesitancy without adequate evidence.
Previously, Ladapo advised against COVID-19 vaccines for healthy kids, then men ages 18-39, and later recommended against them for those under 65, culminating in this month’s call to end their use entirely. All these recommendations contradicted guidelines from the CDC and FDA, prompting leaders of those agencies to publicly rebuke him.
While Ladapo has conducted analyses of vaccine safety data through the Florida Department of Health, which he says support his positions, others in the medical community have criticized these studies.
“I think they’re poorly done. They’ve been unpublished. And they’ve been misuses of databases,” Alexander said. “We’re doing bad research, and publishing bad guidance that contradicts what public health experts around the world are saying.”
In a prior interview with the Sentinel, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf questioned the quality of an October 2022 report from the Florida Department of Health on the risk of cardiac-related death post-vaccine, stating it “lacked the quality of analysis needed to draw a conclusion.”
Public records from FDOH obtained by the Orlando Sentinel and South Florida Sun Sentinel showed that Ladapo removed analyses from the paper, pre-publication, that would have weakened the association between vaccination and cardiac-related death.
Ladapo said that was a normal part of the revision process, but others in the health research field previously told the Orlando Sentinel and Sun Sentinel his revisions took out necessary context and constituted scientific fraud.
Several instances where Ladapo cited peer-reviewed, published studies by other researchers to support his recommendations against the COVID vaccine were also met with rebuttals.
Researchers accused him of misrepresenting their conclusions, with one scientist accusing him of “cherry-picking” sentences from her paper to support his argument in an interview with the Tampa Bay Times.
In his appearance on Bannon’s show, he called the mRNA vaccines “the antichrist of all products. … It’s just complete disrespect to the human genome and the importance of protecting it and preserving it. And that is our connection to God.”
In the end, if Ladapo’s latest attacks on COVID vaccines were partly a continuation of his insertion into the DeSantis campaign, it would probably be for naught, Scala said.
“DeSantis’ campaign in New Hampshire is one long painful example of inability to move the needle,” Scala said. “This is just one more example.”"

The panda cub took a 4.5-hour-long flight to China via Singapore Airlines.
The flag carrier said it spent the past five months preparing for Le Le's trip home.
Singapore Airlines was given a monumental task in January: They were put in charge of sending Le Le, a 2.5-year-old giant panda cub, to China.
Born in August 2021, Le Le was Singapore's first giant panda cub. The cub's parents, Kai Kai and Jia Jia, traveled to Singapore on loan in 2012. Both pandas are set to return to China in 2027.
Le Le, however, has to be separated from his parents. Due to conservation concerns, China requires host countries to return any cubs born there.
The journey back home was a complicated one to execute.
""The Singapore Airlines team has spent the last five months poring through every little detail to prepare for this special flight,"" said Gajandran Sokayan, an assistant manager at the airline who oversees dangerous goods and special cargo.
Le Le made one last public appearance in Singapore on December 13 at River Wonders, Singapore's river-themed wildlife park. The cub went into quarantine for the big journey on December 14.
The zoo's team then used positive reinforcement training to familiarize the cub with a custom travel crate.
The crate was equipped with removable plywood boards for feedings and checks.
On the day of the big move, Le Le's crate had to be transported from the zoo to the airport with an air-conditioned truck. The truck's temperature was kept between 12 and 16 degrees Celsius to keep things nice and cool for the furry traveler.
After arriving at the airport, Le Le's crate had to be secured to a pallet before loading it onto the plane. This pallet also contained travel essentials for the giant panda cub. The total weight of the palletized crate was around 600 kilograms.
The pallet was then loaded through the nose of SIA's Boeing 747-400F freighter aircraft. Like the reefer truck, the plane had to be pre-cooled one hour before boarding.
The pallet was then locked in position on the aircraft before takeoff to reduce movement during the flight.
Le Le didn't travel alone — he was accompanied by a keeper and veterinarian from Singapore and a zookeeper from China.
The giant panda cub was also served a special in-flight meal during his journey — bamboo, bamboo shoots, fruit, pellets, and water.
SIA said in a press release on Wednesday that Le Le arrived safely in China on January 16. The panda cub is now being quarantined, and the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda will soon assign Le Le to a new, permanent home.

The city, home to two refugee camps, shows the scars of the increasing number of Israeli military operations in the West Bank targeting militant strongholds.
Israeli raids were not uncommon before the war triggered by Hamas's bloody October 7 attack, but the conflict has caused a marked intensification.
The Israeli army says it is ""conducting night-time counterterrorism operations to apprehend suspects, many of whom are members of the terrorist organisation Hamas"", and that there have been ""over 700 attempted attacks"" in the West Bank since the start of the war.
But Said, a 23-year-old Palestinian militant in Nur Shams, said the operations were an attempt at ""revenge"" against Palestinians.
""They can't get over what happened on October 7, they didn't anticipate it,"" he told AFP, weapon in hand.
The young militant is a member of the ""Tulkarm Brigade"", an armed Palestinian organisation that brings together various militant factions.
Since the start of the war in Gaza, Israeli forces have conducted eight raids in Tulkarm, including four in December, a militant in the camp told AFP on condition of anonymity.
On October 20, the Israeli army announced the death of a border guard after a confrontation with armed men in the camp.
More than 330 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by the Israeli army or settlers since October 7, including at least 35 in Tulkarm, according to an AFP tally based on figures from the Palestinian health ministry.
Tulkarm, in the northern West Bank, sits directly on the border with Israel.
- 'Home turned upsidedown' -
The Hamas attack resulted in around 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.
In response, Israel vowed to destroy the militant group and launched a massive bombardment and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip which have killed nearly 24,000 people, mostly women and children, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.
At a bend in an alley, Assoum, a 26-year-old militant, was navigating his vehicle between piles of rubble.
""Nothing will stop us,"" he said, adding that support for the brigade was widespread. ""The entire camp is a battalion.""
Said and Assoum are both former prisoners of Israel and said they wanted to ""bring an end to the occupation"".
On December 26, while demolishing the home of a wanted individual, the Israeli army caused severe damage to the home of Yousef Zendiq, 50.
""My house is uninhabitable"" and ""my clothes are in the car"" said the father of four.
With nowhere to live, he set up a tent.
A week ago, the Israeli army raided the home of one of his relatives, Sabhia Zendiq, 65, and arrested her along with her husband, before releasing them.
When she returned home, she found her home turned upside down.
Israeli soldiers ""entered the house and came back with a bag of children's toys, including some plastic guns, and declared 'you are terrorists'"", she said.
""They want revenge,"" her husband said. ""What they can't do in Gaza they do here.""
- 'A little Gaza' -
Sitting amid the rubble, Tamim Khreis, a school principal, was sipping coffee with friends.
The 42-year-old charged that the Israelis ""want to destroy people, displace them and break their resilience"".
Sitting with Khreis, his friend Abdelkader Hamdan interrupted to say: ""Before,(the Israelis) drove them out,"" referring to what Arabs call the Nakba (""Catastrophe"") of 1948 when the establishment of the State of Israel forced 760,000 Palestinians from their homes.
""Today they are pursuing them in the place where they were expelled to,"" Hamdan said.
On Al-Manshiya street, all that remained of a two-storey building that once housed a kindergarten and a wedding hall were children's drawings on the outer walls and a stone plaque with the logo of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.
Saleh, 10, was playing nearby with his friends. ""It's a nursery school, what do they want with it?"" he asked.
""Al-Manshiya is like a little Gaza.""

Germany has offered to intervene on Israel's behalf in the case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.
President Hage Geingob urged Germany to ""reconsider its untimely decision to intervene as a third-party in defence"".
In 2021 Berlin acknowledged committing genocide in Namibia.
German colonisers massacred more than 70,000 Herero and Nama people between 1904 and 1908. Historians consider this to be the 20th Century's first genocide.
President Geingob said Germany could not ""morally express commitment to the United Nations Convention against genocide, including atonement for the genocide in Namibia"" and at the same time support Israel.
""The German Government is yet to fully atone for the genocide it committed on Namibian soil,"" he added.
On Friday the German government said the accusation of genocide against Israel was completely unfounded and amounted to a ""political instrumentalisation"" of the UN genocide convention.
""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Holocaust, the government sees itself as particularly committed to the genocide convention,"" it said.
It said Hamas - which attacked Israel on 7 October, triggering the current war - aimed to destroy Israel, which was acting in self defence.
Hamas killed about 1,300 people, most of them civilians, and took about 240 others hostage on 7 October.
Since then Israel has killed nearly 24,000 people, mostly children and women, in its retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The UN and humanitarian organisations have warned of the risk of famine in Gaza as well as the spread of disease among displaced people and have urged that more aid be allowed into the territory.
The scale of the Israeli response prompted South Africa to ask the ICJ to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.
Pretoria's case included a litany of alleged Israeli offences, from the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians to the wholesale destruction of Gaza's infrastructure.
Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"" and its legal team was scathing about South Africa's submission, arguing that if anyone was guilty of genocide, it was Hamas.

China has been closely monitoring the use of Kinzhals in Ukraine to gauge how these missiles fare against the American Patriot systems used by the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
Beijing hopes that China's own hypersonic missiles would give the country an advantage over the U.S. in a potential war. However, Chinese defense analysts are questioning the effectiveness of the Russian missile.
“There is more and more evidence showing that what the US and Ukraine say on this matter is true,” Chinese defense analyst Yin Jie wrote in the Shaanxi military magazine Ordnance Industry Science and Technology in November.
Though journals do not necessarily reflect the views of military intelligence, these types of publications do not appear in China without state approval.
Yin published a surprisingly critical review of how Russia uses its Kinzhals, stating the missile is “unlikely to have a significant impact” on the battlefield.
Read also:  Russia's missile, drone arsenal growing warns Ukrainian Air Force
He described the Kinzhal as an evolution of the Russian ground-based Iskander missile, quickly completed as part of a “short-term, hasty project” that was forced due to pressure from Western competitors in the pre-war years.
“This missile, which was developed based on the technical framework of the 1980s, may not have any amazing battlefield performance,” wrote Yin.
The maneuverability of the Kinzhal “cannot be compared to that of a true hypersonic missile,” and its ballistic trajectory makes the Kinzhal vulnerable to Patriots.
A similar view can be found in “Showdown between the Dagger [Kinzhal] and the Patriot in Ukraine,” an analysis published by the prominent Beijing defense and science journal Military Arms. This analysis states that the Kinzhal is at best a “conditionally hypersonic missile.”
“Although Russia calls the 'Dagger' a hypersonic missile, analysts from other countries generally believe that the so-called hypersonic 'Dagger' missile is actually an air-launched version of the 'Iskander' short-range tactical ballistic missile,” the article states.
Read also:  Three powerful missile attacks in a short time. What is Russia's goal?
This assessment coincides with what Western experts have said about the Kinzhal — that it is not a “real” hypersonic missile because it cannot effectively maneuver at hypersonic speeds, though it can achieve them.
Yin also criticized the process of using these missiles. Russia stopped launching Kinzhals from MiG-31 aircraft, deciding instead to use slower Su-34 aircraft — too slow to launch these missiles at optimal speed. Already slower than the MiG-31, the Su-34 is further burdened by the heavy Kinzhal.
Another drawback is the Russian satellite guidance system for the missiles, which does not have enough satellites to ensure accuracy.
Russia simply does not have enough Kinzhals: Western sanctions have limited Moscow's ability to rapidly produce weapons, restricting the use of the missiles.

Source: ERR, an Estonian news outlet, with reference to Estonia’s state budget strategy
Details: Marijn Ratnik, Vice-Chancellor of the Estonian Foreign Affairs Ministry, said that the Estonian International Development Centre (ESTDEV) will receive €12.8; €1 million will be used to provide humanitarian aid to Ukraine; and another €200,000 will be used to support cooperation between Estonian and Ukrainian businesses, specifically establishing business ties between businesses in the two countries.
ERR reported that this new aid plan has been outlined in Estonia’s long-term development cooperation strategy that the Estonian government approved in early January and is in line with existing plans for the rebuilding of Ukraine.
Ratnik said that the Estonian government has singled out several areas where this funding will be particularly useful.
""Those are the sectors where we ourselves have faced challenges in the past, because we have also had to transition from the same system that Ukraine is now trying to transition from; [the money will be used to support Ukraine’s] education reform, healthcare, and digital and cyber solutions,"" she explained.
Given the recent announcement of the start of negotiations on Ukraine’s accession to the European Union, Estonia will be able to share with Ukraine its experience in this transition process, as well as in obtaining and utilising EU subsidies, Ratnik added.
She said that current estimates suggest that Ukraine will need €400 billion for post-war rebuilding projects and that only large donors such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the European Investment Bank can provide this type of assistance.
""These institutions don’t just single-handedly implement projects but also help with project-based funding, which [a country] can apply for,"" Ratnik explained, noting that Estonian firms can do so too.

Kyrylo Budanov, who serves as chief of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense's Main Directorate of Intelligence, said that 2024 will see much greater efforts to reclaim territory in Crimea.
""In 2023, the first Ukrainian incursions took place in temporarily occupied Crimea,"" Budanov said in an interview with French outlet Le Monde. ""And this is just the beginning.""

Budanov acknowledged the two countries' mutual inability to make substantive land gains as both are dug into trenches on the front lines.
""The very intensive use of attack drones has made both Russian and Ukrainian offensives impossible,"" he said of the territorial stalemate, adding that ""another factor has been the density of minefields, unprecedented since World War II.""

""A certain Russian paradox surprised me. Everyone thought that Moscow had a strong army and a weak economy. It turns out that the opposite is true,"" Budanov said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will not consider a cease-fire with Russia, claiming it would only help the invading military bolster its power.
Zelenskyy made the comments during a visit to Estonia meant to raise support for continued funding of the war effort.

""A pause would play into [Russia’s] hands,"" he added. ""It might crush us afterward.""

This marks the first agreement between the warring sides since a weeklong cease-fire collapsed in late November.
In Yemen, the U.S. launched the third strike in recent days against the Houthi rebel group, according to a U.S. official. The Houthis have attacked shipping in the crucial Red Sea corridor, saying they seek to halt Israel’s war in Gaza against Hamas.
In northern Gaza, Palestinian militants battled Israeli forces and launched a barrage of rockets from farther south. In the past 24 hours, the bodies of 158 people killed in Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals, bringing the Palestinian death toll to 24,285 people, Gaza's Health Ministry said Tuesday.
In Israel, around 1,200 people were killed during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that sparked the war and saw some 250 people taken hostage by the militants.
Currently:
— After over 100 days of war, Palestinians fight in hard-hit areas of Gaza and fire rockets at Israel.
— Hamas fights with a patchwork of weapons built by Iran, China, Russia and North Korea.
— A freed Israeli hostage relives horrors of captivity and fears for her husband, still held in Gaza.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday forced colleagues to decide whether to investigate human rights abuses in the Israel-Hamas war, a step toward potentially limiting U.S. military aid to Israel.
Senators overwhelmingly rejected the effort, a first of its kind that would have required the U.S. State Department to produce a report within 30 days on whether the Israeli war effort in Gaza is violating human rights and international accords. Had the vote passed and the administration failed to do so, U.S. military aid to Israel, long assured without question, could have been quickly halted.
In all, 11 senators joined Sanders in the vote, while 72 opposed. The White House has rejected Sanders' approach as “unworkable.”
MACRON SAYS FRANCE DIDN'T JOIN U.S. STRIKES ON YEMEN TO AVOID ESCALATING TENSIONS
PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron said his country decided not to join U.S.-led strikes against Houthis attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea because France is seeking to avoid escalation in Mideast tensions.
French warships in the zone will continue to help defend shipping corridors and the freedom of navigation, he said, noting that the French Navy has already intercepted missiles and drones targeting commercial ships in the Red Sea in recent weeks.
Asked at a news conference in Paris why France didn’t join U.S.-led military operations against the Houthis, Macron said, ‘’France decided not to join a coalition that carried out preventive strikes against others on their soil. Why? Because we have a posture that seeks to avoid any escalation. ... It’s a diplomatic issue, because we are vigilant and attentive about balance in the region.’’
The Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The group says it has attacked the ships in response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel.
Macron called for a cease-fire in Gaza and stressed France’s efforts to mediate in the region’s conflicts, including an unprecedented deal negotiated along with Qatar to deliver medicines Wednesday to hostages held by Hamas.
Macron noted that 41 French citizens were killed in the Hamas attack, and four French people are among those still held hostage in Gaza.
UNITED NATIONS CALLS FOR YEMEN'S HOUTHIS TO STOP ATTACKS ON SHIPPING
UNITED NATIONS – The United Nations is calling on Yemen’s Houthi rebels to implement the Security Council resolution adopted last week demanding an immediate halt to its attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
“We’re very concerned by the continuing strikes,” U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday.
The Iranian-backed Houthis, who have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen’s internationally recognized government since 2014, have said they launched the attacks with the aim of ending Israel’s devastation air-and-ground offensive in the Gaza Strip.
The U.N. resolution condemns the more than two dozen Houthi attacks which have disrupted one of the world’s major trade routes and raised shipping costs.
Dujarric said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke to Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian on Monday about the situation in the Red Sea and in Gaza. The U.N. chief “reiterated his call to all the parties to avoid any further escalation” in Yemen and implement last week’s resolution, and reiterated the need for greater humanitarian access in Gaza and the immediate release of all hostages, the U.N. spokesman said.
The U.N. special envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, who has been consulting with all sides, spoke to the Iranian foreign minister’s senior advisor, Ali Asghar Khaji ,earlier Tuesday, Dujarric said. They discussed “the need to maintain an environment conducive to constructive dialogue and sustained concerted regional efforts to peace in Yemen,” the U.N. spokesperson said. Grundberg and others then briefed the Security Council behind closed doors.
TWO ISRAELI HOSTAGES CONFIRMED DEAD IN GAZA
JERUSALEM — Two Israeli men who were captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack have been confirmed dead after the militant group released a video saying they were killed in Israeli airstrikes.
A forum for families of hostages released statements Tuesday confirming that Yossi Sharabi, 53, and Itai Svirsky, 38, had died in captivity in Gaza. They did not say how the men died.
The two were kidnapped from Kibbutz Be’eri, one of several communities near Gaza that Hamas and other militants overran after breaking through Israel’s border defenses. The attack ignited the war in Gaza, which is still raging.
Hamas released a video on Monday showing Sharabi and Svirsky giving statements on camera, likely under duress, followed by images of what appeared to be their dead bodies. It said they were killed in Israeli airstrikes.
Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, said Monday that the army had feared for their lives. He said Israeli forces had struck a building near where the hostages were being held but did not know their location at the time.
Hamas and other militants captured some 250 people in the Oct. 7 attack. More than 100 were released in November during a weeklong cease-fire in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Most of the rest are still in captivity.
Hamas has said no more hostages will be released until there is a permanent cease-fire.
BERNIE SANDERS TO MAKE U.S. SENATORS VOTE ON INVESTIGATING ISRAEL FOR POSSIBLE WAR CRIMES IN GAZA
WASHINGTON — In a notable test Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders is forcing colleagues to vote on record whether to investigate human rights abuses in the Israel-Hamas war, a step toward potentially limiting U.S. military aid to Israel as its devastating attacks on Gaza grind past 100 days.
The Senate vote, a first of its kind tapping into a decades-old law, would require the U.S. State Department to, within 30 days, produce a report on whether the Israeli war effort in Gaza is violating human rights and international accords. If so, U.S. military aid to Israel, long assured without question, could be quickly halted.
While the Senate is unlikely to approve the measure, the vote by senators will begin to reveal the depth of unease among U.S. lawmakers over Israel’s prosecution of the war against Hamas. With no apparent end to the bombardment, Israel’s attacks against Palestinians, an attempt to root out Hamas leaders, are viewed by some as disproportional to the initial terrorist attack on Israel.
DEAL WILL A LLOW DELIVERY OF MEDICINE TO ISRAELI HOSTAGES, AND HUMANITARIAN AID TO GAZA
JERUSALEM — Qatar and France say they have mediated a deal between Israel and Hamas to allow the delivery of medications to the more than 100 Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza.
The Gulf Arab country announced Tuesday that additional quantities of humanitarian aid would be delivered to Palestinians in Gaza as part of the deal.
It marks the first agreement between the warring sides since a weeklong cease-fire collapsed in late November.
France said it had been working on the deal since October, and would provide three months’ worth of medication for 45 hostages with chronic illnesses, as well as other medicines and vitamins. The medicines are expected to enter Gaza from Egypt on Wednesday.
Hamas captured the hostages in its Oct. 7 cross-border attack that began the war. The hostages have not been visited by the Red Cross, and many, including several elderly men, are believed to be in desperate need of medication.
Qatar said the deal was reached with French assistance. The medicines are expected to be delivered on Wednesday.
U.S. STRIKES HIT YEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS FOR THIRD TIME
WASHINGTON — The U.S. launched a new strike against the Yemen-based Houthis on Tuesday, hitting anti-ship missiles in a third assault on the Iranian-backed group in recent days, a U.S. official said.
The U.S. official said no other details were available yet on the American strike, including the precise location. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the operation had not been made public.
The strike came as the Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile attack against the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Zografia in the Red Sea. No one was injured. The Greek-owned vessel had been heading north to the Suez Canal when it was attacked, the Greek Shipping and Island Policy Ministry said.
This latest exchange suggests there has been no let-up in Houthi attacks on shipping in the region, despite the massive U.S. and British assault on the group Friday, bombing more than 60 targets in 28 locations.
A Saudi-led, U.S.-backed war in Yemen against the Houthis has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. The conflict, which began in 2014, has slowed to a stalemate as the Houthis maintain control of the capital and northern and western Yemen, where most of the population lives.

AL-JAZEERA BUREAU CHIEF WHO LOST WIFE AND CHILDREN IN GAZA IS SEEKING TREATMENT ABROAD
CAIRO — Al-Jazeera’s veteran bureau chief in Gaza, who lost his wife, three of his children and a grandchild in Israeli airstrikes, has left the territory for medical treatment.
The head of Egypt’s journalist syndicate, Khaled al-Balshy, says Wael Dahdouh will travel to Qatar, where Al Jazeera is based, for medical treatment. Dahdouh, 53, crossed into Egypt earlier.
He has reported continuously on the fighting between Israel and Hamas even as it has taken a devastating toll on his own family abd was wounded in an Israeli airstrike last month that killed a cameraman working with him.
Dahdouh told Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV that he would get treatment for the hand injury he suffered in the strike and would return to work, without providing further details.
He has been the face of Al Jazeera’s 24-hour coverage of the war for millions of Arabic-speaking viewers across the region.
EUROPEAN UNION PUTS HAMAS LEADER IN GAZA ON ITS TERRORIST LIST
BRUSSELS — The European Union said Tuesday that is has put the mastermind behind the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, Hamas leader Yehya Sinwar, on its terrorist list.
EU headquarters said the move was in “response to the threat posed by Hamas and its brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks in Israel.”
The EU says Sinwar “is subject to the freezing of his funds and other financial assets in EU member states. It is also prohibited for EU operators to make funds and economic resources available to him.” No further details were provided.
Israel believes Sinwar is operating from tunnels somewhere in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.
In November, the EU froze the funds and other assets in Europe of Mohammed Deif, the commander general of Hamas’ military wing, and of deputy commander Marwan Issa.
Hamas and its military wing have been on the EU’s terrorist list as organizations for about 20 years.
QATAR'S PRIME MINISTER SPEAKS OF GAZA'S DESTRUCTION: ''GAZA IS NOT THERE ANY MORE.'
JERUSALEM — Qatar’s prime minister offered stinging criticism of Israel and the international community on Tuesday over the ongoing Israeli war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who also serves as Qatar’s foreign minister, said a two-state solution was required to end the conflict and warned that Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and the Israeli response showed the region could not go back to the way it was before.
“Gaza is not there anymore. I mean, there is nothing over there,” he said, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""It’s carpet bombing everywhere.”
He also brought up the ongoing tensions in the West Bank, which has seen Palestinians killed as well by Israeli security forces, and urged for an end to Palestinian divisions.
""We cannot have a two-state solution without having a government and politicians in Israel who believe in coexisting together side by side peacefully and we cannot have all this ongoing without ending this war,” he said.
He warned that a military confrontation in the Mideast waterways “will not contain” the attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels who on Monday fired a missile, striking a U.S.-owned ship just off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden.
“What we have right now in the region is a recipe of escalation everywhere,” Sheikh Mohammed added.
ISRAEL SAYS ROCKETS FIRED FROM GAZA, REPORTEDLY ONE OF THE STRONGEST BOMBARDMENTS IN MORE THAN A WEEK
TEL AVIV — Israel says a barrage of at least 25 rockets was launched on Tuesday from the Gaza Strip toward southern Israel, damaging a store. It was one of the strongest bombardments from Gaza in more than a week.
It came a day after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the Israeli army was expanding military control from northern Gaza toward other parts of the strip.
Hamas has continued to fire rockets at Israel throughout the war, even as Israel says it is dismantling Hamas’s military capabilities in ever-expanding areas of Gaza. Israeli Channel 12 TV said the rockets on Tuesday were launched from the central Gaza town of Bureij.
In the area of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, Israeli troops located approximately 100 rocket set-installations and 60 ready-to-use rockets, the military said, claiming its forces killed dozens of militants during the activity.
At a news conference on Monday, Gallant said he expects military operations in southern Gaza to “end soon” but gave no timeframe. He spoke a day after the White House called on Israel to curtail its offensive.
Gallant said Israel is still targeting Hamas’ leaders, calling them the “head of the snake” and said they are believed to be hiding in Khan Younis, the southern city where the offensive has been focused in recent weeks.
He stressed that military pressure is the only way to win the release of the more than 100 hostages still in Hamas captivity. “Only from a position of strength can we ensure the release of hostages,” he said.
ISRAELI MILITARY LOOKING INTO WEST BANK CLASHES ON MONDAY THAT KILLED A PALESTINIAN WOMAN
TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it’s reviewing an incident in the occupied West Bank the previous day when a Palestinian woman was killed in clashes with Israeli forces.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said the woman — 23-year-old Ahed Mohammed — was killed along with a man, and nine Palestinians were wounded.
The Israeli military said the clashes occurred in the town of Dura, where about 100 people threw firebombs and blocks at troops, who fired back. The military said one person was killed, others were hit and that the incident was “under review.” It did not confirm reports of the woman’s death.
The West Bank has experienced a surge in violence since the war in Gaza erupted and the Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed some 350 Palestinians there since Oct. 7. Most have been killed in confrontations with Israeli forces during arrest raids or violent protests.
Palestinians from the West Bank have also carried out attacks against Israelis during that time.
EXCHANGE OF FIRE ALONG ISRAEL-EGYPT BORDER KILLS 1 IN EGYPT, INJURES AN ISRAELI SOLDIER
JERUSALEM — Israel said one of its troops was “slightly injured” in an exchange of fire along the country’s border with Egypt, which Cairo attributed to drug smuggling. One person in Egypt was killed.
The statement from the Israeli military late on Monday said the fighting happened near the Nitzana border crossing with Egypt on the Sinai Peninsula, and that there were 20 armed suspects. The Israelis and the suspects exchanged fire, with Israel saying “hits were identified” among the suspects, without elaborating.
The Israeli soldier who was hit “was evacuated to a hospital to receive medical treatment and her family has been informed,” the military said.
The Israeli military did not identify the suspects. An Egyptian military statement on Tuesday described the suspects involved as trying to smuggle drugs. It said one person was killed and six people were arrested afterwards.
Egypt and Israel have had a peace deal since 1979, but Israel’s monthslong war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip has strained ties.
U.N. CHIEF WARNS OF STARVATION AND DISEASE IN GAZA AS AID STAGGERS
UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. secretary-general says Gaza faces “the long shadow of starvation” and the risk of disease outbreaks because of barriers to delivering vital aid.
Antonio Guterres did not mention Israel by name in his remarks Monday, but blamed the inability to meet Gaza’s growing humanitarian needs on widespread bombardment, barriers to entering the territory and restrictions on distribution inside of it — all under Israel’s control.
He said he was “deeply troubled by the clear violation of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing.”
Israeli officials have denied hindering aid delivery, saying the U.N. needs to provide more workers and trucks.
But Guterres said the U.N. and its partners “cannot effectively deliver humanitarian aid while Gaza is under such heavy, widespread and unrelenting bombardment.” He pointed to the deaths of 152 U.N. staffers in Gaza since the start of the war, “the largest single loss of life in the history of our organization.”"

Belarus borders Poland, Latvia and Lithuania to its north and west, and the prospect of Russian tactical nuclear weapons being housed so close to Nato allies sparked an international furore late last year.
Defence minister Viktor Khrenin said at a national security council meeting on Tuesday that the change in military doctrine represented a “new chapter” for Belarus, which does not have its own nuclear weapons.
“We clearly communicate Belarus’s views on the use of tactical nuclear weapons stationed on our territory. A new chapter has appeared, where we clearly define our allied obligations to our allies,” he said.
Belarusian forces are not believed to have actively participated in Russia’s war against Ukraine, but the country has supported Moscow in various ways throughout the almost two-year conflict.
The Belarus border is just 140 miles from Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, and Russian troops stationed in Belarus invaded Ukraine from the north during the opening days of the war in February 2022.
In December, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko confirmed the shipment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons for deployment in his country was complete, marking the first such placement outside of Russia’s borders.
The shipments were completed back in October, Mr Lukashenko revealed at a meeting of a Moscow-led economic bloc in St Petersburg.
Russia has said it will maintain control over the nuclear weapons positioned in Belarus, which are intended for battlefield use, having short ranges and comparatively low yields.
Mr Lukashenko did not share further details at the time regarding the quantity of weapons sent or their specific deployment locations.
On Tuesday, Belarus’s security council secretary Alexander Volfovich claimed the deployment of Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus was aimed at detering aggression from Poland, a Nato member.
“Unfortunately, statements by our neighbours, in particular Poland… forced us to strengthen” the military doctrine, he said.
The doctrine will now be taken to the All-Belarusian People’s Assembly, a representative body that operates in Belarus in parallel with its rubber-stamp parliament."

Ukraine's efforts to gain security guarantees from its Western allies have picked up speed since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. The Group of Seven (G7) members presented their long-term security commitments for Ukraine at the NATO summit in Vilnius last July, which entailed explicit and long-lasting obligations, as well as bolstering Ukraine's ability to resist Russian aggression.
U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a bilateral security agreement on Jan. 12, which Zelensky characterized as ""unprecedented."" It was the first of the G7 commitments to be finalized.
Cmoc said the document contained Canada's plan for ""security assurances,"" not ""guarantees.""
Canada has already pledged long-term assistance to Ukraine, she said, adding that the document finalizes such a commitment on paper.
It is still a draft, and Cmoc said more detailed negotiations are upcoming in the following weeks.

C7TFJF7MKO_ODECELMF88YZCMO,Boeing to add further quality inspections for 737 MAX,Reuters,"Updated January 15, 2024 at 10:22 AM·3 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/boeing-add-further-quality-inspections-132802191.html,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Boeing will add further quality inspections for the 737 MAX after a mid-air blowout of a cabin panel in an Alaska Airlines MAX 9 earlier this month, the head of its commercial airplanes division said on Monday.
The planemaker will also deploy a team to supplier Spirit AeroSystems - which makes and installs the plug door involved in the incident - to check and approve Spirit's work on the plugs before fuselages are sent to Boeing's production facilities in Washington state, Stan Deal, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a letter to Boeing employees.
The new actions from Boeing come after the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday extended the grounding of 171 MAX 9 planes indefinitely for new safety checks. Only after 40 planes are inspected will the agency review the results and determine if safety is adequate to allow the MAX 9s to resume flying, the FAA said.
In addition to the door plug inspections, Boeing teams will conduct checks at 50 other points in Spirit's production process, Deal said. Meanwhile, both Boeing and Spirit will open their 737 production facilities to airline customers for carriers to provide their own inspections.
“We are working seamlessly with Boeing in executing on the FAA’s Quality Management System (QMS) in the production and manufacturing of the 737 MAX 9,” said a Spirit spokesperson in a statement to Reuters.
Boeing will also hold sessions for employees on quality management, and bring in an outside party to conduct an independent assessment of its production process, Deal said.
Alaska Airlines said it had ""engaged in a candid conversation"" with Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and the planemaker's leadership team on the quality improvement actions.
""We welcome and appreciate Boeing’s specific commitments to bolster quality assurance and controls across their factories and at Spirit AeroSystems,"" Alaska Airlines said.
The FAA declined to comment.
Deal said the actions laid out in the letter are separate from the FAA's ongoing investigation and plans to increase oversight of MAX production.
However, before new MAX 9s are delivered, Boeing ""will conduct the same thorough inspections of the mid-exit door plugs as mandated by the FAA,"" Deal wrote.
The regulator announced last week it will also audit the Boeing 737 MAX 9 production line and suppliers and consider having an independent entity take over certain aircraft certification responsibilities the FAA previously assigned to the planemaker.
Boeing has boosted its number of a quality inspectors by 20% since 2019 and plans to make additional investments to its quality units, Deal wrote.
""Everything we do must conform to the requirements in our QMS,"" Deal wrote. ""Anything less is unacceptable. It is through this standard that we must operate to provide our customers and their passengers complete confidence in Boeing airplanes.""
United Airlines and Alaska Airlines have canceled all MAX 9 flights through Tuesday. United Airlines declined to comment on Boeing's actions on Monday.

C8LGI13ABF_DM18UDVJ74SW09B,What to know about overdraft fees as the White House cracks down on them,CORA LEWIS,"January 18, 2024 at 3:25 AM·3 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/know-overdraft-fees-white-house-192543869.html,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed new rules that would lower overdraft fees, with President Joe Biden calling the charges “exploitative.” Currently, the fee for overdrawing a bank account averages more than $26.
If a bank temporarily lends a consumer money when their account has reached a zero balance, the consumer is typically responsible for paying back both the overdrawn amount and an additional fee, which can be more than the original amount charged. In one example often cited by opponents of the fees, a $3 cup of coffee can end up costing someone $30.
Here's what to know.
WHAT IS AN OVERDRAFT FEE?
When there isn’t enough money in an account to cover a transaction or withdrawal, but the bank allows it anyway, the customer is technically “overdrawn,” and most banks charge them a fee. About 91% of accounts have this fee structure, according to the most recent Bankrate research. Consumer advocates argue this is an extension of credit, and should be regulated as such.
The fees originated during a time when consumers wrote and cashed checks more frequently — so that the checks would clear instead of bouncing, if there was an issue of timing — but banks steadily increased the fees in the first two decades of the 2000s. Eventually, the fees provided financial institutions with billions of dollars in revenue. The fees, as high as $39 per overdraft, disproportionately affect banks' most cash-strapped consumers. A majority of overdrafts (70%) are charged to customers with average account balances between $237 and $439, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
HOW CAN I AVOID INCURRING OVERDRAFT FEES?
The simplest way to avoid overdraft fees is to find an account that does not charge them. Online banks, in particular, now offer many accounts without these fee structures. Capital One and Ally Bank also offer consumers accounts that will not charge overdraft fees.
The second thing to do is to opt out of the service. When opening a new bank account, you'll be given the option to decline “overdraft coverage."" If you choose not to accept the service, your bank won’t cover overdrafts and will instead return any payments that can’t be covered as unpaid — but you won’t be charged the overdraft fee.
Other steps include setting up an alert for when your balance falls below a certain amount, and linking savings accounts to checking accounts, so that your own money — not the bank's — will cover any shortfalls. Some banks call this “overdraft protection,” rather than “overdraft coverage.”
WILL THE BANK EVER WAIVE OR REVERSE AN OVERDRAFT FEE?
If you overdraw your account for the first time, a call to your bank could get the charge removed. Even on a second or third offense, some banks will work with customers to reverse or waive charges.
There are also app-based services that will negotiate with a bank on your behalf. In each case, the process can take up to 90 days.
Increasingly, banks are offering grace periods to customers in the event of an overdraft, depending on the account. In these cases, customers can avoid an overdraft fee as long as they bring their account balance back to a positive amount within a certain time frame, such as 48 hours.

In the late 1800s, a wave of northern European settlers arrived in the Dakota Territories to make land claims. German-Russian farmers who had lived in Russia and Ukraine for decades were among the largest of all the immigrant groups, settling in widespread areas of the state. And, naturally, they brought their hearty foodways with them, including the famous cheese dumplings (käse knöpfen, or käse knepfla), which may have been influenced by Ukrainian varenyky.
The German-Russian population tended to live in close-knit communities and, consciously or not, protected their unique heritage and culture for many decades. The recipe for the dish now known stateside as cheese buttons was passed down through families for generations, making use of wheat grown by local farmers and homemade cottage cheese produced by farm wives. As descendants of those early immigrants continue to celebrate their roots, the cheese dumpling remains a symbol of cultural continuity and a delicious reminder of the blending of traditions in the American heartland.

Dumplings of any type, are a good way to stretch costly protein ingredients further to feed more at the table, an important feature for hard-working farm families, and so variations of cheese-filled dough are common in many northern European communities.
Cheese button dumplings are typically made from a simple dough mixture of flour, eggs, and water, encasing a generous filling of flavorful cheese, similar to Ukrainian varenyky or Polish pierogi ruskie, but without additional potato. The cheese used can vary, with some recipes favoring milder options like farmer's cheese, but today most cheese buttons are filled with dry cottage cheese. The dumplings are typically boiled until they float to the surface, indicating their readiness. Once cooked, they can be enjoyed in various ways -- some prefer them with a drizzle of melted butter and onions, while others savor them with a sour cream or toasted breadcrumb sauce.
Dumplings are comfort food around the world, and in this case, a flavorful bridge to previous generations of immigrant communities who shaped and enriched the culinary landscape of North Dakota.

(KOIN) — A Portland-based organization that empowers young Black men embarked on a transformative trip to Africa over the summer, and soon, their journey will be the focus of a documentary premiering at the Hollywood Theatre.
Local nonprofit Word Is Bond champions Black male youth by educating them on leadership, community service, mental health and much more. Executive Director Lakayana Drury founded the organization in 2017 to fill a gap that he observed as he grew up in Wisconsin.

“[I faced] a lot of similar experiences that these young men face: lack of Black teachers, lack of Black role models, just disconnect the education system as a whole and really lack of an understanding of my identity as a Black person and what I was capable of,” Drury said.
This past July, the founder expanded on his mission of empowering members to their fullest potential by organizing an inaugural two-week trip to Ghana dubbed the “Black Star Homecoming Expedition.”
He likens the trip to the moon landing because it was what the organization had been building toward ever since its inception.
Drury invited Tamaryah “Twixx” Williams, the Rose City’s videography prodigy, to capture the ins and outs of the journey — but what was intended to be a brief recap of the trip soon developed into a coming-of-age story for Word Is Bond ambassadors, as well as the director behind the camera.
“It turned into a documentary to kind of show how these ambassadors unravel more of the culture and get more connected to their identities and just learn about a world they’ve never been to,” Williams said.
As the director spoke to KOIN 6, he admitted there were still some final edits to be made before presenting his work before a big audience. However, there were some particular scenes he was sure would resonate with audiences.

In those hard-hitting scenes, the men of Word Is Bond visit historical slave sites in and around Cape Coast. According to Williams, those moments are the most pivotal because many Americans haven’t grasped what enslaved African people had to endure for several months as they awaited transportation to another continent.
In addition to the footage that Williams shot abroad, the documentary will feature exclusive interviews in which Word Is Bond ambassadors reflect on their experiences on the trip.
The organization serves Black men between the ages of 15 and 20, and the director himself was 21 years old while in Ghana. He said the opportunity to film and edit this project — a first-ever documentary for the creative who typically shoots music videos — was impactful for him as well.

Russia is doing so to make up for losses on the front lines, the ISW said.
The ISW said ""Russian forces are able to conduct routine operational level rotations in Ukraine.""
Russia is recruiting 30,000 new soldiers a month to make up for the ones thrown into the meat grinder in Ukraine, a top Ukrainian intelligence official said this week.
That's about 1,000 to 1,100 people a day, according to the assessment from Vadym Skibitskyi, deputy chief major general of Ukraine's main military intelligence arm.
The Institute for the Study of War said Skibitskyi's statement is ""consistent with ISW's assessment that Russian forces are able to conduct routine operational level rotations in Ukraine.""
The term ""meat grinder"" originally referred to Russia's high-casualty approach to battles for strategic cities like Bakhmut and Avdiivka. But as the war drags on, analysts have seen similar parallels in Russia's offensive along other parts of the front lines.
In October, the US said Moscow had resumed the use of bloody ""human wave"" tactics, which involve throwing unprepared and poorly trained troops into the thick of battle, often without the right equipment.
""Russians are motivated to join the army, primarily driven by salary considerations, especially in crisis regions where wages are low or there are no jobs at all,"" Skibitskyi told RBC-Ukraine on Monday.
Skibitskyi told RBC-Ukraine that while the 30,000 new monthly recruits are enough to replenish losses on the front lines, Russia would need to ""declare a more massive mobilization"" to ""create a more strategic reserve.""
""Will Putin dare to do this?"" he added, according to the news outlet. ""Unlikely before the elections. And afterward — we'll see. But all the conditions for conducting mobilization in Russia are created at any time.""
In addition to the war, Putin faces a growing threat from within Russia: the wives and mothers of soldiers who want their loved ones to come home.
Their pushback has been so concerted that Federal Security Service agents have questioned soldiers whose wives are protesting, and military officers have threatened to send soldiers to the front lines if their wives don't back down, The Washington Post reported.
""Your methods are very dirty,"" said one message posted to a Telegram channel advocating for soldiers to be brought home, according to The Post. ""You are trying to calm our anger by putting pressure on our relatives.""

The parliamentary letter to U.K. Home Secretary James Cleverly is signed by the co-convenors of the Australian Bring Julian Assange Home Parliamentary Group: Members of Parliament Andrew Wilkie, Independent; Bridget Archer, Liberal; Josh Wilson, Labor, and Sen. David Shoebridge, Greens.
The letter cited the 2023 U.K. Supreme Court decision in AAA v Secretary of State for the Home Department, which found that courts in the U.K. cannot solely rely on third-party assurances by foreign governments and must make independent assessments of the risk of persecution to people before an order is made to remove them from the U.K.
""This reasoning clearly has direct relevance to the extradition proceedings involving Julian Assange and the joint decision of Lord Justices Burnett and Holroyde in USA v Assange,"" the letter reads. ""In that case their Lordships expressly relied on the 'assurances' of the United States as to Mr. Assange's safety and welfare should he be extradited to the United States for imprisonment and trial. These assurances were not tested, nor was there any evidence of independent assessment as to the basis on which they could be given and relied upon.""
UK HIGH COURT SETS DATE FOR JULIAN ASSANGE'S FINAL APPEAL CHALLENGING US EXTRADITION
Assange is facing 17 charges by the U.S. government for allegedly receiving, possessing and communicating classified information to the public under the Espionage Act, and one charge alleging conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. His possible final legal challenge to block his extradition from Britain to the U.S. will be held Feb. 20 and 21 at the High Court in London.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
If he is extradited to the U.S. after exhausting all his legal appeals, Assange would face trial in Alexandria, Virginia, and could be sentenced to up to 175 years in an American maximum-security prison.
""This is literally a do-or-die scenario for Julian,"" Assange's brother, Gabriel Shipton, told Fox News Digital. ""If he loses at the U.K. courts next month, he could be extradited to the USA within 24 hours. [Expert] witness testimony and a U.K. magistrate have both found that would ultimately lead to his death. This prosecution isn't about justice, it's not about protecting U.S. interest, it's obvious to everyone that Julian's persecution is a sick revenge plot by the people whose criminal behavior his work exposed. It's time for cooler heads to prevail and put an end to this disastrous endeavor.""
SQUAD AND MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE JOIN 16 LAWMAKERS CALLING ON BIDEN TO FREE JULIAN ASSANGE
Assange's lawyer in the U.K., Jennifer Robinson, has previously said she fears he ""would not survive if extradited to the U.S.""
The Australian journalist has been held at London's high-security Belmarsh Prison since he was removed from the Ecuadorian Embassy on April 11, 2019, for breaching bail conditions. He had sought asylum at the embassy since 2012 to avoid being sent to Sweden over allegations he raped two women because Sweden would not provide assurances it would protect him from extradition to the U.S. The investigations into the sexual assault allegations were eventually dropped.
""Mr. Assange is an Australian citizen who has been in HM Prison Belmarsh since April 2019. He has significant health issues, exacerbated to a dangerous degree by his prolonged incarceration, that are of very real concern to us as his elected representatives,"" the Australian lawmakers wrote.
British High Commissioner to Australia Vicki Treadell told Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio on Tuesday that ""all parties would like to see a resolution.""
""We welcome this statement from the High Commissioner because it is exactly what the letter from Australian MPs to Home Secretary James Cleverly is asking him to do,"" Greg Barns SC, adviser to the Australian Assange Campaign, told Fox News Digital. ""We urge the UK government to assist with that resolution by working with the Australian and US governments immediately to end the case against Julian Assange.""
BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL RESOLUTION CALLS ON US OFFICIALS TO DROP CHARGES AGAINST ASSANGE
The Trump administration brought the charges against Assange over WikiLeaks' 2010 publication of cables leaked by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning detailing war crimes committed by the U.S. government in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, detention camp. The materials also exposed instances of the CIA engaging in torture and rendition.
WikiLeaks' ""Collateral Murder"" video showing the U.S. military gunning down civilians in Iraq, including two Reuters journalists, was also published 14 years ago.
The parliamentary letter comes after a cross-party delegation of Australian lawmakers visited Washington, D.C., last year and met with U.S. officials, members of Congress and civil rights groups to demand the charges against Assange be dropped. Multiple bipartisan efforts were also made last year by U.S. lawmakers demanding Assange's freedom.
JULIAN ASSANGE SUPPORTERS DEMAND CHARGES BE DROPPED IN VIGIL OUTSIDE MERRICK GARLAND’S HOME
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also repeatedly called on the U.S. in the last year to end the prosecution of Assange.
""Both the Australian Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have stated publicly that Mr. Assange's case has gone on for too long,"" the parliamentary letter reads. ""This is a position with which we wholeheartedly concur.""
No publisher had been charged under the Espionage Act until Assange, and many press freedom groups have said his prosecution sets a dangerous precedent intended to criminalize journalism. U.S. prosecutors and critics of Assange have argued WikiLeaks' publication of classified material put the lives of U.S. allies at risk, but there is no evidence that publishing the documents put anyone in danger.
The editors and publishers of the U.S. and European outlets that worked with Assange on the publication of excerpts from more than 250,000 documents he obtained in the Cablegate leak — The Guardian, The New York Times, Le Monde, Der Spiegel and El País  — wrote an open letter in 2022 calling for the U.S. to drop the charges against Assange.
The Obama administration decided not to indict Assange in 2013 over WikiLeaks' 2010 publication of the classified documents because it would have had to also indict journalists from major news outlets who published the same materials. Former President Obama also commuted Manning’s 35-year sentence for violations of the Espionage Act and other offenses to seven years in January 2017. Manning, who had been imprisoned since 2010, was released later that year.
AUSTRALIAN DELEGATION MEETS WITH US OFFICIALS, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO DEMAND JULIAN ASSANGE'S FREEDOM
Former President Trump's Justice Department later moved to indict Assange under the Espionage Act and the Biden administration has continued to pursue his prosecution.
""We are deeply concerned that the legal proceedings involving Mr. Assange will now continue, first in the United Kingdom and then in the United States, if extradition is ordered and consented to by you,"" the letter to the U.K. Home Secretary reads. ""This would add yet more years to Mr. Assange's detention and further imperil his health.""
""To this end we are requesting that you undertake an urgent, thorough and independent assessment of the risks to Mr. Assange’s health and welfare in the event he is extradited to the United States,"" it continues. ""Consistent with the decision in AAA, it appears to us that such independent investigation should include a close review of the risks to Mr. Assange’s health, life and wellbeing through prolonged detention in one or more high security U.S. detention facilities.""
Under the Trump administration, the CIA allegedly had plans to kill Assange over the publication of sensitive agency hacking tools known as ""Vault 7,"" which the agency said represented ""the largest data loss in CIA history,"" Yahoo reported in 2021. The agency was accused of having discussions ""at the highest levels"" of the administration about plans to assassinate Assange in London and allegedly acted upon orders from then-CIA director Mike Pompeo to draw up kill ""sketches"" and ""options.""
The CIA also had advanced plans to kidnap and rendition Assange, and had made a political decision to charge him, according to the Yahoo report.
WikiLeaks also published internal communications in 2016 between the Democratic National Committee and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign that revealed the DNC's attempts to boost Clinton in that year's Democratic primary.

CJSCOGONBW_4L89RB4GXW091U3,Ecuador: Argentina expels family of gang boss Adolfo Macías,Sean Seddon - BBC News,"January 20, 2024 at 10:00 AM·2 min read",20240120,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/ecuador-argentina-expels-family-gang-020035677.html,"The wife and children of a wanted Ecuadorean gang leader have been detained and expelled from Argentina.
Argentina's security minister said the move against Adolfo Macías Villamar's family showed the country is a ""hostile territory for narco-criminals"".
The gang leader, known as Fito, is at large after escaping from an Ecuadorean prison earlier this month.
Ecuador is under a state of emergency as a nationwide search for the organised crime boss continues.
Argentine authorities released footage on Friday of several people they say have links to Fito under police escort aboard an air force plane.
Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich told a press conference they were detained at a property in the region of Córdoba and had been returned to Ecuador. She said eight people were deported in total, including associates and family members.
Interior Minister Guillermo Francos said Argentina would ""not be a den for criminals"".
The move comes as Ecuador's government continues to hunt Fito while attempting to quell an outbreak of gang-related disorder that has plunged the country into crisis.
Fito, who is head of the Los Choneros gang and has been accused of orchestrating earlier prison violence, vanished from his cell in a facility in the city of Guayaquil.
He has also been linked to the murder of Fernando Villavicencio, an anti-corruption presidential candidate who was shot dead last August.
In the aftermath of the escape, Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa declared war on the country's gangs and imposed tough security conditions, a stance which has been met with unprecedented levels of violence by Ecuador's gangs.
Earlier this week, authorities said they had regained control of the country's prisons after days of rioting - but the country's most wanted fugitive remains elusive.
Mr Noboa has called on authorities in neighbouring Colombia - where several powerful drug cartels are based - to begin searching for Fito, according to AFP news agency.
He has also reiterated plans to deport foreign criminals in a bid to alleviate overcrowding in Ecuador's volatile prisons."

The proposed changes involve abolishing the special prosecutor’s office, which deals with serious crimes like bribery, organized crime, and extremism. Such cases would instead be dealt with by regional prosecutors who have not handled such crimes for 20 years.
Around 20,000 protesters gathered in the central square of Bratislava, according to police. The crowd chanted slogans like “mafia, mafia” and “enough of Fico.”
The legislation introduced by Fico’s government will require approval from both the President and the parliament. However, a three-party coalition has a sufficient majority to overcome a potential veto from President Zuzana Caputova.
Caputova stated her readiness to use constitutional procedures to challenge the law. It remains unclear how the Constitutional Court might rule at this time.

From the initial, relatively small, protests in Bratislava on Dec. 7, which involved several hundred people, anti-government rallies have now spread to 19 cities and towns. By Dec. 19, thousands of people in major cities across Slovakia had gathered to protest against the law.
In parliamentary elections on Oct. 1, the pro-Russian party Smer-SD, which is led by Fico, emerged victorious. Fico opposes support for Ukraine and its accession to NATO, stating that Slovakia will cease military assistance to Ukraine and focus solely on humanitarian support. He also argues for negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.
Fico has previously repeated false Russian narratives, such as claiming that the “war began in 2014 when Ukrainian Nazis and fascists started killing Russian citizens in Donbas and Luhansk.”

Dianne Feinstein recently launched their first television campaign ads. Both Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Rep. Katie Porters (D-CA) launched television ads this week.
Rep. Schiff launched a 30-second spot in which, among other things, he touted his experience in the impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump, lowered drug costs, and helping to build affordable housing.
“This election is a choice between results and just rhetoric,” Schiff can be heard saying in the ad. “Californians deserve a senator who is going to deliver for them every day and not just talk a good game.”

Rep. Porter’s 30-second spot leans into her trademark whiteboard and new “Shake up the Senate” messaging her campaign has rolled out this week.
“Not just any whiteboard, Katie Porter’s whiteboard,” a voiceover in the ad can be heard saying. The ad highlights Porter’s progressive bona fides including her refusal to take corporate PAC money, “leading the fight to ban congressional stock trading,” and opposing earmarks.
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Porter’s ad is running solely in the SF Bay Area, which some have seen as an attempt to tap into the Bay Area progressive support Rep. Barbara Lee’s campaign is banking on.
Schiff remains the front runner, according to data collected by Real Clear Polling, with Porter trailing slightly behind and Lee running close with Republican candidate Steve Garvey in the race for third place.

CS4E6XIPV6_SC3F6UYYHBV1BNO,Why these Taiwanese Americans flew home to vote,"Shaimaa Khalil - BBC News, Taiwan","January 18, 2024 at 7:09 AM·5 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/why-taiwanese-americans-flew-home-230915624.html,"""I shouted his [William Lai's] name so much on the night of the election, I lost my voice the next day,"" says Nancy Yang, who flies home to Taiwan from San Francisco every four years so she can vote.
William Lai Ching-te won Taiwan's presidential election on Saturday, giving his ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a third, unprecedented term. And Ms Yang is one of a few thousand Taiwanese living overseas who returned last week to vote in an election that China had framed as a choice between war and peace.
In Taiwan, where voters must cast their ballots in person, many travelled to their hometowns - even Mr Lai went to Tainan in southern Taiwan to vote. Others, like Ms Yang, flew across the world.
""The rallies, the noise - you feel the excitement being here,"" she says. ""You feel like you're making a difference on the ground.""
It's unclear how many of the voters were Taiwanese Americans, but some 4,000 citizens living abroad registered to vote, according to the Central Election Commission. Relations with China were a major factor for the Taiwanese watching from afar, and especially those who live in the US, which has long been Taipei's most powerful ally.
""China thinks it owns Taiwan. We don't think so. We don't belong to you,"" Ms Yang had declared the night before the election, when the BBC had met her while she was volunteering at a DPP rally. Clad in the party's green varsity-like sweater and surrounded by green and pink flags, she was all smiles, talking to voters and other volunteers.
The former IT manager has lived in the Bay Area for 40 years. She said this election felt different, compared to the last one in 2020: ""This time we had three parties, and it was a close race.""
The DPP was battling dissatisfaction over poor wages and high cost of living, while emphasising the threat that China posed. The main opposition Kuomintang or KMT campaigned on better relations with Beijing, while the third player, the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), positioned itself as an alternative to the other two, especially on improving cost of living.
The TPP did far better than polls suggested, emerging as a serious future contender - evidence perhaps of how much the economy weighed on the minds of voters here, unlike those who live on the other side of the world.
""It's not the outcome that we are satisfied with,"" says Jason Hsu, an advisor to the KMT and a Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School.
Mr Hsu is at Taipei's Da'an Forest Park - the soft strings of a guitar and the calming Tai Chi exercises are a contrast to the energy of the election from the previous night.
Next to him is Jen Tsao, who travelled from her home in San Francisco to vote, and Chiaoning Su, who teaches journalism and communication at Oakland University.
Ms Tsao supports the KMT, which is traditionally seen as being closer to Beijing, and Ms Su voted for the DPP.
Taiwan just chose a president China loathes. What now?
It's not war Taiwan's young voters worry about - it's jobs
They weren't all happy about the result. But they were all proud of the way the world saw Taiwan.
""This is something we fought for. We enjoy it, we celebrate it, but we can also lose it… it's hard-earned,"" Ms Su says, explaining that it was the reason she picked the DPP.
Ms Tsao says the election is an opportunity for her to come home and soak up the atmosphere and excitement. She says several of her family and friends also flew from the US to vote: ""We do appreciate the process of democracy. That's the main difference between Taiwan and China.""
Taiwan's is a young democracy - this is only the eighth presidential vote since 1996 - and its elections are joyful.
On Saturday, millions of Taiwanese went to the polls, including parents who brought their children, many too young to vote themselves. But they said they wanted them to experience the polling stations. First-time voters spoke of their thrill. Still others turned up with their pets in tow, taking advantage of the sunny, clear skies.
The rallies were like carnivals - a mix of motivational speeches, music and chants, sometimes all at once, in a sea of flags. Some enthusiasts added their own personal touch to the party colours. But the euphoria aside, there was also anxiety and urgency.
Ms Yang said China's warnings in the lead-up to the vote filled her with dread: ""Taiwan needs strong leadership to protect it. To keep it safe. We feel that very strongly.""
But she adds that the fraught situation has also put the island on the geopolitical map, not least because it's a vibrant democracy and the world's largest producer of semiconductors.
""Twenty years ago, people didn't know much about Taiwan. When I talked to someone about it, they thought I was talking about Thailand. Now they know. I feel so proud. I feel like America recognises how important Taiwan is and its responsibility to protect it.""
Ms Su says Taiwan is now a ""key word"" in international news. And China's authoritarian grip over Hong Kong, which has firmed since Taiwan's last election, convinced her she had to vote: ""We are sending the right message to the international community that we want to safeguard our way of life. And we want to keep fighting for democracy.""
Love and longing across the Taiwan Strait: The view from China
Ms Tsao, who voted for the opposition KMT, is worried Mr Lai will inflame an already tense relationship with Beijing, pushing Taiwan closer to a confrontation no-one wants.
""I think the current government has not done a very good job to protect the best interests for our people. So, I wanted to be here [and voice my concern].""
Mr Hsu agrees. He congratulated Mr Lai but also warns of a ""very tumultuous four years"" ahead.
""But I think the victory really belongs to the people of Taiwan - we've made a choice."""

More than one thousand migrants have entered Finland through its eastern border in recent months, creating an opportunity for recruitment.

""A person can be persuaded to cooperate in various ways, for example by exerting pressure or by linking a request for cooperation to the conditions of leaving the country or by promising money,"" SUPO said.
Although this is not a widespread phenomenon, the Border Guard Service believes that there may be thousands of people in Russia near the Finnish border who are willing to cross the border illegally.
Criminals, members of criminal organizations, soldiers disguised as civilians, and other people who might pose a threat to national security could be among those who have already entered Finland illegally, according to the Central Criminal Police (CCP).

However, it is unclear whether these individuals have been uncovered, since the large number of migrants has complicated and delayed their identification.
On Nov. 30, Finland closed all checkpoints along its border with Russia in response to a significant increase in undocumented third-country nationals seeking asylum at the border with the help of Russian border guards
More than 800 migrants from countries like Afghanistan, Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen entered Finland via Russia in recent weeks, the country's Border Guard Service reported earlier.
Previously, the average flow of migrants was less than one per day.
Finnish President Sauli Niinistö believes that an artificial migration crisis at the Finnish-Russian border organized by Moscow is part of a ""broader picture"" and is a way for the Kremlin to destabilize the West, Yle reported on Dec. 2.
Norway could support the Finnish government's decision and also close its border crossing with Russia, Norwegian Minister of Justice Emilie Enger Mehl said earlier. Estonia made a similar statement a day later.

Estonia may close border crossing points with Russia ""very swiftly"" due to a significant increase in the number of people crossing since Finland began blocking the border with Russia, Eve Kalmus, head of the Estonian Boarder Guard Directorate, told Yle on Dec. 2.
The Narva checkpoint in Estonia sawa surge in traffic after Finland closed its border crossings with Russia. About 1,000 more people crossed the Estonian-Russian border as compared to before.
The increase is almost entirely due to traffic from Finland to Russia.

Iran said it carried out strikes in Iraq and Syria, claiming it struck Israeli “espionage centers” in retaliation for attacks by Israel, in a key escalation of the Israel-Hamas war.
Tehran has also deployed forces to Yemen, where U.S.-led strikes targeted the Iran-backed Houthi rebels last week. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps are also playing a direct role in attacks by the Houthis in the Red Sea.
The Houthis have launched further attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea including a strike on a U.S.-owned commercial ship on Monday. Houthi rebels make up part of Iran’s so-called “axis of resistance,” a network of anti-Western militias. As hostilities continue, the U.S. and Iran appear to be locking into an escalatory spiral, the International Crisis Group noted. That comes with major risks. “Tehran and Washington would be wise to look for opportunities to defuse tensions. Right now, that may be politically impossible,” the group wrote in a recent report, adding that “as soon as there is an opening to resume the quiet, indirect diplomacy that led to the pre-Gaza lull, both sides should seize it.”
By some metrics, a regional war in the Middle East has already arrived, one analyst argued, saying a “low-intensity regional war” has been ongoing for decades. In recent years, Iran has expanded its scope in the region to fill power vacuums with its proxies, Christopher P. Costa, a former U.S. intelligence officer, wrote in The Hill. “Hamas’s terrorist attacks have already opened a Pandora’s box for unifying an axis against Israel,” he noted, so the Biden administration must now “reboot a counterterrorism strategy that takes into account these regional dynamics to confront an Iran-directed axis that’s much more expansive” than it was in years past.
Tehran might have believed that Washington would have been more restrained in targeting the Houthis, Al-Monitor noted this weekend. Iran has much to lose from a failed standoff with the U.S.: Any miscalculation could “prove costly for a government already grappling with a host of economic maladies and facing a crisis of legitimacy,” the news website’s Tehran correspondent wrote. Iranian hardliners have encouraged their proxies to act, and state-run media have heralded the Houthis as “game changers” in the Israel-Hamas war. “Should the [U.S] coalition strikes continue in the days to come, the Islamic Republic could find itself in a tighter corner,” the correspondent added."

The deadline for nominating EPP candidates for the post of European Commission president is February 21, according to information obtained by dpa on Wednesday.
The single EPP candidate will then be chosen at a party congress in Bucharest on March 7. Within the EPP, it is widely expected that von der Leyen will campaign for a second term but she has yet to make a public announcement.
European Parliament elections will take place from June 6-9 and will form the basis for the subsequent decisions on which parties receive what position in the next European Commission.
The next European Commission president will be proposed by the European Council, the EU institution made up of the heads of state and government of the 27 EU member states.
However, the person put forward must still be elected by the European Parliament.
According to opinion polls, it is currently likely that the EPP will once again become the strongest political force in the European elections.
In addition to the German centre-right parties CDU and CSU, the Austrian ÖVP and the current governing parties from countries such as Greece, Poland, Sweden and Luxembourg are also EPP members."

He noted that Moscow still maintains other forces near the Baltic countries, including aviation, missiles, tactical nuclear weapons, and a navy. However, without a significant part of its land troops, Russia cannot effectively carry out any provocations with these military assets.
“When it comes to Russia's preparations in our region, everyone notices that Russia has devoted all the potential of its ground forces to Ukraine, moved them to the front,” said Anusauskas.

“In this case, it has other forces on our side—aviation, missiles, tactical nuclear weapons, navy, but it does not have the potential of a large part of the ground forces, and with those remote means it cannot fully carry out any provocations. This is a fact.”
Latvian President Egils Levits previously asserted that while his country's membership in NATO and the European Union provides the best security guarantees in the world, Latvia needs to implement ""concrete measures"" to counter the Russian threat.

The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court by the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) on behalf of the tribe, alleges that the Army failed to follow federal law and instead deferred to its own process. Listed as defendants in the lawsuit are: The U.S. Army, the Office of Army Cemeteries, and three individual employees who oversee the Office of Army Secretaries, and the cemetery where the children are buried.
At the center of the lawsuit is a disagreement between Winnebago Tribe and the U.S. Army as to whether or not federal law for repatriation applies to the cemetery at the site of the former Carlisle Indian Industrial School. The Carlisle Main Post Cemetery, which is now operated by the Army, is where Winnebago citizens Edward Hensley and Samuel Gilbert—along with roughly 180 other Native American children from tribal nations across the United States— are buried.
Congress enacted Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990 to provide a process for federal agencies and museums that receive federal funds to repatriate or transfer certain Native American cultural items—including human remains—back to their respective tribal nations.
NAGPRA sets a clear 90-day timeline for repatriation and provides guidelines for institutions to initiate tribal consultation. It also allows tribes to decide themselves who will claim children who are culturally affiliated to them.
Under the Army’s policy, though, the Army sets its own guidelines, defines who can request the return of a child buried at Carlisle (their “closest living relative”), and lacks a process for following cultural protocols in disinterments, which happen only once a year under the Army’s rules.
Native News Online has previously reported what Indian law experts have said on the matter, including the application of NAGPRA, which they say takes precedence over the Army’s policy.
In October, the Winnebago Tribe sent a formal letter to the defendants requesting that they repatriate the remains of Samuel and Edward from Carlisle Cemetery, pursuant to NAGPRA.
But the Army has maintained that NAGPRA doesn’t apply to the Carlisle Main Post Cemetery “because the remains are not part of a collection,” they wrote in a Federal Register Notice in 2021.
On December 11, 2023, the tribe received a letter from Executive Director of the Office of Army Cemeteries (OAC) Karen Durham Aguilera, a defendant in the lawsuit, denying Winnebago’s request and refusing to repatriate Samuel and Edward pursuant to NAGPRA, according to the lawsuit. “Defendant Durham-Aguilera stated that OAC would only consider ‘disinterring and returning’ Samuel and Edward according to makeshift OAC internal policies and practices,” the lawsuit reads.
A spokesperson from the Office of Army Cemeteries said the Army cannot speak to ongoing litigation, but added that the department is planning to return an additional 30 Native children buried at Carlisle this year.
“The Army remains committed to working with all tribes and families to return their children who died while attending the Carlisle Indian Industrial School and are buried at the Carlisle Barracks Post Cemetery, to their native tribes and lands,” OAC spokesperson Olivia Van Den Heuvel said in a statement to Native News Online.
The larger pictureIn 1879, what was then the Army’s Carlisle Barracks became the site of the nation’s first Indian boarding school, which was operated by the Department of the Interior until 1918 in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
During those 39 years, government officials at the school forcibly assimilated 7,800 Native American children from more than 140 tribal nations through a mix of Western-style education and hard labor. Close to 200 children from 59 different tribes died there, of disease often made worse by poor living conditions and abuse, and were buried at the school.
On September 7, 1895, Captain Beck, an Indian Agent of the Omaha and Winnebago Indian Agency in Nebraska, brough Winnebago tribal citizens Edward Hensley, 17, and Samuel Gilbert, 19, to Carlisle.
Gilbert died 47 days later, according to his student record. There is no cause of death listed.
Hensely died four years later, his school record shows. Both boys were buried on school property, where they’ve remained ever since.
Since 1918, the United States Army War College has controlled the grounds of the former Indian Boarding School, including its cemetery.
The Army began the process of exhuming and returning Native children to their tribal nations in 2017 when Yufna Soldier Wolf of the Northern Arapaho Tribe won her 10-year battle to return three Arapaho children back to their tribal homelands for reburial.
Since then, the Army has used its own policy to return a total of 32 children in six disinterment projects.
Last year, the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate tribe of South Dakota also asked the Army to follow NAGPRA in the return of their ancestor, who tribal historian Tamara St. John had spent six years researching to fulfill Army protocols in order to bring their child home.
The Army refused to follow NAGPRA, but agreed to include the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate’s Amos LaFromboise in the 2023 disinterment cycle, which concluded in September.
Instead of further delaying Amos’ repatriation to fight for NAGPRA, the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate instead drafted a Written Plan of Action, signed by the Director the Army Cemeteries and the participating tribal chairpersons, to outline the plan for disinterment. Additionally, in the Plan of Action, both parties maintained their opposing positions on NAGPRA, stating that they “seek to avoid conflict…and reach a compromise so that the remains of Amos and Edward can be delivered to their tribal homes in a culturally appropriate and expeditious manner.”
St. John told Native News Online that she believes this lawsuit is likely just the beginning of an ongoing push for tribal sovereignty when it comes to enforcing NAGPRA for tribal nations seeking to bring their children home from Carlisle.
“I know other tribes are coming,” she said. “We've all been in communication and working together, and we've all learned from the tribes before us, just like [Sisseton Wahpeton] did from Rosebud. There's a lot of things that happen in history that we can't undo or … there aren't solutions for. This [is] real action.”
Winnebago Tribal Historic Preservation Office Sunshine Bear, who has been researching methods to bring her tribe's children home since 2021, told Native News Online that this lawsuit is about tribal sovereignty, and paving the way for other tribes to bring their children home on their own timeline, and with their own customs.
“I can see why tribes would go the fast route, because they want their children back,” said Thomas-Bear.
Thomas-Bear said that, because Samuel and Edward died at Carlisle, it’s been difficult–if not impossible–for her to find their closest living relatives. But that allows the Winnebago to play the long game in getting their children back by suing the Army, since they’re not rushing to bring home their children to aging elders.
“How can we get the Army to follow the NAGPRA regulations if we continue to bow down and say, ‘We’ll just take them?’ That is not paving the way for other tribes,” Thomas-Bear said. “We want to help lead and make a better way for tribes, and ensure that everyone within this country is following these laws.”

“The transfer of ballistic missiles from North Korea to Russia supports Russia's aggressive war, increases the suffering of the Ukrainian people, and undermines the global non-proliferation regime,” Blinken wrote.
“The United States continues to closely monitor any support provided by Russia to North Korea in exchange for these weapons and will use all available tools to identify and expose individuals and legal entities involved in the transfer of weapons between North Korea and Russia. We will not hesitate to take further measures.”
Russia is using North Korean ballistic missiles, as well as missiles with a range of 900 km, stated White House National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby on Jan. 4.
Strikes with DPRK missiles on Ukrainian territory were carried out on Dec. 30 and Jan. 2, Kirby said. A North Korean missile fell in Zaporizhzhia Oblast during the first large-scale attack and Russia launched several missiles of the same kind on Jan. 2, he added.

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's muted response to the weekend victory by Taiwan President-elect Lai Ching-te signals what some analysts see as the start of an uneasy four months before he takes office, with Beijing treading carefully before then.
Lai, from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), will not replace outgoing Tsai Ing-wen until May 20 - but Beijing has little appetite to break a delicate balance that has settled over its ties with Washington in recent months, some diplomats and analysts say.
The situation is further complicated by a looming U.S. presidential election in November, risking plenty of bipartisan pressure from candidates as foreign policy debates intensify.
China claims neighbouring Taiwan as its own and has never ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. Some DPP figures are bracing for a tough four-year term ahead for Lai, who was branded by Chinese officials as a ""dangerous separatist"" well before the vote.
The tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru offered a taste of that in ditching its recognition of Taiwan for China, which reflects a long-running diplomatic effort by Beijing to deprive Taipei of its last few diplomatic allies. Taipei described the move as an act of post-election malice.
But while Beijing may maintain pressure on Taipei to enforce what it calls ""red lines"" over independence for the island it insists is ""sacred"" Chinese territory, it is unlikely to tighten the squeeze just yet.
""The line is very clearly drawn,"" said Victor Gao, a professor at China's Soochow University.
""China will not fire the first shot. But China will never allow pro-Taiwan independence activists to fire the second shot, after firing a first shot which is anti-peace.""
Tsai and Lai both reject China's sovereignty claims and have repeatedly offered talks, which Beijing has rejected. They say only Taiwan people can decide their future.
Few Chinese analysts and scholars are speaking openly given the delicate nature of the situation, but some outside the country detect a marked caution.
""China's response is relatively muted now because it wants to leave it to the U.S. to rein in Lai first,"" said Qi Dongtao, a senior research fellow at the East Asian Institute in Singapore. ""If the U.S. fails to rein Lai in, then China can step in.""
Taipei-based political scientist Wen-Ti Sung, a non-resident fellow at Washington's Atlantic Council think tank, said Beijing's courting of Nauru was ""low-hanging fruit"".
Chinese officials are now likely conducting internal studies into what went wrong - why Beijing's preferred Kuomintang (KMT) opposition party didn't take the presidency, Sung said.
Not that it was a complete failure. Lai won less than 40 per cent of the vote and together with smaller opposition parties, the KMT can form a majority in the legislature.
RANGE OF OPTIONS
After his victory on Saturday, Lai said he wanted to improve ties with China and was open to talks, but Beijing has no shortage of options should his rhetoric change or broader Washington-Beijing ties cool again.
Western diplomats say China's Central Military Commission, commanded by President Xi Jinping, has likely been presented with a variety of escalatory options beyond its on-going deployments across and around Taiwan.
China's military has not directly commented on the election, but on Monday its Eastern Theatre Command released footage of naval combat drills in the East China Sea, without giving a detailed location.
""Battle alert, battle alert!"" the command said in accompanying text. ""The enemy suddenly arrives and the commander quickly issues combat instructions.""
Such action is on a vastly smaller scale to the extensive missile drills and naval manoeuvres that surrounded Taiwan after the visit to Taipei by then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August 2022.
Economically, Beijing has coercive options too given on-going business flows and trade ties, while security analysts and diplomats say China has the ability to attempt cyberattacks against Taiwan infrastructure.
In late December, China scrapped tariff cuts on some 12 chemical products it imported from Taiwan - moves described by Taipei officials as an attempt to interfere in the election. But further pressure on the two sides' 2010 free trade deal, the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), cannot be ruled out, analysts said.
""The economic sanctions option they tried three weeks or so before and didn't work. So now Beijing needs to retool and optimise how it's going to use economic sanctions in a way that can send its message against Lai without unduly alienating Taiwanese society,"" Sung said.
Politically, too, Beijing can exploit connections with various opposition figures and groups, analysts said, noting that China's Taiwan Affairs Office said on Saturday that the vote tally showed that the DPP ""cannot represent mainstream public opinion"".
So far, China's state media has kept a low profile, with no editorials on the election result published by the English-language Global Times or a CCTV-affiliated social media blog that frequently comments on Taiwan issues.
Retired newspaper commentator Hu Xijin wrote in a WeChat blog post on Saturday that ""if (Lai) does not restrain himself after taking office and intensifies his efforts to promote a radical line ... he may trigger a war and become a sinner for the ages."" It was later deleted.

San Diablo Artisan Churros owner Scott Porter said once he heard the news of the churros being discontinued, he knew he had to do something for the community ""in their hour of churro need.""
""We've been in this attitude of churro solidarity. People love churros and Costco really was a churro pioneer,"" Porter said. ""They brought churros to everyone all across America. And so we thought since they're going away, let's honor them and give them a proper send-off with all the love and happiness.""
The memorial was held in the parking lot at Runner's Corner, across from the Orem Costco. It included an altar of candles with a picture of the churro on the Costco menu, a poster where people could write their last words to the churro and sad music playing while people waited in line for free churros from San Diablo.
Over the past few days, Porter has been calling the Costco food courts and recording their reactions to him being ""over the top"" and ""super dramatic"" about the death of the churros. He said all of the Costco employees were so nice and patient with him and told him ""I'm sorry for your loss.""
American Fork resident Madeline Eames said she is a ""religious follower"" of Porter's LinkedIn, where he has been posting the videos. She said she has been checking in every day to watch his Costco calls and felt she had to come to the memorial, to support the cause.
Eames and her friend Anna Tibbitts called the memorial a ""genius"" public relations and marketing move by Porter.
""It's a great event; free churros and the tie-in with current events of churros leaving Costco is genius. I think it's a really great way for people to come together over something like really sweet and fun,"" Tibbitts said.
Amy Thelin said she remembers getting churros with her dad when she was little. When she heard about the memorial, she grabbed her two close friends Abel Mckenna and Sarah Barlow and brought them to the churro truck.
""It's been on my heart and mind recently — the Costco churro — and how upsetting that has been for me. The fact that they put an event together to bring us together to commemorate and honor these churros, I really appreciate that,"" Thelin said.
Mckenna is from England and said he's only had a Costco churro once, but ""it was life-changing."" He sad he's ""limited"" in experiencing the Costco churro, but he was grateful San Diablo provided churros for those mourning.
""Costco is of the people. It always has been, and it's a hard loss for us all, but loss brings people together and that shows here,"" Barlow added.
The classic twisted churro is being replaced with a cookie at most Costco locations. Meanwhile, Porter said San Diablo Artisan Churros is more than ready to fulfill anyone's churro craving.
""We just want people to live their best churro life,"" Porter said."
D8PGSXD9Q7_FUYHFRWGD5AXZ0V,Supreme court to decide whether US cities can enforce anti-homeless laws,Abené Clayton,"January 16, 2024 at 9:00 PM·4 min read",20240116,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/supreme-court-decide-whether-us-130037703.html,"The US supreme court will be reviewing an appeals court ruling that officials in cities across the west say bar them from removing unhoused people from public spaces when there are no shelter beds available.
On Friday, the supreme court agreed to hear an appeal from the city of Grants Pass, in south-west Oregon, where in 2022 a three-judge ninth circuit of appeals panel ruled that the city could not enforce its anti-camping ordinance that barred people from using any sort of shelter or bedding equipment on public property.
This ruling was partially based on the 2018 decision in Martin v Boise, a case that ended with the ninth circuit of appeals deciding that pushing people from city sidewalks and clearing encampments without offering shelter violates the US constitution’s cruel and unusual punishment clause.
Police, officials and business owners have contested the decision, arguing that it ties the hands of municipalities that want to clear homeless encampments. Advocates for the unhoused, on the other hand, argue that this decision does not stop local governments from building and investing in support services and shelters, but it does stop people from being punished for sleeping outdoors when they have no other option.
“Homelessness is growing not because cities lack ways to punish people for being poor, but because a growing number of hard-working Americans are struggling to pay rent and make ends meet,” the National Homelessness Law Center said in a statement after the supreme court announcement.
“This case does not limit communities’ response to addressing homelessness. Cities remain free to use any of the many evidence-based approaches that end homelessness, like housing,” the statement continued.
Elected officials across the west urged the justices to take up the case because they say the rulings complicate their efforts to clear tent encampments, which have long existed in west coast cities, but have more recently become more common across the US. The federal count of homeless people reached 580,000 last year, driven by a lack of affordable housing, a pandemic that economically wrecked households, and a lack of access to mental health and addiction treatment.
Republican and Democratic officials alike have filed amicus briefs in support of the city of Grants Pass, which brought the petition after a separate ninth circuit panel ruled that the city could not enforce local ordinances that prohibit people “from using a blanket, pillow, or cardboard box for protection from the elements”.
In his brief, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, said that the reach of the 2018 ruling has expanded far beyond its bounds to create injunctions on good faith efforts by cities to address their ever-worsening homelessness crises.
“The governor supports this modest check on government’s use of criminal prohibitions to address the homelessness crisis … But Martin did not purport to prohibit every effort by state and local governments to clear encampments or to regulate the time, place, and manner in which an unhoused person may sleep,” the brief reads.
Newsom’s state leads the nation in homelessness with more than 180,000 people living without permanent shelter as of January 2023, according to the US Department of Housing and Urban Development’s most recent data.
“California has invested billions to address homelessness, but rulings from the bench have tied the hands of state and local governments to address this issue,” Newsom said in a 12 January statement following the supreme court’s announcement. “The supreme court can now correct course and end the costly delays from lawsuits that have plagued our efforts to clear encampments and deliver services to those in need.”
“The issue before the court is whether cities can punish homeless residents simply for existing without access to shelter,” Ed Johnson, a lawyer for homeless people who challenged the Grants Pass ordinances, said in a statement. “Nevertheless, some politicians and others are cynically and falsely blaming the judiciary for the homelessness crisis to distract the public and deflect blame for years of failed policies.”
Cities from Los Angeles to New York have stepped up efforts to clear encampments, records reviewed by the Associated Press show, as public pressure grew to address what some residents say are dangerous and unsanitary living conditions. But despite tens of millions of dollars spent in recent years, there appears to be little reduction in the number of tents propped up on sidewalks, in parks and by freeway off-ramps.
It is unclear whether the case will be argued in the spring or the fall.

Details: Lecornu noted that in the coming weeks, Paris will supply six Caesar howitzers to Kyiv, with plans for the delivery of another 72 by early 2025. In total, around 78 howitzers are expected to be produced over the course of just over a year.
""Currently, there are 49 of them [Caesar howitzers – ed.] in Ukraine, which has led to tactical success. Our initiative aims to produce 78 Caesar howitzers in 2024, and we encourage Europeans and other allies to co-finance the effort,"" Lecornu said in an interview with Le Parisien.
Lecornu noted that Ukraine bought the six howitzers at its own expense. The creation of a French and American-led artillery coalition, aimed at strengthening Kyiv’s capabilities, is to be announced in Paris on Thursday.
Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umierov was scheduled to visit the French capital, but his trip was cancelled for security reasons. He will join the planned events online.
Lecornu added that the Caesar long-range self-propelled howitzer, the flagship of French artillery pieces, costs between €3-4 million, a price he believes is ""acceptable"" to Paris' allies.
Lecornu also said that the delivery of about 40 additional SCALP cruise missiles to Ukraine, promised by President Emmanuel Macron, will begin soon and will take a year, according to a schedule he did not elaborate upon.
Macron had previously announced that he would visit Ukraine in February to finalise a bilateral agreement on ""security guarantees"".

DRS0P0V1YT_8QEGEUASIB89YCI,Iran admits carrying out deadly strike on Pakistan territory,Paul Adams and Caroline Davies - In London and Islamabad,"January 19, 2024 at 12:05 AM·5 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/pakistan-says-children-killed-iranian-232500372.html,"Iran has admitted carrying out a missile and drone attack on western Pakistan on Tuesday.
Officials in Islamabad said two children were killed and three others injured in the attack in Balochistan.
Iran's foreign minister said the operation targeted the militant group Jaish al-Adl, which he described as an ""Iranian terrorist group"" in Pakistan.
As a result the Pakistan's government recalled its ambassador to Iran and has blocked Tehran's envoy from returning.
The Balochistan attack comes after Iran attacked targets in Iraq and Syria earlier this week.
Islamabad said the attack was ""illegal"" and warned of ""serious consequences"".
However Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, speaking in Davos, insisted that no Pakistani citizens had been targeted, only members of Jaish al-Adl.
""We only targeted Iranian terrorists on the soil of Pakistan,"" Mr Amir-Abdollahian said.
He added he had spoken to his Pakistani counterpart and ""assured him that we do respect sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan and Iraq"".
The latest air strike comes at a time of growing tension across the Middle East, with war raging between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza.
Tehran says it does not want to get involved in a wider conflict. But groups in its so-called ""Axis of Resistance"", which include the Houthi militants in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and various groups in Syria and Iraq, have been carrying out attacks on Israel and its allies to show solidarity with the Palestinians. The US and UK have launched air strikes on the Houthis after they attacked commercial shipping.
China on Wednesday urged Pakistan and Iran to show ""restraint"" and ""avoid actions that would lead to an escalation of tension"". Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning added that Beijing saw the countries as ""close neighbours"".
Perhaps stung by recent deadly attacks on home soil, Iran seems intent on exacting revenge on those it sees as responsible.
At a time of heightened regional tensions, Iran is keen to portray strength and demonstrate to its own population that acts of violence will not go unpunished.
Iran shows missile capabilities with regional strikes
Tuesday's strike in Pakistan hit a village in the vast south-western border province of Balochistan. Tehran said it was targeting Jaish al-Adl, or ""army of justice"", an ethnic Baloch Sunni Muslim group that has carried out attacks inside Iran as well as on Pakistani government forces.
Last December Jaish al-Adl attacked a police station in Rask, a town close to the border with Pakistan.
Two weeks ago Iran suffered its worst domestic attack since the Islamic Revolution, when two bombs killed 84 people at a ceremony in Kerman to commemorate the US assassination of Iran's notorious Revolutionary Guard general, Qasem Soleimani.
On Monday, Iran fired ballistic missiles at Syria and Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. Iran said it was targeting Islamic State and Israel's Mossad spy agency, both of whom it said had been involved in the Kerman bombings.
The strike on Iraq hit a building in the northern city of Irbil. Four civilians were killed and six hurt in the attack, local authorities said. The US condemned the attack.
Iran then struck Syria's north-western Idlib province, which is the last remaining opposition stronghold in the country and home to 2.9 million displaced people.
But hitting its nuclear-armed eastern neighbour Pakistan is a dramatic escalation. Pakistan expressed outrage, saying the attack took place ""despite the existence of several channels of communication"" between the countries.
On Wednesday Islamabad said it had recalled its ambassador to Iran and the Iranian ambassador would not be allowed back into the country for the time being.
Pakistan and Iran have a delicate but cordial relationship. This attack took place on the same day as Pakistan's prime minister and Iran's foreign minister met in Davos and while the Iranian and Pakistan navies held military drills together in the Gulf.
Yet both have accused one another of harbouring militant groups that carry out attacks on the other in their border areas for years.
Security on either side of their shared border, which runs for about 900km (559 miles), has been a long-running concern for both governments.
The Iranian strike is believed to have hit Sabz Koh village about 45km from the Iranian border and 90km from the nearest town Panjgur. Local officials described it as a sparsely populated area home to livestock-owning Baloch tribes where smuggling of goods, drugs and weapons is rife.
""People on both sides of the border consider themselves to be deprived of basic necessities, face discrimination and demand a larger share from their own resources,"" security commentator Zaigham Khan told the BBC.
In Iran, the Sunni Muslim Baloch minority complains of discrimination in the Shia Muslim-majority state, while Baloch separatist groups are continuing an insurgent movement against the Pakistani government.
Jaish al-Adl is the ""most active and influential"" Sunni militant group operating in Sistan-Baluchestan, according to the office of the US Director of National Intelligence. It is designated as a terrorist group by Washington and Tehran.
Another security commentator in Pakistan, Aamir Rana, told the BBC he thought the diplomatic crisis ""would take a while to calm down but this is also something that Pakistan would not like to escalate"".
He said in the past Pakistan had not reacted to Iran's actions along the border - ""but now the ball is in Iran's court, whether it wants to get its act right"".

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on July 11 that Ukraine would become a member of the alliance without a Membership Action Plan (MAP) and would receive an invitation when allies agreed that conditions were met.
Separately, G7 leaders have agreed on a declaration of support for Ukraine, which will form the basis for bilateral security guarantees.

Grant Shapps said UK and US warships repelled ""multiple"" attack drones.
The Houthis launched 21 drones and missiles on Tuesday, the US Central Command reported.
US and UK warships have repelled the ""largest attack"" by Iran-backed Houthis to date in the Red Sea, UK Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement on Wednesday.
Shapps said the UK's HMS Diamond warship, alongside US warships, destroyed ""multiple"" attack drones using guns and ""sea viper"" missiles.
No injuries or damage to the UK warship were reported, he said.
The US Central Command (CENTCOM), which had previously reported on the attack, offered more details on the military operation.
It said US warships and the UK's HMS Diamond shot down 21 drones and missiles that Houthi rebels had fired toward international shipping lanes on Tuesday night at 9:15 p.m. local time.
The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, USS Gravely, USS Laboon, and USS Mason repelled what was the 26th Houthi attack on commercial shipping lanes in the Red Sea since November 19, per CENTCOM.
There were no injuries or damage reported, it added.
Previous attacks by Houthi rebels included 14 drone attacks on December 16, 17 drone and missile attacks on December 26, and attempts to hijack a cargo ship on December 31.
But Tuesday's attack was the biggest the US has repelled in the region.
The attacks targeting commercial and merchant vessels in the vital Red Sea waterway have had economists worried about the massive disruption they could have on the world economy, with some warning of inflationary pressures.
To prevent such a scenario, the Pentagon announced Operation Prosperity Guardian in mid-December 2023, a new multinational security operation designed to counter threats by Houthi forces against international maritime commerce heading or related to Israel.
More than 20 countries had joined the operation as of December 21, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said at a Pentagon news conference at the time.
However, the operation was criticized as just a ""Band-Aid"" to an escalating problem by Brian Raymond, the executive vice president of client risk management at international security firm Global Guardian.
Raymond told Business Insider that shooting down drones and missiles won't cut it and that negotiations in the region should take place to ""tamp down this activity.""
""When does this get addressed in a meaningful manner? We just can't keep shooting things down that come off the eastern or the western side of Yemen,"" Raymond said, adding that ""eventually something is going to happen that's much more catastrophic.""
In his statement on Wednesday, the UK defense minister said that the UK, alongside its allies ""have previously made clear that these illegal attacks are completely unacceptable, and if continued, the Houthis will bear the consequences.""

E23JUI36WN_AQXRM7HTX8IH1OV,Dual-use exports to Russia await action by Finland’s next leader,Elisabeth Gosselin-Malo,"January 18, 2024 at 12:40 AM·3 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/dual-exports-russia-await-action-164044695.html,"MILAN — As Finns get ready to head to the polls, over a dozen Finnish companies have been reported to have evaded sanctions by exporting dual-use goods to Russia, a challenge which experts say will be a key issue to tackle by the next leadership.
The upcoming Finnish presidential election will take place on Jan 28., marking the end of President Sauli Niinistö's time in office after 12 years.
Nicknamed a “Putin whisperer” by the media for his enduring contacts with the Kremlin before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Niinistö played an important part in the process leading up to Finland gaining its official NATO membership in April 2023.
Experts note that running candidates appear to have put up a more united front than in previous elections on crucial topics, including maintaining aid to Ukraine.
“As Finland shares the longest border of any NATO member with Russia, it has been necessary to at least have a composed relationship [amongst candidates] to some degree, while being firm on where Finland stands as an EU and NATO member,” Robert Eklund, chair of the board at the Finnish security policy think tank Elisabeth Rehn – Bank of Ideas, said.
“All candidates running have been unwavering in their support for Ukraine, and that is one of the key things they have in common – a resolve to support Ukraine for as long as it needs it,” he added.
Alexander Stubb, a former Finnish prime minister and front runner in the upcoming election, pledged unconditional support to Kyiv during an interview with Reuters earlier this month, calling on Moscow to end its assault.
Most contenders have publicly expressed no willingness to engage with Moscow until its leadership ends the full-scale war it is waging against Kyiv. The Finnish presidential election will prove all the more important as it comes ahead of the Russian one, scheduled for mid-March.
Two weeks prior to the elections, public broadcasting media company Yle, reported that over 20 Finnish companies with a Russian background had been found to have exported various dual-use items to Moscow.
According to customs data obtained by Yle, one of the involved firms operating in southeast Finland would have sent sensors, diesel engines, fuel pumps and transmission equipment to Russia.
Analysts say that while this incident is relatively unsurprising, as other similar ones have previously been reported, the number of companies involved this time around is unusual.
“It is not surprising there are companies which ship these kinds of products to Russia, as in September for instance, there was also news that the CEO of two Finnish companies, Siberica and Luminor, was detained on charges of having violated Russian sanctions,” Kari Paasonen, fellow at the Finnish peace and security think-tank SaferGlobe, said.
“However, the number of companies the report reveals is remarkably high. Over the years, there have also been other cases of illegal shipments of arms through Finland reported,” Paasonen added.
In this high-profile case, the two listed companies are currently under investigation by the Finnish customs authorities as they are believed to have exported around 3,500 drones as well as other electronic components to Russia.
Firms circumventing Russian sanctions is a thorny problem that other European countries have also struggled with, and one that has proven increasingly difficult to manage.
“In many cases, these goods are not sold directly from the manufacturer to the user, but rather they are traded through local dealer networks, which makes it difficult for Western companies wanting to abide to the sanctions regime, to control where their products end up,” Robin Häggblom, independent Finnish defense analyst, said.
While the Yle report highlights an important issue, experts said that it is unlikely to influence the election directly, as the consensus about adhering to Russian export bans is widely shared.
“There will unlikely be any fallout. That said, preventing sanctions evasion in my view will be a top priority for [upcoming] Finnish foreign policy,” Matti Pesu, leading researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, said."

Source: UK Defence Ministry intelligence review dated 16 January on X (formerly Twitter); European Pravda
Details: The UK Defence Ministry noted that over the past week, neither Russian nor Ukrainian troops have gained any significant positions at the contact line.
Despite the progress made in capturing Marinka at the end of December 2023, Russia could not take advantage of this and move either west to Kurakhove or south to Novomykhailivka.
The encirclement of Avdiivka probably remains a key focus of Russian efforts, but to date, Russia has achieved minimal territorial success at significant cost, both in material and human terms.
The northern village of Stepove remains under the control of Ukraine, which provides access to the supply route to Avdiivka. UK observers say Russian efforts to isolate the city are unlikely for at least the following week.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian marines continue to hold a bridgehead in Krynky on the eastern bank of the Dnipro River, despite Russia's attempts to drive them out.
They will likely continue to fight for this territory for the next week.
Background:
Earlier, UK Defence Intelligence stated that statements made about the replenishment of the Russian army in 2023 by another 500,000 people are an exaggeration.
UK intelligence also analysed the impact of FPV drones on the situation on the left bank of the Kherson Oblast.

The incident occurred after take-off from Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario, California, forcing pilots to turn back and land safely with all 171 passengers and six crew on board.
After grounding the three planes operated by Lion Air on Jan. 6 and later inspecting them, Indonesia's transport ministry said it had allowed them to fly again since Jan. 11.
Lion Air said in a statement the planes had different configurations from the Alaska Airline plane.

But now, the crisis is threatening to upend America’s support for the war in Ukraine, throwing the centerpiece of Biden’s foreign policy into jeopardy.
Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times
After a meeting with Biden at the White House on Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson insisted that the Republican-led House would not pass legislation to send aid to Ukraine unless Democrats agreed to sweeping new restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border.
And even if the two sides do come to some sort of agreement, many Republicans, especially in the House, would be loath to give an election-year win to Biden on an issue that has given them a powerful line of criticism toward the White House. The issue is also at the center of the candidacy of Biden’s likely opponent this fall, former President Donald Trump.
The stalemate shows how the debate over immigration in the United States is no longer just about the border. The issue is spilling over into other parts of Biden’s agenda, taking on outsize influence as Republicans use it to block the president’s top foreign policy priorities.
“I think the vast majority of members of Congress support aid to Ukraine,” Biden told reporters on Thursday before traveling to Raleigh, North Carolina. “The question is whether or not a small minority are going to hold it up, which would be a disaster.”
Biden has characterized aid to Ukraine as a matter of American leadership on the global stage. If the United States fails to send more, he warned last month, other allies may back off their own commitments. President Vladimir Putin of Russia, he said, could reclaim momentum in the war.
But House Republicans have so far been unmoved. Johnson said this week he was focused on “national security and a humanitarian catastrophe” within U.S. borders.
Janet Napolitano, former governor of Arizona and homeland security secretary in the Obama administration, said she could not remember a time in recent decades when so much of an administration’s agenda hinged on immigration policy.
The legislation that Biden is pushing does not only include Ukraine aid. It also has money for Israel and Taiwan — and billions of dollars to bolster security along the U.S.-Mexico border, just not enough to satisfy Republican demands.
“They looked at this as an opportunity and they’ve taken it,” said Napolitano, who described the politics of immigration right now as “dire.”
“It really means the president has got to go as far as he can and to work with those across the aisle to get a package through,” she said.
Biden has said he is willing to make compromises on the border. Democratic negotiators, with the approval of the White House, have signaled that they would consider proposals making it more difficult to gain asylum in the United States.
The White House has appeared less willing to substantially restrict humanitarian parole, a program that has allowed thousands of Afghans, Ukrainians and migrants at the border to enter the United States.
While members of Congress are still debating details of that policy, it’s not clear that compromise is in the cards.
In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday evening, Johnson made a point of saying he had spoken about the negotiations with Trump, who encouraged him to oppose compromising.
Biden is also facing pushback from progressives, who do not want to see restrictions on asylum.
“Republicans are holding foreign aid hostage to extract extreme immigration measures that would not solve the problem,” said Rep. Nanette Barragán, D-Calif., chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. “Many of us support aid to Ukraine, but not at the expense of these extreme immigration policies on the table.”
Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a center-left think tank, said the linking of aid for Ukraine to border restrictions was “unprecedented.”
“It’s hard to imagine a time previously in our nation’s history where something that is so important from a national security standpoint, that would normally unite all Americans of both political parties, is caught up in games,” Kessler said.
The White House initially portrayed the decision to pair immigration with the military funding request as an enticement, or at the very least an attempt at compromise, to win over Republicans who had been calling on Biden to get tougher on the border.
William B. Taylor Jr., who served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009, said there would be severe consequences both for Ukraine and the United States if the strategy ended up failing.
“I imagine that the calculation was that there’s a lot of support for these and if we put them all together we’ll have a winning strategy,” Taylor said. But if the White House cannot reach a deal, he added, it would undermine “a crucial component of U.S. foreign policy.”
“That U.S. leadership would be badly damaged if we can’t provide the assistance to the Ukrainians to allow them to stop the Russians now,” he said. “It has enormous implications.”

EVWJEHZH87_1RFDX9TG6HQDRV5,LA County calls on Azerbaijan to release Armenian hostages,Alexi Chidbachian,"January 10, 2024 at 5:25 AM·2 min read",20240110,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/la-county-calls-azerbaijan-release-212559008.html,"LOS ANGELES - The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved a motion Tuesday that calls for the release of Armenians being held hostage by Azerbaijan.
Since September 2023, Azerbaijan has been holding eight former military and political leaders of Artsakh captive as political prisoners along with 36 other Armenian prisoners. After months of fighting, Azerbaijan claimed full control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region (also known as Artsakh), resulting in 120,000 ethnic Armenians being forced to leave their indigenous land.
The Armenians in Artsakh have been dealing with a humanitarian crisis since Azerbaijani officials launched a full-scale war in 2020. During the six week war, Azerbaijan reclaimed parts of Nagorno-Karabakh and destroyed ancient Armenian churches and buildings. More than 6,700 people died in the fighting, which ended with a Russian-brokered peace agreement. Since then, over 100,00 Armenians were displaced and a 10-month blockade by Azerbaijan left those Artsakh without food or medicine.
""We need to hold Azerbaijan accountable for violations of humanitarian law. As leaders of a County that is home to the greatest number of Armenians outside of Armenia itself, we must do what is within our power and use our voice to condemn Azerbaijan’s violations of human rights and urge the return of all Armenian hostages and prisoners of war,"" said Supervisor Kathryn Barger who co-authored the motion with Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell.

""We must make it clear that these crimes against humanity will not be tolerated by our government,"" said Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell.
The Supervisors are urging the US government put pressure on Azerbaijan to release all Armenian prisoners of war. The county says a letter will be sent with all five Supervisors' signatures to President Biden, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, and Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen urging the administration to take action and suspend all U.S. military and economic assistance to Azerbaijan.
In November, Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, said a total of 55 Armenian POWs were held by Azerbaijani officials, including six civilians, 41 soldiers and eight separatist leaders who were arrested. In December, Armenia and Azerbaijan exchanged prisoners in a swap. Azerbaijan released 32 Armenians, who were mostly captured in 2020, and Armenia released two Azerbaijani soldiers held since April."

Source: European Pravda
Details: The Office of the President of Ukraine reported earlier that 81 countries and international organisations had taken part in the meeting, but China was not among them, although Beijing had been invited. Two sources confirmed China’s absence to European Pravda.
When European Pravda asked Andrii Yermak, Head of the President’s Office, a question about who attended the meeting, he replied that many Western countries and countries of the Global South had participated.
Quote: ""The number of participants is increasing – over 80 countries and international organisations [participated this time]. There were 66 at the previous meeting in Malta.""
Yermak added that ""a lot of countries are expressing their opinions, especially the countries of the Global South"".
A European Pravda source said Davos was deliberately chosen as the location of the peace formula meeting so that Chinese representatives would not have to travel, as they are already in Davos attending the World Economic Forum.
Of the four Ukrainian Peace Formula meetings so far, only one, held in Jeddah in early August last year, has been attended by a Chinese representative. At the time, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called China’s participation a ""major breakthrough"".
China was not present at the following meeting in Malta. The Office of the President of Ukraine said this was due to a ""scheduling conflict"".

The embassy in Bogota said Wednesday eight Americans died between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31, including involuntary drugging overdoses or suspected homicides.
It added that the deaths are not believed to be linked as they each involved ""distinct circumstances"" but noted that several of the deaths indicated the possibility of drugging, robbery and overdose and several involved the use of dating apps.
""Criminals use dating apps to lure victims to meet in public places such as hotels, restaurants and bars, and then later assault and rob them,"" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. ""Numerous U.S. citizens in Colombia have been drugged, robbed and even killed by their Colombian dates.""
The embassy said that over the last year it had seen an increase in reports involving use of dating apps to lure victims, especially foreigners, for robbery.
They typically meet in public places, but then later assault and rob them.
The embassy advised travelers to use caution if they use dating apps in Colombia and to meet any strangers only in public places.
Travelers should also tell friends or family members their travel plans, including details on anyone they are meeting, along with the name of the app if using dating apps.
The embassy said it regularly gets reports of dating apps being used to lure victims in Medellin, Cartagena and Bogota, as well as other Colombian cities.
The security alert follows one issued Jan. 2 that advised increased caution and reconsideration of travel to Colombia due to ""crime and terrorism."" That advisory said civil unrest and risks of kidnapping had increased and ""violent crime, such as homicide, assault and armed robbery, is widespread.""
Thefts against tourists went up 200% in the third trimester of 2023, according to the Tourism Observatory of the District Personnel of Medellin. Violent deaths of foreign visitors went up by 29% and most of the 2023 victims were U.S. citizens."

The European Parliament decided to assess Thursday whether to take the bloc's executive branch, the European Commission, to court over allegations that it gave into blackmail from Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to get his approval to start membership talks with Ukraine.
The European Parliament made the decision in a 345-104 vote and tasked its legal department to prepare the groundwork for a possible challenge at the EU's highest court. It wants to see whether the European Commission took all measures “to protect the EU’s financial interests” in its dealings with Orbán. They said that Hungary didn't meet the rule of law requirements to get the money.
The vote followed a bruising debate in the plenary during which legislators of major center-right and center-left groups all criticized European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for making sure the money was approved just before Orbán unexpectedly and crucially abstained from the Ukraine vote at a summit in December.
The funds were only supposed to be released if Hungary had shown enough effort to force through some rule of law reforms on judicial independence and political interference, and during Wednesday's plenary, von der Leyen said that the country had pushed through measures to earn the release of funds.
She said the European Commission had no option but to approve the funds and strongly denied the two issues were linked.
“These are the rules we have all agreed to,” she said. “We will follow them. This is what makes the rule of law stand out from arbitrary power.
Many parliamentarians disagreed, however.
“Once again the Parliament is having to step in,"" said parliamentary rapporteur Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield of the Greens group, complaining that the European Commission and the member states “seem happy to give a carte blanche to Viktor Orbán to continue his bullying tactics and attacks on the rule of law.”
The EU is still blocking around 20 billion euros (nearly $22 billion) in funds over similar rule of law concerns, and the parliament doesn't want to see them fall prey to political brinkmanship. On Feb. 1, EU leaders will have another summit, hoping to approve 50 billion euros (nearly $55 billion) in much-needed financial aid to Ukraine, which Orbán did block at the last summit in December.
It wasn't the first time Orbán had derailed EU plans to provide funding to Ukraine. The nationalist leader is widely considered to be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in the EU, and has been accused by his critics of promoting Moscow’s interests over those of his EU and NATO allies.
Orbán has advocated for an immediate end to the fighting and pushed for peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, though he hasn't detailed what such a step would entail for Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
Orbán has been at odds with his fellow EU leaders, top officials and legislators for years, ranging from fights over COVID-19 recovery money to his declining respect for the Western democratic principles that are the essence of the EU. Yet as the longest-serving EU leader, he knows the EU rules inside out and has been able to extract financial concessions time and again to shore up his struggling economy."

Here’s the latest:
• Record-breaking cold for Iowa caucuses: Monday saw the coldest Iowa caucuses on record, with Des Moines’ highest temperature for the day hitting just one degree Fahrenheit. Other high temperatures across the state were some 25 to 30 degrees below normal for this time of year. And the frigid wind chills are cold enough to cause frostbite in as little as 10 minutes on exposed skin.
• Nearly 80% of US to see below freezing temperatures: Over 140 daily cold records could be broken Monday and Tuesday from Oregon to Mississippi, as temperatures in Memphis, Dallas and Nashville are expected to stay below freezing for at least 72 consecutive hours.
• Severe weather kills at least five: Brutal back-to-back severe storms over the last few days have left at least five people dead across four states, including Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee, where one weather-related death was reported in Shelby County, which includes Memphis. At least two weather-related deaths were also reported in Oregon over the weekend.
• Treacherous travel conditions: Snow, sleet and freezing rain gathered on roadways across parts of the southern and central US Sunday night into Monday, making travel hazardous. One person was killed and another was injured in Arkansas after their pickup truck careened off a snowy White County highway and hit a tree, according to state police. In nearby Mississippi, one person died Sunday evening in a weather-related crash, according to the state’s emergency management agency. The wintry mix will continue from Texas through the Lower Mississippi Valley into parts of the Tennessee Valley and Southern Appalachians. “Have a cold survival kit if you must travel,” the National Weather Service said.
• Life-threatening wind chills: More than 100 million people in the US are under wind chill alerts stretching from the Canadian border to the Mexican border. Breezy winds are contributing to life-threatening wind chills. In South Dakota, wind chills as low as minus 45 can cause frostbite in as little as 5 minutes. Wind chills of 30 degrees below zero are expected from the Northern Rockies to northern Kansas and into Iowa.
• Texas’s vulnerable power grid: As Texas shivers under the freezing cold, ERCOT, which manages 90% of the state’s electric load, asked Texans to conserve energy both Monday and Tuesday mornings, expecting tight grid conditions. The request also asked all government agencies to reduce energy use at their facilities until at least Tuesday morning.
• Big city snowless streaks could finally end: Snow from this storm will push across the mid-Atlantic Monday and across the Northeast late Monday through Tuesday. Around 1 to 3 inches of snow is possible across both regions. Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New York City haven’t had an inch of snow fall in a single day in more than 700 days.
• Thousands of flights canceled: More than 3,100 flights within, into or out of the US were canceled on Monday, and more than 9,000 were delayed, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware.com
• Schools close: Districts in more than half a dozen states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia announced closures amid the frigid temperatures.
More than 70 million people are under winter weather alerts spread over 1,400 miles from parts of the Texas-Mexico border to southern New York.
The storm will lay down snow from Oklahoma to Virginia while ice falls to the south.
Snow totals of 2 to 4 inches were common from Sunday to Monday morning from Oklahoma through Tennessee and Kentucky. A few locations in Arkansas and Tennessee picked up 6 to 8 inches of snow by Monday afternoon. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear on Monday said a second round of “light to moderate snow” is expected through Tuesday morning mainly in eastern and southeastern Kentucky and urged residents to stay off the roads, warning temperatures were expected to remain “dangerously low.”
Totals will increase as snow continues to fall in parts of the Tennessee Valley Monday. In Tennessee’s Shelby County, Mayor Lee Harris declared a state of emergency after the community saw several inches of snow, he said on social media. Parts of the county saw 3 to 6 inches of snow, with temperatures plummeting to 9 degrees Monday evening, according to CNN Meteorologist Taylor Ward.
Meanwhile, a wintry mix of freezing rain and sleet targeted areas from Texas to Mississippi, unloading a glaze of ice and up to an inch of sleet on area roadways by Monday morning.
Memphis, which has had no measurable snow so far this year, picked up between 3 and 6 inches by Monday afternoon.
Heavy snow was expected over parts of the Central Rockies into Monday evening, and lake-effect snow was expected to persist downwind from the Great Lakes through Tuesday, according to the weather service.
Already, numerous cold daily records have been broken across the central US as the arctic blast moved toward the southern US. In Kansas City, Missouri, the temperature dropped to minus 3 degrees Sunday – smashing a previous record of 0 degrees set in 1979.
The storm will clear the South by late Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Oregon is still cleaning up after a potent winter storm accumulated three-quarters of an inch of ice in some cities and damaging winds resulted in widespread power outages over the weekend. More than 90,000 homes and businesses were without power Monday afternoon, according to the tracking site PowerOutage.us. Strong winds will continue to pound parts of the state Monday.

FDWF1Z7UAG_TNN6IYWFNTCNP0L,DNA from ancient Europeans reveals surprising multiple sclerosis origins,Will Dunham,"January 10, 2024 at 8:54 AM·4 min read",20240110,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/dna-ancient-europeans-reveals-surprising-165435733.html,"By Will Dunham
(Reuters) - DNA obtained from the bones and teeth of ancient Europeans who lived up to 34,000 years ago is providing insight into the origin of the often-disabling neurological disease multiple sclerosis, finding that genetic variants that now increase its risk once served to protect people from animal-borne diseases.
The findings stemmed from research involving ancient DNA sequenced from 1,664 people from various sites across Western Europe and Asia. These ancient genomes were then compared with modern DNA from the UK Biobank, comprising about 410,000 self-identified ""white-British"" people, and more than 24,000 others born outside the United Kingdom, to discern changes over time.
One striking discovery related to MS, a chronic disease of the brain and spinal cord that is considered an autoimmune disorder in which the body mistakenly attacks itself.
The researchers identified a pivotal migration event about 5,000 years ago at the start of the Bronze Age when livestock herders called the Yamnaya people moved into Western Europe from an area that includes modern Ukraine and southern Russia.
They carried genetic traits that at the time were beneficial, protective against infections that could arise from their sheep and cattle. As sanitary conditions improved over the millennia, these same variants increased MS risk. This helps explain, the researchers said, why Northern Europeans have the world's highest MS prevalence, double that of Southern Europeans.
""We are a product of the evolution that happened in past environments, and in many ways we are not optimally adapted to the environment we have created for ourselves today,"" said University of California, Berkeley population geneticist Rasmus Nielsen, one of the leaders of the research published on Wednesday in the journal Nature.
Around 11,000 years ago, farmers from the area of modern Turkey expanded into Western Europe, replacing hunter-gatherers. It was these agriculturalists who the Yamnaya later replaced.
""The Yamnaya were Europe's first true nomads. They used domesticated cattle and horses to access the interiors of the Asian Steppe, where there is little to eat or drink, so carried everything with them on wagons. Physically they were unusually large, which we can see by measuring the skeletons and also genetically, and apparently fairly violent,"" University of Cambridge geneticist and study co-author William Barrie said.
""We think that much of the replacement that happened involved warfare,"" Nielsen added.
High Yamnaya-related ancestry exists in Northern Europeans, peaking in Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden and decreasing further south.
The findings underscore how genetic traits can change from beneficial to deleterious as conditions evolve.
""Pathogenic infections increased in frequency during the Bronze Age, due to close proximity between people and their domestic animals, as well as rising population density,"" University of Copenhagen computational evolutionary biology specialist and research co-author Evan Irving-Pease said.
""It was not until the modern era, with widespread sanitation and medical care, that these genetic variants became surplus to our immunological requirements, resulting in an increase in the risk of developing MS and other autoimmune diseases,"" Irving-Pease added.
The findings may carry implications for MS research and treatment.
""This changes our view of MS, helping us understand its origins. We can see MS as the result of an immune system which has efficiently evolved to cope with a range of infections in the human past but which now exists in a very different environment. This difference between the past and modern sanitary environments likely causes the overactive immune system. This implies we should be aiming to recalibrate the immune system rather than suppress it,"" Barrie said.
The research shed light on other characteristics of Europeans.
Because the Yamnaya were genetically predisposed to being tall, present-day Northern Europeans tend to be taller than Southern Europeans, who have greater ancestry from Neolithic farmers who were genetically predisposed to being short.
Eastern Europeans have a heightened genetic risk for Alzheimer's and type 2 diabetes, the researchers found. They also discovered that lactose tolerance, the ability to digest the sugar in milk and other dairy products, emerged in Europe approximately 6,000 years ago.

FG3J0UAO5M_OSL25AQED0KECVS,North Korea sentences 2 teens to 12 years of hard labor for watching K-pop: report,Lawrence Richard,"January 19, 2024 at 9:38 PM·3 min read",20240119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/north-korea-sentences-2-teens-133834635.html,"Two North Korean teenagers were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor after they were previously convicted of watching K-pop videos, according to a video released Friday.
K-pop, or Korean pop, is South Korean music which is barred in the North. North Korea has imposed tough sentences on anyone caught enjoying South Korean entertainment, including movies and music videos, to reduce outside influence under a sweeping new ""anti-reactionary thought"" law that was first imposed in 2020.
Reuters reported North Korean authorities sentenced the two 16-year-old girls during a public hearing and that video footage of the sentencing was released Friday by the South and North Development (SAND) Institute, an organization that works with North Korean defectors.
K-pop bands like the seven-member band BTS, the all-female Blackpink and the South Korean duo TVXQ have surged in popularity in South Korea and around the world for their charisma and soulful harmonies.

The video, produced by North Korean authorities, shows the two handcuffed students wearing gray scrubs in an amphitheater with about 1,000 students watching the sentencing.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
Choi Kyong-hui, president of SAND and doctor of Political Science at Tokyo University, who defected from North Korea in 2001, told Reuters that the heavy punishment is likely to be a message to other students and the country.
""Judging from the heavy punishment, it seems that this is to be shown to people across North Korea to warn them. If so, it appears this lifestyle of South Korean culture is prevalent in North Korean society,"" Choi said.
RECORD-BREAKING HIT SONG 'GANGNAM STYLE' TURNS 10 YEARS OLD
The date of the sentencing was not provided, but all the students, including the two 16-year-olds, were wearing face masks in the video. Choi suggested this could mean the video was recorded during the COVID pandemic.
""I think this video was edited around 2022... What is troublesome for (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un is that Millennials and Gen Z young people have changed their way of thinking. I think he's working on turning it back to the North Korean way,"" Choi added.
In the video, the narrator said the students were convicted of watching and spreading South Korean movies, music and music videos over three months.
""They were seduced by foreign culture... and ended up ruining their lives,"" the narrator can be heard saying before it shows the teens.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain turbulent as the North continues to develop and test nuclear and ballistic technologies. The effort to bolster its arsenal comes in preparation for a potential war with the South and its allies, which include the United States and Japan.
Earlier this month, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un said that he would be discarding his country’s longstanding idea of a peaceful reunification with South Korea and would be revising its constitution accordingly.
North Korea is technically still at war with democratic South Korea after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce and not a formal peace treaty.

Germany has offered to intervene on Israel's behalf in the case brought by South Africa at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague.
President Hage Geingob urged Germany to ""reconsider its untimely decision to intervene as a third-party in defence"".
In 2021 Berlin acknowledged committing genocide in Namibia.
German colonisers massacred more than 70,000 Herero and Nama people between 1904 and 1908. Historians consider this to be the 20th Century's first genocide.
President Geingob said Germany could not ""morally express commitment to the United Nations Convention against genocide, including atonement for the genocide in Namibia"" and at the same time support Israel.
""The German Government is yet to fully atone for the genocide it committed on Namibian soil,"" he added.
On Friday the German government said the accusation of genocide against Israel was completely unfounded and amounted to a ""political instrumentalisation"" of the UN genocide convention.
""In view of Germany's history and the crime against humanity of the Holocaust, the government sees itself as particularly committed to the genocide convention,"" it said.
It said Hamas - which attacked Israel on 7 October, triggering the current war - aimed to destroy Israel, which was acting in self defence.
Hamas killed about 1,300 people, most of them civilians, and took about 240 others hostage on 7 October.
Since then Israel has killed nearly 24,000 people, mostly children and women, in its retaliatory attacks on Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. The UN and humanitarian organisations have warned of the risk of famine in Gaza as well as the spread of disease among displaced people and have urged that more aid be allowed into the territory.
The scale of the Israeli response prompted South Africa to ask the ICJ to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza.
Pretoria's case included a litany of alleged Israeli offences, from the indiscriminate killing of Palestinian civilians to the wholesale destruction of Gaza's infrastructure.
Israel has strongly rejected the allegation, calling it ""baseless"" and its legal team was scathing about South Africa's submission, arguing that if anyone was guilty of genocide, it was Hamas.

Credit - Danny Lawson–PA Images/Getty Images
The head of counter-terrorism policing in the U.K. warned there has been an “unprecedented” spike in terrorism threats since the Israel-Hamas war began in October.
Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Matt Jukes told a gathering of journalists on Friday that there has been a 25% rise in counter-terrorism intelligence, which is ""a significant increase,” Sky News reported. He said the war had created a ""radicalization moment,” which had the potential to push people toward terrorism, per the BBC.
""It's hard to remember a more unstable, dangerous and uncertain world,” Jukes, the U.K.’s most senior counter-terrorism officer, said.
Threats have increased since the militant group Hamas, which governs Gaza, attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking some 240 hostage. Israel responded by bombarding and invading the territory, killing 24,762 people as of Friday, according to Gaza’s health ministry. The conflict has ignited protests and hate crimes against both Muslims and Jews around the world.
In the U.S., the FBI warned of increased terrorism threats over the holiday period because of the war, echoing repeated concerns from its head Christopher Wray that Hamas’ attack would inspire copycats and put Americans at greater risk.
In the U.K., a Met Police spokesperson tells TIME in an email that its Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit has received more than 2,700 referrals from the public relating to online content linked to the war since October.The unit identified around 630 cases that have a link to the U.K. and could potentially be in breach of terrorism or other laws, or otherwise of interest to policing, and passed around 150 cases on for further police investigation or action. Around 20 are being investigated by the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command, while the rest are in the hands of regional units or local police forces.
Since Oct. 7, police have made 33 arrests for terrorism crimes—19 related to protests, 13 in connection with social media and one about an alleged attack, Sky News reported. Seven people were charged and the rest remain on bail or under investigation, the news outlet said. Per reports, of those arrested, 20% were under the age of 18, with children as young as 11 involved in concerning conversations online.
Police also tell TIME they launched around 30 investigations into suspected offenses at protests in London, the majority of which they say relate to potential terrorism offenses. Police say they arrested 11 people in connection with these investigations, with four charged and awaiting trial.
Despite the rise in reports, the U.K.’s official threat level of terrorism has not changed since the war started. The threat level has remained at “substantial”—meaning an attack is “likely”—since February 2022, when it was downgraded from “severe,” the most extreme level that means an attack is “highly likely.”

The changes apply to services including Azure, Microsoft 365, Power Platform, and Dynamics 365, the Seattle-based tech company said.
Cloud computing companies have been moving to localize data storage and processing amid tightening requirements in the 27-nation European Union, which has strict data privacy laws.
Brussels and Washington have spent years wrangling over the safety of EU citizens’ data that tech companies store in the U.S. following revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the American government eavesdropped on people’s online data and communications.
Microsoft said its “EU Data Boundary solution goes beyond European compliance requirements."" The company has previously pledged that customers wouldn't have their data moved outside the EU.
Last year, it started storing and processing some data inside Europe. Now it's expanding that to all personal data, including pseudonymized data found in automated system logs, which are generated automatically when online services run.

FQYS9OWWAU_FGG9YV4G6G8MGJA,New Data Shows That One In 10 US Restaurants Offer Mexican Cuisine,John Tolley,"January 15, 2024 at 2:00 PM·3 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/data-shows-one-10-us-220016133.html,"Pew Research Center data has unveiled a fascinating facet of America's culinary landscape, revealing that a noteworthy 11% of all restaurants in the United States serve Mexican cuisine. Delving deeper into these findings, it becomes evident that the influence of Mexican culture is ingrained across the nation. A staggering 85% of U.S. counties boast at least one Mexican restaurant, emphasizing the widespread appeal and integration of Mexican flavors into the American palate.
This sheer volume of Mexican eateries signifies more than just a culinary trend. It speaks volumes about the cultural amalgamation that defines the United States. The diversity and richness of Mexican cuisine have become an integral part of the American experience, stretching from the popularity of Tex-Mex cuisine to the growing appreciation for the breadth of our southern neighbor's full culinary spectrum. Whether you find yourself in the Heartland or on the coasts, the chances are high that you're just a short distance away from at least some iteration of Mexican cuisine, be that familiar fare like tacos or something a bit less well-known.
What's more, the fact that Mexican restaurants are found in 85% of U.S. counties underscores the cultural diversity and integration that characterizes American society. It reflects fully the role that Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans play in all aspects of society and it cements their place in the nation's identity. The popularity of Mexican cuisine extends beyond merely satisfying taste buds; it symbolizes a shared appreciation for the diversity that defines the American experience.

While Mexican restaurants are dispersed throughout the United States, their concentration is particularly notable in specific regions. Unsurprisingly, California and Texas as well as other states situated near the Mexican border, host a significant number of these eateries. This proximity speaks not only to geographic convenience but also to the historical and cultural connections between these border regions. Let us not forget that a significant portion of what is now the American Southwest and West Coast were once part of Mexico.
Major urban centers such as Chicago and New York City are also culinary hubs for Mexican cuisine. The presence of Mexican eateries in these bustling metropolises underscores not only the thriving Mexican communities therein but also the widespread popularity and acceptance of Mexican food by the larger population. It reflects a broader trend where the culinary landscape mirrors the multicultural fabric of these cities. But it's not just the cities that have vibrant Mexican communities and representation.
Indeed, the thriving Mexican food scene across the country indicates that Mexican-American identity is American identity, and all Americans, regardless of their cultural background, have developed a profound appreciation for Mexican flavors. One might even argue that Mexican cuisine is inextricably linked to the cuisine of the U.S., as is evidenced not just by the impressive number of Mexican restaurants that dot the nation, but by the large number of non-Mexican focused restaurants that also feature Mexican or Mexican-inspired menu items.

FWYP6OTHPF_9HD75PGXDHER209,Kidnapping of California woman that police called a hoax gets new attention with Netflix documentary,Associated Press,"January 19, 2024 at 6:28 AM·4 min read",20240118,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/kidnapping-california-woman-police-called-222800435.html,"VALLEJO, Calif. (AP) — The ordeal of Denise Huskins, whose kidnapping from her boyfriend’s Northern California home was first dismissed as a hoax by law enforcement, is getting renewed attention as the subject of a new Netflix docuseries, “American Nightmare.”
Here’s a look at the facts of the case, which captivated the country:
THE KIDNAPPING
On March 23, 2015, Huskins was kidnapped by a masked intruder who broke into the home in Vallejo, a city in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her boyfriend, Aaron Quinn, told detectives he woke up to a bright light on his face and that intruders had drugged, blindfolded and tied both of them up before forcefully taking Huskins in the middle of the night. Quinn also said the kidnappers were demanding an $8,500 ransom.
A Vallejo police detective interrogated Quinn for hours, at times suggesting he may have been involved in Huskins’ disappearance. Quinn took a polygraph test which an FBI agent told him he failed, the couple said later in a book about their ordeal.
Huskins, who was 29 at the time, turned up unharmed two days later outside her father’s apartment in Huntington Beach, a city in Southern California, where she said she was dropped off. She reappeared just hours before the ransom was due.
POLICE CALL IT A HOAX
That same day, police in Vallejo announced in a news conference that they had found no evidence of a kidnapping and accused Huskins and Quinn of faking the abduction, which spurred a massive search.
Police said they became suspicious because Quinn waited hours to report the kidnapping. At the news conference, spokesman Kenny Park expressed disgust over the resources supposedly squandered, with 40 detectives assigned to the case, and the fear it caused among the community.
“It was such an incredible story, we initially had a hard time believing it, and upon further investigation, we couldn’t substantiate any of the things he was saying,” Park said.
But Quinn and Huskins were adamant that it wasn’t a hoax and insisted they were the victims. Quinn's attorney explained the delay in reporting to police by noting that his client had been bound and drugged.
A SUSPECT IS CAUGHT AND CONVICTED
The couple were proven right when Matthew Muller, a disbarred, Harvard-educated attorney, was caught and charged in Huskins' abduction.
Muller was arrested on June 8, 2015, in South Lake Tahoe for a home-invasion robbery that occurred in Dublin, a city in the Bay Area, and that had similarities to the Vallejo case. Investigators found a laptop that resembled one that belonged to Quinn and had been taken.
A search of a stolen car connected to Muller turned up numerous other items, including a water pistol with a flashlight and laser pointer on it, and a pair of goggles similar to the ones Huskins and Quinn said they were forced to wear during the kidnapping. In the goggles was a strand of long blond hair, the same color as the victim's. Detectives also determined that the vehicle’s navigation system history turned up a Huntington Beach address.
Muller pleaded guilty to the kidnapping and is serving a 40-year prison term.
THE AFTERMATH
Huskins and Quinn sued the city of Vallejo and its police department for false imprisonment, defamation, false arrest and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and reached a $2.5 million settlement in 2018.
During Muller's trial, prosecutors said he used a drone to spy on the couple before he broke into the home with the fake gun, tied them up and made them drink a sleep-inducing liquid. While they were blindfolded, Muller, who was dressed in a full-body wetsuit, played a recording that made it seem as if there was more than one kidnapper, they said.
Muller put Huskins in his trunk, drove her to his home in South Lake Tahoe and held her there for two days. Investigators said they found videos of Muller arranging cameras in a bedroom and then recording himself twice sexually assaulting his blindfolded victim. The Associated Press typically does not name victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly with their stories, as Huskins has frequently done.
During and after the kidnapping, Muller used an anonymous email account to send messages to a San Francisco reporter claiming that Huskins was abducted by a team of elite criminals practicing their tactics.
WHERE ARE THEY NOW
Huskins and Quinn married in September 2018 and have two young children. In 2021 they released their book, “Victim F: From Crime Victims to Suspects to Survivors.”
That same year the city of Vallejo and its police department both apologized to the couple.
“The Huskins Quinn case was not publicly handled with the type of sensitivity a case of this nature should have been handled with, and for that, the City extends an apology to Ms. Huskins and Mr. Quinn,"" city officials said in a statement sent to KGO-TV.
Police Chief Shawny Williams, who was not in that post at the time of the kidnapping, called the couple's ordeal “horrific and evil,” apologized for how they had been treated and promised to ensure that “survivors are given compassionate service with dignity and respect.”"
FXGHEZ4XYQ_WZQXTESH78MYRYS,South Korea calls on divided UN council 'to break the silence' on North Korea's tests and threats,EDITH M. LEDERER,"January 19, 2024 at 9:27 AM·3 min read",20240119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/south-korea-calls-divided-un-012702896.html,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) — South Korea called on the divided U.N. Security Council on Thursday “to break the silence” over North Korea’s escalating missile tests and threats.
“It’s a big question,” South Korea’s U.N. Ambassador Hwang Joonkook told reporters after an emergency closed meeting of the council on the North’s first ballistic missile test of 2024 on Sunday. South Korea is serving a two-year term on the council.
The Security Council imposed sanctions after North Korea’s first nuclear test explosion in 2006 and tightened them over the years in a total of 10 resolutions seeking — so far unsuccessfully — to cut funds and curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The last sanctions resolution was adopted by the council in 2017. China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution in May 2022 that would have imposed new sanctions over a spate of intercontinental ballistic missile launches. Since then, the two veto-wielding permanent council members have blocked any council action, including media statements.
North Korea’s escalating test-launches in violation of the existing U.N. sanctions — five ICBMs, more than 25 ballistic missiles and three satellite launches using ballistic missile technology in 2023 – coupled with new threats from the North’s leader Kim Jong Un have raised regional tensions to their highest point in years.
On Monday, Kim declared North Korea would abandon its commitment to a peaceful unification with South Korea and ordered a rewriting of its constitution to eliminate the idea of a shared statehood between the war-divided countries. He said South Koreans were “top-class stooges” of America who were obsessed with confrontation, and repeated a threat that the North would annihilate the South with its nukes if provoked.
Before Thursday’s council meeting, U.S. Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood told reporters Kim’s provocations “are of great concern.”
He said the 15 council members need to be reminded that North Korea is violating sanctions and its obligations to the council, “and we have to insist that they adhere to those obligations, and for all Security Council members to enforce those resolutions.”
By contrast, China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun, whose country is a close ally of North Korea, called on all parties involved in the Korean Peninsula to stay calm and refrain from actions that would further raise tensions.
In a message clearly aimed at the United States and South Korea, Zhang expressed hope that while attention is mainly on North Korea, “other countries are also responsible to avoid further escalation.”
France’s U.N. Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere told reporters that North Korea’s actions are “getting worse and worse,” with regular ballistic missile launches, continuing uranium enrichment, and advancement of its nuclear program.
“Everyone is focused on missile launches, but I think the biggest threat is their nuclear program which continues to grow again and again,” De Riviere said.
And he called it “a shame” that Russia is violating Security Council resolutions by “buying military stuff that they use in Ukraine"" from North Korea. ""It’s really bad,” he said.
South Korea’s Hwang said all 15 members of the Council are worried that North Korea’s rhetoric and actions are “getting more and more serious.”
But how to break the council’s silence and inaction?
“We will discuss and think about it, and how to move forward,” he said. “It’s a big question.”
As for Kim’s abandonment of peaceful reunification, Hwang called it “a big change” in their rhetoric, actions and policy. “The nuclear policy is highly, highly alarming,” he said."
FY08P6IC4Q_TWCF6XNRQ9LBNDY,"Pakistani retaliatory strikes in Iran kill at least 9, raising tensions along border",MUNIR AHMED and JON GAMBRELL,"Updated January 19, 2024 at 4:02 AM·5 min read",20240118,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/pakistan-air-force-carries-retaliatory-044100312.html,"ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan launched airstrikes against alleged militant hideouts inside Iran on Thursday, killing at least nine people as it retaliated for a similar attack days earlier by Iran and raising tensions with its neighbor as conflict across the region escalates.
The unprecedented attacks by both Pakistan and Iran on either side of their border appeared to target Baluch militant groups with similar separatist goals. The countries accuse each other of providing a haven to the groups in their respective territories.
The flare-up between Iran and Pakistan comes as the Middle East remains unsettled by Israel’s war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and on the heels of Iranian airstrikes late Monday in Iraq and Syria. Those airstrikes were in response to a suicide bombing in Iran by Islamic State militants in early January that killed over 90 people.
Iran and nuclear-armed Pakistan have long regarded each other with suspicion over militant attacks, but analysts say this week's tit-for-tat strikes were at least partially prompted by internal political pressures.
Iran is dealing with unrest against its theocracy and has faced pressure for action ever since the Islamic State suicide bombing. It is also seeking to flex military power at a time when militant groups it supports in the region — Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthi rebels in Yemen — are engaged in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Pakistan, meanwhile, could not leave Tuesday's airstrikes by Iran unchallenged, and it faces a crucial February general election in which its military is a powerful political force.
“The government and military have been under immense pressure,” said Abdullah Khan, an analyst at the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. “Iran celebrated (Tuesday’s) attack in its media and the Pakistani public perception of a strong army is not as it used to be, so it had to respond.”
The U.S., China, the United Nations and others urged the two countries to de-escalate.
Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry described its attack Thursday as “a series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes.”
The ministry said in a statement it had ""credible intelligence of impending large scale terrorist activities” and pledged “unflinching resolve to protect and defend its national security against all threats.”
Pakistan's military described using drones, rockets, and ""standoff weapons,” which are missiles fired from aircraft at a distance — likely meaning Pakistan's fighter jets didn't enter Iranian airspace.
Pakistan’s caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul-Haq-Kakar cut short his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to return home. Kakar is expected to meet Friday with the heads of Pakistan's armed forces, its intelligence chief and other senior government officials.
Among the dead in Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan province were three women, four children and two men near the town of Saravan along the Pakistani border, according to Ali Reza Marhamati, a deputy governor of the province. He said the dead were not Iranian citizens.
The Baluch Liberation Army, an ethnic separatist group that has operated in the region since 2000, said in a statement the strikes “martyred innocent Baluch people.”
Pakistan's military said the strikes also hit targets associated with the Baluchistan Liberation Front, though that group did not acknowledge the claim.
HalVash, an advocacy group for the Baluch people, shared images online that appeared to show the remains of the munitions used in the attack. It said a number of homes had been struck in Saravan. It shared videos showing a mud-walled building destroyed and smoke rising from the strike.
Iran later summoned Pakistan's charge d’affaires in the country. Pakistan already had withdrawn its ambassador over Tuesday's attack.
Pakistan named its operation “Marg Bar Sarmachar,” which translates in Farsi to ‘’death to the guerrillas.''
Pakistan’s Baluchistan province, as well as Iran’s neighboring Sistan and Baluchestan province, have faced a low-level insurgency by Baluch nationalists for more than two decades.
However, the groups targeted this week are different. Jaish al-Adl, the Sunni separatist group that Iran targeted Tuesday, grew out of another Islamic extremist group known as Jundallah that was once alleged to have ties to al-Qaida. Jaish al-Adl has long been suspected of operating out of Pakistan and launching attacks on Iranian security forces.
The Baluch Liberation Army, which has no religious component and has launched attacks against Pakistani security forces and Chinese interests, is suspected of hiding out in Iran. The Baluchistan Liberation Front is similarly nationalistic.
The risk of escalation remained Thursday as Iran’s military begins a planned annual air defense drill from its port of Chabahar near Pakistan all across the south of the country to Iraq.
Iran and Pakistan share a 900-kilometer (560-mile), largely lawless border in which smugglers and militants freely cross. The route is also key to global opium shipments coming out of Afghanistan. The Taliban separately urged restraint amid the tensions.
For both Iran and Pakistan, the cross-border attacks renew questions about their own military preparedness, particularly their radar and air defense systems.
For Pakistan, such systems are crucial as tensions are always at a low boil with India, its nuclear-armed rival. Iran relies on those systems against potential strikes by its main enemy, the U.S.
There are also complex geopolitical considerations at play. Pakistan's military relies on U.S., Chinese and French fighter jets for its air force — meaning some of those foreign weapons were used in Thursday's attack.
Beijing, which urged restraint, has a major development project in Gwadar port in Pakistan's Baluchistan province.
The U.S. also sought to ease tensions. “There's no need for escalation,” said Matthew Miller, a U.S. State Department spokesman.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres likewise urged both countries “to exercise maximum restraint to avoid a further escalation of tensions.”

G05IPUP2GW_MRRDAA5UPMQR826,Ukraine's ally Poland looking into how to make more ammunition - foreign minister,Antoni Slodkowski,"January 17, 2024 at 9:38 AM·3 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraines-ally-poland-looking-more-153841543.html,"By Antoni Slodkowski
DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Poland's new government is looking into how it can make more ammunition and military equipment as it works on a new aid package for Ukraine, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said in Davos on Wednesday.
Warsaw has been a close ally of Kyiv during Russia's war in Ukraine, but relations were dealt a blow last year by a dispute over grain imports and a blockade of some border crossings by Polish truckers demanding that the European Union reinstate a permit system for Ukrainian hauliers.
Sikorski signalled his intention to put ties back on a stronger footing by visiting Ukraine last month, shortly after his appointment to the new Western-looking government, and the new government has announced a new aid package for Kyiv.
""We are looking at all issues to do with Ukraine with fresh eyes,"" Sikorski told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos.
""We're examining what options we have of making more ammunition and equipment and also what we still have in our stores.""
Though Warsaw has provided Kyiv with military and financial aid since Russia's invasion, the previous government under the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party said last year it was carrying out only previously agreed arms deliveries to Ukraine.
Sikorski's remarks indicated Warsaw is looking into ways to produce more ammunition and military hardware to be able to send more military aid to Kyiv.
""What we think and communicate to our allies is that the cost of deterring Mr Putin after he'd conquered Ukraine would be much bigger than the cost of supplying Ukraine to effectively defend itself against his act of aggression,"" he said.
DEAL WITH TRUCKERS
Sikorski welcomed a deal reached this week under which Polish truckers agreed to suspend their protests calling for the EU to reinstate a system which it waived after Russia's invasion but which Polish hauliers said created unfair competition.
Sikorski acknowledged that Ukraine and Poland, which is a member of both the EU and NATO, must keep working on resolving challenges.
""Poland shouldn't be the country that bears the brunt of most of the cost of solidarity with Ukraine on behalf of all of the European Union...the cost is inevitable, we accept it, but it should be born more fairly,"" he said.
He endorsed a U.S. plan to confiscate up to $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to help rebuild Ukraine, saying: ""It's the aggressor who should pay for the damage to Ukraine.""
Sikorski said Poland was ""back from a faraway trip into populism"" after eight years of PiS in power.
""I hope we inspire democrats around the world that you can win against populist politics. We now need to bring back rule of law, respect for the constitution, respect for the rights of citizens,"" he said.
PiS were accused of democratic backsliding during their time in office, but the party says its policies sought to remove the residue of communist rule, protect Poland's sovereignty and raise living standards.

Earlier on Jan. 12, self-proclaimed authorities in the Russian-backed region released a statement accusing Moldova of training more than 60 people, including Ukrainian soldiers, to ""organize terrorist actions."" The statement was then repeated by the Russian state-run news outlet TASS.
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported on Jan. 9 that Russian media was continuing to embolden pro-Russian forces in Moldova, possibly in an attempt to sow political instability and division.
Transnistria is a breakaway region internationally recognized as part of Moldova. Russian troops have occupied Transnistria since the early 1990s when Russia invaded the region under the pretext of protecting ethnic Russians.
Moldova's Defense Ministry characterized the accusation as ""provocative"" and ""propaganda"" and said that the training program was to help provide Ukrainian soldiers with expertise on demining.
The ministry recommended that Moldovans receive ""information from official public sources, disseminated by constitutional authorities.""

G70BYFUB0R_D8SMC0LZ4EKEQZA,South Africa accuses Israel of genocide and urges top UN court to halt Gaza war,"Christian Edwards, CNN","January 12, 2024 at 11:12 AM·8 min read",20240111,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/south-africa-accuses-israel-genocide-161430808.html,"South Africa accused Israel of genocide in an unprecedented case at the United Nations’ top court, saying the country’s leadership was “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza” and calling for the court to order a halt to Israel’s military campaign in the enclave.
On the first of two days of hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), South Africa on Thursday argued that Israel’s air and ground assaults on Gaza were intended to “bring about the destruction” of its Palestinian population, and that comments made by Israeli leaders signalled their “genocidal intent.”
Israel declared war on Hamas after the militant group’s murderous rampage on October 7, when more than 1,200 people were killed and 240 hostages were taken back to Gaza. South Africa condemned Hamas’ attacks but said “nothing” could justify Israel’s response, which has killed more than 23,000 people in Gaza.
“The point is not simply that Israel is acting disproportionately. The point is that the prohibition on genocide is an absolute,” said Vaughan Lowe, one of the lawyers representing South Africa. “Nothing can ever justify genocide.”
Israel dismissed the case as “absurd blood libel,” and government spokesperson Eylon Levy said it is “tragic that the rainbow nation that prides itself on fighting racism will be fighting pro-bono for the anti-Jewish racists.”
Israel is scheduled to deliver its response in court on Friday. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the country would make the case that the war was one of self-defense, and would show that Israel is doing its “utmost” under “extremely complicated circumstances” to avert civilian casualties.
The ICJ, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, was set up in June 1945 and hears cases brought by states accusing others of violating their UN treaty obligations. South Africa and Israel are signatories to the 1948 Genocide Convention, meaning they are obliged not to commit genocide and to prevent and punish it.
Experts say it is the first time that the Jewish state is being tried under the Genocide Convention, which was drawn up after World War II in light of the atrocities committed against the Jewish people during the Holocaust.
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them, and other countries who are party to the court have ignored its rulings in the past.
In an 84-page filing to the ICJ, South Africa argued that Israel is committing genocide by killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing serious mental and bodily harm, forced evacuation, widespread hunger, and by creating conditions “calculated to bring about their physical destruction.” It also accused Israel of failing to stem incitement to genocide in the public pronouncements of its officials.
During three hours of oral argument, lawyers representing South Africa asked the ICJ to order a suspension of Israel’s campaign in Gaza to protect the rights of Palestinians in Gaza “from imminent and irreparable loss.”
Such “provisional measures,” as they are known, function as a kind of restraining order to stop a dispute from escalating while the court considers the full merits of the case, which could take years. For provisional measures the court need only decide if prima facie, or “at first glance,” the acts complained of could fall foul of the genocide convention.
“It is not necessary for the court to come to a final view on the question of whether Israel’s conduct constitutes genocide. It is necessary to establish only whether at least some of the acts alleged are capable of falling within the provisions of the convention,” argued Adila Hassim, one of the lawyers representing South Africa.
In its opening remarks, South Africa said it “places Israel’s genocidal acts and omissions within the broader context of Israel’s 25-year apartheid, 56-year occupation, and 16-year siege imposed on the Gaza Strip.”
South Africa operated under a system of apartheid from 1948 until the early 1990s, and its governing African National Congress has long championed the Palestinian cause.
Ahead of the hearing South Africa was accused by Israel and others of hypocrisy for not also bringing a charge of genocide against Hamas, whose founding charter mandates the killing of Jews and the destruction of Israel.
South Africa explained during the hearing that “Hamas is not a state and cannot be a party to the genocide convention,” and said the group would be accountable to “other bodies” such as the International Criminal Court, which tries individuals – rather than states – for crimes including war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, a grouping of 57 Muslim countries, as well as Jordan, Turkey and Malaysia have so far backed South Africa’s case, while Israel’s allies have fiercely opposed it.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the case as “meritless,” and said it was “particularly galling given that those who are attacking Israel – Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, as well as their supporter of Iran – continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews.”
South Africa presented widely reported evidence that it said showed a “systematic pattern of conduct” by Israel “from which genocide can be inferred.” The UN defines genocide as an act “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.”
“South Africa believes that the publicly available evidence of the scale of the destruction resulting from the bombardment of Gaza, and the deliberate restriction of food, water, medicines and electricity available to the population of Gaza, demonstrates that the government of Israel… is intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza as a group, and is doing nothing to prevent or punish the actions of others who support that aim,” said Lowe.
Citing previous CNN reporting that nearly half of the air-to-ground munitions that Israel has used in Gaza in its war with Hamas have been unguided “dumb bombs,” Vaughan said “it’s no use Israel saying it does whatever it can to minimize the deaths of innocent” Palestinians.
“The use of 2,000-pound bunker-busting bombs and dumb bombs in residential areas, and the relentless bombardment of Gaza… tell another story.”
Israel has repeatedly stressed that it is targeting Hamas – which has long been known to station military operations inside civilian buildings – rather than civilians in Gaza.
South Africa argued that the evacuation order issued by Israel to residents of northern Gaza on October 13 – the first of its kind – was itself “genocidal,” since “it required immediate movement… while no humanitarian assistance was permitted.” Israel said at the time that, by notifying the civilian population of a planned military attack, it was complying with international law.
As well as detailing the actions of the Israeli military, South Africa also cited public pronouncements by Israeli officials it alleged were genocidal in nature.
“Israel’s political leaders, military commanders, and persons holding official positions, have systematically and in explicit terms declared their genocidal intent,” argued Tembeka Ngcukaitobi.
Ngcukaitobi cited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Israeli forces on October 28, ahead of the imminent launch of its ground offensive in Gaza.
“Remember what Amalek did to you,” Netanyahu said in his address, which Ngcukaitobi told the court “refers to a Biblical command by God to Saul for the retaliatory destruction of an entire group of people known as the Amalekites.”
There is precedent for the court to grant the kind of emergency orders South Africa is calling for.
In January 2020, the court granted The Gambia’s request for provisional measures to protect the Rohingya people remaining in Myanmar from genocide. The Court has granted similar measures to protect Ukrainians from ongoing Russian aggression, and Bosnians during the Balkan Wars in the 1990s.
Max du Plessis, another of South Africa’s lawyers, said if the court failed to do so it risked treating Palestinians “differently, as less worthy of protection than others.”
Countries are unable to appeal the rulings but the ICJ has no way of enforcing them. A 2022 report by Human Rights Watch found continued abuses against the Rohingya remaining in Myanmar, despite the provisional measures. Similarly, despite the court in March 2022 ordering Russia to immediately suspend its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow’s war rages on nearly two years later.
While an ICJ ruling against Israel may fail to constrain its military action, it could land a serious blow to Israel’s international reputation.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused South Africa of “functioning as the legal arm of Hamas” in furious comments on Thursday.
“Today we were witness to one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history, compounded by a series of false and baseless claims,” Lior Haiat, a spokesperson for the ministry, said on X.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also hit out at South Africa.
“Today, again, we saw an upside-down world, in which the State of Israel is accused of genocide at a time when it is fighting genocide,” he said during a televised speech Thursday.
“South Africa’s hypocrisy screams to the high heavens.”

G8PFZYKJPA_N2A895ZLEBIR2KF,Support grows for petition to revoke Hungary's voting rights at European Council,Nate Ostiller,"January 12, 2024 at 3:36 PM·1 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/support-grows-petition-revoke-hungarys-213641574.html,"Petri Sarvamaa, a senior member of the EU's parliament, is collecting signatures for a petition to revoke Hungary's voting rights at the European Council, Sarvamaa wrote on Jan. 12.
He initially launched the petition on Jan. 9, which seeks to revoke some of Hungary's membership rights, including voting, due to the country's ""erosion of the rule of law"" and obstructive behavior in the face of EU consensus building.
Hungary blocked 50 billion euros ($55 billion) in EU funding for Ukraine at a summit in December, which was supported by all other members.
Hungary has maintained a favorable stance toward Russia since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and has repeatedly obstructed sanctions against Russia or blocked other aid for Ukraine within the EU to leverage economic concessions.
Sarvamaa said that he had already collected 120 signatures from members of parliament across the political spectrum and from various countries.
The group then sent a letter to the president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, on Jan. 12.
""We believe that this action is necessary to protect the values of the European Union,"" the letter read.
Sarvamaa said that the next steps would be to measure the popularity of implementing the measure in the wider parliament, which may be possible as soon as next week.
A decision to revoke Hungary's voting rights would ultimately have to be made by a majority at the European Council.
No EU country has ever had its voting rights suspended before.

Budapest has passed legislation to strengthen judicial independence in Hungary, von der Leyen told the EU legislature. ""This is what we requested and this is what Hungary delivered,"" she said.
In December, the commission released around €10 billion ($10.9 billion) in frozen EU funds to Hungary despite ongoing allegations of abuse of power and corruption in the country.
Other funds worth almost €12 billion, and billions more in coronavirus aid, remain blocked. This is the case until ""Hungary fulfils all the necessary conditions,"" von der Leyen said.
A group of EU lawmakers from across the political spectrum believes that if the commission releases further funds to Hungary without the conditions being met, parliament would reserve the right to take further political and legal action.
This could include a vote of no confidence in the commission. If successful, it would require the commission including von der Leyen to resign.
A resolution on the measures is to be voted on in Strasbourg on Thursday and although it has little chance of success, anger is growing across the chamber.
Von der Leyen, a veteran German conservative politician, has been accused of allowing herself to be blackmailed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who previously announced he would block an EU aid package for Ukraine if money was not forthcoming."
GCLDV7PED3_QZMNNJNG1LMIMP2,Israeli hostage families mark anniversary with mock Hamas tunnel,Maighna Nanu,"January 14, 2024 at 1:47 AM·3 min read",20240113,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-hostage-families-mark-anniversary-174731749.html,"Israeli hostage families recreated a Hamas tunnel to mark 100 days since their relatives were first kidnapped by the terror group.
Families built the mock tunnel in Hostage Square, Tel Aviv, to raise awareness for their loved ones who are still being held captive more than three months after the October 7 attacks.
The cramped and dimly-lit tunnel, unveiled on Saturday, was built to imitate the conditions the hostages have had to endure inside the Hamas underground tunnel network.
Ella Ben Ami, 23, whose father Oded, 55, is still being held in Gaza, told Channel 12 she was “shaking” as she walked through the underground passage.
“For nearly 100 days [the hostages] haven’t been able to leave this,” said the 23-year-old, whose mother, Raz, was kidnapped separately but then freed in November.
She told NBC News it was “hard to keep the hope” for “so many days.”
Many of the remaining 132 Israeli hostages are elderly and have chronic illnesses that require daily medications. Their families have petitioned the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit the hostages to deliver medicine and inspect their conditions.
The Red Cross has said Hamas has denied it access.
Israeli officials are coming under increasing pressure to secure the release of the estimated 132 hostages still held in the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli prime minister’s office said on Friday that Israel had made an arrangement with Qatar that will allow the delivery of medicines to hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.
The medications would be given to the hostages “in the next few days”, the office said in a statement.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of hostages, said it would demand “visual proof” the medications had reached the hostages.
On Saturday, thousands of people gathered in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv at the start of the 24 period of events to mark 100 days since the attacks.
The rally in Hostage Square will feature a video message from Emmanuel Macron, the French President, and other world leaders. Similar events are scheduled in cities outside Israel, including London, New York and Paris.
The tireless campaign by families has gained widespread support and sympathy, ratcheting up pressure on the Israeli government to make concessions to win their release.
More than 100 hostages were released during a week-long truce at the beginning of December. Earlier this week, Israeli officials said they will not allow Palestinians to return to northern Gaza unless Hamas agrees to release more hostages.
The repatriation of Gazans to their homes could be used as a bargaining chip during negotiations for hostage release.
Dorit Gvili of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum told Channel 12 News: “I think we need public pressure, there’s no other way.
“We must keep them in mind. We must say constantly that these people are alive and need to be returned. We feel the claustrophobia here every minute.”
Rachel Goldberg-Polin, 54, spends her days trying to bring her son Hersh and the other hostages home.
The mother-of-three sticks a piece of masking tape on herself with the number of days her only son has been held hostage in Gaza every morning.
Ms Goldberg-Polin, who began the ritual on day 26, pleaded with those around the world to adopt the same routine hoping the show of solidarity would help her and the other families bear the pain and anguish of waiting yet another day for their loved ones to return.
She said her identity is “the number of days he’s been stolen.”
In a message to her son, 23, she said: “We need you to stay strong. And survive and stay alive. And we are coming.”

GFEOCV04BQ_858RWHIU5AWHFUJ,Russian dissident poet Rubinstein dead at 76,AFP,"January 15, 2024 at 3:46 AM·2 min read",20240114,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-dissident-poet-rubinstein-dead-194642481.html,"Russian poet Lev Rubinstein, a key figure of the Soviet underground literary scene who later protested against President Vladimir Putin, has died days after being hit by a car, his daughter said Sunday.
Rubinstein is considered as one of the founders of the Russian conceptualist movement, a literary ""avant-garde"" that mocked the official doctrine of socialist realism in the 1970s-1980s.
""My dad, Lev Rubinstein, died today,"" his daughter Maria wrote on a ""LiveJournal"" blog picked up by Russian media.
The 76-year-old was hit by a car in Moscow on January 8 and hospitalised in a serious condition.
The Moscow department of transport said ""the driver did not slow down"" as Rubinstein was crossing the street.
According to preliminary information, the driver who hit Rubinstein had been involved in 19 traffic violations in 12 months, the department said.
Human rights organisation Memorial didn't mince its words.
""Today's Russia leaves no room for free citizens and poets,"" it wrote in a long homage to the writer. ""It doesn't see them on pedestrian crossings.""
When Putin launched his full-scale assault on Ukraine in 2022, Rubinstein had signed with other renowned writers an open letter denouncing a ""criminal war"" and the ""lies"" from the Kremlin.
- 'Bitterly symbolic' -
Born in Moscow in 1947, Rubinstein went on to create his own genre, between poetry and theatre, by writing short sentences on perforated cards and reading the ""note-card poems"" on stage.
His daily work as a librarian and the bureaucracy of the Soviet era inspired his performances, which combined absurd comedy and improvisation.
In its tribute, Memorial said Rubinstein had a perception of ordinary life which was ""sharp, poetic, astute and ironic, he was himself a way of perceiving the world"".
After the USSR collapsed, Rubinstein shot to prominence and saw his work widely published by leading Russian publishing houses.
He was invited to international poetry festivals and his works were translated into many languages.
Rubinstein also worked as a journalist.
He was openly hostile to Putin's government and regularly protested against the Kremlin's intensifying repression and human rights violations.
He denounced the war in Chechnya, the 2014 annexation of Crimea and took part in opposition demonstrations, before taking aim at the invasion of Ukraine.
Rubinstein had not been arrested or prosecuted during the conflict in Ukraine, Memorial said, even as the Kremlin's repression reached new heights.
""But his tragic death in January 2024, just on the eve of the two-year anniversary of the catastrophe seems bitterly symbolic,"" Memorial continued.
""Our tense desperation and hope, the powerlessness and fear of the past days, the coma and muteness of Lev Rubinstein -- this is us today,"" it added.
Russian authorities have launched an investigation into the accident, the transport department said.

According to court documents, Tracy Mikulencak, 44, embezzled approximately $144,000 from her teller drawer and the vault while working at A+ Federal Credit Union.
A+ auditors also revealed that Mikulencak, who lives in Georgetown, made unauthorized withdrawals from customer accounts, including a deceased account holder, the announcement said.
Mikulencak embezzled a total of $325,708 from the credit union, according to the U.S. Attorney’s office.

A cabin panel broke off a new Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines in mid-flight, leading to the grounding of the model and inspections by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
The incident occurred after take-off from Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario, California, forcing pilots to turn back and land safely with all 171 passengers and six crew on board.
After grounding the three planes operated by Lion Air on Jan. 6 and later inspecting them, Indonesia's transport ministry said it had allowed them to fly again since Jan. 11.
Lion Air said in a statement the planes had different configurations from the Alaska Airline plane.
The transport ministry said the Lion Air planes had a ""mid cabin emergency exit door type II"" whereas the Alaska Airlines plane had a ""mid exit door plug.""

Speaking to the Kansas Legislature during her annual State of the Judiciary address, Luckert revealed more details about the attack than the court had released since shutting down online access in early October. Luckert confirmed what experts had suspected, that the judicial branch was hit by a ransomware attack.
Kansas did not pay a ransom to the attackers, she said.
Instead, Luckert explained, staff at the Office of Judicial Administration quickly disconnected the systems to prevent the malware from infecting district courts in addition to the state. That step caused the statewide outage for electronic access systems.
Additionally, Luckert said, the court system worked with experts to investigate and resolve the issue fully.
“The emergency responders’ investigation revealed ransomware on the encrypted systems, but we had working backups and the tools and expertise of experts, making recovery of our data feasible,” Luckert said.
In November, the judicial branch announced in a press release that hackers may have accessed sensitive information. Luckert said the courts were still working to determine what information was accessed and notify those affected.
Kansas restored access to the statewide online system earlier this year but is still working on updating the online records with three months worth of paper-only court proceedings.
Luckert said the court system has implemented a variety of new protections and policies to prevent a subsequent attack. Officials have passed information along to federal law enforcement for a criminal investigation into the breach."

The ministry issued the ban on communicating and cooperating with both countries a week after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 2022. This did not affect the performances of Russian artists or organizations that spoke out against the war.
The reversal is effective Jan. 22, according to the leaked documents. Šimkovičová told reporters that there are dozens of military conflicts in the world that artists and culture should not be paying for.
Šimkovičová had been dropped by a private Slovak TV channel after sharing anti-refugee content on social media. Since then, she has broadened her repertoire into homophobic, pro-Russian and anti-establishment messaging.
Hromadske reported that Šimkovičová worked for several TV channels that emphasize conspiracy theories.
In 2016, she was elected to parliament, but was expelled from her conservative party for voting for herself and for a fellow party MP and fined for breaching parliamentary conduct. She refused to resign and served as an independent MP.

Following reports of more attacks by the rebel group on ships in the Red Sea on Monday, the prime minister refused to speculate whether he would take further military action in response.
But he said the UK ""will not hesitate to protect our security, our people and our interests where required"".
Labour said it backed the ""targeted action"".
However, leader Sir Keir Starmer told the Commons military action must be ""underpinned by a clear strategy"".
He added that the strikes still carried risks and ""we must avoid escalation across the Middle East"".
The Houthis - a military and political group who control the north of Yemen and its capital Sanaa - have been attacking cargo ships in the Red Sea since November.
Last Thursday, the US and UK carried out air strikes on military Houthi targets in response.
Live updates
Who are the Houthis attacking Red Sea ships?
Yemen strikes show war in Gaza has already spread
Giving a Commons statement, Mr Sunak told MPs the government's ""initial assessment"" was that all 13 planned targets were destroyed, while there was no evidence of civilian casualties so far.
He said the ""proportionate"" action was taken ""in self-defence"" and was ""limited, not escalatory"".
His statement came shortly after American officials said the Houthis had hit a US-owned ship off the coast of Yemen with a missile.
Earlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations security agency also reported that missile fire had struck a ship near Yemen's southern port city of Aden.
Asked whether he would take more military action if necessary, Mr Sunak said: ""I won't speculate on future action.
""This was intended as limited, single action and we hope the Houthis will now step back and end their destabilising attacks.
""But of course... we will not hesitate to protect our security, our people and our interests where required.""
The Houthi attacks have led major shipping companies to divert vessels away from the Red Sea, instead taking a longer route around southern Africa.
Mr Sunak said this ""pushes up prices, and imperils the passage of goods, foods and medicines that the British people and others rely on"".
He added that there were also risks from not acting, which he said ""would weaken international security and the rule of law, further damage freedom of navigation and the global economy, and send a dangerous message that British vessels and British interests are fair game"".
The Houthis - who are allies of Iran - have said they are attacking ships affiliated with Israel in protest at the war in Gaza.
However, commercial vessels with no connection to the country also appear to have been targeted.
Mr Sunak said the UK-US strikes were ""completely unrelated"" to the Israel-Gaza conflict and were ""a direct response to the Houthis' attacks on international shipping"".
He added that the group were targeting ships from around the world and ""we shouldn't fall for their malign narrative"".
The Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru had argued the government should hold a vote on the strikes.
The government is not legally required to seek parliamentary approval before taking military action. However, a convention has been established in recent years under which the Commons is - in most circumstances - given the opportunity to debate the deployment of military forces in advance.
SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn called on the PM to reveal his long-term strategy if the Houthi attacks continued, adding: ""We cannot have an escalation which leads to further regional instability.""
Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said his party supported ""limited"" strikes against the Houthis but it was ""regrettable"" there was no vote on the action.
He urged Mr Sunak to ensure the strikes remained ""limited"", describing the region as ""a tinderbox"".
Defending the decision not to consult Parliament before the action, Mr Sunak said it was ""necessary to strike at speed... to protect the security of these operations"".
However, the prime minister added that he had addressed MPs on the issue ""at the earliest opportunity"".
The Houthis, who control most of the populated parts of Yemen, now have three options.
They can back down, having made their point, raised their regional profile and increased their popularity at home.
Their actions to date show no sign of them doing this.
They can continue to harass military and commercial shipping off their coasts, which they appear to be now doing.
Or - and this is the option the West should worry about - they could marshal their remaining missiles and drones and wait for the opportunity to launch a mass attack on a US or British warship, in the hopes of overwhelming its air defences. This is something the Houthi spokesman has already hinted at and it remains a real risk.
US intelligence assesses that the recent airstrikes on the Houthis' military facilities have destroyed or degraded around a quarter of their arsenal.
Further airstrikes will degrade that further so the Houthis will need to make some careful calculations as to how far they take this beyond their fiery rhetoric about retaliation.

Prosecutors said the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva was burgled in June 2019 by a gang of three who used tools to break through the front door.
Two 14th Century vases and a bowl were taken in the heist.
Stewart and Louis Ahearne admitted their involvement at a court in Geneva.
The pair, from south-east London, appeared before a panel of three judges at the Palais de Justice in Geneva on Monday facing charges of theft, trespass and damage to property.
They fought extradition from the UK, but it was approved by the Home Secretary in 2022.
Patrick Monney, the president of the court, rejected a last-minute application for the trial to be heard in private. He added that the court was aware of the facts of the case from reports by the Swiss Prosecutors Office and Geneva Police and explained the purpose of the hearing was to ""ask additional questions"".
The court heard that the two brothers travelled to Hong Kong shortly after the raid to sell one of the stolen items to an auction house for £80,000.
Father-of-one Louis Ahearne told the court he came to Geneva days before the raid to carry out reconnaissance.
The 34-year-old to confirmed he went to ""film the museum"" and ""took part in the burglary"".
He also admitted giving his passport to the auction house in Hong Kong.
""I was in debt,"" he told the court. ""I was paid to be a front man to clear a debt. In the [CCTV] video I am the third person [going into the museum] with no crowbar and no sledgehammer.""
Throughout the hearing, the brothers insisted they didn't want to name the third person involved.
Stewart Ahearne, 45, told the court he has five children and worked as a tradesman in England. He also admitted to using his name to hire the Renault Captur car, used in the heist, from Avis at Geneva Airport.
He told the court he ""took full responsibility"" for his actions, but denied being involved in any pre-planning of the heist in Geneva.
""I went into the museum. I stole some stuff. Any organisation, anything to do with the artwork I didn't know nothing,"" he said.
He added that he ""used as a pawn like in a game of chess"" during the heist: ""I was asked to come to Switzerland to do some driving. The story, the scenario changed with the third person. He is not someone you can say no to. He is not a very nice person. My role was I was used.
""I got a phone call telling me my brother was in debt and that I was needed to bring back some stuff. Alarm bells started ringing. My instinct as an older brother was to protect my brother.""
The court heard the three came to Geneva in February 2019. Louis Ahearne said this was for ""tourist"" purposes, but Stewart Ahearne said he ""put two and two together"" after the burglary.
""It was so the third person could do some scouting,"" he added.
He broke down when answering questions about his life in Champ-Dollon prison, saying he spends his time in a cell by himself for 23 hours a day.
The hearing continues."

They were responding to a call by the Israeli umbrella organization of trade unions, Histadrut, to mark 100 days since the start of the Gaza war.
At the beginning of the strike, thousands of participants in a rally organized by relatives and supporters of the hostages remained silent for 100 seconds as a sign of solidarity. The rally in Tel Aviv is set to last 24 hours until Sunday evening.
Histadrut leader Arnon Ben-David said at the rally: ""[Israel is] in the middle of a terrible dream, and I want to wake up from this terrible dream and create a new Israel.""
""We are striking today to work together to rebuild the land of Israel.
""We will rebuild everything they have tried to destroy.""
Israel has been fighting the Palestinian Islamist organization Hamas in Gaza since Hamas militants and other extremist groups launched a bloody raid on Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 and kidnapping around 240.
Israel estimates that 136 hostages are still being held in Gaza and that two dozen of them have died.
Israel responded to the massacre with massive airstrikes and launched a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip.
According to the Hamas-controlled health authorities in Gaza, about 24,000 have been killed and some 60,600 others injured in the sealed-off coastal strip since the beginning of the Israeli campaign. These figures cannot currently be independently verified."

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Somalia rejected any discussions with Ethiopia about Addis Ababa's agreement to lease a port in the breakaway region of Somaliland, as regional heads of state gathered on Thursday to try to defuse a growing diplomatic crisis.
Under a memorandum of understanding signed on Jan. 1, Ethiopia would consider recognising Somaliland's independence in return for gaining access to the Red Sea, partly through the port lease.
Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991 but has not won recognition from any country and the port lease deal, which would be a boon to landlocked Ethiopia, has enraged Somalia.
An escalating war of words, including threats by Somalia to go to war to prevent the deal from going through, led the African Union to call on Wednesday for restraint and ""meaningful dialogue"".
""There is no space for mediation unless Ethiopia retracts its illegal MOU and reaffirms the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia,"" Somalia's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement on Thursday.
Under the deal, which still has to be finalised, Ethiopia would lease 20 km (12 miles) of coastland around the port of Berbera, on the Gulf of Aden, for 50 years for military and commercial purposes.
Ethiopia's current main port for maritime exports is in the neighbouring country of Djibouti.
Heads of state from a regional group, the eight-member Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), met in Entebbe, Uganda, on Thursday to seek a peaceful solution.
Those in attendance included the presidents of Djibouti, Kenya, Somalia and South Sudan as well as the leader of the Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.
AL-SHABAAB FEARS
The U.S. special envoy for the Horn of Africa, Mike Hammer, who attended as an observer along with the European Union, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, said the MOU threatened to further undermine regional security and had been weaponized by Al Shabaab militants.
""We have already seen troubling indications that al-Shabaab is using the MOU to generate new recruits,"" he told delegates in Uganda, according to a copy of the remarks seen by Reuters.
Ethiopia did not send a delegation, saying it was informed too late about the summit.
At a news conference on Thursday, Ambassador Meles Alem, Ethiopia's foreign affairs spokesperson, rejected a statement by the Arab League on Wednesday that called the MOU ""a clear violation of international law"".
""The statement is a disservice to the organisation itself as well as member countries. More than anything it shows a disregard to Africans,"" Meles said.

Source: Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces, reported by European Pravda
Details: Polish and allied aircraft were deployed in response to the ""increased activity of the Russian Federation's long-range aviation, associated with the intention to strike at the territory of Ukraine"".
Due to the ""necessary procedures to ensure the safety of Polish airspace"", residents of the country, particularly in the southeast, were warned of an increase in noise levels.
After some time, due to the decrease in the threat level, Polish and allied aircraft returned to standard operations.
""The Polish army is constantly monitoring the situation in Ukraine and remains in constant readiness to ensure the safety of Polish airspace,"" they said.
Background:
On 29 December, the Polish General Staff announced that a Russian missile had violated the country's airspace. The Polish military found that the missile flew 40 kilometres into Poland and returned to Ukraine three minutes later.
On the night of 12-13 January, the Russians launched a missile attack on Ukraine, using 40 targets – cruise, aeroballistic, ballistic, air-launched, anti-aircraft guided missiles and attack drones.
Eight targets were destroyed by Ukrainian air defence units, while most weapons failed to reach their targets due to the operation of Ukrainian electronic warfare systems.

HXRTB2J1XU_HJQ0PSOLSH17ISX,Plaza Live work reaches milestone as historic spire spins once more,"Matthew J. Palm, Orlando Sentinel","January 11, 2024 at 8:01 AM·3 min read",20240111,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/plaza-live-nears-end-historic-000100094.html,"Sixty years after it brought a touch of the Space Age to Orlando, the distinctive spire on top of The Plaza Live is spinning once more.
Applause and champagne greeted the return of the iconic feature in Orlando’s Milk District, east of downtown, Wednesday evening as city Mayor Buddy Dyer led a countdown to set the rejuvenated spire in motion.
“The sign is an icon and celebrates the history of Orlando,” said David Schillhammer, vice president of the Orlando Philharmonic Plaza Foundation, which is leading the Plaza Live renovations.
In his remarks, Dyer agreed.
“Anybody who grew up in Central Florida probably saw some of their first movies at the ‘rocking-chair theater,'” said the mayor, using an old Plaza Theatre nickname, as he recalled watching “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” there.
Named a historic landmark by the city of Orlando in 1997, the spire had fallen on hard times as its mechanics failed. In August, it was removed from the top of the building for a complete overhaul. A $500,000 historic-preservation grant from the Florida Department of State’s Division of Historical Resources helped fund the work, along with $100,000 from the Kay Hardesty Logan Foundation, said Mary Palmer, a past Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra board chair who recalled taking her children to performances in the theater decades ago.
The spire’s return to its former glory, with new lighting and other mechanics, is part of the overall multimillion renovation project by the Orlando Philharmonic Plaza Foundation. That project, which also calls for a new outdoor plaza with bar service, is still underway though the building is open once again on a limited basis.
Concerts resumed Jan. 9, and Judy Collins is scheduled to give a performance in the building’s main theater on Friday. New restrooms are open, and events will feature temporary bars while work continues at least for several months, Schillhammer said.
The Philharmonic’s Resonate festival next month will take place at the Winter Park Events Center.
The Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra bought the Plaza in 2013 and previously spent about $4.5 million on improvements such as building the organization’s offices and creating the Mary Palmer Room, a small theater named for the longtime orchestra supporter.
The theater already had a storied history: It opened in 1963 as the city’s first two-screen cinema and was known as “the rocking-chair theater” because of its unique seating for moviegoers. Wednesday night, Dyer recalled that mischievous moviegoers could kick the seat in front of them and knock fellow patrons right out of their rocker.
The modern-looking building was designed by architect Robert E. Collins of Miami, who also designed the “underwater” theater at Weeki Wachee and the 1938 Cameo Theater in Miami.
The Plaza Live later became a home to family-oriented stage shows and then a touring house for concerts and other performances.
The latest remake, which saw the main performance space gutted and rebuilt with expanded capacity for patrons, is funded in part with $10 million from Orange County through the tourist-development tax collected on hotel and other overnight stays. As part of that funding deal, the city of Orlando acquired the building and leases it back to the orchestra for $1 annual rent.
Other donors to the project include AdventHealth, AEG Presents and RBmarks Construction, Schillhammer said.
The Philharmonic is conducting its own fundraising to help with renovation costs. Wednesday, Orlando Philharmonic philanthropy director Jennifer Coolidge said about $1.5 million has been raised, and the nonprofit is seeking a minimum of another $500,000. Money raised over that amount will pay for other exterior improvements, such as landscaping.
On Wednesday, supporters celebrated how far the renovations have progressed as the spire slowly rotated, beaming “Plaza Theatre” in bright red capital letters.
“It took a lot of work to get to this point,” Schillhammer said. “We’re open for business.”

The satellite was launched on an H2A liquid-fuel rocket from the Tanegashima Space Centre in southwestern Japan.
The satellite will capture coloured photographs of the Earth’s surface and a radar satellite will capture photographs at night, in overcast and severe weather.
Japan says the satellite could also help improve responses to a range of major natural disasters. It comes just days after a magnitude 7.6 earthquake with its epicentre in Ishikawa killed more than 200 people.
Officials at the space centre initiated the launch at 1.45pm local time and confirmed later that its payload had reached orbit, reported The Asahi Shimbun.
With Friday’s successful mission, Japan now has five operational reconnaissance satellites in space. One of the satellites can transmit high-definition data to Earth.
The H2A launch was closely watched, at a time when Japan is developing a new flagship rocket – the H3 – as its long-term successor.
The new rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, failed its first test flight in March last year. Another attempt is scheduled to take place next month.
Mitsubishi Heavy’s rockets, including Friday’s, have two solid-fuel sub-rockets and are known for their remarkable 98 per cent success rate. It has recorded 41 consecutive successes after a failure seen in 2003.
Japan is aiming to develop a network of as many as 10 operational spy satellites in orbit, in part to watch for early warning signs of possible missile launches from North Korea. Pyongyang’s missile tests last year at times sent Japanese citizens scrambling for bomb shelters, and there is no indication that Kim Jong-un is planning to abandon the weapons programme in the near future.
Prime minister Fumio Kishida’s government, under its national security strategy adopted in 2022, is pushing to deploy long-range US-made Tomahawk and other cruise missiles as early as next year to build up more strike capability, breaking from the country’s exclusively self-defence-only postwar principle, citing rapid weapons advancement in China and North Korea."

The Service Employees International Union (SEIU) represents nearly 20,000 health care workers in Nevada. It’s the largest health care and public service union in the state.
Sunrise employees “want a seat at the table to advocate for good jobs, safe staffing and quality care for their community,” according to a union statement released to the media. The margin of victory was 78% and the 275 professionals will now be represented by SEIU Local 1107, the statement said.
SEIU members negotiated strong union contracts last year that included major raises to support, recruit and retain staff.
Voting took place at Sunrise on Thursday and Friday. The hospital released a statement after votes were counted.
“While we acknowledge the right of our colleagues to unionize, we are disappointed by the outcome of this labor union member vote,” said Todd P. Sklamberg, CEO at Sunrise.
“No one cares for our colleagues more than we do. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to them with significant wage increases, industry leading safety and protection protocols, aggressive recruitment and retention initiatives to stabilize staffing, training and educational benefits and much more,” Sklamberg said.
“We prefer a direct working relationship with our colleagues to address their concerns. We respect the federal rights of our colleagues to be a member of a labor union,” he said.
Union officials also released a statement.
“Sunrise professionals are at the forefront of a statewide and national movement of working people who are rising up and taking action,” said Sam Shaw, Executive Director, and Michelle Maese, President, of SEIU Local 1107 in a joint statement. “We’re incredibly proud to welcome them to our union family.

""The United States strongly condemns Iran’s attacks in Erbil today and offers condolences to the families of those who were killed. We oppose Iran’s reckless missile strikes, which undermine Iraq’s stability,"" Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesperson said in a statement.
Miller added that the U.S. supports the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government’s efforts to meet the aspirations of the Iraqi people.
This all comes just days after the State Department claimed the Biden administration 'will ensure one way or another that Iran will never obtain a nuclear weapon.'
IRAN ANNOUNCES STRIKES IN NORTHERN IRAQ, SYRIA
""It was only a matter of when, not if, Iran would act on it's stated intent to deliver a ""hard response"" to the terror attack it suffered earlier this year,"" Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) told Fox News Digital. ""Iran's improving ballistic missile capabilities means that these weapons of war will be used more often, and for purposes of conflict adjudication. This raises the risk of escalation mismanagement with any actor involving Iran.""
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
At least five ballistic missiles struck Erbil in the late hours of Monday. The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for the strikes, claiming to have hit ""spy headquarters"" of anti-Iran groups in the Kurdistan Region.
The strikes killed at least four civilians and injured 17 others.
BIDEN’S IRAN DE-ESCALATION STRATEGY BACKFIRIN AS REGIME CLOSE TO PRODUCING ATOMIC BOMB
Taleblu added that Iran is just adding more fuel to the regional fire by launching missiles at Iraq and Syria at a time when its proxies are firing at Israel, U.S. forces and international shipping.
""Iran's ballistic missile program is the largest in the Middle East, with Tehran making improvements to precision, range, survivability, and maneuverability for this force. This strike raises more questions than answers, particularly, why Syria and Iraq, both to Iran's west, were targeted when the culprit behind the terror attack was ISIS-K, which operates from Iran’s east,"" Taleblu continued.
Taleblu said while Iran has not reported exactly which missile it has launched, solid-propellant short-range or close-range ballistic missiles with precision strike capabilities have been used in every single missile operation since 2017.
""Iran has engaged in eight ballistic missile operations from its own territory since 2017, with five of them occurring under the Biden administration’s watch,"" Tabeblu said.
In total, Iran has launched at least 14 ballistic missile operations since the end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988 and all have been launched at targets in Iraq or Syria, according to Tabeblu.

The remaining hostages could receive the medicine in the next few days, Reuters reported.
More than 240 hostages were captured by Hamas when it launched a surprise attack that killed 1,200 people on Oct. 7. In the more than three months since, Israel has launched a counteroffensive that has killed more than 23,000 Palestinians in Gaza, and has vowed to continue fighting until all of the hostages are returned.
Qatar and the United States helped Israel broker a deal in November for a temporary cease-fire in exchange for returning some hostages. Hamas freed almost half of the hostages in return for the release of many Palestinian detainees that were held in Israel and shipments of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.
Released hostages have described torture, sexual assault and the lack of necessary medicine for many people, as a large amount of hostages taken were elderly or have chronic illnesses, Reuters reported.
Families of the hostages have asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to deliver medicine and inspect the condition of the hostages, which the organization said Hamas blocked access, per the news wire.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum also said it would demand visual proof that the medications reached the hostages. In a statement, the group warned that all of the hostages face mortal danger and need life-saving medicine and many require extensive medical treatment.
The United States State Department announced this week that after a trip to the Middle East, Secretary Antony Blinken was able to agree with many Arab countries to focus on short-term and long-term solutions for the reconstruction and future governance in Gaza — if Israel is able to agree as well.
The countries are continuing diplomatic relations as tensions in the region have spiked surrounding the war.
U.S. officials have urged Israel to dial back its attacks and operate in a more precise manner.

Quote: ""President Zelenskyy said that there are people who are in the battlefield and there are also people who pay taxes in Ukraine so that the state could fund the soldiers. But there are also people who are in other countries, for instance, in Estonia.""
She remarked that if these people follow the rules, then they have every right to remain in Europe.
""So we definitely will not do anything to extradite these people. This is Ukraine’s duty to turn to the people who remain here and convince them to return in order to help their Motherland,"" Kallas stated.
Background:
Earlier, Estonian Internal Affairs Minister Lauri Läänemets stated that if Ukraine turned to Estonia with a request to help mobilise Ukrainian citizens in Estonia, ""it would be hard for us to say no"".
The Estonian Minister made this statement after Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umierov mentioned the plans to mobilise Ukrainians abroad in an interview.
Later, the Defence Ministry specified that Umierov urged all Ukrainians to join the Armed Forces of Ukraine but there is so far no mechanism of punishment or legal pressure on men outside the borders of Ukraine.

IIIR84TDGX_QM5M0SFZO70IPSD,"What to know about Yemeni rebel group, the Houthis",Lauren Irwin,"January 12, 2024 at 10:15 AM·3 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/know-yemeni-rebel-group-houthis-021549492.html,"President Biden announced Thursday that the U.S. and U.K. conducted retaliatory strikes against the Houthi rebels in Yemen as tensions rise in the Red Sea.
The Iran-backed rebel group has stepped up its strikes on ships, action that is seen as revenge against Israel for its war against Hamas in Gaza.
The strikes on ships have caused some of the largest shipping companies to suspend travel through the world’s most vital trade route.
The Houthis are believed to be armed by Iran, and there are fears their attack could escalate the conflict in Gaza into a wider regional war.
The Houthis are a Zaydi Shiite movement that has fought Yemen’s Sunni government since 2004. The Houthi movement began in the 1990s as a reaction to rising Saudi financial and religious influence.
The group took over Yemen’s capital in 2014 and seized control over much of the north by 2016.
Officials have repeatedly alleged that Iran and Hezbollah have provided the Houthis with weapons and financial support, but Iranian and Hezbollah officials have denied the claims, according to the Wilson Center.
In 2017, the group killed former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who left office in 2012 and once had a relationship with the Houthis.
The war in Yemen became the world’s worst humanitarian crisis in 2018. More than 22 million people, three-quarters of the country’s population, were in desperate need of aid, the United Nations declared.
The Houthis widened the scope of the conflict in early 2022, and now, the group has involved itself in the conflict in Gaza.
Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel in a surprise attack Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people. Israel, which has vowed retaliation for the attack and the group’s taking of more than 200 hostages, has killed more than 22,000 people in what many have declared a humanitarian crisis.
The Houthis have called for the death of Israel, the Wilson Center reported. The group has said it is striking in the Red Sea to prevent Israeli ships from reaching ports of Palestine until the conflict stops.
The Houthis have attacked commercial ships at least 26 times since Nov. 19 in a campaign they say targets Israel-based boats or boats heading to Israel. The Houthis say they are attempting to protect Palestinians as Israel continues its destructive and deadly war in Gaza, The Hill previously reported.
Earlier this year, shipping giant Maersk paused its operations through the Red Sea after the Houthis attacked one of its ships. The U.S., which was patrolling the Red Sea to protect commercial boats, responded to a distress call and sunk three Houthi boats.
Maersk joined several of the world’s largest shipping and oil companies, including BP in stopping travel through the corridor, which is expected to impact the global economy and shipping costs, as boats now must reroute around Africa.
President Biden announced Thursday that the U.S. joined with the U.K. to strike the Houthis as a “direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks,” as U.S. personnel, civilians and trade have been threatened in the region.
“I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary,” Biden said.
According to The Associated Press, the U.S. and U.K. bombed more than a dozen sites in Yemen used by the Houthis.
It’s the first time the U.S. has carried out a direct military offensive against the Houthis since the group began targeting ships in the corridor.
The strike is likely to provoke both the Houthis and Iran, The Hill reported, and threatens to spiral into a wider war.

When officers arrived, they found a victim who had been forced to give up her car keys due to a threat.
According to APD, the suspect had been waiting at the scene of the robbery when the victim pulled up to her workplace. Once the victim got out of her car, the suspect approached and pressed a bag against the victim and demanded her car keys. Fearing that the suspect had a firearm inside the bag, the victim surrendered her keys.
The suspect then left the scene with the stolen car.

Details: Gulyás commented on the issue of Ukrainian-Hungarian relations as he was talking about Budapest’s position with regard to further blocking of a four-year €50 billion aid package for Ukraine.
Quote: ""The possibility of an improvement in relations between Hungary and Ukraine cannot be ruled out, and Hungary must pursue good relations with a neighbouring country. We must not lose hope that Hungarian-Ukrainian relations may change.""
Gulyás cited Serbia as an example, as well as the Slovak Parliament, which had previously condemned Orbán’s statement, but ""now the two countries are on good terms"".
In this context, Gulyás also mentioned preparations for a meeting between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Viktor Orbán in which they could discuss ""a return to previous conditions for education in Hungarian in Ukraine"" and humanitarian aid for Zakarpattia Oblast, ""but there are many other topics on which they could share their thoughts"".
Background: Hungary and Ukraine had had almost no high-level contact since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but their interaction on various levels has stepped up over the last few weeks.
Earlier, Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó announced that he would be meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in Uzhhorod. Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry has confirmed that Andrii Yermak, Head of the Ukrainian President’s Office, will also attend the meeting on 29 January.

The Kremlin previously banned 11 Moldovan officials from entering Russia after Moldova restricted access to certain Russian media sites it said spread disinformation ahead of local elections.
The new ban includes high-ranking members of the president's office, such as Supreme Security Councilmember Adrian Balutel, Secretary General Artur Mija, and Presidential Adviser for Foreign Affaris and Strategic Communications Olga Rosca.
Journalists from Moldovan media outlets, including the deputy chief editor of NewsMaker Stela Untila, were also banned from Russia.
The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned Moldovan Ambassador Lilian Darie on Jan. 10 and said that the ""unfriendly actions of official Chisinau"" had led it to ban some Moldovan representatives.
Moldova has intensified its efforts to remove itself from Moscow's sphere of influence in the last year, increasing its military budget and participating in joint excercises with NATO. The European Council agreed to initiate EU accession talks with Moldova on Dec. 14, the same day it agreed to begin accession talks with Ukraine.
Moldova's Prime Minister Dorin Recean said on Dec. 18 that Moscow's attempts to simplify the process of obtaining Russian citizenship for Moldovans were ""an attempt to recruit 'cannon fodder' for this brutal and incomprehensible war.""
Analysts from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on Jan. 9 that Russian state-run media outlets continue to sow political instability in Moldova, appealing to pro-Russian separatists in the breakaway region of Transnistria.
Russia's self-serving narratives frame the Moldovan government as a threat to Russian-language speakers, justifying continued aggression.

It did not disclose further information about the planned meeting and a Hungarian government spokesperson did not immediately respond to emailed questions for comment.
Relations between NATO-member Hungary and Ukraine have been strained by issues such as the rights of ethnic Hungarians in western Ukraine and Hungary's opposition to providing European Union aid to Ukraine from the EU budget amid Russia's invasion.
Last month all EU states except Hungary agreed to start accession talks with Ukraine. The bloc's leaders bypassed nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban's opposition by getting him to leave the room when the decision was made.
""It has been confirmed that the Hungarian and Ukrainian foreign ministers are slated to meet in Uzhorod (Ungvár) on Jan 29,"" Orban's international communications office said on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had a ""frank"" conversation with Orban on the sidelines of the inauguration of Argentine President Javier Milei last month.
Zelenskiy's chief of staff said late last month that Ukraine and Hungary were preparing a meeting between Zelenskiy and Orban in the near future.
On Thursday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said a high-level summit between the two leaders would only make sense if it could produce ""significant results"", according to a statement issued by his ministry.

China, which claims almost the entire South China Sea, has taken increasingly aggressive actions in the area in recent years.
Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have claims to the 3.5 million square kilometre sea area, which is believed to be rich in natural resources.
In December, Manila accused the Chinese coastguard of firing water cannons at two Philippine supply ships and ramming them. Beijing rejected the accusations.
The area of widely scattered reefs and islands to the west of the Philippines and far south of China has been the subject of dispute between the two countries for decades.
China has ignored a 2016 ruling by an international arbitration court that it has no legal or historical basis for its expansive claims.
In addition to geopolitical issues, the dispute is about fishing grounds, raw materials such as oil and natural gas, and the safety of sea routes.
During her diplomatic trip to Manila, Baerbock also plans to enhance cooperation on skilled labour between both countries. She is expected to visit a technical training centre where mechatronics engineers are trained.
Germany already has a bilateral deal in which some 2,500 nurses have been recruited from the Philippines since 2013."

""The government hopes that the aid will help recovery work of the damaged areas and local residents to return to daily lives at an early time,"" it said.
The magnitude 7.6 quake on New Year's Day killed more than 200 people in Japan's western region and drove more than 26,000 people to evacuate from their homes.
Japan's foreign ministry said: ""We truly welcome and appreciate this decision which demonstrates the friendly and cooperative relationship between Japan and South Korea.""
Japan said last week it was in talks with the United States about emergency assistance and declined offers for help from other countries including China for the time being.
It has since said it would accept relief as long as it does not cause logistics complications.
South Korea's conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol has dramatically improved ties and security cooperation with Japan despite lingering tension over Japan's wartime history and territorial claims over islets between the two countries.

The fighting erupted on Oct. 7 when Hamas carried out a deadly attack in southern Israel. Since then, Israel has relentlessly pounded the Gaza Strip with airstrikes and a ground offensive that have wrought unprecedented destruction, flattening entire neighborhoods. The offensive has displaced the vast majority of Palestinians in Gaza, shuttered operations in more than half of Gaza's hospitals and caused widespread hunger, U.N. monitors say.
The Israeli military says it has now scaled back operations in the hard-hit north. But in the south, where it says Hamas' leaders are hiding, it presses forward at full strength. Meanwhile, Lebanon's Hezbollah militia and Israel have engaged in cross-border skirmishes nearly every day since the war began.

The military targets included logistical hubs, air defense systems and weapons storage and launching locations, they said.
President Joe Biden said the strikes were meant to demonstrate that the U.S. and its allies “will not tolerate” the militant group’s ceaseless attacks on the Red Sea. And he said they only made the move after attempts at diplomatic negotiations and careful deliberation.
“These strikes are in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea — including the use of anti-ship ballistic missiles for the first time in history,” Biden said in a statement. He noted the attacks endangered U.S. personnel, civilian mariners and jeopardized trade, and he added, “I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.”

Associated Press journalists in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, heard four explosions early Friday local time. Two residents of Hodieda, Amin Ali Saleh and Hani Ahmed, said they heard five strong explosions hitting the western port area of the city, which lies on the Red Sea and is the largest port city controlled by the Houthis. Explosions also were heard by residents of Taiz, a southwestern city near the Red Sea.
The strikes marked the first U.S. military response to what has been a persistent campaign of drone and missile attacks on commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. And the coordinated military assault comes just a week after the White House and a host of partner nations issued a final warning to the Houthis to cease the attacks or face potential military action. The officials described the strikes on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. Members of Congress were briefed earlier Thursday on the strike plans.
The warning appeared to have had at least some short-lived impact, as attacks stopped for several days. On Tuesday, however, the Houthi rebels fired their largest-ever barrage of drones and missiles targeting shipping in the Red Sea, with U.S. and British ships and American fighter jets responding by shooting down 18 drones, two cruise missiles and an anti-ship missile. And on Thursday, the Houthis fired an anti-ship ballistic missile into the Gulf of Aden, which was seen by a commercial ship but did not hit the ship.
In a call with reporters, senior administration and military officials said that after the Tuesday attacks, Biden convened his national security team and was presented with military options for a response. He then directed Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to carry out the retaliatory strikes.
In a separate statement, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the Royal Air Force carried out targeted strikes against military facilities used by the Houthis. The Defense Ministry said four fighter jets based in Cyprus took part in the strikes.
Noting the militants have carried out a series of dangerous attacks on shipping, he added, “This cannot stand. He said the U.K. took “limited, necessary and proportionate action in self-defense, alongside the United States with non-operational support from the Netherlands, Canada and Bahrain against targets tied to these attacks, to degrade Houthi military capabilities and protect global shipping.”
And the governments of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand and South Korea joined the U.S. and U.K. in issuing a statement saying that while the aim is to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, the allies won’t hesitate to defend lives and protect commerce in the critical waterway.
The rebels, who have carried out 27 attacks involving dozens of drones and missiles just since Nov. 19, had warned that any attack by American forces on its sites in Yemen will spark a fierce military response.
A high-ranking Houthi official, Ali al-Qahoum, vowed there would be retaliation. “The battle will be bigger…. and beyond the imagination and expectation of the Americans and the British,” he said in a post on X.
What happened to Columbus officer who proposed ‘child porn’ charges against 11-year-old?
Al-Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, described strikes hitting the Al-Dailami Air Base north of Sanaa, the airport in the port city of the Hodeida, a camp east of Saada, the airport in the city of Taiz and an airport near Hajjah. And eyewitnesses who spoke with The Associated Press said they saw strikes in four areas, including Dhamar, Hodeida, Sanaa and Taiz.
The Houthis did not immediately offer any damage or casualty information.
A senior administration official said that while the U.S. expects the strikes will degrade the Houthi’s capabilities, “we would not be surprised to see some sort of response,” although they haven’t seen anything yet.
The Houthis say their assaults are aimed at stopping Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But their targets increasingly have little or no connection to Israel and imperil a crucial trade route linking Asia and the Middle East with Europe.
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution Wednesday that demanded the Houthis immediately cease the attacks and implicitly condemned their weapons supplier, Iran. It was approved by a vote of 11-0 with four abstentions — by Russia, China, Algeria and Mozambique.
Britain’s participation in the strikes underscored the Biden administration’s effort to use a broad international coalition to battle the Houthis, rather than appear to be going it alone. More than 20 nations are already participating in a U.S.-led maritime mission to increase ship protection in the Red Sea.
U.S. officials for weeks had declined to signal when international patience would run out and they would strike back at the Houthis, even as multiple commercial vessels were struck by missiles and drones, prompting companies to look at rerouting their ships.
On Wednesday, however, U.S. officials again warned of consequences.
“I’m not going to telegraph or preview anything that might happen,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters during a stop in Bahrain. He said the U.S. has made clear “that if this continues as it did yesterday, there will be consequences. And I’m going to leave it at that.”
The Biden administration’s reluctance over the past several months to retaliate reflected political sensitivities and stemmed largely from broader worries about upending the shaky truce in Yemen and triggering a wider conflict in the region. The White House wants to preserve the truce and has been wary of taking action in Yemen that could open up another war front.
The impact on international shipping and the escalating attacks, however, triggered the coalition warning, which was signed by the United States, Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Separately, the U.S. called on the United Nations Security Council to take action against the Houthis and warned their financier Iran that it has a choice to make about continuing to provide support to the rebels.
Transit through the Red Sea, from the Suez Canal to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, is a crucial shipping lane for global commerce. About 12% of the world’s trade typically passes through the waterway that separates Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, including oil, natural gas, grain and everything from toys to electronics.
In response to the attacks, the U.S. created a new maritime security mission, dubbed Operation Prosperity Guardian, to increase security in the Red Sea, Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden, with about 22 countries are participating. U.S. warships, and those from other nations, have been routinely sailing back and forth through the narrow strait to provide protection for ships and to deter attacks. The coalition has also ramped up airborne surveillance.
The decision to set up the expanded patrol operation came after three commercial vessels were struck by missiles fired by Houthis in Yemen on Dec. 3.
The Pentagon increased its military presence in the region after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel to deter Iran from widening the war into a regional conflict, including by the Houthis and Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria.

The deaths occurred in Medellin between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31, 2023, and appear to be either homicides or “involuntary” drug overdoses, officials said.
The deaths are not believed to be specifically linked as each involved distinct circumstances, but several of the deaths point to a common factor: online dating apps.
Officials say criminals use the apps to lure tourists and visitors to meet in public places like hotels, restaurants and bars — places that are often considered safe in other parts of the world.
Several U.S. citizens have ended up getting assaulted, drugged, robbed or even killed by the people they had planned to meet for a date.
U.S. officials say crimes against foreign visitors have seen a sharp increase in recent months in Colombia.
“The number of thefts committed against foreign visitors increased 200 percent in the third trimester of 2023 compared to the previous year and violent deaths of foreign visitors increased 29 percent,” the State Department said, citing local officials.
Of those violent deaths, most were U.S. citizens.

The use of online dating apps to rob, assault or murder American citizens is not limited to Medellin. Reports have also been received in Cartagena and Bogotá, the nation’s capital.
The State Department also says the crimes may be more widespread, as it’s believed victims are often too embarrassed to report the crimes to local authorities.
The U.S. Embassy in Colombia provided a list of tips to those visiting the country, which includes warnings about the use of online dating apps and meeting strangers.
It’s strongly advised you only meet with someone in public places and avoid isolated locations. If you end up inviting someone into your residence or hotel room, you should establish a visitor procedure with the hotel. You should also make sure friends or family are aware of your plans, including details about the person you are meeting and the app you used to meet them.

Ukrainian forces liberated Kherson and other settlements on the western bank of the Dnipro River in November 2022. Russian troops remain on the other side of the river and continually carry out indiscriminate attacks, leading to civilian casualties.
A 37-year-old man was killed and an 81-year-old woman was injured after a Russian strike hit a garage in a residential area of Kherson. Medics treated the woman at the site of the attack.
Roman Mrochko, the head of the city's military administration, said the man had been outside at the moment of the strike.
Prokudin shared a video of the damage to the area and said that Russian forces fired at the area for an hour.
Russian forces also attacked Beryslav, a city 65 kilometers east of Kherson. A 60-year-old woman, a 62-year-old man, and a 54-year-old man were injured, Prokudin said. All three received medical assistance.
Later in the afternoon, the Kherson Regional Military Administration reported an attack on the village of Romashkove, a village 12 kilometers outside of Kherson.
Homes, farms, and a car were damaged, and an 81-year-old local woman was injured in the strike.
Prokudin reported that on Jan. 16, three civilians were injured in Russian attacks.

“We have to take into account that Vladimir Putin will one day even attack a Nato country,” said Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister.
“Our experts expect a period of five to eight years in which this could be possible,” he told Der Tagesspiegel, a German newspaper. “At the moment I don’t think a Russian attack is likely.”
Europe is dealing with a “military threat situation … that has not existed for 30 years,” he added. “We hear threats from the Kremlin almost every day – most recently against our friends in the Baltics.”
The Baltic nations are taking steps to increase border security given those increased security concerns after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on Friday signed an agreement to build bunkers over the next few years to bolster the defences along their borders with Russia and Belarus, a staunch ally of Moscow.
Under the agreement, signed in Riga, the three countries will “construct anti-mobility defensive installations in the coming years to deter and, if necessary, defend against military threats”, the Estonian defence ministry in a statement.
The plan, and Mr Pistorius’s comments, came the day after a top Nato military official warned that civilians in the West must prepare for the possibility of all-out war with Russia in the next 20 years, and be ready to mobilise if necessary.
While various militaries are primed for the outbreak of war, the general public must also be ready for a conflict that would mean a wholesale change in their lives, said Adml Bauer, a Dutch naval officer who chairs the Nato military committee.
“We have to realise it’s not a given that we are in peace,” he said. “And that’s why we [Nato] are preparing for a conflict with Russia.
“But the discussion is much wider. It is also the industrial base and also the people that have to understand they play a role.”
Finland, which became Nato’s latest member when it joined last April, does not see any immediate military threat from Russia, the country’s prime minister said on Friday. “I don’t see any immediate military threat from Russia against Finland,” Petteri Orpo said. “We in Finland sleep peacefully at night, because we are well prepared.”
Concerns over global peace have grown, too, as the Israel-Hamas war continues and has begun to spill over in the Middle East.
With Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine approaching its two-year anniversary, global stockpiles of weapons and ammunition have been whittled down significantly.
Adml Bauer warned that more preparation is needed now to ensure there aren’t shortages of materiel in the future.
“You need to be able to fall back on an industrial base that is able to produce weapons and ammunition fast enough to be able to continue a conflict if you are in it,” he said.
The EU has been unable to deliver on plans to send one million 155mm artillery shells to Kyiv by Februrary, impacting the ability for the Ukrainian military to return fire against the Russians.
Meanwhile, in Washington, US support for Ukraine has ground to a halt in the face of mounting opposition from Republicans.
Europe, said Adm Bauer, must be ready to defend itself if it can no longer count on the US for support.
“We have a nuclear shield with the Americans and the French have the ‘force de frappe’,” Mr Pistorius said, referring to the French nuclear deterrent. “There are no signs that the nuclear shield will evaporate or be dismantled.

Israel has given no indication that it plans to halt its war against Hamas in the near future. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who launched the war after Hamas carried out a massacre on Oct. 7 that included the killing of at least 1,200 Israelis, has said the war will last ""many more months.""
Netanyahu has also threatened war with Hezbollah, another Iran-backed terrorist organization that operates in Lebanon to Israel's north.
President Biden's administration has remained largely supportive of Israel throughout the conflict, but has urged Netanyahu's government to scale back its offensive in Gaza.

Ryanair's boss told the BBC that quality was improving but the incident had shown there was ""more to be done"".
It comes after an unused door fell off a Boeing 737 Max 9 operated by US-based Alaska Airlines.
Ryanair does not use Boeing's 737 Max 9 aircraft but operates the Max 8 variant and has Max 10s on order.
The airline is one of Boeing's biggest customers for the 737 Max family, with more than 100 in service and due to have some 400 more by 2034.
Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said that he expects delivery delays to affect its capacity. Asked in an interview with the BBC if he had complete confidence in Boeing's quality control processes after the incident which saw a part of the aircraft's fuselage fall off, the Ryanair boss said ""no"".
But he added that his airline did now have ""more confidence"" in plane maker Boeing. Mr O'Leary also said that a delivery of 12 planes towards the end of last year had been ""in terms of defects the best deliveries we've had in three years"". He acknowledged what happened with the Alaska Airlines flight had been serious but said the industry always learned from incidents.
Key questions behind plane's mid-air blowout
Boeing's mid-air blowout puts safety record in spotlight again
Ryanair will deploy more engineers to oversee quality control at US factories in Seattle and Wichita building aircraft and fuselages for the airline. Mr O'Leary said that Boeing made good planes, but compared the relationship to a marriage: ""I can be in love with you and still occasionally criticise some of your personal habits. I think that's the same with Boeing.""
He suggested that the management team at Boeing ""needs to be improved"" following the incident, although he gave his support for Boeing's current chief executive David Calhoun, stating that he is ""doing a stellar job in very tough circumstances"".
Mr O'Leary added: ""We don't need more senior management changes in Boeing.""
On Monday, Boeing announced that an outside party would also be brought in to assess its production practices.
It will also check the work of the firm that supplies and installs the parts involved in the accident.
Last week, the US regulator extended the grounding of 737 Max's with similar fuselage panels.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also said it would conduct an audit of the plane's production line, adding it believed there were ""significant problems"" with the 737 Max 9 jet as well as ""other manufacturing problems"".
Announcing the latest measures, Stan Deal, who heads up Boeing's commercial division, said the company was ""not where we need to be"".
Scrutiny of Boeing has been renewed after the blowout on the Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to California, which forced an emergency landing but resulted in no serious injuries.
The US aerospace giant has been struggling to restore confidence after crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving a different plane in the 737 Max group killed 346 people.
Poor design of a piece of its flight control system was found to play a role in those crashes, and authorities grounded its popular 737 Max planes globally for more than 18 months. Poor oversight by the FAA was also cited.
On Tuesday, Boeing also announced that it had appointed Kirkland H. Donald, a former Navy admiral, as the independent advisor responsible for overseeing a review of its quality control systems for its commercial aircraft.
He and a range of experts will provide Boeing bosses, including Mr Calhoun, with a series of recommendations."

The objects were seized by Peru’s customs authorities from a shipment heading to Mexico before being handed over to experts from Peru’s prosecutor’s office.
The findings quash claims made by some in Mexico that the figures come from an “alien centre or come from another planet, all of which is totally false,” said forensic archaeologist Flavio Estrada, who led the analysis.
“The conclusion is simple: they are dolls assembled with bones of animals from this planet, with modern synthetic glues, therefore they were not assembled during pre-Hispanic times,” Estrada told reporters. “They are not extraterrestrials; they are not aliens.”
Experts showed reporters the pair of two-foot-long dolls dressed in red, orange and green clothes. They said examinations showed the bones of birds, dogs and other animals were used to create the dolls.
Meanwhile, the object said to be a three-fingered alien hand was subjected to X-ray examinations. Estrada said the “very poorly” built hand was created with human bones.
The prosecutor’s office has not yet determined who owns the objects. Officials on Friday would only say that a Mexican citizen was the intended recipient of the objects before they were seized by customs agents in October.
Mexican journalist José Jaime Maussan and some Mexican lawmakers became the subject of international ridicule in September when he went before the country’s congress to present two boxes with supposed mummies found in Peru.
Mr Maussan, along with others, claimed they were “non-human beings that are not part of our terrestrial evolution”.
In November, Mr Maussan returned to Mexico’s congress with a group of Peruvian doctors and spent more than three hours pressing the case for “non-human beings” that he said were found in Peru, where he made similar claims in 2017. A report by the Peruvian prosecutor’s office that year found that alleged alien bodies were actually “recently manufactured dolls, which have been covered with a mixture of paper and synthetic glue to simulate the presence of skin”.
“They are not the remains of ancestral aliens that they have tried to present,” the 2017 report stated.

An Istanbul court on Tuesday found Mohammed Hassan Sheikh Mohamud guilty of death by negligence.
The car he was driving collided with Yunus Emre Göçer's motorbike in the city in November last year.
Supporters of Mr Göçer have complained that the fine was too lenient and said that justice had not been served.
Mohamud's departure from Turkey in December after a police interrogation sparked an outcry among opposition media, the AFP news agency reports.
Critics said the authorities let Mohamud, son of Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, leave the country to maintain relations with its ally.
Turkey then issued an international arrest warrant for Mohamud and he returned to Turkey ahead of the trial.
The court initially sentenced him to two-and-a-half years in prison, but converted this to a fine due - among other things - to the remorse he showed during the trial, the BBC's Turkish service reports. He has also been banned from driving for six months.
Prosecutors had asked for a six-year sentence.
There were some who were not satisfied with the outcome.
""The life of a motorcycle courier cannot be 27,000 lira ($900)... What happened just now? Is this justice?"" Mesut Çeki, president of the Courier Rights Association said outside the courthouse.
Last month, as anger was building over what had happened, Istanbul's mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu shared grainy CCTV footage of the 30 November incident in a post on X.
A car can be seen appearing to hit the back of a motorcycle at a junction on a busy multi-lane road.
Mr Göçer, 38, was taken to hospital but the father-of-two died from his injuries six days later.
An initial police report had said that Mr Göçer had been at fault and because of this Mohamud was released, according to Mr Göçer's lawyer quoted by Turkish media outlets at the time.
But a review of the security footage suggested there may have been another explanation, which led to the arrest warrant and the court case.
Turkey and Somalia have enjoyed improving diplomatic relations over the past decade, with Turkey providing infrastructure investment, military training and humanitarian aid."

Russia is doing so to make up for losses on the front lines, the ISW said.
The ISW said ""Russian forces are able to conduct routine operational level rotations in Ukraine.""
Russia is recruiting 30,000 new soldiers a month to make up for the ones thrown into the meat grinder in Ukraine, a top Ukrainian intelligence official said this week.
That's about 1,000 to 1,100 people a day, according to the assessment from Vadym Skibitskyi, deputy chief major general of Ukraine's main military intelligence arm.
The Institute for the Study of War said Skibitskyi's statement is ""consistent with ISW's assessment that Russian forces are able to conduct routine operational level rotations in Ukraine.""
The term ""meat grinder"" originally referred to Russia's high-casualty approach to battles for strategic cities like Bakhmut and Avdiivka. But as the war drags on, analysts have seen similar parallels in Russia's offensive along other parts of the front lines.
In October, the US said Moscow had resumed the use of bloody ""human wave"" tactics, which involve throwing unprepared and poorly trained troops into the thick of battle, often without the right equipment.
""Russians are motivated to join the army, primarily driven by salary considerations, especially in crisis regions where wages are low or there are no jobs at all,"" Skibitskyi told RBC-Ukraine on Monday.
Skibitskyi told RBC-Ukraine that while the 30,000 new monthly recruits are enough to replenish losses on the front lines, Russia would need to ""declare a more massive mobilization"" to ""create a more strategic reserve.""
""Will Putin dare to do this?"" he added, according to the news outlet. ""Unlikely before the elections. And afterward — we'll see. But all the conditions for conducting mobilization in Russia are created at any time.""
In addition to the war, Putin faces a growing threat from within Russia: the wives and mothers of soldiers who want their loved ones to come home.
Their pushback has been so concerted that Federal Security Service agents have questioned soldiers whose wives are protesting, and military officers have threatened to send soldiers to the front lines if their wives don't back down, The Washington Post reported.
""Your methods are very dirty,"" said one message posted to a Telegram channel advocating for soldiers to be brought home, according to The Post. ""You are trying to calm our anger by putting pressure on our relatives.""

While the stock was down in the morning, it fell further after the Wall Street Journal first reported that the talks between the two sides had broken down. Reuters confirmed the news.
Novartis may attempt to pursue a deal for Cytokinetics in the future or a different suitor may acquire the company, the person said.
Reuters could not immediately ascertain the reason for the breakdown in the talks.
On Monday, Reuters reported that Novartis is in the lead to acquire Cytokinetics, ahead of other bidders that include AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.
Both Novartis and Cytokinetics said they do not comment on market rumors and speculation.
Shares of Cytokinetics, which has a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion as of Wednesday's closing price, have more than doubled in value since Oct. 31, when reports of the company attracting takeover interests first surfaced.
In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan had said the company's overall M&A strategy was focused on smaller acquisitions, involving assets valued below $5 billion.
Cytokinetics' stock has dropped 6% in the last two sessions since Narasimhan's comments on fears that a deal with Novartis may not happen.
Truist Securities analyst Srikripa Devarakonda in a note said she sees Cytokinetics as an attractive acquisition target as late-stage trial data of the company's key experimental drug, aficamten, supports its potential to be best in its class.
The company is testing aficamten for treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), an inherited chronic heart disease that can cause cardiac arrest.

K37CAS40LX_WVS9L4SLLLKSAWQ,US warns of Russian efforts to turn public opinion against Ukraine in upcoming European elections,"Nate Ostiller, The Kyiv Independent news desk","January 19, 2024 at 5:41 PM·2 min read",20240119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-warns-russian-efforts-turn-094153754.html,"Russia plans to use ""information operations"" in a bid to turn public opinion against Ukraine in the lead-up to key elections across Europe in 2024, said Jamie Rubin, the special envoy and coordinator for the U.S. State Department's Global Engagement Center (GEC), in comments to reporters on Jan. 18.
Russia's use of disinformation to further its own goals and weaken its perceived adversaries has been widely documented. Russian disinformation operations have been implicated in several key elections around the world, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Brexit vote in the U.K. in the same year.
There have been concerns that such efforts will be repeated in 2024 as dozens of countries are set to hold elections.
Rubin did not specify which countries he was particularly concerned about, but said that the primary targets would likely be in Europe.
Elections in Austria, the U.K., and the European Parliament are scheduled to take place in 2024. A parliamentary election will also occur in Georgia, which analysts have described as a ""pivotal"" opportunity for the country to make a ""choice between East and West.""
""Russia is hoping that the number of elections in Europe this year could change what has been a remarkable coalition and disciplined opposition to its war,"" said Rubin.
""We do believe that the Russians will conduct information operations throughout Europe to try to change opinion on Ukraine during this election season,"" he added.
In recent months, Russia has been accused of funding disinformation campaigns across Latin America and the Middle East in an effort to sow division and ""undermine support for Ukraine.""
Beyond seeking to influence public opinion, Russia has also wielded information operations for more specific purposes. The Finnish media outlet YLE reported in December 2023, citing leaked documents, that Russian intelligence services planned a series of disruptive activities to prevent, or at least hinder, Sweden and Finland's accession to NATO.
The planned activities, which YLE said did not appear to have actually taken place in Finland, sought to increase discord between Turkey and other NATO countries, especially Sweden, as the two Nordic countries began the process of joining the alliance.
Finland joined the alliance in April 2023, but Sweden's accession has been delayed, largely due to hesitation from Turkey.

K85O3WQM69_ORXKTUYTSCXTT89,San Diego County officials applaud Mexico groundbreaking of wastewater treatment plant,Tammy Murga,"January 15, 2024 at 3:18 AM·4 min read",20240114,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/san-diego-county-officials-applaud-191814795.html,"Mexico has broken ground on a long-awaited replacement for a crumbling wastewater treatment plant in Baja California that officials said will dramatically reduce the discharge of sewage that has fouled San Diego and Tijuana shorelines.
The failing and outdated San Antonio de los Buenos treatment plant in Punta Bandera, about six miles south of the border, is one of the biggest sources of water pollution in the region. Every day, the facility releases millions of gallons of mostly raw sewage into the ocean that routinely reaches San Diego County's southernmost beaches.
At a groundbreaking ceremony on Thursday with Imperial Beach Mayor Paloma Aguirre and U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar, Baja California Gov. Marina del Pilar Ávila Olmeda said the launch of the project marked a major milestone in ending cross-border pollution after failed attempts under previous administrations. She vowed to have the project online this year.
""The promise is that on the last day of September, this treatment plant will be working,"" said Ávila Olmeda. ""No more beach closures.""
For Aguirre, the start of Mexico's new treatment plant project feels like Imperial Beach and the surrounding communities are one step closer to accessing clean water.
""I think fixing Punta Bandera is one of the major fixes we need and it's what we've been advocating for so long,"" she said. ""It's exciting to think that once this source of pollution is eliminated, we will be able to have our beaches reopened during the summer and dry weather months.""
Mexico will pay for the $33-million project, which will consist of draining outdated lagoons that have failed to effectively treat wastewater. A new plant will instead have an oxidation ditch system made up of three independent modules and a 656-foot ocean outfall. It will have a capacity of 18 million gallons per day.
The project is one of several short- and long-term ones that Mexico and the U.S. vowed to take on under an agreement called Minute 328.
For the short-term projects, Mexico will invest $144 million to pay for the new treatment plant, plus fix pipelines and pumps. And the U.S. will use the $300 million that congressional leaders secured in late 2019 to fix and expand the outdated South Bay International Treatment Plant in San Ysidro , which serves as a backstop for Tijuana's sewage.
The unspent funds on the U.S. side are insufficient, however, to complete the expansion because of deferred maintenance that has only worsened during heavy rainfall. Even more funding will be needed for the long-term projects, which include building a treatment plant in San Diego that would take flows from the existing diversion system in the Tijuana River.
Elected officials representing the San Diego region have been pleading for additional funding to get projects in the U.S. completed. Last year, President Biden asked that Congress grant $310 million more to fix the sewage crisis.
That has not yet happened.
Hours before the groundbreaking, Rep. Scott Peters took to the floor of the House of Representatives demanding that the funding be included in any upcoming spending deal.
""We should be embarrassed that Mexico is acting with more urgency than we are,"" he said. ""The more we delay in addressing cross-border pollution, the more costly and difficult it will be to fix in the future.""
The U.S. section of the International Boundary and Water Commission, which operates the South Bay plant, is soliciting proposals for the design and construction of the rehab and expansion project. On Tuesday, officials reported that more than 30 contractors from about 19 companies visited the site and expressed interest in bidding. Construction is slated to begin within one year of the contract being awarded.
Simultaneously, the IBWC has been pressure-testing a newly installed pipeline that replaced one that ruptured in Tijuana in 2022, resulting in sewage spilling over the border through the Tijuana River and into the ocean. Crews recently found new leaks in the new pipe and are repairing them, according to the IBWC.
Though infrastructure improvements were made in the 1990s and new efforts on both sides of the border are underway, Tijuana's wastewater facilities have not kept pace with its population growth. Poorer communities also remain unconnected to the city's sewer system.

The inferno at the facility controlled by oil major Rosneft was spread over an area of 1,000 square metres along with tanks in Klintsy, Bryansk Region, Tass news agency said.
Bryansk governor Alexander Bogomaz said that a Ukrainian “aeroplane-style drone” was brought down and fire erupted after the munitions dropped over the oil depot.
The drone strike was the second on Russian oil facilities in two days this week.
While the Russian authorities suggested that the drone was shot down without causing the damage there were suggestions in Kyiv that such cross-border attacks are part of a new phase in Ukrainian strategy.
Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine‘s GUR military intelligence agency, neither confirmed nor denied Ukraine had been behind the attack, but said ""such events regularly occur at the aggressor state’s military facilities"".
He told national TV that he expected the incident to complicate logistics for Russian troops, increasing Ukrainian forces’ ""room for manoeuvre"".
Ukrainian media reports citing sources suggested that GUR was behind the strike that caused the massive fire.
“An aeroplane-style drone was brought down by the defence ministry using radio-electronic means. When the aerial target was destroyed, its munitions were dropped on the territory of the Klintsy oil depot,” Mr Bogomaz wrote on the Telegram messaging app.
Four oil reservoirs are burning at an oil depot in Klintsy, Bryansk region of Russia that was attacked by a drone last night, Russian media report. Residents of nearby homes have been evacuated. The fire has been assigned an increased level of complexity. https://t.co/hRQF3mqp0U pic.twitter.com/KirIz17J4P
— Anton Gerashchenko (@Gerashchenko_en) January 19, 2024
No one was hurt in the attacks. But around 30 people were evacuated, the governor said.
The regional governor said air defence units had brought down two other Ukrainian drones on Friday over other parts of Bryansk, a region that borders around 70km north of the Ukrainian border.
“Currently, the fire area stands at approximately 1,000 square meters. Four fuel tanks with total volume of 6,000 cubic meters are burning,” the emergency services said on Friday.
In footage shared by the governor, the firefighters were seen directing water hoses at giant flames around the storage tanks, at least one of which looked to have been badly damaged, as thick smoke filled the air.
Amidst a nearly two-year-long conflict, Russia and Ukraine have engaged in targeted strikes on each other’s energy infrastructure. These strategic attacks aim to disrupt supply lines and logistics, serving both as a tactical advantage and a means to demoralise the opponent in a protracted war with no apparent resolution in sight.
A rare attack on Thursday targeted a major oil loading terminal in Russia’s St Petersburg. Russian officials said that the drone was destroyed and its wreckages fell on the St Petersburg Oil Terminal.
""Yes, last night we hit the target. This thing crossed 1,250km (776 miles) last night,"" said Ukraine’s Strategic Industries minister Oleksandr Kamyshin on Thursday.
The attack was carried out using a domestically produced drone, a Ukrainian minister said quoting the Interfax-Ukraine news agency.
There were also reports of Ukrainian strikes on a gunpowder factory in the Tambov region and its consequences were still being clarified, the Ukrainska Pravda outlet quoted a source as saying.
Due to the potential threat of Ukrainian drone strikes, the Russian city of Belgorod, situated near the Ukrainian border, cancelled its traditional Orthodox Epiphany festivities on Friday. This marked the first instance of significant public events being cancelled in Russia explicitly in response to the threat posed by drones."

""I'd had it with the word brekkie. Well in Australia that is what they call breakfast exclusively,"" she told Sullivan, her co-star in TV series Sweet Home Oklahoma.
The comedy podcast sees the pair embark on regular rants as they complain about their daily grumbles.
But Welch moved to clarify her brekkie complaint was not about Australians.

""And now we have to go on the Aussie redemption tour.""
A video of the segment in question was shared to their social accounts days earlier where she asked people to ""quit making up cute words"", prompting backlash from unimpressed Aussies.
""Australia is shook right now,"" one person said. ""I think you need a deep dive into Australian slang,"" another said.
Welch's response to the anger was thankfully well received. ""Thanks for the clarity, us Aussies were triggered,"" one woman responded. Other Aussies suggested she may have a point as Australians can't help but abbreviate as many words as possible.
Last year the US embassy in Australia raised eyebrows after sharing a list of questionable slang words Australians use, including Sleeve Irwin for sweatshirt.

The $3.2 billion in military funding for Ukraine over the next financial year will cover long-range missiles, thousands of drones, air defense, artillery ammunition and maritime security, according to a statement from Sunak’s office.
According to the BBC, around $250 million will be spent on drones, most of which will be U.K.-made. The military package would result in the largest delivery of drones to Ukraine by any country.

It will also include $23 million for humanitarian aid, to help fortify Ukraine's energy infrastructure and more funding for online English language training, the BBC reported.
Britain is the second-biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the U.S., giving a total of $3.3 billion in 2022 and 2023. The funding is many times smaller than the estimated $75 billion in cash and equipment the Biden administration has sent to Kyiv. House Republicans for months stalled Biden’s request to Congress for an additional $61.4 billion more for Ukraine.

Ukraine says Moscow is receiving artillery shells and missiles from North Korea and drones from Iran. On Jan. 4, the White House cited U.S. intelligence officials as saying that Russia acquired ballistic missiles from North Korea and is seeking them from Iran, according to the Associated Press.
Sunak said that the U.K. ""will not falter"" in its commitment to help Ukraine forces stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion.
""Today we are going further — increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones, and signing a historic new Security Agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term,"" Sunak said.
The news comes a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he will not consider a cease-fire with Russia, claiming it would only help the invading military bolster its power.
Meanwhile, the United States and Britain carried out a series of air strikes on military locations belonging to Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen early Friday in response to the militant group's ongoing attacks on vessels traveling through the Red Sea.

KDXWH2WDS0_2UOYQJQKLI28CVM,British brothers raided Swiss museum 'to clear a debt',"Thomas Mackintosh - BBC News, in Geneva","January 15, 2024 at 9:30 PM·3 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/british-brothers-raided-swiss-museum-133006168.html,"Two British brothers have admitted raiding a museum in Switzerland and making off with iconic Chinese Ming dynasty era artefacts worth millions in order to ""clear a debt"", a court heard.
Prosecutors said the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva was burgled in June 2019 by a gang of three who used tools to break through the front door.
Two 14th Century vases and a bowl were taken in the heist.
Stewart and Louis Ahearne admitted their involvement at a court in Geneva.
The pair, from south-east London, appeared before a panel of three judges at the Palais de Justice in Geneva on Monday facing charges of theft, trespass and damage to property.
They fought extradition from the UK, but it was approved by the Home Secretary in 2022.
Patrick Monney, the president of the court, rejected a last-minute application for the trial to be heard in private. He added that the court was aware of the facts of the case from reports by the Swiss Prosecutors Office and Geneva Police and explained the purpose of the hearing was to ""ask additional questions"".
The court heard that the two brothers travelled to Hong Kong shortly after the raid to sell one of the stolen items to an auction house for £80,000.
Father-of-one Louis Ahearne told the court he came to Geneva days before the raid to carry out reconnaissance.
The 34-year-old to confirmed he went to ""film the museum"" and ""took part in the burglary"".
He also admitted giving his passport to the auction house in Hong Kong.
""I was in debt,"" he told the court. ""I was paid to be a front man to clear a debt. In the [CCTV] video I am the third person [going into the museum] with no crowbar and no sledgehammer.""
Throughout the hearing, the brothers insisted they didn't want to name the third person involved.
Stewart Ahearne, 45, told the court he has five children and worked as a tradesman in England. He also admitted to using his name to hire the Renault Captur car, used in the heist, from Avis at Geneva Airport.
He told the court he ""took full responsibility"" for his actions, but denied being involved in any pre-planning of the heist in Geneva.
""I went into the museum. I stole some stuff. Any organisation, anything to do with the artwork I didn't know nothing,"" he said.
He added that he ""used as a pawn like in a game of chess"" during the heist: ""I was asked to come to Switzerland to do some driving. The story, the scenario changed with the third person. He is not someone you can say no to. He is not a very nice person. My role was I was used.
""I got a phone call telling me my brother was in debt and that I was needed to bring back some stuff. Alarm bells started ringing. My instinct as an older brother was to protect my brother.""
The court heard the three came to Geneva in February 2019. Louis Ahearne said this was for ""tourist"" purposes, but Stewart Ahearne said he ""put two and two together"" after the burglary.
""It was so the third person could do some scouting,"" he added.
He broke down when answering questions about his life in Champ-Dollon prison, saying he spends his time in a cell by himself for 23 hours a day.
The hearing continues."

Related: Boeing opens factories to airlines and adds more checks after blowout
Video taken by an eyewitness and posted to social media showed the 747-8 aircraft trailing flames and sparks from its left wing as it circled back to land at Miami international airport at about 10.30pm.
The operator, New York-based Atlas Air, said the plane “experienced an engine malfunction soon after departure”. Its crew of five “followed all standard procedures and safely returned” to the airport, it said in a statement, adding it would conduct a “thorough inspection to determine the cause”.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it would be investigating the incident, adding that the eight-year-old Boeing 747-8 aircraft was heading for Puerto Rico. Its preliminary report stated that an inspection after the flight had landed revealed a “softball-sized hole” above one of its four engines, but did not specify when or how it occurred.
The plane, colloquially known as a jumbo jet, is equipped with four General Electric GEnx engines. The pilot reported a fire in the left wing engine closest to the fuselage, according to cockpit audio of the emergency call.

“Mayday, mayday, we have an engine fire,” the pilot calmly told the Miami control tower. “It’s engine number two, and we’re still trying to work it out.” The pilot said the fire started as it was gaining altitude after takeoff.
In a statement, General Electric Aerospace said: “Safety is our first priority, and GE Aerospace is providing technical assistance to FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board as they investigate the incident.”
The incident follows a series of other recent safety incidents involving Boeing’s aircraft, which prompted the FAA to announce last week it would significantly increase oversight of the company.
The agency is already conducting a formal inquiry into the in-flight blowout of a cabin panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 aircraft after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, on 5 January. Nobody was seriously hurt, and the FAA grounded 171 737 Max 9 planes while it investigated.
The FAA administrator, Mike Whitaker, said the new 737 Max 9 aircraft model had “significant problems” and “we believe there are other manufacturing problems”.
On Saturday, a Boeing 737-800 airliner belonging to Nippon Airlines returned to its departure airport at Toyama after a crack was found in its cockpit window.
The incidents represent the biggest safety crisis for the company since 346 people were killed in separate 737 Max 8 jet crashes in 2018 and 2019, leading to the grounding of that aircraft model worldwide for almost two years.
Boeing on Friday referred questions about the flight’s operation to Atlas Air, which it called its “customer”. In a brief statement, it said it was “supporting our customer and will support the NTSB investigation into this incident”.
The company’s chief executive, Dave Calhoun, had told employees in an all-hands town hall following the Alaska Airlines blowout that he accepted the company was at fault for that episode.
“We’re going to approach this, number one, acknowledging our mistake. We are going to approach it with 100% and complete transparency, every step of the way,” he said.
On Tuesday, Boeing announced it had hired a retired US navy admiral, Kirkland Donald, to act as an independent special adviser to “conduct a thorough assessment of Boeing’s quality management system for commercial airplanes, including quality programs and practices in Boeing manufacturing facilities and its oversight of commercial supplier quality”.
Donald, Calhoun said, would receive “any and all support he needs from me and from across the Boeing Company” to make safety and quality control recommendations."

Who are the Baluch?
Both Iran's southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan and Pakistan's western province of Balochistan are the most impoverished regions of their respective countries, vast and arid provinces constantly battling drought, with rampant unemployment.
They are home to the Baluch people, who number overall an estimated 10 million, the majority of whom live in Pakistan including also in the Sindh province, with several million in Iran and a much smaller minority in Afghanistan.
Iran and Pakistan share a border of nearly 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) along the provinces with smuggling activity, in particular of fuel, intense due to the porous nature of the frontier.
The Baluch are Sunni Muslims, which in Iran makes them a religious as well as an ethnic minority, with the dominant religion in the Islamic republic Shiite Islam.
What is the security threat in Iran?
Tensions have long simmered on both sides of the border but have rarely flared, as they have now, with both Iran and Pakistan striking what they call ""terrorist"" targets inside the respective provinces of the neighbouring country.
Nine people were killed in Pakistani air strikes on Thursday, Iranian state media said, two days after Iran carried out strikes against ""terrorist"" targets in Pakistan, which left at least two children dead.
There have been attacks inside Iran in recent months by the Sunni militant separatist group Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), which is blacklisted by Iran -- but also its arch foe the United States -- as a terrorist organisation.
Eleven police were killed in an attack claimed by the group in the town of Rask in December.
Jaish al-Adl was founded in the early years of the last decade after the disintegration of a similar group, Jundallah, which for years had carried out attacks against Iranian security forces but was weakened after the capture and subsequent execution of its leader Abdolmalek Rigi in 2010.
According to official Iranian media reports, he was arrested in extraordinary circumstances in February 2010 when Iranian fighter jets forced a passenger plane he was travelling on to Kyrgyzstan to land in Iran. He was hanged in June that year.
What is the situation in Pakistan?
On the other side of the border, Pakistani forces have for almost two decades also been fighting the latest iteration of an ethnic Baluch separatist insurgency, which has killed hundreds in attacks targeting security forces, government personnel and ethnically non-Baluch civilians.
Baluch separatists and rights groups say the military's crackdown on the insurgency has included widespread enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.
Since 2014, the separatists have also targeted projects associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a $58-billion project that is part of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and large parts of which run through mineral-rich Balochistan.
Baluch separatists are far from the only group, however, to use the vast and largely ungoverned Pakistani region as a base.
Western governments have in the past accused Pakistan of allowing Taliban leaders to enjoy a safe haven there while there has also been activity of a branch allied to the Islamic State group.
What are the grievances of the Baluch?
Iran's Sistan-Baluchistan province faced new instability in 2022 when its residents joined in with nationwide protests that were erupting across Iran over the death of young woman Mahsa Amini in police custody.
While the protests had their own spark -- the alleged rape of a teenager by a police commander in custody in the province -- they reflected nationwide anger, and security forces cracked down on the demonstrations.
On September 30, 2022, over 80 people were killed, according to Amnesty, when security forces opened fire on a protest in Sistan-Baluchistan's main city of Zahedan in what became known as its ""bloody Friday"".
Activists have long complained the region has been the victim of economic and political discrimination by Iran's Shiite clerical leadership, with disproportionate numbers of Baluch hanged in executions, in particular on drugs charges.
Reflecting the economic impoverishment of the region, many Baluch work as fuel carriers -- known as sookhtbar in Persian. They smuggle fuel over the border to Pakistan where it can be sold at a higher price.
Dozens have been killed by Iranian security forces in recent years, according to activists.
Amnesty International said that in 2021 at least 19 percent of all executions in Iran were of members of the Baluch minority.
Baluch on the Pakistani side of the border also complain of being disenfranchised, and of income from the province's rich natural resources not being adequately spent on local governance and social needs.

Details: The French Foreign Ministry noted that Séjourné arrived in Ukraine ""to continue French diplomatic efforts there and to reiterate France's commitment to its allies and civilians"".
The French Foreign Minister is expected to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy today.
Séjourné himself confirmed his arrival in Kyiv on Twitter (X), stressing that Ukraine has been ""defending its sovereignty and ensuring the security of Europe"" for almost two years.
""France's assistance is long-term. This is what I came to say during my first trip to Kyiv,"" he added.
Suspilne news outlet said that Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Séjourné paid tribute to the killed people at the Wall of Remembrance of those who died for Ukraine on Mykhailivska Square in the capital and laid flowers.
As reported, the visit of former Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna was originally planned, but reshuffles in the government changed the plans.
Background: This week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced the appointment of a new Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, following the resignation of his predecessor, Élisabeth Borne.
The day before, the Élysée Palace announced the composition of the new French government, in which most of the key ministers from the Borne government retained their positions, but the Foreign Minister was replaced.
Attal, who is France’s youngest-ever prime minister, has roots in the Ukrainian city of Odesa on his mother's side.

The satellite was launched on an H2A liquid-fuel rocket from the Tanegashima Space Centre in southwestern Japan.
The satellite will capture coloured photographs of the Earth’s surface and a radar satellite will capture photographs at night, in overcast and severe weather.
Japan says the satellite could also help improve responses to a range of major natural disasters. It comes just days after a magnitude 7.6 earthquake with its epicentre in Ishikawa killed more than 200 people.
Officials at the space centre initiated the launch at 1.45pm local time and confirmed later that its payload had reached orbit, reported The Asahi Shimbun.
With Friday’s successful mission, Japan now has five operational reconnaissance satellites in space. One of the satellites can transmit high-definition data to Earth.
The H2A launch was closely watched, at a time when Japan is developing a new flagship rocket – the H3 – as its long-term successor.
The new rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, failed its first test flight in March last year. Another attempt is scheduled to take place next month.
Mitsubishi Heavy’s rockets, including Friday’s, have two solid-fuel sub-rockets and are known for their remarkable 98 per cent success rate. It has recorded 41 consecutive successes after a failure seen in 2003.
Japan is aiming to develop a network of as many as 10 operational spy satellites in orbit, in part to watch for early warning signs of possible missile launches from North Korea. Pyongyang’s missile tests last year at times sent Japanese citizens scrambling for bomb shelters, and there is no indication that Kim Jong-un is planning to abandon the weapons programme in the near future.
Prime minister Fumio Kishida’s government, under its national security strategy adopted in 2022, is pushing to deploy long-range US-made Tomahawk and other cruise missiles as early as next year to build up more strike capability, breaking from the country’s exclusively self-defence-only postwar principle, citing rapid weapons advancement in China and North Korea."
L24SAVH76N_H5FOB4JBA15856H,Ukraine is piling pressure on China to help bring an end to the war. But Beijing’s peace plans are focused on Gaza,"Simone McCarthy, CNN","January 19, 2024 at 11:36 AM·6 min read",20240119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-piling-pressure-china-help-033639317.html,"As Ukraine scrambles to keep international support with Russia’s invasion grinding into a third year, its leader has made clear one country he would like to see join his push for peace: China.
Ratcheting up pressure on Beijing – Moscow’s most powerful political ally – appeared as a key talking point for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other officials this week during a gathering of the global elite in Switzerland’s Davos.
There, Zelensky told reporters he would “very much like China to be involved” in Ukraine’s peace plan. His foreign minister said the country wanted more contact with China at “all levels,” Interfax-Ukraine reported, while Zelensky’s chief of staff left the door open that the wartime leader could even meet China’s top delegate on the gathering’s sidelines.
But Chinese Premier Li Qiang appeared to depart the World Economic Forum earlier this week without meeting Zelensky – and didn’t directly address the conflict in a roughly 25-minute speech that focused heavily on reassuring his audience about China’s faltering economy.
Even as Chinese officials last year ramped up efforts to present the country as a potential peace broker in the war, analysts say it’s unlikely Beijing sees now as the time to leverage its deep and growing Russia ties to ramp up a push for its end – especially on Ukraine’s terms.
“China thinks it is already playing an important role in moving toward peace. It’s just the Chinese version of peace is not what Zelensky wants to see,” said Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center think tank.
Last year, after Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke to Zelensky for the first time some 14 months after the war began, Beijing dispatched an envoy to both Kyiv and Moscow. It has also released its own proposal for peace, which unlike Ukraine’s demands, calls for a ceasefire without the prior withdrawal of Russian troops illegally occupying Ukrainian territory.
Now, the latest events at Davos spotlight China’s wait-and-see approach when it comes to any further push to bring the war to a close, analysts say, as fighting remains locked in stalemate with neither side giving signs of backing down – and another major conflict, in the Middle East, draws global attention.
“China previously might have wanted to mediate because it didn’t want Russia to lose too badly. But now there is less worry on that front … China has more incentive to observe how battlefield development will evolve, which will form the foundation for any (peace) negotiation,” according to Sun.
“Now that the US is distracted by Gaza and the resources available to Ukraine are more limited, things have shifted in Russia’s favor. There is even less reason for China to ‘advance a fair peace as advocated by the West and Ukraine,’” she said.
As Li focused on the economy in Davos, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi kept his focus on Gaza earlier this week.
In Cairo as part of the foreign minister’s customary first trip of the year to Africa, Wang issued a joint statement with the Arab League calling for an “immediate and comprehensive ceasefire” in Gaza to end more than three months of war – echoing Beijing’s stance on the conflict since its early days.
Wang also said China called for convening a “larger-scale, more authoritative and more effective international peace conference,” and a specific timetable for implementing a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.
Though it is unclear how much sway China has in the region to play a strong role backing such an effort, an independent state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel, is consistent with Beijing’s long-standing foreign policy; it was one of the first countries to recognize Palestine as a sovereign state in the late 1980s and has long advocated for a two-state solution.
However, analysts say, the conflict also presents an opportunity for Xi as he maneuvers to position China as an alternative international leader to the United States, in particular for the Global South – and fan perceptions that American policies have disrupted global stability.
“So much (global) frustration and anger has shifted to the conflict in Gaza … and that’s where China scores points for trying to position itself as a diplomatic force for good,” said Alex Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin.
“When it comes to the Gaza war, the bulk of Global South countries are strongly, strongly opposed to what Israel is doing … that’s a conflict where portraying yourself as an agent for peace and a negotiated solution yields you much more sympathy (in the Global South) … unlike the Ukrainian war, where most of the countries are sitting on the fence and it’s only the West that’s so united,” he said.
Whether Beijing has an interest in joining a growing number of countries – including those from the Global South – willing to sit down at the table with Ukraine and hear its peace conditions will be tested at an upcoming peace summit, announced Monday.
The meeting, which Switzerland said it would host on an undisclosed date at Zelensky’s request, is expected to draw world leaders to discuss how to end the conflict as it nears entering its third year. Zelensky portrayed it as an event “where all countries that respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity are welcome to attend.”
When asked whether an invitation had been extended to Beijing, China’s Foreign Ministry earlier this week sidestepped a direct reply, saying China’s position “is centered on promoting talks for peace” and supported “any efforts for peace.”
Analysts say it’s unlikely that will translate into high-level attendance at talks where Ukraine’s views, but not Russia’s, would be the starting point.
Russia has not been represented in any of the four closed-door international peace talks that have taken place so far, though its participation would be needed for a peace agreement. Of those three, China only attended one hosted by its increasingly close strategic partner, Saudi Arabia.
Beijing views Moscow as a key partner in counterbalancing what it sees as a hostile West, and the two countries have continued to bolster security, diplomatic and economic ties since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.
“As long as Russia doesn’t accept it, whatever happens at the peace conference is irrelevant. China will not support conditions that Russia opposes,” said Sun in Washington. “Any attempt to draw China into such a setting will fail because China also understands the optics of it joining such a session.”
For now, that may see China sit on the sidelines, until it feels there’s a moment for compromise between Kyiv and Moscow – an opening within which it may seek to ramp up its role.
But when it comes to how Beijing may maneuver toward brokering peace in Gaza, China likely doesn’t see itself as yet having captured the opportunity “to present itself as a conflict mediator,” according to Sun. “Therefore, more is on the way.”

L3JFDGEJA7_ZYS8712NZC8TLOM,US and UK carry out strikes against Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen,"Oren Liebermann, Haley Britzky, Natasha Bertrand, Kevin Liptak, Alex Marquardt, MJ Lee and Jennifer Hansler, CNN","January 12, 2024 at 2:36 PM·13 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-uk-carry-strikes-against-013630001.html,"The US and UK militaries launched strikes against Houthi targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen on Thursday, marking a significant response after the Biden administration and its allies warned that the Iran-backed militant group would bear the consequences of its attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
US President Joe Biden said he ordered the strikes “in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea.”
“Today, at my direction, U.S. military forces — together with the United Kingdom and with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands—successfully conducted strikes against a number of targets in Yemen used by Houthi rebels to endanger freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most vital waterways,” the president said in a statement released by the White House.
Biden added that he will “not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.”
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday the strikes were an act of “self-defense,” adding that the aim was to “de-escalate tensions and to restore stability to the region.”
US Air Forces Central Commander Lt. Gen. Alex Grynkewich initially said US and coalition forces struck over 60 targets with more than 100 precision-guided munitions at 16 Iranian-backed Houthi militant locations. The Houthi assets included command and control nodes, munitions, depots, launching systems, production facilities, and air defense radar systems, he added.
On Friday afternoon, Director of the Joint Staff Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims II said another 12 locations were also hit on Thursday after a “near immediate” decision following the initial strikes.
The strikes, which have been condemned by several leaders across the Middle East, killed five and wounded six others, according to the rebels’ military spokesperson, Yahya Sare’e, who said the airstrikes would not deter further Houthi attacks on shipping.
The US and UK strikes are a sign of the growing international alarm over the threat to one of the world’s most critical waterways. For weeks, the US had sought to avoid direct strikes on Yemen because of the risk of escalation in a region already simmering with tension as the Israel-Hamas war continues, but the ongoing Houthi attacks on international shipping compelled the coalition to act.
Though the US has carried out strikes against Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, this marks the first known strike against the Houthis in Yemen.
The strikes were from fighter jets and Tomahawk missiles. More than a dozen Houthi targets were fired on by missiles fired from air, surface, and sub platforms and were chosen for their ability to degrade the Houthis’ continued attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, a US official told CNN.
The USS Florida, a guided missile submarine that crossed into the Red Sea on November 23, was part of the attack on Yemen, according to a second US official.
The USS Philippine Sea guided missile cruiser and two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers, the USS Gravely and the USS Mason, also took place, the official added on Friday.
The US also deployed 22 fixed wing aircraft — including F18s — from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier, the official said.
Four British Typhoon jets departed RAF Akrotiri, a major UK airbase in Cyprus, on Thursday evening local time, according to a British government official.
Two Voyager air-to-air refuelling tankers also comprised the mission, UK junior armed forces minister James Heappey told the BBC on Friday, adding that at least 14 targets were successfully hit.
“They flew south, joined up with their US colleagues, and prosecuted two targets in Houth-controlled Yemen, both of which had been used for the launching of drone and missile attacks,” Heappey added. There are no more UK convoys “immediately planned,” he said.
On Thursday, Rear-Admiral Emmanuel Slaars, joint commander of French forces in the Red Sea region, told journalists in Paris that French naval forces were patroling the waters where the Houthis operated.
Slaars said the French navy forces remain “under national command” and were “not subordinated” to the US. However, they are cooperating and sharing intelligence with the US.
A senior US military official told reporters on Thursday evening that he could not provide an exact percentage of Houthi assets that were destroyed in the strikes but that it was “significant.” He added that precision guided munitions were used to destroy the targets “and also to minimize collateral damage.”
“We were absolutely not targeting civilian population centers. We were going after very specific capabilities, in very specific locations, with precision munitions,” the official said.
The Houthis — an Iran-backed Shia political and military organization that has been fighting a civil war in Yemen against a coalition backed by Saudi Arabia — have been launching drones and missiles at commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea for weeks, many of which have been intercepted and shot down by US Navy ships in the area.
The Houthis have said their bombardments are showing solidarity with the Palestinian people, after Israel launched an unrelenting military campaign on Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks.
The Houthis have said they will only relent when Israel allows the entry of food and medicine into Gaza; its strikes could be intended to inflict economic pain on Israel’s allies in the hope they will pressure it to cease its military offensive.
Within Yemen, a yearslong conflict between Houthi forces and the Saudi-backed coalition has plunged the population into a devastating humanitarian crisis marked by famine, economic turmoil and extreme poverty.
Houthi forces stormed the capital Sanaa in 2014, and toppled the internationally recognized and Saudi-backed government, triggering a civil war. The conflict spiraled into a wider war in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an attempt to beat back the Houthis.
The conflict has killed up to 377,000 people, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reported in 2021. More than half of those died from indirect causes associated with the conflict, such as lack of food, water and healthcare.
Pro-Houthi demonstrators gathered in Sanaa on Friday, protesting against the US and UK airstrikes. Some chanted, “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews, victory to Islam.”
The Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping on Tuesday marked the final straw that culminated in Biden giving the green light for the US to move forward with Thursday’s strikes, though preparations have been ongoing for some time, a senior US official told CNN.
The strikes come as Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin remains hospitalized following complications from a surgery for prostate cancer. A senior Defense official said Austin ordered and monitored the strikes in in real-time from the hospital “with a full suite of secure communications.”
Over the course of the past several weeks, Biden has weighed potential strikes against Houthi positions in Yemen against the prospect of an escalating crisis in the Middle East. His underlying hesitancy in ordering direct action has been the potential of getting drawn in more directly to an expanding conflict — a scenario US officials believe could ultimately be Iran’s objective.
But the White House had made clear the repeated Houthi attacks on international shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea were intolerable. The attacks have forced some of the world’s largest shipping companies to avoid the waterway, instead adding thousands of miles to international shipping routes by sailing around the continent of Africa.
Hours before the strike on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Iran “has a role to play” in getting the Houthis to stop their “reckless, dangerous, and illegal activity.” If they did not, he said, “there will be consequences.”
The Houthi’s deputy foreign minister, Hussein al-Ezzi, claimed that Yemen was targeted in a “massive aggressive assault.”
In a speech Thursday, Houthi leader Abdul Malek Al-Houthi said that any US attack on Yemen ” will not go unanswered,” cryptically warning that the response will be “much more” than attacking US ships in the sea.
Houthi rebels’ military spokesperson Sare’e on Friday said they would continue their aggression against commercial ships in the Red Sea.
In a statement Friday on social media, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the group’s Supreme Revolutionary Committee, said the airstrikes “are barbaric, terrorist, and are a deliberate and unjustified aggression that reflects a brutal psychology.”
A senior US administration official signaled that there could be more action to come against the Houthis.
The Houthis fired at least one anti-ship ballistic missile towards a commercial vessel, Sims said on Friday.
The ballistic missile, fired Friday, “did not hit any ships of any kind,” Sims said, adding that he expected they were working through things on the ground and “trying to determine what capabilities still exist for them.” A US official said the missile was fired towards the M/T Khalissa in the Gulf of Aden.
“I would expect that they will attempt some sort of retaliation. Quite honestly I would hope they wouldn’t. And what I mean by that is, there are a number of actors here who have the ability and have influence with the Houthis who recognize that continued conflict is not … advantageous to them,” Sims said. “Iran would be one of them.”
“The hope would be that any real thought of retaliation is based on a clear understanding that we simply are not going to be messed with here,” he added.
New explosions were heard in Yemen’s western port city of Hodeidah on Friday, a resident told CNN.
The airport in Hodeidah had been hit in the initial round of strikes early Friday morning. The resident provided CNN a video that showed smoke rising from the direction of the airport.
CNN has reached out to the US Department of Defense about the explosions, and whether there are new strikes in Yemen.
On Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned while traveling in the region that “if it doesn’t stop, there will have to be consequences. And unfortunately, it hasn’t stopped.”
Blinken also said he doesn’t believe the war in Gaza is escalating into a regional conflict, even as he warned of “a lot of danger points.” While in the region, Blinken visited Bahrain, home to the US Naval Forces Central Command and the Navy’s Fifth Fleet.
An important aspect of Blinken’s trip to the Middle East was to tell regional leaders that if US takes military action against the Houthis, it should be seen as defensive, not escalatory, according to a senior State Department official.
On Wednesday, the United Nations Security Council passed a US- and Japan-led resolution condemning “in the strongest terms the at least two dozen Houthi attacks on merchant and commercial vessels since November 19, 2023” and demanding “that the Houthis immediately cease all such attacks.” Eleven countries voted in favor of the resolution. Four abstained, including China and Russia. A Western diplomat told CNN that the US accommodated some of China’s requests on the language of the resolution.
US strikes in Yemen are not unprecedented; according to the Council on Foreign Relations, the US has conducted nearly 400 airstrikes in Yemen since 2002.
In Yemen, officials say they are concerned at what a strike against the Houthis would portend for the region. Declassified US intelligence shows that Iran has been deeply involved in coordinating the Houthi attacks on commercial and merchant ships, including providing information about shipping vessels passing through the waterway.
Among the US’ concerns about taking direct action inside Yemen is also the risk of upsetting a carefully brokered truce in the war in Yemen between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia, which a US official previously told CNN the Biden administration considers one of its most significant foreign policy achievements.
Some American officials feared a direct attack on the Houthis in Yemen would be precisely what the group craved: drawing the US into direct engagement with the Iranian proxy group and potentially committing its forces to a more prolonged conflict.
Still, Biden’s attempts at deterrence had done little to prevent the Houthis from continuing their attacks on commercial and merchant ships transiting the Red Sea.
A significant turning point came around New Year’s, when US Navy helicopters shot and sank three Houthi boats in self-defense, killing those aboard. It was the first direct engagement between the US and Houthis since the start of the conflict, and prompted Biden to convene his national security team for a secure briefing call while he was on vacation in the US Virgin Islands.
That joint statement was issued on January 3, saying that the Houthis “will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways.”
While not describing the statement as a red line, Biden and his team recognized the language would essentially bind them to a more forceful response should the Houthi attacks continue, which many officials privately believed they would.
Just on Tuesday, the US Navy to shot down 21 missiles and drones fired by the Houthis; culminating on Thursday the fiercest response from the Biden administration since the salvos began.
There have been at least 27 Houthi attacks since November 19. As the US and its allies have been navigating the Houthis’ ongoing attacks, there have also been at least 131 attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria since October 17, leading to several strikes on facilities linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other proxy forces.
But many of the commercial vessels have had no connection to Israel. Vice Adm. Bradley Cooper, the commander of US Navy Central Command, said last week that the US assesses 55 nations have “direct connections” to the ships that have come under fire.

Earlier on Jan. 12, the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organizations (AFUO) asked the government to supply Ukraine with 45 decommissioned Taipan helicopters destined for the scrapyard.
Defense official Pat Conroy said there are no Taipan units that are currently in ""flying condition,"" and that ""to get any up to flying condition would require a huge investment in taxpayers' funds, time and resources to do that.""
Ukraine heavily relies on Western allies for armored vehicles, aircraft, and other advanced equipment as it battles Russian forces.
Australian officials said the government will seek other ways to provide support to Kyiv.
""The Australian government continues to work closely with Ukraine to consider further options to provide timely, meaningful, and sustainable assistance,"" Conroy said.

""In 2023, the first Ukrainian incursions took place in temporarily occupied Crimea,"" Budanov, 38, told French daily Le Monde. ""And this is just the beginning.""
Ukraine has also repeatedly targeted Russia's Black Sea Fleet, based in Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula.
""The Russians have had to move everything in a hurry to the southeast,"" Budanov said, adding that Moscow was now trying to set up a naval base on the Black Sea coast of the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia.
He acknowledged that the front lines were largely frozen in Ukraine.
""On both sides, the very intensive use of attack drones has made both Russian and Ukrainian offensives impossible,"" he said. ""Another factor has been the density of minefields, unprecedented since World War II.""
He said that the resilience of the Russian economy surprised him, and that the current Western sanctions were not enough to force the Kremlin to change its behaviour.
""A certain Russian paradox surprised me. Everyone thought that Moscow had a strong army and a weak economy. It turns out that the opposite is true,"" Budanov said.
""The economy may be weak, but the country is not starving, far from it. It could even last quite a long time at this rate,"" he said, adding that sanctions should target Russia's main economic sectors and the entire financial system.
Signs of fatigue over the war in Ukraine might be increasing but Budanov urged the West to keep supporting Kyiv militarily.
""Those who think they are tired of Ukraine abroad will have to court Russians when they come to occupy their own territories,"" he said.
Budanov, who has led Ukraine's GUR military intelligence unit since 2020, accurately predicted that Russia would attack Ukraine on February 24, 2022.
He said it was not the right time to negotiate with Russia.
""Negotiations begin when one or both parties have an interest,"" he said. ""This is not the case.""

LED1IBEIGW_F6JWIFBTK2K50WX,Estonia arrests professor on suspicion of spying for Russia,Nate Ostiller,"January 16, 2024 at 11:42 PM·2 min read",20240116,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/estonia-arrests-professor-suspicion-spying-154236159.html,"Estonian authorities arrested a professor with Russian citizenship on charges of allegedly spying for Russia, the Estonian media outlet ERR reported on Jan. 16, citing information from Estonia's Internal Security Service (ISS).
Estonia has long been concerned about undue influence from Russia, being on the far eastern flank of NATO and having a considerable ethnic Russian minority. The country was also the subject of a massive cyber-attack widely attributed to Russia in 2007, which was viewed by some Estonians as a wake-up call to the threat emanating from Russia.
The professor, Viacheslav Morozov, worked at Estonia's premier higher education institute, the University of Tartu, studying and teaching political theory. Morozov was born in Russia but worked at the University of Tartu since 2010. He was arrested on Jan. 3, but Estonian authorities only made the detention public on Jan. 16.
The university informed students and alumni of Morozov's arrest in an email on Jan. 16, saying that he had been dismissed from his position.
""Understandably, this comes as a shock to all of us. Our trust has been seriously abused. We confirm you that we have had no grounds to question Viacheslav Morozov's earlier work, but in the light of new knowledge, it is important to critically review it,"" said Kristiina Tonnisson, head of the university's Johan Skytte Institute of Political Studies.
The university's Rector Toomas Asser later commented on the arrest, saying, ""I unequivocally denounce any action that could endanger the security of our country. It is impossible to measure the full extent of the potential damage.""
""I urge us not to underestimate hostile countries’ ability and intent to lead and carry out anti-democratic actions,"" he added.
ISS General Director Margo Pallosson said that Morozov regularly traveled to Russia, where he met with his handlers. Estonia's Public Prosecutor's Office said that Morozov's alleged spying activity occurred over a period of several years.
Morozov is known for his left-leaning views, often speaking and writing critically about Russian President Vladimir Putin and the country's aggression toward Ukraine.
An anonymous associate of Morozov told Politico that he was surprised by the news. ""I have never encountered any anti-Estonian or any other of his activities outside of his left-liberal publications,” he said.
Pallosson said that the extent of the information Morozov allegedly shared with Russian security services has yet to be determined.

Russia targeted a total of nine Ukrainian oblasts — Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Chernihiv, Mykolaiv, Luhansk, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Kherson. Casualties were reported in the latter four regions.
A civilian was killed in Zalizine on the southeastern outskirts of Toretsk, just a few kilometers from the front line, Donetsk Oblast Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Facebook.
Russia attacked multiple settlements in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk Oblast, damaging industrial facilities, a school, 13 houses, and two high-rises, added Filashkin.
Russia’s missile strike on Kharkiv late on Jan. 10 hit a hotel in the city center, injuring 13 people, including a foreign journalist, according to the latest update by Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.
Earlier Russian attacks against Kharkiv Oblast killed a 49-year-old woman in the village of Vilkhuvatka and wounded two elderly residents of Podoly near Kupiansk, Kharkiv Oblast Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported.
The strikes damaged over 10 houses, an educational institution, a shop, and power lines, according to Syniehubov.
Russian attacks on Kherson Oblast in the previous 24 hours wounded three people, Oleksandr Prokudin, the regional governor, said on Telegram. Russia reportedly launched 108 strikes against the region, firing 482 projectiles from various weapons.
Russian troops struck the Nikopol district in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast several times on Jan. 10, leaving a 56-year-old man and a 39-year-old woman injured, according to Serhii Lysak, the regional governor.

LJXAUZCPGP_8M8FFC3V226WCTM,Iran releases German-Iranian citizen from prison with ankle tag,"Hande Atay Alam, CNN","January 10, 2024 at 7:27 AM·2 min read",20240110,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/iran-releases-german-iranian-citizen-232754032.html,"A German-Iranian citizen arrested in Iran in 2020 has been granted a temporary release, on the condition she wear an electronic ankle monitor, according to her daughter.
“I am pleased to announce that my mother Nahid Taghavi was this morning released temporarily on furlough. Unfortunately, Nahid has to wear an electronic ankle tag during the furlough,” Taghavi’s daughter Mariam Claren wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Tuesday.
Taghavi, now in her late sixties, was detained in Tehran on October 16, 2020, “solely for peacefully exercising (her) human rights,” according to the human rights organization Amnesty International statement in 2021.
In August 2021, Iran’s Revolutionary Court convicted Taghavi of national security-related charges which she denied, and she was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison, Amnesty said.
Her lawyer Mostafa Nili said she had been sentenced alongside a British-Iranian citizen, Mehran Raouf, on charges related to “participating in managing an illegal group” and “propaganda against the regime.”
Human Rights Watch has previously accused Iranian authorities of targeting foreign and dual nationals with vague charges in an attempt to gain leverage over other countries.
Taghavi’s release from Tehran’s Evin prison comes amid concerns over her health. Amnesty has warned Taghavi was at increased risk of severe illness or death if she were to contract Covid as she has diabetes and high blood pressure.
Her fellow prisoner at Evin, the Nobel Peace Prize winning Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi, warned on Instagram in June that Taghavi’s life was in danger.
Following Taghavi’s release, Claren posted a photograph of her mother sitting on a yellow sofa with a gentle smile.
The photo also shows Taghavi wearing an electronic monitor on her ankle.
“Nahid’s movement will be restricted to 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) from her apartment in Tehran. This makes her release more comparable to house arrest,” Claren wrote, adding, “However, we hope this furlough is an important first step for her unconditional release.”
Germany’s senior diplomat Ambassador Christian Buck on Tuesday welcomed Taghavi’s release, which he said was on medical grounds.
“This is an important first step. We continue to work tirelessly to ensure that Nahid Taghavi is reunited with her family,” he posted on X.

LMJA3SJF51_IF4T586OU10G241,Iran's sudden strikes show just how perilous region has become,Lyse Doucet - Chief international correspondent,"January 20, 2024 at 12:53 PM·7 min read",20240120,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/irans-sudden-strikes-show-just-004303570.html,"These are shape-shifting times in the Middle East.
This week, out of the blue, Iran suddenly attacked targets in ""friendly"" Pakistan, sparking an unprecedented tit-for-tat across their volatile border and a sharp spike in tension on a far edge of the grievous Israel-Gaza war.
Iran wanted a message to be heard loud and clear - at home, and a long way beyond.
""It has showcased its missile arsenal and its willingness to use it,"" says Vali Nasr, professor of international affairs and Middle East studies at Johns Hopkins University.
""It was a message also likely intended for Israel and the US in the midst of the Gaza war, especially with the potential escalation in Lebanon and Yemen.""
Like most observers, he believes ""for now Iran is not looking to escalate"".
Ever since the Gaza war exploded after Hamas's murderous 7 October assault on southern Israel, it has been darkened by fears of an even more dangerous contagion. No-one, including Iran and its principal partner Hezbollah, as well as the United States, wants to see an even hotter conflagration.
Iran shows missile capabilities with regional strikes
Why did Iran launch strikes on its allies' territory?
Iran's war has been a web of shadow wars. It sits at the fulcrum of what it calls an ""axis of resistance"", the alliance of Tehran-backed groups dotting the region, from Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, to the Houthis in Yemen, and well-armed groups in both Iraq and Syria. Most have been designated as terrorist entities by some Western states.
Their military prowess is rooted in Iran's accelerated arming and training; each actor also has agendas and ambitions of its own.
Fires have been burning on all these fronts, and sometimes blazing, with efforts to douse the flames lest they provoke crippling Israeli and American reprisals.
When Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) carried out these first direct strikes since this crisis erupted, they trained their sights on Pakistan and two other friendly countries. They may have seen them as areas of least resistance beyond the highly combustible landscape of their ""axis of resistance"".
Iran's elite force unleashed a barrage of ballistic missiles and suicide drones against what it called an intelligence centre for Israel's Mossad spy agency in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, and at ""anti-Iran terror groups"" including Islamic State in rebel-controlled swathes of Syria.
Each operation was said to have its own specific retaliatory rationale.
Iran says it had to aim fire at Iranian Baloch separatists operating in restive southwest Pakistan.
""An attack was imminent. They had gathered and were leaving the base,"" says Prof Seyed Mohammad Marandi at the University of Tehran. He also points to last month's killing of 11 Iranian police officers in its tense province of Sistan and Balochistan.
Pakistan also spoke of an ""impending attack"" when it then fired its own salvos two days later into southern Iran against what it said were bases of its own Baloch nationalists, which it called ""terrorist targets"". This cross-border tension has simmered for decades; this is its worst moment.
Northern Iraq and Syria, closer to the Gaza epicentre, were about settling separate scores.
""The attacks in Iraq and Syria were retaliation for the general as well as the atrocity in Kerman,"" explains Prof Marandi. He's referring to last month's assassination just outside Damascus of one of the IRGC's most senior men, Sayyed Razi Mousavi, which was widely reported as the work of an Israeli air strike.
Then, earlier this month, a double suicide bombing shattered a memorial service in Iran for Qasem Soleimani, the top commander assassinated by an American drone in Iraq four years ago. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the deadliest attack in Iran since the 1979 revolution.
""Iran has been under pressure to react, including to the killing of senior Hamas and Hezbollah commanders in Lebanon, but it doesn't want to get directly embroiled in any escalation by hitting Israel or the US,"" says Mohammad Ali Shabani, editor of Amwaj media, which provides in-depth analyses of the region.
""We are going to continue to see a slow boil,"" he says.
These are also tough times at home for Iran's ruling clerics. They've faced unprecedented women-led protests over social freedoms and more, as well as financial woes stemming from international sanctions, alleged corruption, and mismanagement.
And there has been blowback after these latest operations, with angry denunciations from Iraq, as well as the Arab League, and an even more forceful rebuke from Pakistan.
""They did not think through that striking in Pakistan territory could just have no repercussions,"" remarks former Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar. ""Their action created a crater of distrust. It will take hard work and persistence to fill.""
There are wars within wars in every corner of this conflict. Pakistan also had to be seen to be setting its own red lines in a neighbourhood where age-old rival India, as well as Taliban-run Afghanistan, were watching closely. Accusations and more of harbouring hostile forces have long been hurled across those borders too.
This past week has been a reminder, if one was needed, of the unpredictability and peril in this moment of a widening and worsening Israel-Gaza war.
They were Israel's 'eyes on the border' - their warnings went unheard
Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?
A really simple guide to Iran's protests
Any day can be a flare-up on one or multiple fronts - and there are the longer-term risks being shaped in a region where fault lines were deeply and darkly etched long before Hamas's 7 October attacks.
Israel's largest loss of life in a single day since the founding of its state, as well as the seizing of more than 250 hostages, sparked a military campaign causing a staggering number of civilian deaths and turning much of Gaza into an unliveable wasteland.
It has enraged and emboldened this Iran-backed military alliance of militant non-state actors. They've been drawing closer for years. Now they've forged a far more vocal and visible league.
For Iran's adversaries, the proverbial ""we need to do something about Iran"" may now be even riskier. It may also mean confronting Tehran's staunchest allies across the region.
""Tehran has achieved what the Pentagon calls military 'overmatch' - a level of capability in which a country has weaponry that makes it extremely difficult to check or defeat,"" says Robin Wright, author of several books on Iran and a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre for Scholars.
This current escalation has not been cost-free. US salvos against Iranian-backed fighters in Iraq are reported to have significantly damaged their infrastructure.
The Pentagon says its air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, in an effort to stop their attacks on vessels in the vital Red Sea shipping lanes, have destroyed a quarter of the Houthi arsenal.
Biden says US strikes have not stopped Houthi attacks
Who are the Houthis attacking Red Sea ships?
Gaza destruction risks a lost generation - UN
But on the balance sheets of some of Iran's allies, they believe they're winning far more than they're losing. Standing up for Gazans has galvanised their popularity on Arab streets. Yemen's Houthis in particular are relishing being catapulted into the centre of world attention.
Minds are already focused on the ""day after"", when this Israel-Gaza war ends, including in Tehran, which has long prided itself on its ""strategic patience"".
""Iran is playing a broader longer game,"" points out Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at Chatham House. ""It perhaps anticipates that after Gaza winds down Israel is going to be more provocative towards Iran, so it is preparing for a longer fight.""
Iran's long-term goals include keeping the US out of its backyard, and avoiding a direct confrontation with Israel and America.
That means careful calculations on where and how it strikes in a hazardous region where the risks of miscalculation are always dangerously high.

LO2QAD3BKR_ZQM97JI6TBMBZ18,Iran claims responsibility for strikes in Iraq,Brad Dress,"January 15, 2024 at 5:42 PM·2 min read",20240116,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/iran-claims-responsibility-strikes-iraq-234212962.html,"Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) claimed responsibility for an attack on what it called an Israeli spy base in Iraq as large explosions were reported in the city of Erbil on Tuesday morning.
The IRGC early Tuesday local time fired at the “espionage headquarters and gatherings of anti-Iranian terrorist groups” in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil and destroyed the targets, according to a statement from the military wing.
Iran has long said that Israel operates a secret base used by spy agency Mossad in the city of Erbil. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the claimed strike.
The Hill could not independently confirm the IRGC’s claims. But a U.S. defense official said explosions were reported in the area of Erbil.
“We have seen the reports, and we tracked the missiles, which impacted in northern Iraq and northern Syria,” said White House national security council spokesperson Adrienne Watson. “No US personnel or facilities were targeted. We have been in touch with senior Iraqi officials as well as officials in the Kurdistan Region. Iran is claiming this is in response to the terrorist attacks in Kerman, Iran and Rask, Iran, with a focus on ISIS. We will continue to assess the situation, but initial indications are that this was a reckless and imprecise set of strikes. The United States supports the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Iraq.”
The U.S. operates a consulate in Erbil and some troops are stationed at the city’s Harir Air Base along with allied fighters in Iraq.
Washington is not reporting any injuries or damage to infrastructure at any American bases, according to the defense official.
The reported strike comes as the Middle East is flaring up amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, with Iranian-backed groups fighting U.S. and Israeli forces across the region.
Iran has largely battled the U.S. and its ally, Israel, through proxy forces in Lebanon and Yemen, and the IRGC strike is the most direct attack yet in the war.
Israel says it is fighting a multi-arena war and in late December killed a senior IRGC official in Syria.
Separately, the IRGC said it struck the ISIS commanders responsible for a deadly bombing in Iran earlier this month. That strike hit targets in Syria, according to the IRGC.
ISIS claimed responsibility for killing nearly 100 people in the Iranian city of Kerman while supporters had gathered for a memorial service on the anniversary of the death of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani.

LVUON3F9N7_V6FFT6P6QLHSXTJ,Florida can now import prescription drugs from Canada. It's great news to my patients.,Dr. Marc Siegel,"January 12, 2024 at 4:16 a.m.·4 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/florida-now-import-prescription-drugs-101648096.html,"The Food and Drug Administration finally approved the importation of prescription drugs from Canada to Florida last week, a long awaited move.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law to allow this all the way back in 2019. This move has bipartisan support, and the White House is encouraging other states to follow, and in fact Colorado, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin already have laws allowing drug importation.
President Joe Biden signed an executive order back in 2021 directing the FDA to work with the states on imports, opening the door.
The real question is: Considering that we have the highest drug prices of any developed country, how much difference will this make in bringing down prescription drug prices in the United States to a more reasonable place? The answer is that even if it's just a small step, it's a step in the right direction.
Part of the reason for this problem is the powerful drug lobbies, led by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which oppose drug importation of medications from Canada and other destinations. And they aren’t going to cease their opposition any time soon.
Multinational drug companies may try to block some of the importation, and the Canadian government may, too, considering that Canadians, like us, are suffering from drug shortages and supply chain problems, according to the Canadian Pharmacists Association.
Plus, the U.S. prescription drug market is nearly 20 times that of Canada's market, so our northern neighbor certainly cannot supply all our drug needs.

If nothing else, this move will help burst the Big Pharma myths once and for all. The prescription drugs in Canada are just as effective and just as safe, as are generic and biosimilar drugs that can be had for much lower costs and yet often face approval challenges here.
The myth that we are really paying for the high cost of drug development (while other countries clearly aren’t), will finally be burst. Why shouldn’t these costs be shared across all customers and all countries.
At the same time, artificial intelligence will speed drug development and make it much cheaper. Too much of the cost of drugs here is tied up with distribution costs, complying with FDA regulations regarding cleanliness and sterility and paying for regulatory approval, and other cogs in the wheel including pharmacy benefit managers (PBM), who suck up profit without providing clear value.
Just one fake pill can kill: She thought it was Xanax. She died of fentanyl poisoning.
I favor free-market approaches to drive down drug prices through competition, rather than increasing more regulation through direct negotiation. Medicare and Medicaid attempts to negotiate prices inevitably lead to fewer choices – which is very problematic for me and my patients – while competition leads to more choices and better health care outcomes.
This is what California Gov. Gavin Newsom is trying to accomplish by having his state produce insulin in a more cost-effective streamlined way.
For that matter, why shouldn’t states be able to import drugs from other countries like India, considering that the vast majority of our drugs (or their ingredients) come from overseas to begin with. The notion that prices are high as a way to somehow ensure quality is the greatest myth of all.
TikTok is a trap. As a doctor, I tell parents to protect their kids from social media.
Price opacity is another key part of the problem. All my patients care about is what their co-pay will be at the pharmacy, and they are not aware when a PBM or an insurance company is getting a drug company rebate.
Drug manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies all rely on this opacity to obscure the exorbitant prices from the patient or their doctor. This bloat will be squeezed out of the system when drug companies are forced to compete more with generics, biosimilars, other states and other countries.
Many patients are asking me this week if they will be able to order Canadian drugs online from Florida pharmacies. While this remains to be seen, the question itself is revealing.
The United States is finally on the verge of introducing needed competition into the prescription drug market.

M4YUSV5N4U_058IFB2RXCRMSJH,Bloomberg: Internal documents show White House support for seizing frozen Russian assets,Martin Fornusek,"January 11, 2024 at 2:43 AM·2 min read",20240111,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/bloomberg-internal-documents-show-white-104333912.html,"U.S. President Joe Biden's administration backs legislation that would allow the confiscation of some frozen Russian funds and funneling them to Ukraine, Bloomberg reported on Jan. 10, citing three documents it had obtained.
Western countries have immobilized around $300 billion of the Russian central bank's assets since the start of the full-scale invasion. Washington, Brussels, and Kyiv have long discussed legal ways of channeling these funds to aid Ukraine's reconstruction efforts.
Despite appeals by U.S. lawmakers, the White House had been hesitant on outright seizure of the assets, as such a step carries a number of legal and economic pitfalls.
It appears that the Biden administration began warming to the idea recently. A November memo from the National Security Council to the U.S. Senate welcomed ""in principle"" a bill that would allow the confiscation of funds, Bloomberg reported.
""The bill would provide the authority needed for the executive branch to seize Russian sovereign assets for the benefit of Ukraine,"" the document reportedly said.
Congressional officials cited by Bloomberg noted that the measure could be included in the proposed $61-billion supplemental package for Ukraine, though both chambers of Congress would have to back its inclusion.

Senate Republicans have so far blocked the overall $111-billion funding requests, including money for Ukraine, chiefly due to other domestic concerns. A hardline faction of House Republicans opposes the aid in principle, however.
Using Russia's own funds instead of U.S. money could alleviate Republican worries about financial burdens, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a member of the Republican Party, voiced interest in the plan.
The White House also reportedly seeks to align its position with the Group of Seven (G7) allies, namely in the EU, where around two-thirds of Russian frozen assets are held. In comparison, only around $5 billion are held in U.S. institutions.
The European bloc has been wary of confiscating Russian sovereign funds, instead discussing ways of providing Ukraine with a windfall tax on profits generated by the frozen assets.
In October, Belgium announced it would create a $1.8 billion fund for Ukraine, financed by the tax revenue from interest on frozen Russian assets.
The World Bank assessed early in 2023 that the total cost of Ukraine's reconstruction would amount to $411 billion. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba commented earlier this week that the full amount of Russian assets could cover over 80% of recovery costs.

M71JX58JZY_F0NDU0VADMD7JHB,US and UK carry out strikes against Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen,"Oren Liebermann, Haley Britzky, Natasha Bertrand, Kevin Liptak, Alex Marquardt, MJ Lee and Jennifer Hansler, CNN","January 12, 2024 at 2:36 PM·13 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-uk-carry-strikes-against-013630001.html,"The US and UK militaries launched strikes against Houthi targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen on Thursday, marking a significant response after the Biden administration and its allies warned that the Iran-backed militant group would bear the consequences of its attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea.
US President Joe Biden said he ordered the strikes “in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea.”
“Today, at my direction, U.S. military forces — together with the United Kingdom and with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands—successfully conducted strikes against a number of targets in Yemen used by Houthi rebels to endanger freedom of navigation in one of the world’s most vital waterways,” the president said in a statement released by the White House.
Biden added that he will “not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.”
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday the strikes were an act of “self-defense,” adding that the aim was to “de-escalate tensions and to restore stability to the region.”
US Air Forces Central Commander Lt. Gen. Alex Grynkewich initially said US and coalition forces struck over 60 targets with more than 100 precision-guided munitions at 16 Iranian-backed Houthi militant locations. The Houthi assets included command and control nodes, munitions, depots, launching systems, production facilities, and air defense radar systems, he added.
On Friday afternoon, Director of the Joint Staff Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims II said another 12 locations were also hit on Thursday after a “near immediate” decision following the initial strikes.
The strikes, which have been condemned by several leaders across the Middle East, killed five and wounded six others, according to the rebels’ military spokesperson, Yahya Sare’e, who said the airstrikes would not deter further Houthi attacks on shipping.
The US and UK strikes are a sign of the growing international alarm over the threat to one of the world’s most critical waterways. For weeks, the US had sought to avoid direct strikes on Yemen because of the risk of escalation in a region already simmering with tension as the Israel-Hamas war continues, but the ongoing Houthi attacks on international shipping compelled the coalition to act.
Though the US has carried out strikes against Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria since the outbreak of the war in Gaza, this marks the first known strike against the Houthis in Yemen.
The strikes were from fighter jets and Tomahawk missiles. More than a dozen Houthi targets were fired on by missiles fired from air, surface, and sub platforms and were chosen for their ability to degrade the Houthis’ continued attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, a US official told CNN.
The USS Florida, a guided missile submarine that crossed into the Red Sea on November 23, was part of the attack on Yemen, according to a second US official.
The USS Philippine Sea guided missile cruiser and two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers, the USS Gravely and the USS Mason, also took place, the official added on Friday.
The US also deployed 22 fixed wing aircraft — including F18s — from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier, the official said.
Four British Typhoon jets departed RAF Akrotiri, a major UK airbase in Cyprus, on Thursday evening local time, according to a British government official.
Two Voyager air-to-air refuelling tankers also comprised the mission, UK junior armed forces minister James Heappey told the BBC on Friday, adding that at least 14 targets were successfully hit.
“They flew south, joined up with their US colleagues, and prosecuted two targets in Houth-controlled Yemen, both of which had been used for the launching of drone and missile attacks,” Heappey added. There are no more UK convoys “immediately planned,” he said.
On Thursday, Rear-Admiral Emmanuel Slaars, joint commander of French forces in the Red Sea region, told journalists in Paris that French naval forces were patroling the waters where the Houthis operated.
Slaars said the French navy forces remain “under national command” and were “not subordinated” to the US. However, they are cooperating and sharing intelligence with the US.
A senior US military official told reporters on Thursday evening that he could not provide an exact percentage of Houthi assets that were destroyed in the strikes but that it was “significant.” He added that precision guided munitions were used to destroy the targets “and also to minimize collateral damage.”
“We were absolutely not targeting civilian population centers. We were going after very specific capabilities, in very specific locations, with precision munitions,” the official said.
The Houthis — an Iran-backed Shia political and military organization that has been fighting a civil war in Yemen against a coalition backed by Saudi Arabia — have been launching drones and missiles at commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea for weeks, many of which have been intercepted and shot down by US Navy ships in the area.
The Houthis have said their bombardments are showing solidarity with the Palestinian people, after Israel launched an unrelenting military campaign on Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks.
The Houthis have said they will only relent when Israel allows the entry of food and medicine into Gaza; its strikes could be intended to inflict economic pain on Israel’s allies in the hope they will pressure it to cease its military offensive.
Within Yemen, a yearslong conflict between Houthi forces and the Saudi-backed coalition has plunged the population into a devastating humanitarian crisis marked by famine, economic turmoil and extreme poverty.
Houthi forces stormed the capital Sanaa in 2014, and toppled the internationally recognized and Saudi-backed government, triggering a civil war. The conflict spiraled into a wider war in 2015 when a Saudi-led coalition intervened in an attempt to beat back the Houthis.
The conflict has killed up to 377,000 people, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) reported in 2021. More than half of those died from indirect causes associated with the conflict, such as lack of food, water and healthcare.
Pro-Houthi demonstrators gathered in Sanaa on Friday, protesting against the US and UK airstrikes. Some chanted, “God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews, victory to Islam.”
The Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping on Tuesday marked the final straw that culminated in Biden giving the green light for the US to move forward with Thursday’s strikes, though preparations have been ongoing for some time, a senior US official told CNN.
The strikes come as Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin remains hospitalized following complications from a surgery for prostate cancer. A senior Defense official said Austin ordered and monitored the strikes in in real-time from the hospital “with a full suite of secure communications.”
Over the course of the past several weeks, Biden has weighed potential strikes against Houthi positions in Yemen against the prospect of an escalating crisis in the Middle East. His underlying hesitancy in ordering direct action has been the potential of getting drawn in more directly to an expanding conflict — a scenario US officials believe could ultimately be Iran’s objective.
But the White House had made clear the repeated Houthi attacks on international shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea were intolerable. The attacks have forced some of the world’s largest shipping companies to avoid the waterway, instead adding thousands of miles to international shipping routes by sailing around the continent of Africa.
Hours before the strike on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Iran “has a role to play” in getting the Houthis to stop their “reckless, dangerous, and illegal activity.” If they did not, he said, “there will be consequences.”
The Houthi’s deputy foreign minister, Hussein al-Ezzi, claimed that Yemen was targeted in a “massive aggressive assault.”
In a speech Thursday, Houthi leader Abdul Malek Al-Houthi said that any US attack on Yemen ” will not go unanswered,” cryptically warning that the response will be “much more” than attacking US ships in the sea.
Houthi rebels’ military spokesperson Sare’e on Friday said they would continue their aggression against commercial ships in the Red Sea.
In a statement Friday on social media, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the group’s Supreme Revolutionary Committee, said the airstrikes “are barbaric, terrorist, and are a deliberate and unjustified aggression that reflects a brutal psychology.”
A senior US administration official signaled that there could be more action to come against the Houthis.
The Houthis fired at least one anti-ship ballistic missile towards a commercial vessel, Sims said on Friday.
The ballistic missile, fired Friday, “did not hit any ships of any kind,” Sims said, adding that he expected they were working through things on the ground and “trying to determine what capabilities still exist for them.” A US official said the missile was fired towards the M/T Khalissa in the Gulf of Aden.
“I would expect that they will attempt some sort of retaliation. Quite honestly I would hope they wouldn’t. And what I mean by that is, there are a number of actors here who have the ability and have influence with the Houthis who recognize that continued conflict is not … advantageous to them,” Sims said. “Iran would be one of them.”
“The hope would be that any real thought of retaliation is based on a clear understanding that we simply are not going to be messed with here,” he added.
New explosions were heard in Yemen’s western port city of Hodeidah on Friday, a resident told CNN.
The airport in Hodeidah had been hit in the initial round of strikes early Friday morning. The resident provided CNN a video that showed smoke rising from the direction of the airport.
CNN has reached out to the US Department of Defense about the explosions, and whether there are new strikes in Yemen.
On Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned while traveling in the region that “if it doesn’t stop, there will have to be consequences. And unfortunately, it hasn’t stopped.”
Blinken also said he doesn’t believe the war in Gaza is escalating into a regional conflict, even as he warned of “a lot of danger points.” While in the region, Blinken visited Bahrain, home to the US Naval Forces Central Command and the Navy’s Fifth Fleet.
An important aspect of Blinken’s trip to the Middle East was to tell regional leaders that if US takes military action against the Houthis, it should be seen as defensive, not escalatory, according to a senior State Department official.
On Wednesday, the United Nations Security Council passed a US- and Japan-led resolution condemning “in the strongest terms the at least two dozen Houthi attacks on merchant and commercial vessels since November 19, 2023” and demanding “that the Houthis immediately cease all such attacks.” Eleven countries voted in favor of the resolution. Four abstained, including China and Russia. A Western diplomat told CNN that the US accommodated some of China’s requests on the language of the resolution.
US strikes in Yemen are not unprecedented; according to the Council on Foreign Relations, the US has conducted nearly 400 airstrikes in Yemen since 2002.
In Yemen, officials say they are concerned at what a strike against the Houthis would portend for the region. Declassified US intelligence shows that Iran has been deeply involved in coordinating the Houthi attacks on commercial and merchant ships, including providing information about shipping vessels passing through the waterway.
Among the US’ concerns about taking direct action inside Yemen is also the risk of upsetting a carefully brokered truce in the war in Yemen between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia, which a US official previously told CNN the Biden administration considers one of its most significant foreign policy achievements.
Some American officials feared a direct attack on the Houthis in Yemen would be precisely what the group craved: drawing the US into direct engagement with the Iranian proxy group and potentially committing its forces to a more prolonged conflict.
Still, Biden’s attempts at deterrence had done little to prevent the Houthis from continuing their attacks on commercial and merchant ships transiting the Red Sea.
A significant turning point came around New Year’s, when US Navy helicopters shot and sank three Houthi boats in self-defense, killing those aboard. It was the first direct engagement between the US and Houthis since the start of the conflict, and prompted Biden to convene his national security team for a secure briefing call while he was on vacation in the US Virgin Islands.
That joint statement was issued on January 3, saying that the Houthis “will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, and free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways.”
While not describing the statement as a red line, Biden and his team recognized the language would essentially bind them to a more forceful response should the Houthi attacks continue, which many officials privately believed they would.
Just on Tuesday, the US Navy to shot down 21 missiles and drones fired by the Houthis; culminating on Thursday the fiercest response from the Biden administration since the salvos began.
There have been at least 27 Houthi attacks since November 19. As the US and its allies have been navigating the Houthis’ ongoing attacks, there have also been at least 131 attacks on US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria since October 17, leading to several strikes on facilities linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other proxy forces.
But many of the commercial vessels have had no connection to Israel. Vice Adm. Bradley Cooper, the commander of US Navy Central Command, said last week that the US assesses 55 nations have “direct connections” to the ships that have come under fire.

M7A15QX0YZ_928XMFEA8ATWUUV,US government rejects complaint that woman was improperly denied an emergency abortion in Oklahoma,KIMBERLEE KRUESI,"January 19, 2024 at 2:30 PM·3 min read",20240119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-government-rejects-complaint-woman-223018146.html,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says an Oklahoma hospital did not violate federal law when doctors told a woman with a nonviable pregnancy to wait in the parking lot until her condition worsened enough to qualify for an abortion under the state's strict ban.
Jaci Statton, 26, was among several women last year who challenged abortion restrictions that went into effect in Republican-led states after the Supreme Court revoked the nationwide right to abortion in 2022.
Rather than join a lawsuit, Statton filed a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA. The complaint came a little more than a year after Biden's administration informed hospitals that they must provide abortion services if the mother’s life is at risk. At the time, President Joe Biden's administration said EMTALA supersedes state abortion bans that don’t have adequate exceptions for medical emergencies.
The Biden administration’s denial of Statton’s claim is the latest development in the ongoing scrutiny over how to apply EMTALA in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. It also underscores the uphill legal battle reproductive rights advocates when pushing back against state abortion bans.
According to the complaint, Statton learned she was pregnant in early 2023 and soon began experiencing severe pain and nausea. Doctors in Oklahoma eventually told her that she had a partial molar pregnancy, which left untreated could cause hemorrhaging, infection, and even death.
“However, providers told Jaci that they could not provide an abortion until she was actively crashing in front of them or on the verge of a heart attack,"" the complaint stated. ""In the meantime, the best that they could offer was to let Jaci sit in the parking lot so that she would be close to the hospital when her condition further deteriorated.”
Abortion is illegal in almost every case in Oklahoma. However, in November, the state's Supreme Court reiterated in a ruling that the state constitution guarantees a woman’s right to an abortion when necessary to preserve her life.
Ultimately, Statton and her husband traveled out of state to have an emergency abortion rather than wait for her health to deteriorate.
In October, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services — which operates under Health and Human Services — informed Statton that its investigation could not “confirm a violation” of the emergency care federal law.
“We appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention,” the letter said.
The Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents Statton, confirmed Friday that her complaint had been denied. The center did not disclose why it waited months to make the denial public. In December, an attorney for the center told The Associated Press that they had did not have any updates that they could release publicly.
“EMTALA was created to protect every person’s right to receive stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition no matter which state they live in or what kind of stabilizing care they need,” said Rabia Muqaddam, a senior staff attorney with the center. “It is horrifying that patients in Jaci’s circumstances are being turned away.”
A spokesperson for Health and Human Services did not immediately return an email request for comment.
The Center for Reproductive Rights has lawsuits ongoing in Idaho, Tennessee and Texas. The lawsuits do not seek to overturn the states’ abortion bans, but instead ask the state courts to clarify the circumstances that qualify patients to legally receive an abortion.
The Supreme Court earlier this month allowed Idaho to enforce its strict abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, while a separate legal fight continues. The justices said they would hear arguments in April and put on hold a lower court ruling that had blocked the Idaho law in hospital emergencies, based on a federal lawsuit filed by the Biden administration.
Also this month, a three-judge panel in New Orleans ruled that the administration cannot use EMTALA to require hospitals in Texas to provide abortions for women whose lives are at risk due to pregnancy."

MBEEDO8XUP_AM1ASG7BI0H430H,China says threats of force over Taiwan not aimed at most Taiwanese,Reuters,"January 16, 2024 at 8:22 PM·3 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/china-says-threats-force-over-042234098.html,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's position that it will not renounce using force to bring Taiwan under its control is aimed at foreign interference and a tiny number of separatists, but Taiwanese need to be disabused of ""biases"" against China, the government said on Wednesday.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which won the presidential election on Saturday, rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims but has repeatedly offered talks that have been rebuffed.
China views president-elect Lai Ching-te as a dangerous separatist.
Chen Binhua, spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, told a regular news briefing in Beijing that the result of Taiwan's election does not change the fact that the island is Chinese and will eventually be ""reunified"".
""Our not promising to renounce the use of force is absolutely not targeted at Taiwan compatriots. We are targeting interference from external forces and the tiny number of Taiwan independence separatists and their separatist activities,"" Chen said.
Over the past year-and-a-half China has twice staged large-scale war games around Taiwan and regularly sends fighter jets and warships into the Taiwan Strait.
Mainstream public opinion in Taiwan wants peace not war, exchanges not distance, and to ""take down"" the DPP, he said, reiterating the office's comment on Saturday following Lai's victory with less than 50 pct of the vote and the loss of the DPP's parliamentary majority.
""If the DPP does not repent and goes further and further on the wicked path of seeking 'independence' provocations, it will only push Taiwan into a dangerous situation and bring serious harm to Taiwan,"" he said.
Chen said Taiwanese are ""our flesh and blood"", but some have been ""poisoned"" by ideas of independence and have a ""biased understanding"" of relations across the strait and national identity.
""We are willing to maintain sufficient patience and tolerance, continue to deepen the understanding of the mainland of the motherland by the majority of Taiwanese compatriots, and gradually reduce their misunderstandings and doubts,"" he added.
""We hope and believe that our compatriots in Taiwan can firmly stand on the right side of history and be upright Chinese people.""
As if to underscore those differences in understanding, Chen told off a Taiwanese reporter for using ""Beijing"" to refer to China, saying the correct wording was ""the mainland"".
Opinion polls in Taiwan show an overwhelming number of people these days consider themselves Taiwanese not Chinese, and close to no support for China's ""one country, two systems"" model of autonomy to get the island to accept Beijing's rule.
However, Chen did not mention Lai, who takes office on May 20, by name, unlike before the election when the Taiwan Affairs Office repeatedly and directly called him a separatist and danger to peace.
China says talks can only happen under the proviso Taiwan recognises both sides of the Taiwan Strait are part of ""one China"", which the DPP-led government has refused to do.

Marcos's congratulatory message is likely to be frowned upon by China, which claims the self-governing island as its own territory to be taken under Beijing’s control by force if necessary. President-elect Lai has vowed to safeguard the island’s de-facto independence from China and further align it with other democracies.
After U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken congratulated Lai on his victory, China’s Foreign Ministry said that message “sends a gravely wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence’ separatist forces,” claiming it goes against a U.S. commitment to maintain only unofficial ties with Taiwan.
""On behalf of the Filipino people, I congratulate President-elect Lai Ching-te on his election as Taiwan’s next president,” Marcos said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
""We look forward to close collaboration, strengthening mutual interests, fostering peace and ensuring prosperity for our peoples in the years ahead,” the Philippine president added.
The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately comment on Marcos’s congratulatory remarks.
The Philippines adheres to the One China principle, which holds that Taiwan is part of China and recognizes Beijing as the government of China.
When asked earlier for a reaction to the outcome of Taiwan’s presidential election, the Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila briefly stated that it remains committed to its One China policy, which the Philippines adopted in 1975.
Marcos's remarks were made as tensions escalate between China and the Philippines over a series of territorial standoffs in the South China Sea."

The meeting is scheduled to take place on Jan. 12 at 5:00 p.m. EET.
After Israel began an operation in the Gaza Strip in response to attacks by Palestinian Hamas militants, Yemeni Houthis intensified attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
To support Palestine, the Houthis threatened on Dec. 9 to attack all ships passing through the Red Sea to Israel. The Houthis struck several commercial ships and attacked an American military vessel on Dec.3.

In response to the Houthi assaults on vessels in the Red Sea, the U.S. and UK initiated air and sea strikes against Houthi military sites in Yemen. This action represents a significant escalation of the conflict that originated with the Israel-Hamas confrontation in Gaza.
The U.S. and UK began striking Houthi bases in Yemen, on the night of Jan.11-12.  The attack was confirmed by U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
A spokesperson for the Houthis in Yemen declared that the strikes by the U.S. and UK were unwarranted, stating that the Iran-supported faction intends to persist in targeting vessels en route to Israel, Reuters reported.
A British destroyer, along with U.S. military ships, repelled the largest attack by Yemeni Houthis in the Red Sea, on Jan.10.

The records show that Bolsonaro, a COVID-19 skeptic who publicly opposed the vaccine, received a dose of the immunizer in a public healthcare center in Sao Paulo in July 2021.
The investigation concluded, however, that the former president had left the city the previous day and didn't leave Brasilia until three days later, according to a statement.
The nurse listed in the records as having applied the vaccine on Bolsonaro denied doing so and was no longer working at the center. The listed vaccine lot was also not available on that date, the comptroller general's office said.
Registration of two other vaccine doses that would have been given to Bolsonaro was removed from his record even before the investigations began, it added, saying these were also fake.
Last May, Bolsonaro's home in Brasilia was raided by the federal police under the vaccine probe. Some of his aides were arrested and his cell phone was seized.
Bolsonaro has previously denied having knowledge of or ordering false information to be inserted into his vaccination records.
His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
During his tenure, Bolsonaro repeatedly downplayed the importance of immunization and social distancing measures during the pandemic. He often stated that he had not been vaccinated against the disease and would not do so.
He also dismissed the effectiveness of vaccines and spread fears about the possible side effects of immunization, going so far as to falsely associate the vaccine with the development of AIDS.
Bolsonaro was infected with COVID-19 in July 2020, nearly one year before the record of his first vaccine.

Rusak,"January 16, 2024 at 7:28 PM·4 min read",20240116,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/iowa-proves-haley-desantis-won-112800175.html,"Two of the most important tasks to win in politics are to make your opponent toxic to voters and make yourself palatable to them as the alternative. If you’re facing an incumbent, it has to happen in that order.
Donald Trump’s resounding victory in Iowa on Monday night proves that no Republican challenger could pull that off. Simply put, the other candidates — chiefly Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley — would not do what it took. So, neither will win.
Trump isn’t currently in office, but as a two-time nominee, he fits the role of incumbent in the Republican primary, at least. To have any chance, DeSantis and Haley needed to bloody him and then present themselves as the best remaining choice. There are many reasons they couldn’t, but the main one is a lack of will, daring and creativity.
Neither would forcefully make the case that Trump is bad for the party and the country. They wouldn’t say that his character flaws, legal liability and narcissism make him unlikely to achieve what Republicans want from the next president. Neither would make the case that he is a consistent loser and likely to fall short again. Neither gave the vast number of Republicans a reason to oppose Trump — so they don’t.
Incredibly, they repeated the mistake of the candidates who watched Trump rise up in 2016 and roll over experienced governors and senators. Each tried to focus on becoming the last standing rival to Trump, targeting one another while Trump simply rolled to victory. As recently as last week, DeSantis and Haley spent hours on a debate stage sniping over their records in Florida and South Carolina and comments from years back, all while ignoring the double-digit margins by which both trail the frontrunner.
It was beyond useless; it was counter-productive. When you look like you’re fighting for second place, you look small. And Americans don’t want a small president.
To be fair to DeSantis, Haley and every other candidate who tried to stop Trump, it’s unclear anything would have worked. There was a time, shortly after his loss in 2020 and his disgraceful behavior leading up to the Jan. 6 riot, when it seemed impossible Republicans would stick with him. When the party did poorly in the 2022 midterms — in many cases because of weak Trump-backed candidates and swing voters’ continuing disdain for him — an aggressive push might have knocked him off the pedestal.
But DeSantis waited and others ran in different lanes. Trump played the hits, and when Democratic officials across the country began bringing absurd legal cases no one else would have faced, such as the weak charges over hush-money payments to a former lover, Republicans saw a guy they still appreciated getting rolled over.
The other thing that has helped Trump is Joe Biden’s political weakness. Republicans no longer worry that Trump, who activates Democrats like no other, can’t beat BIden. It looks like any Republican could, so why not go with the one they love best?
Iowa is but one state. Haley could surprise in New Hampshire. Or maybe a second-place win gives DeSantis new life. Perhaps something on the legal front scares Republican voters before Super Tuesday, when Texas and other large states could deliver a decisive verdict.
But DeSantis sounded oddly triumphant Monday night, as if a 30-point loss was a great victory. He said not one word to persuade voters in New Hampshire that they should, in just a week, regard the race any differently. He gave no rationale for his candidacy over the guy who just demolished him.
Haley did a little better, comparing Trump to Biden in age, complicity in the national debt and grievance politics. “America deserves better,” she said. “We deserve a president who will focus on the needs of our people, not themselves.”
She added: “Our campaign is the last, best hope of stopping the Trump-Biden nightmare.”
Iowa, though, made crystal clear what has long been frustrating and obvious: Neither DeSantis nor Trump will pull the trigger on a real effort, no matter how long a shot it might be, to actually defeat Donald Trump. So, get ready for Trump vs. Biden … again.

More than 1,000 people have arrived in Finland over its eastern border with Russia in recent months.
The Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) accused Moscow of targeting some of those asylum seekers in a bid to turn them towards espionage.
“You can try to get a person to co-operate by different means, such as by pressuring them or tying the co-operation requirement to the conditions for leaving the country, or by promising, for example, financial benefits,” Supo said.
The agency told national broadcaster Yle it would not comment further because of ongoing secret operations.
But Supo added it was not a large-scale operation among those fleeing Vladimir Putin’s Russia for Finland.
Some 1,300 non-EU nationals, mainly from Syria, Somalia, Yemen and Iraq, have crossed the frontier since August.
Supo is involved in vetting the new arrivals in case any pose a threat to national security.
Relations between Helsinki and Moscow soured after Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine.
Finland ended decades of non-alignment to join Nato after the war began, which led Russia to warn of “countermeasures”.
Last year, Finnish ministers accused Russia of seeking to destabilise their country by weaponising migrants seeking to cross the 830-mile border between the two nations.
The Finnish border guard said in October that Moscow had allowed increasing numbers of migrants to reach its frontier without proper paperwork.
The tactic echoes one used by Putin’s close ally, Alexander Lukashenko, in 2021 and forms part of what Nordic countries have said is a hybrid war that Russia is waging against the EU and Nato.
The Belarusian president pushed tens of thousands of migrants towards the border with Poland in retaliation for sanctions.
In November, Finland closed its border with Russia for two weeks and made the same move again a month later in response to rising illegal immigration.
Earlier this month, Norway’s PST police intelligence service said some hostile countries were trying to recruit migrants entering Europe as spies.
Atle Tangen, head of PST counterintelligence, did not specifically accuse the Kremlin of recruiting people, but he did reference a 2015 influx into Norway via Russia.
“These were not intelligence agents in the traditional sense, but people who had been tricked or threatened by intelligence organisations into carrying out missions for them,” he said on a podcast run by the PST.
Norway shares a 120-mile border with Russia in the Arctic. In 2015, during a surge of refugees from Syria to Europe, the Scandinavian country took in thousands who entered from Russia.
Most crossed the border with bicycles given to them by Russian officials.

NL5HWGP8FB_9FVUN7ZQB302BJ2,Israel is accused of genocide at The Hague. But what happens next? Experts weigh in,Brendan Rascius,"January 13, 2024 at 5:25 AM·4 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-accused-genocide-hague-happens-212533713.html,"South Africa formally accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza and asked the International Court of Justice to order a suspension of hostilities, which have left tens of thousands of Palestinians dead, Gazan officials have said.
The case, which strikes at the heart of one of the world’s longest simmering conflicts, could result in serious legal and political ramifications for Israel and its allies, experts told McClatchy News.
But, while the court may soon issue provisional measures, the full case is likely to drag on for years.
South African officials filed its case with the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the U.N.’s top court established at The Hague, on Dec. 29, nearly three months into Israel’s war with Hamas.
“Acts and omissions by Israel,” South African officials said, “are genocidal in character, as they are committed with the requisite specific intent…to destroy Palestinians in Gaza...”
Both South Africa and Israel are party to the Convention Against Genocide, a treaty over which disagreements can be adjudicated by the ICJ, Ian Hurd, a political science professor at Northwestern University, told McClatchy News.
The treaty “requires all countries to prevent genocide and to prosecute anyone suspected of committing genocide (or organizing it, or attempting it, or conspiring over it),” Hurd said.
South African officials have requested that the court to take action soon and to issue provisional measures, which could require Israel to cease hostilities before the case is fully resolved, Robert Goldman, a professor of law at American University Washington College of Law, told McClatchy News.
“Think of them as very much like an injunction, where a court requires a party to do or not to do certain things, pending its decision on the merits,” Goldman said.
Requests for these measures are filed when a party believes “irreparable harm” will be committed without immediate action, Rebecca Hamilton, also a professor of law at American University Washington College of Law, told McClatchy News, adding that these cases are prioritized by the court.
Composed of a panel of 15 judges, the court held hearings on these measures on Jan. 11 and 12.
During these hearings, representatives for Israel argued that the country is “in a war it did not start and did not want” and that it is seeking to minimize civilian casualties, while Hamas attempts to maximize them.
Following the hearings, the court will either dismiss the case — an “improbable” possibility — or accept some or all of South Africa’s requested provisional measures, Goldman said.
“The most likely result, if the Court finds for South Africa, is that the Court would demand that Israel live up to its obligations under the treaty, specifically by stopping whatever acts it is committing that constitute genocide or conspiracy for genocide,” Hurd said.
This ruling would also likely include measures requiring unimpeded humanitarian relief to Gaza, whose population is already on the brink of starvation, Goldman said.
While the decision will be legally binding, the court does not have a police force or other enforcement mechanism, meaning Israel will not be forced to comply with any ruling that comes down, Hurd said.
However, “in the past, countries have a pretty good record of abiding by the decisions of the ICJ, even when the Court finds against them,” Hurd said.
Still, there have been instances when countries have disregarded ICJ rulings, Goldman said.
Russia, for example, ignored the Court’s March 2022 provisional measures to cease all military operations in Ukraine, undermining the court’s authority, Goldman said.
Looking farther back, the U.S., too, has a history of spurning the court’s orders. In 1979, when the U.S. brought a case against Iran over the taking of American hostages, the court ordered both parties to refrain from any actions that would alter the status quo.
“Nonetheless, President Carter, ordered what was the abortive attempt through military action to rescue the hostages,” Goldman said. “And that was in violation of the provisional order.”
If Israel adopts a similar playbook and disregards the court’s orders, it would not be without ramifications, though, Goldman said.
“This could create additional pressure if Israel is seen as violating provisional orders,” particularly for Israel’s allies, Goldman said. If the Biden Administration continued to support Israel, then the U.S. would “implicitly become complicit with that violation,” which would likely damage the president’s credibility.
Following a decision on provisional measures, the next phase of the process would deal with preliminary objections, Goldman said.
At this point, Israeli officials would offer a defense through written and oral proceedings, Goldman said. They could argue that the court does not have jurisdiction or that the country is engaged in a war of self-defense.
Then, if the court accepts that it has jurisdiction, it would decide on the merits of the dispute, namely whether Israel has committed genocide or not.
This process will take years, Goldman said, noting that the ICJ has never before ruled that a state has engaged in the crime of genocide.
However, if the court does break with precedent and rules against Israel, it could order that reparations be made to victims, Hamilton said.

Nauru, a tiny Micronesian island, was just one of 12 countries that kept diplomatic ties with Taipei.
But in recent years, Beijing - which insists Taiwan is part of China - has been poaching its diplomatic allies.
Taiwan suggests this latest loss is related to the weekend's election results, which angered China.
The election saw voters pick pro-sovereignty candidate William Lai as their next president, a man Beijing has labelled a ""troublemaker"" over remarks he made in the past supporting Taiwanese independence, which it sees as a red line.
""This timing is not only China's retaliation against our democratic elections but also a direct challenge to the international order,"" Taiwanese officials said after Nauru's government announced it would ""no longer recognise [Taiwan] as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China's territory"".
How China is poaching Taiwan's friends
Taiwan elects pro-sovereignty leader, angering Beijing
In a media conference on Monday, Taipei's deputy foreign minister Tien Chung-kwang accused China of taking advantage of recent ""political fluctuations"" in Nauru to ""buy over"" the country with financial aid.
""China thinks it can suppress Taiwan with such methods, I think it is wrong. The world has noticed Taiwan's democratic development. If [Beijing] continues to use such despicable methods to seize Taiwan's diplomatic relations, democratic countries all over the world will not recognise it,"" Mr Tien said.
Still, his ministry remains ""on strong alert"" to combat further moves from China to isolate Taiwan on an international stage, he said.
China - which sees the self-ruled island of 23 million as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - welcomed Nauru's decision.
""The decision of the government of Nauru to resume diplomatic relations with China fully demonstrates once again that the one-China principle is the will of the people and the trend of the times,"" China's foreign ministry said.
This is not the first time Nauru has cut ties with Taiwan, which considers itself distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically elected leaders.
In 2002, Nauru made a similar diplomatic switch to China - it later restored relations with Taiwan in May 2005.
Analysts said the move by Nauru was not unexpected.
""The likelihood that Nauru would switch recognition from Taiwan to China has been on the cards for a while,"" said Anna Powles, associate professor in security studies at New Zealand's Massey University.
The speed at which Australia pursued a treaty offering climate refuge to Tuvalu citizens late last year reflected concerns that Tuvalu, another Pacific nation, was ""under pressure to switch recognition to China"", Ms Powles said.
""These concerns extended to Nauru,"" she said.
""China is always looking to erode Taiwan's influence, especially in the Pacific, where many small nations are looking for development gains,"" said Mihai Sora, a research fellow in the Pacific Islands Program at Lowy Institute, a think tank based in Australia.
""As Taiwan has fewer diplomatic allies around the world, each one becomes more important in its claim to sovereignty... And it is quite possible that China will continue to look for opportunities to erode that."""

Flat terrain and lots of drones mean defenders see the tanks coming, an expert told BI.
Ukraine stopped attempting such attacks, while Russia persisted despite frequent defeats.
Neither Russia nor Ukraine has been able to pull off successful tank assaults — and there is a clear reason.
The flat terrain and number of drones in the sky make it too hard to surprise the other side, an expert told Business Insider.
Riley Bailey, a Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War think tank, said the attacks were unlikely to work without surprise.
""A lot of mechanized maneuver warfare on some level rests upon surprise on being able to rapidly advance and catch your enemy off guard,"" he said.
""By all indications, along the current front line, that's not really possible.""
One reason is the flat landscape in eastern and southern Ukraine — there is nowhere to conceal columns of armored vehicles.
In some areas ""it's all flat and you can see anyone coming from kilometers away,"" Bailey said.
Another reason is that there are so many drones in the sky.
Both Russia and Ukraine are relying heavily on both surveillance and attack drones, with soldiers describing skies full of them during some battles.
Surveillance drones are used to watch the enemy, and often provide targeting data for artillery and other long-range weapons.
The attack drones are weapons themselves, which have in some cases damaged and disabled armored vehicles and tanks.
Both Russia and Ukraine have experienced losses when trying to use columns of tanks and armored vehicles.
But Russia has experienced it on a much wider scale, repeatedly seeing big losses, while Ukraine pivoted away from the strategy much faster, Bailey said.
Russian tank defeats took place in Bucha in 2022, in Vuhledar in early 2023, and repeatedly in the eastern town of Avdiivka around the end of 2023.
Russia and Ukraine are still fighting for Avdiivka, which has become one of the war's hot spots.
Russia's losses there included 44 tanks in a single day, according to Ukraine. US intelligence said in December that Russia had lost more than 220 tanks and 13,000 men at Avdiivka since it launched an offensive there in October.
Ukraine, meanwhile, saw big vehicle losses at the start of its counteroffensive in the summer, but it changed tactics quickly, Bailey said. No reports of any mass Ukrainian tank and vehicle losses have emerged since.
The lack of any vehicle and tank breakthroughs, and the difficulty both sides have with trying to surprise each other, has contributed to the grinding nature of the battle, where neither side is making any big breakthroughs.
Heavy defenses laid by Russia, including minefields, have also helped keep the battlefield static. Ukraine says its allies are not sending the weapons it needs to achieve a breakthrough.

NRPKBE8NHY_9AMARR85LHU6H02,Christians adapt to conflict on Israel-Lebanon frontier,Joseph Boyle,"January 19, 2024 at 11:36 PM·4 min read",20240119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/christians-adapt-conflict-israel-lebanon-153643321.html,"The SUVs roll to a halt, the pupils run from the room and hop in, the parents speed away -- just like a normal school run, only this was in a bomb shelter.
It's been this way in Jish, an Israeli village with a majority Christian population a stone's throw from the Lebanon border, since the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.
Israel's retaliatory strikes and ground invasion of Gaza prompted Lebanese Hezbollah to fire repeatedly at Israel.
Locals have endured three months of thudding artillery, thrumming drones and wailing sirens, while Israel launches daily strikes on southern Lebanon.
School buildings are shut and teaching is now online or in public shelters.
""Studying in the shelter is terribly difficult for the children,"" said 75-year-old Margaret Ashur, there to grab her grandson.
Ashur has lived in Jish all her life and said she cannot remember a time like this.
At least 190 people have been killed in Lebanon during in the latest violence including more than 140 Hezbollah fighters, according to an AFP tally.
In northern Israel, nine soldiers and six civilians have been killed, according to Israeli authorities.
The military action is not nearly as intense as in Gaza, nor the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, though this is of little comfort to Jish residents.
""The community is still here,"" said Shadi Khalloul, who runs the Israeli Christian Aramaic NGO, a group who pushes the rights of Maronites.
""They will not go and leave their own towns just because Hezbollah decided to attack Israel,"" he added.
The border area has been largely emptied of its residents, but Jish sits just outside the evacuation zone declared by Israeli authorities.
- 'Peace will reign' -
The village has ground to a halt -- large gatherings and events are banned because of the risk -- and the church is about the only place left to go.
""Since the war began, we've stopped praying in our big church,"" said Father Sandy Habib.
Over Christmas, a rocket hit a church just a few kilometres (miles) from Jish where services are now held in a meeting room below the main building.
Habib's church has rolled back community programmes and activities for children, but Habib said it was vital to keep daily services going.
""It gives people hope that peace will come and peace will reign, that's why we're praying,"" he said.
The Maronites are largely based in Lebanon with only a few thousand in Israel.
They make up half the population of Jish, a higgledy-piggledy village of roughly 3,000 people whose houses and churches cling to a hillside dotted with olive groves.
Khalloul, 48, has spent years campaigning for greater recognition in Israel, including successfully getting Maronites their own legal designation.
He also promoted teaching Aramaic, the language spoken by Jesus.
But like everyone else, his work has stalled over the past three months.
- Fears of militants attacking -
Jish is steeped in religious history, changing hands between Jewish, Muslim and Christian populations over the centuries.
Many of the Maronites in the village, including Khalloul's family, were forced from their homes in nearby villages during the war which accompanied the 1948 creation of Israel.
Israeli authorities said they would be allowed to return home within weeks, but the military razed it and the families of former residents have been banned from going back.
Despite this, Khalloul served in the Israeli military and encourages young Maronites to enlist.
He wants to see the fight ramped up against the Islamist enemies he sees ganging up against Israel across the region.
""We saw what Hamas did and they're a proxy of Iran,"" like Hezbollah, Khalloul said.
""Here on the border the fear is of an incursion by elite units of Hezbollah, who will do atrocities against us just as was done in the south to the Jewish people,"" he added.
The October 7 attack by Hamas militants resulted in the deaths of about 1,140 people in Israel, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas in response. Its relentless air and ground offensive has killed at least 24,620 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry.

Diplomat Alounkeo Kittikhoun faces the tough challenge of promoting the regional group’s peace plan for Myanmar to quell the violence between the military government, which seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, and an armed pro-democracy resistance movement that is assisted by ethnic minority fighting forces.
Almost 2 million people have been displaced by years of fighting in Myanmar, according to the U.N., and the 10-member ASEAN regional grouping is concerned that the destabilization could have regional consequences, including generating large numbers of refugees. Neither the military government nor its pro-democracy government foes have shown any inclination to compromise.
Alounkeo's visit comes just ahead of a meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers scheduled for Jan. 28-29 in Luang Prabang, the old capital of Laos. It is the turn this year of Laos to act as chair of the bloc, which includes Myanmar.
ASEAN has been seeking to implement a five-point consensus it reached on Myanmar just a few months after the army’s takeover. It called for the immediate cessation of violence, a dialogue among all concerned parties, mediation by an ASEAN special envoy, provision of humanitarian aid through ASEAN channels, and a visit to Myanmar by the special envoy to meet all concerned parties.
MRTV reported that Alounkeo's meetings included discussions about the implementation of the five-point consensus, the military government's efforts at providing humanitarian assistance and plans for the military’s promised election. Bilateral relations and Laos' role as ASEAN chair were also discussed, it said.
Myanmar’s military government initially agreed to the consensus but has since made little effort to implement it, even as the country has slipped into a situation that U.N. experts have characterized as a civil war. Its stonewalling led fellow ASEAN members to block key leaders of the military government from attending major meetings of the regional grouping.
Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, all electoral democracies, are known to have taken a strong stand against any engagement that could be perceived as favoring the Myanmar’s generals’ claims to be the country’s legitimate leaders. Authoritarian nations such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos are less critical of the ruling generals, as is Thailand, whose military retains strong influence over security matters.
Some members of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement — Signatories, Ethnic Armed Organizations, a group established nine years ago to pursue ways of ending decades of armed conflict with the military, also held a meeting with Alounkeo.
MRTV reported they also discussed the five-point consensus and humanitarian assistance. However, since none of the seven groups that attended are currently at war with the military, the relevance of their participation for peacemaking appeared to be minimal.
It was not immediately known if Alounkeo would meet with Suu Kyi, who was arrested when the military seized power. The 78-year-old Suu Kyi is now serving a 27-year prison term in Naypyitaw after being convicted in a series of politically tinged prosecutions brought by the military.
The military government has refused to allow her to meet with any previous ASEAN special envoys, who came in turn from Brunei, Cambodia and Indonesia.
Alounkeo, 72, is a former minister in Laos' prime minister’s office and has also served as his country’s ambassador at the United Nations."

Connor Fitzgerald Bowman, 30, was indicted last week on one count of first-degree murder – premeditated and one count of second-degree murder with intent for the August 2023 death of Betty Bowman, 32.
The Olmstead County Attorney’s Office said if Bowman is convicted on the first-degree murder charge, he would automatically be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. “The Grand Jury found probable cause that Mr. Bowman intentionally and with premeditation was responsible for her death,” County Attorney Mark Ostrem said in a statement.
Bowman was arrested on October 20 and initially charged with second-degree murder. The criminal complaint said that Betty Bowman, who worked for the Mayo Clinic, died from “the toxic effect of colchicine,” a medicine primarily used to treat gout. There was nothing in Betty Bowman’s medical record to indicate she was ever prescribed colchicine or diagnosed with gout, investigators said.
The complaint says Connor Bowman, who had completed a residency at the Mayo Clinic, had researched colchicine online. Bowman had worked as a poison control specialist, but his employer, the University of Kansas, told investigators his work did not require any research of colchicine.
On August 5, 2023, Connor Bowman made internet searches including “internet browsing history: can it be used in court?” and “Police track package delivery,” the criminal complaint states.
Betty Bowman went to a hospital in Rochester on August 16, 2023, “with severe gastrointestinal distress and dehydration where her condition deteriorated rapidly,” the criminal complaint states.
“Victim experienced cardiac issues, fluid in her lungs, and eventually organ failure. Victim was taken in for surgery to remove a portion of her colon after it was discovered it contained necrotic tissue,” the court document says.
Connor Bowman appeared in court Friday and did not enter a plea. His arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday.
Jail records show he remained incarcerated Wednesday in lieu of $2 million bail with conditions, or $5 million bail for unconditional release. CNN reached out to Bowman’s attorney Wednesday for comment.

The electric vehicle maker said in a statement Thursday night that its factory near Berlin, which makes Model Y vehicles and batteries, will pause from Jan. 29 to Feb. 11.
It’s a fresh sign of how the hostilities in the Mideast are disrupting global manufacturing supply chains, with shipping companies reporting that they’re being forced to reroute vessels carrying goods and components on the longer route around the southern tip of Africa. Analysts say the detour adds 10 days or more to the journey.
“The armed conflicts in the Red Sea and the associated shifts in transport routes between Europe and Asia via the Cape of Good Hope are also affecting production in Grünheide,"" Tesla said. “The significantly longer transport times create a gap in the supply chains.”
The U.S. led airstrikes on Thursday against Yemen's Houthi rebels in response to their attacks on Red Sea shipping,
Tesla said normal operations are expected to resume on Feb. 12. The factory in Grünheide, southeast of Berlin, is Tesla's first in Europe. It opened in 2022 and employs 11,000 workers.

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) -China and Taiwan's largest opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), warned on Thursday of the danger Taiwan's ruling party presidential candidate Lai Ching-te could pose to peace if he wins election this weekend.
Taiwan will hold a pivotal presidential and parliamentary election on Saturday, which is being closely watched internationally amid geopolitical tensions. China claims Taiwan as its own territory, to the objections of Taiwan's government.
China has not publicly named a preferred candidate or specified what the right choice is, but has framed the vote as a decision between war and peace.
China and the KMT have said the Democratic Progressive Party's Lai is a dangerous supporter of the island's formal independence. Lai has repeatedly offered talks with China but has been rebuffed.
He says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement that Lai is an ""obstinate Taiwan independence worker"" and that if he came to power he would further promote separatist activities.
""I sincerely hope the majority of Taiwan compatriots recognise the extreme harm of the DPP's 'Taiwan independence' line and the extreme danger of Lai Ching-te's triggering of cross-Strait confrontation and conflict, and to make the right choice at the crossroads of cross-Strait relations,"" it said.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry responded by condemning China for ""once again blatantly intimidating the Taiwanese people and the international community"" and seeking to affect the election.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control and has during the past four years stepped up military activity around the island, regularly sending warplanes and warships into the Taiwan Strait.
The KMT, which traditionally favours closer ties with China but denies being pro-Beijing, has also denounced Lai as an independence supporter.
Speaking to foreign reporters in Taipei's sister city, New Taipei, on Thursday, KMT vice presidential candidate Jaw Shaw-kong said that if Lai won, tensions would most likely rise even before May 20, when President Tsai Ing-wen hands over power to her successor.
""Tsai Ing-wen is more low key, not shouting every day about 'I'm for Taiwan independence' and the Taiwan Strait is already so tense. If Lai Ching-te wins, do you think the cross-strait situation will be better than it is now?""
Lai's campaign team said Jaw was aligning with China's interests and parroting its positions, as well as ""spreading fear of war"".
""All Jaw Shaw-kong is thinking about is unification"" with China, said DPP spokesperson Tai Wei-shan.
Speaking at a Thursday evening rally that drew more than 200,000 supporters, Lai said Taiwan was already a fortress of democracy and freedom, and that people should choose the right person and the right democratic path.
""Peace depends on strength. It is not based on the goodwill of the aggressor,"" he told the cheering crowds. He also promised to ""maintain the status quo without being humble or arrogant, to protect the country's survival and development.""
Lai has previously said he does not seek to change Taiwan's formal name, the Republic of China. The republican government fled to the island in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's Communists, who established the People's Republic of China.
The DPP has portrayed the KMT and its presidential candidate, Hou Yu-ih, as pro-Beijing.
Hou, sitting next to Jaw, said he wouldn't touch the issue of ""unification"" with China during his term in office if elected, while maintaining the status quo and encouraging communication with China but also opposing the ""one country, two systems"" autonomy model Beijing has offered to Taiwan.
""I firmly uphold Taiwan's democratic and free system; this is the middle path that Taiwan should take,"" Hou said, pledging to ensure strong defences to give China pause if it were considering an attack. ""When the Taiwan Strait is stable, Taiwan is safe, and the world can be at ease.""

O9EBBJ8L4S_JJC8TQ8MIZVQ1VW,"Abandoning Ukraine will embolden Iran, Sunak warns",Benedict Smith,"January 13, 2024 at 2:52 AM·15 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/abandoning-ukraine-embolden-iran-sunak-151720952.html,"Abandoning Ukraine will only embolden Vladimir Putin’s allies such as Iran and North Korea, Rishi Sunak warned on Friday.
Arriving for a surprise visit to Kyiv, the Prime Minister announced Britain’s military funding to Ukraine would be increased to £2.5 billion and signed a new security pact, the first step in a “100-year partnership”.
“Our actions right now will determine the future path of the war,” Mr Sunak said, at a time when support packages from Washington and Brussels are snarled up in political bickering.
“If Putin wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there. And our opponents around the world believe that we have neither the patience nor resources for long wars. So waver now, and we embolden not just Putin but his allies in North Korea, Iran and elsewhere.”
The military support promised by Britain is its largest annual package of artillery ammunition, air defence missiles and military training.
It includes an extra £200 million worth of drones, most of which will be manufactured in the UK, to support Volodymyr Zelensky’s drive to procure one million extra UAVs this year.
While in Ukraine, Mr Sunak signed off on a 10-year security package for the war-torn nations, becoming the first G7 leader to deliver on the deals promised at a Nato summit last year.
The 16-page document promises a “swift and sustained” response if Russia attacks again in the future.
It also pledges Britain’s future role in using its expertise to develop Kyiv’s navy after a series of successes in pushing Russia’s fleet out of the Black Sea, a move first reported by the Telegraph last month.
It read: “The UK will jointly lead the Maritime Security Capability Coalition and will make significant contributions to Ukraine’s maritime fleet development.”
Britain hopes that the promise will transform Ukraine into a “net contributor” to security in both the Black Sea and Sea of Azov by the end of the 10-year deal.
It will also further formalise intelligence sharing, cyber security, military training and defence-industrial co-operation.
Mr Zelensky praised Mr Sunak for his “personal leadership” in supporting the war-torn nation’s armed struggle against the Russian invasion, awarding the Prime Minister with the Ukrainian Order of Freedom.
The Ukrainian president added: “Today marks a watershed moment in European history. Ukraine and the United Kingdom signed a new, unprecedented security agreement.
“This is not simply a declaration. This is a reality that will come to fruition as a result of our cooperation, including security commitments from a major global power, the United Kingdom.”
More than 30 nations are seeking to replicate Britain’s long-term promise to support Kyiv in the wake of it not being offered Nato membership last summer and access to the alliance’s iron-clad mutual defence clause – Article 5.
The announcement was designed to maintain pressure on both the US and European Union to continue providing aid for Ukraine.
Joe Biden, the US president, was said to be watching closely as he works to secure backing from Congress for a $61 billion (£47.8 billion) support package, which is being blocked by Republican lawmakers.
He hopes the signing of the UK-Ukraine will focus minds in Washington, sources from his administration said.
The EU is also working to find secure backing for its own €50 billion (£52.4 billion) aid package for Kyiv, which was blocked by Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, at a summit in Brussels last month.
On his one-day visit to Kyiv, the Prime Minister visited an apartment block that was recently hit by debris in a Russian missile attack on the capital, meeting emergency workers who hauled survivors out of the rubble. Three people were killed, 50 hospitalised and 400 made homeless in the strike.
He also joined Mr Zelensky at a military hospital in the capital to award Order of Courage medals to soldiers injured on the front lines.
Downing Street will hope the visit cements Britain’s position as one of Ukraine’s most ardent backers, having donated £2.3 billion in military support in the first two years of conflict.
Mr Sunak was also the first world leader to sign off on shipments of modern main battle tanks and long-range missiles.
But the UK has slipped down to Europe’s second-largest backer for Kyiv, with Germany promising to deliver €8 billion in weaponry this year.
Thanks for following our live coverage of developments in Ukraine, as Rishi Sunak made a surprise visit to Kyiv to announce a £2.5bn aid package. We’ll be back on Monday with all the latest news.
Rishi Sunak has urged other countries to follow Britain’s lead and provide support to Ukraine as an “investment in our own collective security”.
He said: “For the free nations of the world, aid to Ukraine is also an investment in our own collective security.
“Because if Putin wins in Ukraine he will not stop there and our opponents around the world believe we have neither the patience nor resources for long wars.
“So waver now and we embolden not just Putin but his allies in North Korea, Iran and elsewhere.
“That’s why the United Kingdom and the free world will continue to stand with Ukraine as we have since the beginning of this war.”
Aid from the US has dried up amid resistance from Congress, while a European support package was vetoed by the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Volodymyr Zelensky has awarded Rishi Sunak with the state order of Ukraine as he thanked his “dear friend” for supporting Ukraine.
He said: “I’d like to thank the whole of the UK all of its citizens all of its people, I’d like to thank everyone who believed that life and justice have to prevail.
“The UK really ranks first, for it has ranked first throughout history in many respects... I’d like to present the state order of Ukraine, the order of freedom, I’d like to present it to Rishi, my dear friend.
Ukraine’s independence from Russia would have been guaranteed if countries had brought in security agreements earlier, Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
Speaking at a joint press conference with Rishi Sunak, the Ukrainian President said: “Today the history of Europe changed and Ukraine and the UK have entered into a new unprecedented security agreement.
“This is a reality that will come to life thanks to our cooperation, thanks to security guarantees from a prominent global force: Great Britain.
“If this level of guarantees would be guaranteed after 1991 with the UK and the other countries there would not be Russian aggression.
Addressing Mr Sunak directly, he added: “Rishi, dear prime minister, thank you for your personal leadership... we reached a new level of relations between our countries.”
Volodymyr Zelensky has described the security agreement announced by Rishi Sunak as “unprecedented” and says it will continue until Ukraine joins Nato.
The pact sets out the intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training that Britain will provide for Ukraine, along with a pledge to lend “swift” support in the event of another Russian invasion.
Russian assaults on the left bank of the Dnipro River are dropping in intensity while Ukraine targets enemy artillery, according to reports.
A spokeswoman for Ukraine’s southern defence forces said three enemy assaults were recorded yesterday, compared to 10-12 attempts previously.
Kyiv established a bridgehead on the left bank in November. Britain’s defence ministry has suggested Moscow was forced to cancel planned offensives after losing fighter jets that left it without air support.

Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has hit out at Britain, “our eternal enemies”, after Rishi Sunak announced a multi-billion-pound support package for Kyiv.
He wrote on Telegram: “How would the Western public react to the fact that the British delegation came under fire from cluster munitions in the centre of Kyiv, as happened to the civilians of our Belgorod.
“And one more thing: I hope that our eternal enemies, the arrogant British, understand that the deployment of their official military contingent in Ukraine will mean a declaration of war on our country”.
Rishi Sunak is making a surprise visit to Ukraine today to meet with Volodymyr Zelensky after unveiling a £2.5bn military aid package for Ukraine.
The Prime Minister pledged to stand with Ukraine in its “darkest hour” after Mr Zelensky urged western nations to maintain support as the war drags towards its second anniversary.
Britain will provide £2.5bn 2024-25, an increase of £200m from the previous two years, supplying drones, long-range missiles, air defences and artillery shells.
Mr Sunak said: “For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy.
“I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine, in their darkest hours and in the better times to come.”
The UK has proved its “unwavering” support of Ukraine’s fightback against Russia with a £2.5 billion in military aid package, Grant Shapps has said.
In a post Twitter, the Defence Secretary said: “We said our support would be unwavering and today we’ve proved it.
“Putin hoped the West would be distracted by events in the Middle East but today we’ve taken the critical step to increase our military support to Ukraine, to get them more of what they need to win.”
Rishi Sunak has arrived in Kyiv, according to Ukrainian state broadcaster Suspilne. It has published a picture of the Prime Minister disembarking from a train.
Authoritarian countries including Russia, China and Rwanda have been “emboldened” by the West’s weak stance on human rights abuses, a new major report has warned.
Britain and its allies are “picking and choosing” which injustices to challenge and refraining from criticising certain offenders to avoid disrupting diplomatic relations, said Human Rights Watch (HRW) in its annual, 735-page report.
This includes silence on the disappearance of Rwanda’s political opponents, India’s increasingly transnational repression of critics, or a reluctance to upset countries such as Libya, Turkey and Mexico.
These nations are considered vital migration and trade partners for Britain, the European Union and the United States.

Ukraine desperately needs US funding as Russia ramps up its attacks and bombards regions with North Korean missiles, the White House has said.
John Kirby, the White House national security council coordinator, told reporters: “It’s critical that Congress move on that national security supplemental request and we get more funding.
“The assistance that we provided has now ground to a halt.  The attacks that the Russians are conducting are only increasing.
“And now, as I talked about earlier this week, they’re using North Korean ballistic missiles to do their dirty work. So the need is acute right now, particularly in these winter months.”
James Heappey, the armed forces minister, has said there will be “no loss in patience” among Ukraine’s allies as he was questioned why the Government had not provided a longrunning support package.
Ministers and senior military figures are reported to have urged the Government to commit to a military aid running over several years. The £2.5bn in support announced today will provide Kyiv with air defences, artillery shells and drones for the next year.
Mr Heappey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There is £2.5 billion that effectively is the funding for tactical activity in this next year, follows £2.3 billion last year and the £2.3 billion the year before.
“These capability coalitions, there are a number of them led by different countries, but the ones that the UK are leading is principally in the maritime domain.
“They are exactly the multi-year capability development programmes that give the Ukrainians that certainty around the development of their capabilities over the arc of a decade, and equally importantly, give [Vladimir] Putin the certainty that there is no loss in patience and commitment from their [Ukraine’s] Western supporters.”
John Healey has backed the Government’s military aid package and pledged there would be “no change in Britain’s resolve to stand with Ukraine” if Labour took office.
The shadow defence secretary wrote on Twitter:
This is vital support for Kyiv's fight against Putin's illegal invasion. There may be a change in government to Labour this year, but there will be no change in Britain's resolve to stand with Ukraine, confront Russian aggression and pursue Putin for his war crimes. 2/2

Freezing conditions across the frontline as the Ukrainian winter takes hold will create “favourable terrain” as Russia attempts to gain ground near Kupyansk, a think tank has said.
The Institute for the Study of War cites Ukrainian officials who say Moscow is concentrating armoured units around the Kharkiv settlement, including the 47th and 4th Tank Divisions.
“Freezing temperatures in Ukraine are likely constraining operations along the front but will likely create more favorable terrain for mechanised manoeuvre warfare as the ground freezes in the coming weeks,” it said.
The EU is preparing to bow to some of Viktor Orban’s demands to secure a €50bn support package for Ukraine, according to reports.
The Hungarian prime minister vetoed the military aid package on November, depriving Kyiv of key supplies amid a stalemate in the US Congress that has seen Washington’s support dry.
In a bid to convince him to drop his opposition, the European Commission is open to giving Mr Orban an opportunity to stop the four-year deal in 2025, three officials told the Financial Times.
Rishi Sunak will sign a security agreement later today guaranteeing will provide “swift and sustained” support from Britain if Russia attempts another invasion.
It will also set out the intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training that the UK will provide for Ukraine, along with cooperation between their defence industries.
The agreement is the result of last year’s Nato summit in Vilnius, and the “first step in developing an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the United Kingdom”.
Some £200m of the aid package is being spent on providing thousands of drones – the “largest delivery of drones to Ukraine from any nation”, according to a government statement.
This will include surveillance, long-range strike and sea drones, which will predominantly be manufactured in the UK.
“The technology will give Ukraine cutting edge, battle-tested capabilities to defend their citizens and target the invading Russian forces on land and sea,” the statement continues.
The rest of the package will be made up of long-range missiles, air defences – something Kyiv has been appealing for amid Russian airstrikes – artillery ammunition and “maritime security”.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said:
“For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion.
“They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy.
“I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine, in their darkest hours and in the better times to come.
“The UK is already one of Ukraine’s closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security.
“Today we are going further - increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones, and signing a historic new Security Agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term.”

“Our actions right now will determine the future path of the war,” Mr Sunak said, at a time when support packages from Washington and Brussels are snarled up in political bickering.
“If Putin wins in Ukraine, he will not stop there. And our opponents around the world believe that we have neither the patience nor resources for long wars. So waver now, and we embolden not just Putin but his allies in North Korea, Iran and elsewhere.”
The military support promised by Britain is its largest annual package of artillery ammunition, air defence missiles and military training.
It includes an extra £200 million worth of drones, most of which will be manufactured in the UK, to support Volodymyr Zelensky’s drive to procure one million extra UAVs this year.
While in Ukraine, Mr Sunak signed off on a 10-year security package for the war-torn nations, becoming the first G7 leader to deliver on the deals promised at a Nato summit last year.
The 16-page document promises a “swift and sustained” response if Russia attacks again in the future.
It also pledges Britain’s future role in using its expertise to develop Kyiv’s navy after a series of successes in pushing Russia’s fleet out of the Black Sea, a move first reported by the Telegraph last month.
It read: “The UK will jointly lead the Maritime Security Capability Coalition and will make significant contributions to Ukraine’s maritime fleet development.”
Britain hopes that the promise will transform Ukraine into a “net contributor” to security in both the Black Sea and Sea of Azov by the end of the 10-year deal.
It will also further formalise intelligence sharing, cyber security, military training and defence-industrial co-operation.
Mr Zelensky praised Mr Sunak for his “personal leadership” in supporting the war-torn nation’s armed struggle against the Russian invasion, awarding the Prime Minister with the Ukrainian Order of Freedom.
The Ukrainian president added: “Today marks a watershed moment in European history. Ukraine and the United Kingdom signed a new, unprecedented security agreement.
“This is not simply a declaration. This is a reality that will come to fruition as a result of our cooperation, including security commitments from a major global power, the United Kingdom.”
More than 30 nations are seeking to replicate Britain’s long-term promise to support Kyiv in the wake of it not being offered Nato membership last summer and access to the alliance’s iron-clad mutual defence clause – Article 5.
The announcement was designed to maintain pressure on both the US and European Union to continue providing aid for Ukraine.
Joe Biden, the US president, was said to be watching closely as he works to secure backing from Congress for a $61 billion (£47.8 billion) support package, which is being blocked by Republican lawmakers.
He hopes the signing of the UK-Ukraine will focus minds in Washington, sources from his administration said.
The EU is also working to find secure backing for its own €50 billion (£52.4 billion) aid package for Kyiv, which was blocked by Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister, at a summit in Brussels last month.
On his one-day visit to Kyiv, the Prime Minister visited an apartment block that was recently hit by debris in a Russian missile attack on the capital, meeting emergency workers who hauled survivors out of the rubble. Three people were killed, 50 hospitalised and 400 made homeless in the strike.
He also joined Mr Zelensky at a military hospital in the capital to award Order of Courage medals to soldiers injured on the front lines.
Downing Street will hope the visit cements Britain’s position as one of Ukraine’s most ardent backers, having donated £2.3 billion in military support in the first two years of conflict.
Mr Sunak was also the first world leader to sign off on shipments of modern main battle tanks and long-range missiles.
But the UK has slipped down to Europe’s second-largest backer for Kyiv, with Germany promising to deliver €8 billion in weaponry this year.
Thanks for following our live coverage of developments in Ukraine, as Rishi Sunak made a surprise visit to Kyiv to announce a £2.5bn aid package. We’ll be back on Monday with all the latest news.
Rishi Sunak has urged other countries to follow Britain’s lead and provide support to Ukraine as an “investment in our own collective security”.
He said: “For the free nations of the world, aid to Ukraine is also an investment in our own collective security.
“Because if Putin wins in Ukraine he will not stop there and our opponents around the world believe we have neither the patience nor resources for long wars.
“So waver now and we embolden not just Putin but his allies in North Korea, Iran and elsewhere.
“That’s why the United Kingdom and the free world will continue to stand with Ukraine as we have since the beginning of this war.”
Aid from the US has dried up amid resistance from Congress, while a European support package was vetoed by the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Volodymyr Zelensky has awarded Rishi Sunak with the state order of Ukraine as he thanked his “dear friend” for supporting Ukraine.
He said: “I’d like to thank the whole of the UK all of its citizens all of its people, I’d like to thank everyone who believed that life and justice have to prevail.
“The UK really ranks first, for it has ranked first throughout history in many respects... I’d like to present the state order of Ukraine, the order of freedom, I’d like to present it to Rishi, my dear friend.
Ukraine’s independence from Russia would have been guaranteed if countries had brought in security agreements earlier, Volodymyr Zelensky has said.
Speaking at a joint press conference with Rishi Sunak, the Ukrainian President said: “Today the history of Europe changed and Ukraine and the UK have entered into a new unprecedented security agreement.
“This is a reality that will come to life thanks to our cooperation, thanks to security guarantees from a prominent global force: Great Britain.
“If this level of guarantees would be guaranteed after 1991 with the UK and the other countries there would not be Russian aggression.
Addressing Mr Sunak directly, he added: “Rishi, dear prime minister, thank you for your personal leadership... we reached a new level of relations between our countries.”
Volodymyr Zelensky has described the security agreement announced by Rishi Sunak as “unprecedented” and says it will continue until Ukraine joins Nato.
The pact sets out the intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training that Britain will provide for Ukraine, along with a pledge to lend “swift” support in the event of another Russian invasion.
Russian assaults on the left bank of the Dnipro River are dropping in intensity while Ukraine targets enemy artillery, according to reports.
A spokeswoman for Ukraine’s southern defence forces said three enemy assaults were recorded yesterday, compared to 10-12 attempts previously.
Kyiv established a bridgehead on the left bank in November. Britain’s defence ministry has suggested Moscow was forced to cancel planned offensives after losing fighter jets that left it without air support.

Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has hit out at Britain, “our eternal enemies”, after Rishi Sunak announced a multi-billion-pound support package for Kyiv.
He wrote on Telegram: “How would the Western public react to the fact that the British delegation came under fire from cluster munitions in the centre of Kyiv, as happened to the civilians of our Belgorod.
“And one more thing: I hope that our eternal enemies, the arrogant British, understand that the deployment of their official military contingent in Ukraine will mean a declaration of war on our country”.
Rishi Sunak is making a surprise visit to Ukraine today to meet with Volodymyr Zelensky after unveiling a £2.5bn military aid package for Ukraine.
The Prime Minister pledged to stand with Ukraine in its “darkest hour” after Mr Zelensky urged western nations to maintain support as the war drags towards its second anniversary.
Britain will provide £2.5bn 2024-25, an increase of £200m from the previous two years, supplying drones, long-range missiles, air defences and artillery shells.
Mr Sunak said: “For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion. They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy.
“I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine, in their darkest hours and in the better times to come.”
The UK has proved its “unwavering” support of Ukraine’s fightback against Russia with a £2.5 billion in military aid package, Grant Shapps has said.
In a post Twitter, the Defence Secretary said: “We said our support would be unwavering and today we’ve proved it.
“Putin hoped the West would be distracted by events in the Middle East but today we’ve taken the critical step to increase our military support to Ukraine, to get them more of what they need to win.”
Rishi Sunak has arrived in Kyiv, according to Ukrainian state broadcaster Suspilne. It has published a picture of the Prime Minister disembarking from a train.
Authoritarian countries including Russia, China and Rwanda have been “emboldened” by the West’s weak stance on human rights abuses, a new major report has warned.
Britain and its allies are “picking and choosing” which injustices to challenge and refraining from criticising certain offenders to avoid disrupting diplomatic relations, said Human Rights Watch (HRW) in its annual, 735-page report.
This includes silence on the disappearance of Rwanda’s political opponents, India’s increasingly transnational repression of critics, or a reluctance to upset countries such as Libya, Turkey and Mexico.
These nations are considered vital migration and trade partners for Britain, the European Union and the United States.

Ukraine desperately needs US funding as Russia ramps up its attacks and bombards regions with North Korean missiles, the White House has said.
John Kirby, the White House national security council coordinator, told reporters: “It’s critical that Congress move on that national security supplemental request and we get more funding.
“The assistance that we provided has now ground to a halt.  The attacks that the Russians are conducting are only increasing.
“And now, as I talked about earlier this week, they’re using North Korean ballistic missiles to do their dirty work. So the need is acute right now, particularly in these winter months.”
James Heappey, the armed forces minister, has said there will be “no loss in patience” among Ukraine’s allies as he was questioned why the Government had not provided a longrunning support package.
Ministers and senior military figures are reported to have urged the Government to commit to a military aid running over several years. The £2.5bn in support announced today will provide Kyiv with air defences, artillery shells and drones for the next year.
Mr Heappey told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “There is £2.5 billion that effectively is the funding for tactical activity in this next year, follows £2.3 billion last year and the £2.3 billion the year before.
“These capability coalitions, there are a number of them led by different countries, but the ones that the UK are leading is principally in the maritime domain.
“They are exactly the multi-year capability development programmes that give the Ukrainians that certainty around the development of their capabilities over the arc of a decade, and equally importantly, give [Vladimir] Putin the certainty that there is no loss in patience and commitment from their [Ukraine’s] Western supporters.”
John Healey has backed the Government’s military aid package and pledged there would be “no change in Britain’s resolve to stand with Ukraine” if Labour took office.
The shadow defence secretary wrote on Twitter:
This is vital support for Kyiv's fight against Putin's illegal invasion. There may be a change in government to Labour this year, but there will be no change in Britain's resolve to stand with Ukraine, confront Russian aggression and pursue Putin for his war crimes. 2/2

Freezing conditions across the frontline as the Ukrainian winter takes hold will create “favourable terrain” as Russia attempts to gain ground near Kupyansk, a think tank has said.
The Institute for the Study of War cites Ukrainian officials who say Moscow is concentrating armoured units around the Kharkiv settlement, including the 47th and 4th Tank Divisions.
“Freezing temperatures in Ukraine are likely constraining operations along the front but will likely create more favorable terrain for mechanised manoeuvre warfare as the ground freezes in the coming weeks,” it said.
The EU is preparing to bow to some of Viktor Orban’s demands to secure a €50bn support package for Ukraine, according to reports.
The Hungarian prime minister vetoed the military aid package on November, depriving Kyiv of key supplies amid a stalemate in the US Congress that has seen Washington’s support dry.
In a bid to convince him to drop his opposition, the European Commission is open to giving Mr Orban an opportunity to stop the four-year deal in 2025, three officials told the Financial Times.
Rishi Sunak will sign a security agreement later today guaranteeing will provide “swift and sustained” support from Britain if Russia attempts another invasion.
It will also set out the intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training that the UK will provide for Ukraine, along with cooperation between their defence industries.
The agreement is the result of last year’s Nato summit in Vilnius, and the “first step in developing an unshakeable hundred-year partnership between Ukraine and the United Kingdom”.
Some £200m of the aid package is being spent on providing thousands of drones – the “largest delivery of drones to Ukraine from any nation”, according to a government statement.
This will include surveillance, long-range strike and sea drones, which will predominantly be manufactured in the UK.
“The technology will give Ukraine cutting edge, battle-tested capabilities to defend their citizens and target the invading Russian forces on land and sea,” the statement continues.
The rest of the package will be made up of long-range missiles, air defences – something Kyiv has been appealing for amid Russian airstrikes – artillery ammunition and “maritime security”.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said:
“For two years, Ukraine has fought with great courage to repel a brutal Russian invasion.
“They are still fighting, unfaltering in their determination to defend their country and defend the principles of freedom and democracy.
“I am here today with one message: the UK will also not falter. We will stand with Ukraine, in their darkest hours and in the better times to come.
“The UK is already one of Ukraine’s closest partners, because we recognise their security is our security.
“Today we are going further - increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones, and signing a historic new Security Agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term.”

OPRDL8R7LY_267Y4V2OFUZ571L,"The lunacy of Little Amal, the puppet who became a fetish for self-deluding liberals",Ella Whelan,"January 16, 2024 at 1:36 AM·6 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/lunacy-little-amal-puppet-became-173628979.html,"On January 13, the seventh pro-Palestine march took to the streets of London – this time with a celebrity in tow. Not Jeremy Corbyn, or Susan Sarandon, but four people in a 10-foot puppet of a Syrian child called Little Amal.
Amid SWP placards and Palestinian flags, Amal posed for photos and touched the heads of protesters. It’s not her first rodeo – Little Amal is quite the media operator. Saturday’s appearance was one of many planned by The Walk Productions and Handspring Puppet Company, creators of the puppet. Amal has appeared across the globe, from Brighton and Stone Henge to Gaziantep on the Turkish border and Oaxaca in Mexico.
In the summer of 2021, Amal embarked on a 8,000 kilometer walk from the Turkish-Syrian border to Manchester, looking for her mother “who set out in search of some food and never returned”. The Walk Productions, which produces the performance side of the puppet, describes her tour as “large scale participatory public art” to “challenge assumptions, rethink narratives and provoke change”.
Since its creation in 2015, the giant puppet has become a vessel for all and any liberal cause – hugging attendees at COP conferences and spreading the message of solidarity at The Hague. If you want to know what Little Amal’s politics are, note that she appeared at the Palestine march on Saturday, but was presumably washing her hair for the one in solidarity with Israeli hostages on Sunday. Getting your picture with Little Amal is like donating to Amnesty International – it sends the right kind of signals to the right sections of society.
The puppet’s origins were specific – born as a character in a play set and performed in the Calais Jungle at the time of international debate about the migrant crisis. Fleeing from war and destruction in the Middle East, European ports and cities were filling up with families looking for better lives. The Calais Jungle in particular became a centre of attention, with celebrities like Lily Allen filming themselves crying while visiting children living in makeshift tents and shacks.
The fact that so many children were caught up in the crisis struck a chord with many. That same year, two-year-old Alan Kurdi washed up on a beach, with photos of his lifeless body sparking intensified global outrage about the plight of many Syrian refugees.
But Little Amal doesn’t hang out with kid refugees anymore. These days, her clientele include phone-wielding fans in Coney Island. Puppetry fan Laura Collins-Hughes writing for the New York Times notes Amal’s ability to pose in New York’s most “Instagrammable” neighbourhood, as well as stop for photos ops outside the public library and other landmarks. Outside the Lincoln Center, Collins-Hughes wrote that Amal “seemed more like a dignitary granting an audience than a child ambassador for a cause”. And yet, she notes that “symbolic behavior matters”, that even as a “buzzy spectacle”, Amal is ‘one you want to be able to say you saw’.
In terms of the puppet itself, Amal is technically masterful – a light-weight but giant moving puppet, whose intricate movements seem surprising at such scale. This level of detail and craft is what South African company Handspring Puppet Company is famous for, whose previous puppet for the theatre production War Horse in 2007 won them international fame. Indeed, Little Amal’s public theatre is often accompanied by bands or music. Such is the demand on her calendar that there are actually numerous Amals, with various productions and performances taking place in different locations.
Fans of puppetry will have their own opinions – I’ve always been left cold by street theatre. But perhaps that’s because Little Amal’s performances were never really about art or serious discussions about the migrant crisis, but something liberal and nebulous in between. Back in 2021, the Guardian’s editorial described Little Amal’s art as “acting as society’s conscience”, quoting producer of The Walk Production’s David Lan describing the puppet as “an opportunity for people to be sympathetic and imagine what it would be like to be her”.
Wow, what a magical and moving morning welcoming #LittleAmal to #Lewisham 😍 Thank you for coming out and showing Little Amal that we are a Borough of Sanctuary where refugees are always welcome 👐❤#TheWalk #LittleAmal #LewishamWelcomes pic.twitter.com/yujjHrM0gb
— Lewisham Council (@LewishamCouncil) October 22, 2021
Much was made of the fact that Amal faced a hostile welcome in some countries, with stones and insults thrown at her. But even refusing a selfie with Little Amal is considered non-U. Little Amal may as well be wearing a t-shirt that says “don’t you care?” If Hamlet told us that art functions “to hold, as ‘twere, the mirror up to nature”, Little Amal clunks you round the head with it. This is not art, it’s a black square on your Instagram, a hashtag on your Twitter feed, a mascot for NGO gatherings and international conferences. Little Amal might have begun on the artist’s table, but she has become the cheerleader of the global middle classes.
Exploring political issues through the eyes of a child is nothing new. Mark Twain’s 19th century story of Huckleberry Finn, a young boy living through slavery, opened generations of young reader’s eyes to the horror and injustice of slavery. By putting racial slurs and prejudices into the mouth of a boy – and by drawing on the reality of life under slavery – Twain’s art did indeed provoke discussion about political change.
It is perhaps ironic that, unlike the welcome Little Amal receives, Twain’s teenager is banned from many schools and libraries for being too political. Twain’s pessimistic ending to Huck Finn, coloured by the realisation of how little had changed in the lives of black Americans under Jim Crow rules, has long stuck in the craw of readers. Perhaps if Twain has played it safer, and used his art to tap into the platitudes of liberal consensus, his characters might too be invited to COP conferences.
Little Amal serves as a comfort to the liberal middle classes, who feel that Something Should Be Done about global injustices. Much like the papier-mâché at Extinction Rebellion protests or the die-ins at pro-Palestine marches in train stations, she satisfies the need to make a bit of a show of one’s political leanings. She is safe – who could object to the image of a child? She is secure – who could question a public work of art, international recognised and globally adored?
But the issues Little Amal seeks to be ambassador for are neither safe nor secure. Debates about immigration cannot be boiled down to a simplistic and moralistic challenge about child safety, but must tussle with big issues of democracy, sovereignty and international solidarity. Appearing as an ambassador for Palestinian children at the march on the weekend, one can’t help but wonder why Amal’s creators didn’t want her to represent the Jewish children captured and murdered by Hamas fighters.
This puppet might know her angles in front of a camera, and create a feeling of satisfaction in those for whom politics is a list of boxes to tick, but that’s about it. If we want to have a discussion about the disruption and destruction of the Middle East, let’s not let a puppet pundit distract us from doing just that.

ORUFI6QQAL_QNIF964R32O0GEC,Israel still needs Britain's unwavering support,Telegraph View,"January 14, 2024 at 6:00 AM·2 min read",20240113,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/israel-still-needs-britains-unwavering-220000335.html,"It has now been 100 days since the depraved terrorists of Hamas broke the ceasefire with Israel and committed the worst anti-Semitic massacre in almost 80 years. Civilians were murdered and mutilated in the most horrifying fashion. Women were gang-raped and tortured. Young children and babies were butchered in their beds. Teenage girls, children and elderly Holocaust survivors were taken hostage, and 132 are still in captivity, their fate unknown.
The leadership of Hamas remains not only defiant, but committed to the genocidal goals of the group’s founding charter. In November, it vowed to repeat the pogrom of October 7 “again and again” and called for the state of Israel to be annihilated.
The cruelty of Hamas extends to the treatment of the people of Gaza, over which it has ruled since 2006. It did not build a single bomb shelter, even as it prepared for war. Instead, it has sought to use Gazans as human shields. Hamas violated international law by embedding its fighters as close as possible to vulnerable civilians. Hospitals, mosques and schools were all co-opted.
The actions of Hamas are morally grotesque, an abandonment of all civilised norms. In the most difficult and tragic of circumstances, Israel has had no choice but to defend itself. And yet the last 100 days have also seen a shocking attempt to distort the truth, an effort by far too many in the broadcast media, international organisations such as the UN, and by Left-wing politicians to make out as if the Israelis are the aggressors.
Even before Israel began its inevitable military response, anti-Semitic protests had begun around the world. Groups that ostensibly stood for social justice cheered on rapists and child-killers as if they were heroes.
There is no greater symbol of this moral inversion than South Africa’s attempt to indict Israel for genocide over its conduct of the war, when the war only started because Hamas had itself committed a genocidal attack. South Africa shows little sign of a moral compass, only an irresponsible desire to stoke anti-Israel sentiment.
In Britain, the last 100 days have also been an indictment of the establishment class. The BBC has failed to confront its anti-Israel bias.
Meanwhile, the police have refused to keep order on the streets. Anti-Semitic incidents have skyrocketed. Despite Hamas being a proscribed terror group, large pro-Palestine protests have normalised the chanting of hateful slogans and made the centre of London a no-go area for British Jews. This weekend, it seems, the protestors chanted in celebration of Houthi piracy.
This afternoon, the Campaign Against Antisemitism will be holding a peaceful rally in Trafalgar Square. Today should serve as a reminder of what is at stake. Israel continues to deserve Britain’s unwavering support as it endeavours to destroy Hamas.

P0EY1FGINA_OYAJWF49PR624BM,Lithuania pledges almost $220 million in 3-year support for Ukraine,Martin Fornusek,"January 10, 2024 at 9:13 PM·2 min read",20240110,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/lithuania-pledges-almost-220-million-131318932.html,"Lithuania continues to support Ukraine in its all-out war with Russia, as its government had approved long-term support of 200 million euros ($219 million), Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Jan. 10 during a joint press conference with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky.
Ukraine's head of state arrived in Vilnius earlier on Jan. 10 as the first step in his trip to the three Baltic countries. Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are among Kyiv's staunchest supporters against Moscow's aggression.
Vilnius promised to continue its uninterrupted support for Ukraine through defense deals finalized last year, as well as through new ones planned for the coming months and years.
""In January, we will again send ammunition, generators, detonation systems, and in February - M-577 armored personnel carriers,"" Nauseda announced during the press conference.
""We will train Ukrainian soldiers and strengthen cooperation in the defense industry,"" the president noted.
The two countries signed new agreements on joint defense production on Jan. 10, including anti-drone systems.
Lithuania's Defense Ministry said that funds from the $219 million support plan for the period of 2024-2026 will be used to cover new military acquisitions for Ukraine.
""The weapons and equipment supplied by Lithuania and its allies make a critical contribution to Ukraine's struggle for independence and the security of Europe as a whole,"" Lithuanian Defense Minister Arvydas Anusauskas said.
""Lithuania will not tire of supporting Ukraine's fight for freedom, just as we ourselves have not tired of striving for the restoration of Lithuania's independence for 50 years.""
Most of this assistance is allocated to the demining coalition led by Lithuania, providing funds for mine clearance equipment and vehicles.
Demining equipment, as well as ammunition and food rations, will be delivered to Ukraine between 2024 and 2025, the Lithuanian Defense Ministry said.
The Baltic country also plans to train about 3,000 Ukrainian soldiers by the end of 2024.
Lithuania announced plans to head a coalition assisting Ukraine with demining efforts in July 2023. The country has also provided extensive military support, including various munitions and NASAMS air defense launchers, and hosts a repair facility for Leopard 2 tanks damaged in Ukraine.

P3GPXHEKO3_NOZIBO95U5BZGY9,Russia ally Belarus to permit use of nuclear weapons for first time in new military rulebook,Arpan Rai,"January 17, 2024 at 5:05 PM·2 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-ally-belarus-permit-nuclear-090509569.html,"Russia ally Belarus has amended its military doctrine to permit the use of nuclear weapons for the first time, months after its decision to host Vladimir Putin’s nukes sent alarm bells ringing across Europe.
Belarus borders Poland, Latvia and Lithuania to its north and west, and the prospect of Russian tactical nuclear weapons being housed so close to Nato allies sparked an international furore late last year.
Defence minister Viktor Khrenin said at a national security council meeting on Tuesday that the change in military doctrine represented a “new chapter” for Belarus, which does not have its own nuclear weapons.
“We clearly communicate Belarus’s views on the use of tactical nuclear weapons stationed on our territory. A new chapter has appeared, where we clearly define our allied obligations to our allies,” he said.
Belarusian forces are not believed to have actively participated in Russia’s war against Ukraine, but the country has supported Moscow in various ways throughout the almost two-year conflict.
The Belarus border is just 140 miles from Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, and Russian troops stationed in Belarus invaded Ukraine from the north during the opening days of the war in February 2022.
In December, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko confirmed the shipment of Russian tactical nuclear weapons for deployment in his country was complete, marking the first such placement outside of Russia’s borders.
The shipments were completed back in October, Mr Lukashenko revealed at a meeting of a Moscow-led economic bloc in St Petersburg.
Russia has said it will maintain control over the nuclear weapons positioned in Belarus, which are intended for battlefield use, having short ranges and comparatively low yields.
Mr Lukashenko did not share further details at the time regarding the quantity of weapons sent or their specific deployment locations.
On Tuesday, Belarus’s security council secretary Alexander Volfovich claimed the deployment of Russian nuclear weapons in Belarus was aimed at detering aggression from Poland, a Nato member.
“Unfortunately, statements by our neighbours, in particular Poland… forced us to strengthen” the military doctrine, he said.
The doctrine will now be taken to the All-Belarusian People’s Assembly, a representative body that operates in Belarus in parallel with its rubber-stamp parliament."

The election, which China had described as “a choice between war and peace,” could test recent efforts by Beijing and Washington to repair relations that in recent years have fallen to their lowest point in decades. The status of Taiwan, one of the strongest democracies in Asia, is among the most sensitive issues between the two superpowers, and focus will now turn to any potential show of force from Beijing in response.
China claims Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force against the island, while the U.S. is Taiwan’s most important international backer. The majority of Taiwan’s 23 million people are in favor of maintaining the status quo, neither formally declaring independence nor becoming part of China.
Lai’s victory extends the eight-year rule of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is considered the least friendly to Beijing. Relations between Taiwan and China have deteriorated under President Tsai Ing-wen, who was first elected in 2016 and is limited to two terms.
Voters in Taiwan, especially younger ones, were concerned not just with China policy but with economic issues such as unemployment, housing costs and income inequality.
Lai won with 40% of the vote, compared with 33% for Hou Yu-ih of the main opposition party, the Kuomintang, and 26% for Ko Wen-je, founder of the populist Taiwan People’s Party. Hou and Ko, who both favor closer ties with Beijing, had argued that the DPP’s policies toward China were too confrontational.
It is the first time in Taiwan’s almost 30 years as a democracy that the same political party has won three consecutive terms. But the DPP lost control of the legislature, which experts say could constrain Lai’s policy options.
At a news conference after his victory on Saturday, Lai said he would continue foreign affairs and national defense in line with Tsai’s policies. China cut off direct dialogue with Taiwan after she was elected in 2016, and has rebuffed offers of talks with Lai as well.
Lai, 64, who will take office for four years starting May 20, said he hopes that China will “understand that only peace will benefit both sides of the strait. In addition, global peace and stability depends on peace in the Taiwan Strait. We hope that China understands the situation, because China also has a responsibility.”
After the election on Saturday, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office said Taiwan was part of China and that the election could not “stop the general trend that the motherland will eventually be reunified.”
It had earlier warned Taiwan voters against supporting Lai, describing him as a “stubborn Taiwan independence advocate” who if elected would promote separatist activities and “create a dangerous situation” in the Taiwan Strait.
Lai’s victory was welcomed in the U.S., which Secretary of State Antony Blinken said was “committed to maintaining cross-Strait peace and stability” in a statement congratulating Lai.
The Congressional Taiwan Caucus said it looked forward to working with Lai and that “in the face of escalating threats to Taiwan’s democracy and security, it is imperative that the United States remains steadfast in support of the people of Taiwan and our shared commitment to democratic values.”
House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a post on X that he would be asking the chairs of the relevant House committees to lead a delegation to Taiwan after Lai’s inauguration in May.
President Joe Biden said Saturday that the U.S. — which recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China but maintains unofficial relations with Taiwan under its longstanding “One China” policy — does not support Taiwan independence.
The White House said this week that after the election, the U.S. would send an unofficial delegation to Taiwan, in what a senior Biden administration official said was an effort to manage tensions and prevent inadvertent conflict.
The question now is how China will respond. Beijing has in the past fired missiles and staged military exercises in response to developments in Taiwan it doesn’t like, and Lai’s victory could bring another show of force.
Taiwan’s government had already accused China of trying to interfere in the election through military and economic pressure as well as disinformation campaigns, while China accused it of “hyping up the threat from the mainland” to gain voter support.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping “is unlikely to accept this defeat gracefully,” said Craig Singleton, a senior China fellow at the nonpartisan Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
“It probably won’t take long for Beijing to register its anger over the result, and its response could be swift and severe,” he said in emailed comments, with possible actions including military drills, new trade restrictions on Taiwanese companies, and intensified cyberattacks on Taiwanese infrastructure.
But while China may be tempted to “punish” Taiwan, it is also reluctant to provoke either Lai or Washington, said Daniel Russel, vice president for international security and diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York.
“Xi Jinping has invested considerable effort and credibility in tamping down tensions with the West, both to lower China’s profile in an American election year and to buy space to deal with myriad problems at home,” he said in emailed comments.
Voters turning up to cast ballots in the election on Saturday, which had turnout of more than 70%, told NBC News that Taiwan’s relationship with China was among the issues they were most concerned about.
Ryan Lu, a 32-year-old from Taipei, said the most important issue for the next leader should be “ensuring peace.”
“These sensitive matters are what I’m most concerned with,” he said, referring to the possibility of a conflict with China. “I know the chances are small but then again, who really knows — just like with the Ukraine-Russia war, who would’ve thought it would really be like this?”
Lai has presented himself as “Tsai 2.0,” said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Chengchi University in Taipei.
“What that means is from a cross-Strait relations perspective, we’re not likely to see a lot of change in the PRC-Taiwan dynamic, which is to say it’s going to remain very icy,” Nachman said, using the initials for China’s formal name, the People’s Republic of China.
Beijing says it is willing to hold talks only if both sides agree that Taiwan is part of China, a policy reiterated by senior Chinese official Liu Jianchao during a visit to the U.S. this week and one that the DPP says it cannot accept.
Following Lai’s victory on Saturday, Nachman said on X that it was “less about Lai winning over hearts and minds of undecided voters” and more about the opposition KMT and TPP parties’ failure late last year to “co-ordinate a joint ticket,” producing a three-way race that “made Lai’s victory much, much easier.”
He added that if the two opposition parties had run on a combined ticket, “I do not think Lai would have won.”
With Lai’s election, “we’re likely to see the same level of threats we see from the PRC, but threats don’t equal conflict,” Nachman said, noting that neither China nor Taiwan wants to go to war.
The U.S. and China, the world’s two largest economies, have increased their interaction since a November meeting in California between Biden and Xi, their first encounter in a year.
This week, in what appears to be partly an effort to protect the fragile gains in their relationship from tensions over the Taiwan election, the U.S. and China resumed long-frozen military talks in Washington, while Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo had a call with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Wentao.
Blinken also met with Liu, the senior Chinese official, on Friday. The State Department said Blinken reiterated the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and that both sides “recognized the importance of continuing to maintain open channels of communication.”

P9QZXVLV33_LCEEL8ACB1TOVB5,UK and US launch strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen,Ben Farmer,"January 12, 2024 at 7:49 PM·4 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/uk-us-launch-strikes-against-114957425.html,"Britain and the United States have launched missile and air strikes against Yemen’s Houthi militants, prompting rebel officials to warn that the allies would pay a “heavy price” in response.
Jets and warships struck dozens of targets overnight in retaliation against weeks of Houthi drone and missile strikes on commercial shipping in one of the world’s busiest waterways.
Rishi Sunak said Britain was standing up “for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade”, while Joe Biden said the strikes were a response to “unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea”.
The US Air Force said it had hit more than 60 targets at 16 sites, including “command-and-control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, production facilities and air defence radar systems”.
Houthi television said strikes hit the capital Sana’a, as well as the cities of Hodeida and Saada.
The strikes began at around 2.30am (11.30pm GMT) with American jets flying from the carrier USS Eisenhower and Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from a submarine and other warships.
Four RAF Typhoon jets supported by a refuelling tanker flew from Akrotiri in Cyprus to hit two targets with laser-guided 500lb Paveway bombs. The first, in Bani in north-western Yemen, was described as a facility to launch reconnaissance and attack drones. The second, an airfield at Abbs, was described as a launch site for cruise missiles and drones.
James Heappey, the armed forces minister, said the strikes were legitimate and were in self-defence.
“Whatever you think of the Houthis’ cause and their justification… we cannot allow them to seek to choke off global trade as a ransom to achieve whatever their political and diplomatic aims are,” he told the BBC.
The Iran-backed Houthis said in total the allied strikes had killed five people and wounded six.
The movement said they would expand their response to the attacks “very soon”, without giving further details.
Hussein al-Ezzi, a Houthi official in their foreign ministry, said there had been “a massive aggressive attack by American and British ships, submarines and warplanes”.
“America and Britain will undoubtedly have to prepare to pay a heavy price and bear all the dire consequences of this blatant aggression,” he said.
The Houthis began attacking and seizing ships in mid-November, saying they were acting in support of Hamas and would not back down until Israel stopped fighting in Gaza.
There have been at least 26 attacks so far, prompting a lot of traffic to avoid the Red Sea and instead take longer, more costly routes around the Cape of Good Hope.
Mohammed Abdul-Salam, the Houthis’ chief negotiator and spokesman, accused America and Britain of having “committed foolishness with this treacherous aggression”.
“They were wrong if they thought that they would deter Yemen from supporting Palestine and Gaza,” he wrote online. Houthi “targeting will continue to affect Israeli ships or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine”, he wrote.
Oil prices jumped by more than 2 per cent in trading after the strikes.
Saudi Arabia, which has led a military campaign against the Houthis since 2015, called for “restraint and avoiding escalation” following the US and UK strikes. The official Saudi Press Agency said the Gulf kingdom was watching the operation with “great concern”.
Yemen has been blighted by war and political crisis for more than a decade and is regarded as one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises.
Protests in 2011 inspired by the Arab Spring, forced Ali Abdullah Saleh, the president, to resign and in the ensuing turmoil Houthi rebels seized much of the country.
Saudi-led forces intervened to support the internationally recognised government and years of fighting has also included activity by al-Qaeda and Islamic State jihadist groups.
At least 150,000 people are estimated to have died in the civil war and three quarters of the population are judged to need some form of aid.

The Palestinian health ministry confirmed that six people had died and an organisation which represents those held in Israeli jails - the Palestinian Society Prisoner's Club - said hundreds had been arrested over the two days.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said four had been badly beaten by Israeli forces. Video footage showed many buildings had also been badly damaged or destroyed.
The Israeli-occupied West Bank has seen a surge of violence in parallel to the Gaza war that erupted on Oct. 7 with a shock cross-border killing and kidnapping spree by Islamist Hamas militants in southern Israel.
The Israeli military says it has arrested 2,700 suspects in the West Bank since the start of the war, and that around half belonged to Hamas.
Tulkarm, one of the main crossing points between the West Bank and Israel, has seen repeated raids.
The Israeli military said on Thursday it had carried out a more than 35-hour long counter-terrorism operation in Tulkarm, killing eight militants, arresting 15 suspects, seizing weapons and destroying dozens of explosive devices.
It said in a statement that it had returned fire with armed militants.
Faisal Salameh, the head of the services committee in Tulkarm, told Reuters that 10 houses had been blown up, others had been damaged by Israeli tanks and infrastructure had been destroyed. Israel said it had discovered bomb-making facilities.
""As you can see, the room is gone, there used to be a bathroom, a yard and a wall here, there used to be trees,"" said Tulkarm resident Issam Asfour.

Best Buy Canada listed and then quickly delisted a Sony PlayStation 5 DualSense ""V2"" controller, denoting a refresh of the stock DualSense design, as noted by TechPowerUp. The pricing was identical to the original DualSense in Canada ($89.99 CAD), but there actually are some nice improvements that come with this refresh.
The biggest change is definitely to the weight, which is given as 280 grams versus the original DualSense's 360 grams. That's a roughly ~22% reduction in overall weight. The original DualSense wasn't particularly heavy, but this should serve to improve long-term comfort while gaming even further. It's even lighter than the 331-gram DualSense Edge.
Another major improvement to the DualSense V2 will be in battery life, which is advertised as 12 hours. Under heavy use, the original DualSense can be depleted in as fast as 6 hours or less, so this could be a major improvement. The DualSense Edge is even worse in this regard, depletable in as fast as 4 hours.
Reportedly, DualSense V2 controllers also are going to be bundled with a DualSense Charging Station, which can charge up to 2 controllers at a time. Since this is normally a separate purchase and you otherwise need to plug in the controller to charge it, this is a nice way to reduce strain on USB ports and make things slightly more convenient for PS gamers. This is particularly pertinent because while battery life is seemingly improved with the DualSense V2 refresh, it still isn't even close to the high-end of what you get from competitors.
This refresh should prove beneficial to the PlayStation 5-owning audience it serves, as well as PC gamers who prefer the PlayStation gamepad layout. For the same price as the original controller, a lot of improvements have still been made, and if all the refreshed units actually do come with free charging stations, that does help mitigate the battery issue versus other consoles.
The appearance of this refresh could also mean that the announcement of the PlayStation 5 Pro is closer than we think, following whispers of devkits being sent out in December. The PS5 Pro would definitely make the most sense shipping with these refreshed controllers compared to the original DualSense or the $199 DualSense Edge, but we'll have to wait and see how that all plays out."

Source: Rivne Oblast Prosecutor's Office; Security Service of Ukraine (SSU)
Details: The prosecutor's office reports that the 34-year-old Belarusian citizen was a member of several illegal armed groups of militants in the occupied territories of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts from 2014 to 2017, where he fought against Ukraine. In 2023, the man joined the artillery unit of the Wagner Group and took part in combat actions against the Armed Forces of Ukraine near Bakhmut in Donetsk Oblast.
The SSU specifies that the man joined the ranks of the Wagner Group at the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He participated in the Bakhmut offensive and adjacent settlements, then returned to Belarus, where he received tasks from his handler.
The prosecutor's office reports that on 11 January 2024, the militant illegally crossed the border of Ukraine to carry out a mission assigned by his handler. The mission involved preparing a sabotage operation that would disable the central regions. Specifically, the man was supposed to install GPS trackers on energy infrastructure facilities in Rivne Oblast so that Russia could obtain precise coordinates of these targets for future airstrikes.
The SSU reports that it learned about Russia’s plan while the saboteur was still in Belarus. Since then, Ukrainian intelligence has systematically documented his actions, from crossing the state border to arriving at the location of the intended sabotage in Ukraine.
The Wagner member was caught red-handed as he attempted to attach GPS trackers to the supports of power lines supplying the Kyiv metropolitan area.
The prosecutor's office states that this occurred in the territory of Sarny district in Rivne Oblast. He was found to be in possession of GPS trackers and starter packs from a Ukrainian mobile operator. Additionally, the saboteur used a forged passport of a Ukrainian citizen to conceal his criminal activities.
The SSU reports that it is planned to serve the individual with a notice of suspicion under two articles of the Criminal Code: Article 113 (sabotage) and Article 258-3.1 (participation in a terrorist group or terrorist organisation).
At the same time, the prosecutor's office reports that the person has already been served with a notice of suspicion and a pre-trial restriction has been chosen in the form of detention without the right to post bail.
In addition to these two articles, the prosecutor's office mentions a third (Article 14.1 – preparation for a crime). The prosecutor's statement does not specify under which articles the person has been served with a notice of suspicion, but it states that the sanction of the article provides for punishment in the form of imprisonment for a term of 15 years or life imprisonment, with confiscation of property.

DAVOS (Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish Prime Minister Masrour Barzani on Tuesday accused Iran of killing innocent civilians in its strikes on the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards earlier said they attacked an Israeli spy centre in the region.
Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos after the attack, Barzani said the Iranian allegations were baseless and added that now was not the time for U.S forces to withdraw from the country.
""What's surprising - we are not a part of this conflict. We don’t know why Iran is retaliating against civilians of Kurdistan, especially in Erbil,"" Barzani told reporters.
At least four civilians were killed and six wounded in the Iranian missiles strikes, the Kurdistan government's security council said.
Iraq condemned Iran's ""aggression"" on Erbil and recalled its ambassador from Tehran for discussions, according to a statement by the country's foreign ministry.
Asked about recent calls in Iraq to remove the U.S.-led international military coalition from the country, Barzani said: ""The U.S. is in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government and their mission is to fight terrorism.""
""We don't think terrorism has ended and last night's event is an indication that instability in the region is still very much at stake,"" he added.
The U.S. has 900 troops in Syria and 2,500 in Iraq on a mission that it says advises and assists local forces trying to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State, which in 2014 seized large parts of both countries before being defeated.

Charles is set to be admitted to hospital next week for a corrective procedure after being diagnosed with a benign enlarged prostate, prompting concern about the monarch’s health.
Camilla, who was visiting the Aberdeen Art Gallery, was asked about Charles by the Lord Provost on Thursday afternoon.
Camilla said: “He’s fine, thank you very much. Looking forward to getting back to work.”
Meanwhile, Prince William was pictured driving himself to The London Clinic, where Kate is recovering following surgery. The couple’s three young children were not with their father.
Buckingham Palace, in an unprecedented double royal health scare, announced the news of the King’s medical issue just an hour and a half after Kensington Palace revealed Kate’s operation on Wednesday afternoon.
The 75-year-old monarch, who acceded to the throne 16 months ago, was said to be keen to go public with his condition to encourage other men who may be experiencing symptoms to get checked.
The King is staying at Birkhall in Aberdeenshire with the Queen but the palace has not confirmed whether he will be treated in London or Scotland next week.
Charles had a series of meetings and events planned at Dumfries House in East Ayrshire on Thursday and Friday, which have been postponed on his doctor’s advice.
William was seen leaving the private London Clinic at around 12.35pm on Thursday after visiting Kate. Sources say that Kate is “doing well” but will spend up to three months recovering.
The princess was admitted on Tuesday for the successful, planned procedure but is expected to stay in hospital for 10 to 14 days before returning to her Adelaide Cottage home in Windsor.
The nature of the princess’s condition has not been revealed, although Kensington Palace confirmed it was not cancerous.
It is serious enough, however, for heir to the throne to be postponing official duties while his wife is in hospital and in the immediate aftermath while she recuperates.
The princess is not expected to return to public duties until after Easter but this will depend on medical advice at the time.
William was looking after George, 10, Charlotte, eight, and five-year-old Louis on Wednesday evening.
The royal youngsters were at school all day and are yet to visit their mother in hospital.
A spokesperson said the princess wanted to share news of her surgery to explain to those affected by the postponement of her engagements.
“She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible, and her wish that her personal medical information remains private,” they added.
“Kensington Palace will, therefore, only provide updates on Her Royal Highness’ progress when there is significant new information to share.”
There will now be no international travel for the prince and princess in the coming months.
The London Clinic was chosen to care for Kate this time, rather than King Edward VII’s Hospital which is usually the go-to establishment for royal medical matters and where she was admitted in 2012."
PUJ1IAT9HY_F9NC1HRMS38RNOG,South Africa calls Israel’s leaders ‘genocidal inciters’ at ICJ case opening,Jenna Moon,"January 11, 2024 at 10:45 PM·3 min read",20240111,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/south-africa-calls-israel-leaders-133614412.html,"With insights from Just Security, CNN, The Mail & Guardian, and The Conversation.
South Africa accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in its opening arguments at the United Nations International Court of Justice on Thursday.
“The intent to destroy Gaza has been nurtured at the highest level of state,” Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, advocate of the High Court of South Africa, told the court. He called Israel’s political and military leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, “genocidal inciters,” adding that Israel’s intentions are “evident from the way in which this military attack is being conducted.”
Israel responded by accusing South Africa of operating as the “legal arm” of Hamas, with the Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson describing the case as “one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history.”
The case brought by Pretoria over Israel’s bombing campaign in Gaza, which followed Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel, also demands an end to Israel’s military operations in the enclave. Lawyers for Israel, which has called Pretoria’s claims “baseless,” will present the nation’s defense on Friday.
South Africa sees parallels between its apartheid history and Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. In the 1960s, South Africa was subject to an ultimately unsuccessful ICJ case arguing against its then apartheid rulers — something that now informs the case Pretoria has brought to The Hague, legal scholar Christopher Gevers wrote for South African newspaper the Mail & Guardian. The case “is about more than just the present legal dispute,” Gevers noted. But “by bringing it South Africa has offered the ICJ the chance to place itself and International Law on the right side of Dr King’s moral arc.”
The ICJ is likely to provide a decision on South Africa’s request for provisional measures — a form of international injunction against Israel’s strikes on Gaza — by the end of January, a move that could impact how the war proceeds. If the ICJ upholds South Africa’s request, Israel might have to make major changes to its military operations in the enclave. The court, however, doesn’t have any right to enforce any orders, so Israel could choose to ignore its findings. Few Israelis are willing to accept the genocide claims against the nation, Tel Aviv-based law professor Eliav Lieblich told CNN. “Some view the proceedings as just another case of international bias against Israel,” he said. “They mostly view the war as one of self-defense against Hamas, which due to the latter’s tactics result in wide but unintended harm to civilians.”
South Africa, thousands of miles away from Israel, is not directly affected by the war in Gaza, but it was still able to bring forward the case because of a legal doctrine called s. The doctrine allows a state party to a treaty to begin legal proceedings that would protect common rights. The use of the doctrine has major implications: It’s a huge development in human rights law, Alaa Hachem and Oona Hathaway wrote for Just Security, but comes with risks, as the ICJ could increasingly find itself in the middle of “vexing legal and political disputes,” they argued."

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) -Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei held a positive meeting with International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva in Davos on Wednesday, focused on the South American country's deep economic crisis and its $44 billion IMF program.
""Very good meeting with Argentina's President Javier Milei,"" Georgieva wrote on X after meeting the right-wing leader who is pushing a tough austerity package to bring down inflation above 200%, even while two-fifths of people are living in poverty.
""We talked about Argentina's deep economic and social challenges and decisive steps underway to bring down inflation, promote private sector-led growth, and use scarce public money to help the most vulnerable people,"" she said.
Earlier in the day Milei had praised free markets, while slamming socialism and ""social justice"" in a speech at Davos that marks the first overseas tour for the self-proclaimed 'anarcho-capitalist' since taking office last month.
""Socialism is a phenomenon that creates poverty,"" he said in a special address to a large and well-heeled crowd at the World Economic Forum, warning the West was ""in danger"" of its spread.
""Free enterprise capitalism is the only tool we have to end hunger and poverty.""
Milei shot to power last year on the back of voter anger at the worsening economic crisis, often campaigning with a chainsaw to underscore his plans to slash the size of the state. He needs to rebuild depleted foreign currency reserves and spur growth.
He is pushing major economic reforms, including spending cuts and deregulation, in a bid to improve the government's finances and boost the economy. But he faces high poverty levels and the real threat of social unrest.
Milei earlier met British foreign minister David Cameron, discussing ""deepening commercial ties, the support they will give us in the IMF and how to promote British investments in Argentina,"" Milei's office said in a readout.
En route to Switzerland by commercial jet, Milei had said he was attending the Davos conclave in order to ""plant the idea of freedom in a forum contaminated by the 2030 socialist agenda"".
AUSTERITY 'DETOX'
Argentina is racing to salvage its massive loan program with the IMF, the Washington-based lender's largest globally. Last week it secured an agreement with IMF staff over the program's latest review, which should unlock some $4.7 billion of funds.
According to a Davos briefing on Argentina, the country's relationship with the IMF is ""very good"" and the government is confident of meeting objectives in a tough economic plan that surpasses what the fund was demanding.
Milei's libertarian coalition, which only has a small bloc in Congress but has won over conservative allies, was confident of passing its major 'omnibus' reform bill, part of a first wave of economic reforms, but had back-up plans if it failed.
Planned tax hikes as part of these reforms - going against campaign pledges to cut taxes - were a necessary step to bring in revenues to pay for social programs for the most vulnerable, but the aim was that these would last no more than a year. Those tax hikes have irked Argentine soy and corn farmers.
Milei would stick by plans to dollarize Argentina's economy and shut the central bank, but the conditions were not yet right for doing so and the government first had to stabilize the economy and navigate a tough period of austerity ""detox"".

PXUEMRN8UW_CZODN1N0UEXQ7A1,What we know about strikes on Houthis and strategy behind them,"Jonathan Beale, defence correspondent, and Jacqueline Howard - BBC News","January 12, 2024 at 11:20 PM·6 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/houthi-strikes-everything-know-us-094254962.html,"The US and UK have carried out air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen with the aim of deterring attacks on ships passing through the Red Sea.
The strikes were also backed by a number of the US and UK's allies.
Missiles were launched overnight into Friday, hitting dozens of sites - with some casualties reported.
The Houthis say they are not deterred by the attacks, but the US suggests the strikes have damaged the rebel group's military capability.
But the group has survived much worse - including years of being targeted by the Saudi Air Force.
This is what we know about the US-UK strikes so far.
The US says it ""executed deliberate strikes on over 60 targets at 16 Iranian-backed Houthi militant locations"".
The Pentagon described its targets as radar systems, drone storage and launch sites, missile storage and launch facilities and Houthi command and control nodes.
Strikes were reported in the Yemen capital Sanaa - which is controlled by the rebels - as well as the Houthi Red Sea port of Hodeidah, Dhamar and the group's north-western stronghold of Saada.
According to the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD), the British strikes were in Bani in the north-west - which the MoD said was a drone operational site - and Abbs airfield, which intelligence said was a launching site for missiles and drones.
There were 72 strikes in all, according to the Houthis' military spokesman.
The Houthi spokesman also said five of its members had been killed and six others injured.
The Pentagon said the strikes were on military, not civilian targets using ""precision weapons"".
US President Joe Biden has said he won't hesitate to take further military action if necessary. But the US has also made clear that it does not want to see a widening conflict in the Middle East.
That suggests that any future US-led military action, if necessary, would again be limited.
Air strikes and long range cruise missiles are the least risky and costly for Mr Biden in an election year. Remember the US has been also using limited airstrikes to target other Iranian backed groups in Iraq and Syria in recent months.
But at best it's a deterrent. It will not eliminate the threat.
The strikes last night might also have degraded and destroyed some of the Houthi's ability to launch attacks on shipping in the Red Sea.
But in public, at least, they remain defiant. They still have the capacity to launch further attacks.
The only real option left for the US and UK is then doing more of the same - targeting from a distance. The US has bitter recent experience of more direct military action in the region - such as putting boots on the ground.

Explained: Who are the Houthi rebels attacking Red Sea ships?
Impact: Strikes could undermine US goal of containing war
The bulk of the firepower came from US jets. The US has an aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, as well as air bases in the region.
US Navy warships fired Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles, which are GPS-guided and can be programmed to fly evasively, the US military says.
While no specific figures have been given for how many missiles were fired, the US says more than 100 precision-guided munitions ""of various types"" were used.
Meanwhile, the UK said it sent four RAF Typhoons from Cyprus, carrying Paveway IV guided bombs. It has not said how many were released.
Though the Royal Navy has two warships in the Red Sea, neither can fire land attack missiles and so would not have been directly involved in the strikes.
Reacting to Friday's strikes, the group's leader Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said the US and UK would ""soon realise"" the action was ""the greatest folly in their history"".
""America and Britain made a mistake in launching the war on Yemen because they did not benefit from their previous experiences,"" he wrote on social media, adding ""every individual in this world is faced with two choices - either to stand with the victims of genocide or to stand with its perpetrators.""
Another spokesman for the group said the US and UK were wrong to think they could deter Yemen's support for Palestinians.
Iran, which backs the Houthis, has condemned the strikes on Yemen as a ""clear violation of Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" and a violation of international laws.
A US senior administration official at the National Security Council said in a call on Thursday that ""Iran is a primary, if not the primary enabler or supporter sponsor of the Houthis"", adding that they believe Iran has been ""involved in every phase"" of these attacks.
The Houthis' position on the Red Sea attacks is that they are preventing ships affiliated with Israel from crossing the route - due to events in Gaza.
They have previously said that any ship destined for Israel or with Israeli links is a ""legitimate target"". However, many commercial vessels that have been targeted appear to have no such connection.
""They are firing indiscriminately on vessels with global ties,"" the US National Security Council official said. ""Most of the ships that have come under attack have nothing whatsoever to do with Israel.""
Mr Biden said the strikes were in ""direct response"" to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea.
""These attacks have endangered US personnel, civilian mariners, and our partners, jeopardised trade, and threatened freedom of navigation,"" he said.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak added that the action was ""necessary and proportionate"" to protect global shipping.
""Despite the repeated warnings from the international community, the Houthis have continued to carry out attacks in the Red Sea, including against UK and US warships just this week,"" he said. ""This cannot stand.""
The US-UK attacks were backed by a coalition of Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand and South Korea.
The National Security Council official said ""close calls"", one which recently nearly sunk a ship carrying US jet fuel, has caused ""over a dozen shipping companies"" to reroute vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, increasing costs and affecting the global economy.
In a statement, the allies said the multilateral strikes were conducted ""in accordance with the inherent right of individual and collective self-defence"".
""These precision strikes were intended to disrupt and degrade the capabilities the Houthis use to threaten global trade and the lives of international mariners in one of the world's most critical waterways,"" the statement read."

PARIS (Reuters) -French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he would head to Ukraine in February to finalise a bilateral security guarantee deal under which Paris would deliver more sophisticated weaponry, including long-range cruise missiles.
The trip comes at a time when political infighting in the U.S. and European Union has held up two major packages of assistance for Ukraine.
Macron said some 40 SCALP long-range missiles and several hundred bombs would be delivered in the coming weeks.
""We are going to deliver a lot more equipment and help Ukraine with what it needs to defend its skies,"" Macron told a news conference. ""I will go myself to Ukraine in February and finalise these texts.""
France has already delivered about 50 SCALP missiles, which have a range of about 250 km, three times as far as Ukraine's existing missile capacities.
Macron added that Europeans would in the coming weeks ramp up their support for Ukraine so it could continue to defend itself against Russia because Moscow could not be allowed to defeat Ukraine otherwise the security of Europe would be put at risk.
Ukraine's defence minister will be in Paris on Thursday, France's defence ministry said on Tuesday.
G7 countries in June unveiled an international framework for the long-term security of Ukraine to boost its finances and defences against Russia with a view to deterring Moscow from future aggression, officials said.
Ukraine has lobbied for long-term security commitments from its main backers. France has been negotiating bilaterally since June, but there has been scant detail on what countries are willing to do and with the war entering its third year there are questions about how committed Kyiv's allies may be.
French diplomatic sources have said the accord would outline the framework for long-term humanitarian aid, support for reconstruction and military assistance.
Kyiv is seeking to maintain flows of military and financial aid from its Western allies after nearly two years of fighting a full-scale Russian invasion.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was in Kyiv last week to sign a new security agreement and announce an increase in military funding for Ukraine to buy drones, including surveillance, long-range strike and sea drones.

Several thousand turned London landmark Trafalgar Square into a sea of Israeli flags and yellow balloons, symbolising the 132 hostages who remain captive after being kidnapped on October 7.
The attack by Hamas militants triggered Israel's bombing campaign in Gaza that has left thousands dead.
Some supporters held placards reading ""stand with Israel"" and ""never again is now"" while guest speakers on stage led the crowd in chants of ""bring them home"".
The event was marked by a heavy police presence and tight security, with all attendees undergoing bag checks and frisking.
""I'm here to support Israel, to support our community and our people,"" retiree Arthur Goldberg, from north London, told AFP.
""You have to have empathy with an ordinary Gazan citizen, they are going through a nightmare. However, there are 150 hostages that are being detained,"" added the 56-year-old.
""There are consequences to how government's behave, and they voted for that government.""
The Hamas attack resulted in about 1,140 deaths in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
The fighters also abducted around 250 people from southern Israeli communities and a trance music festival, though dozens were released in a swap with Palestinian prisoners in late November.
Israel has since bombarded Gaza, killing at least 23,968 people in the Palestinian territory, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas health ministry.
- 'Rock and hard place' -
Ursula Conlong, 59, travelled six hours from North Wales for the event.
""I support Israel. The people that support Israel in England, we know each other, there's a network,"" said the former volunteer teacher.
""Israel is stuck between a rock and a hard place.
""What's interesting about this event is how we are scrutinised coming in... but the other marches around the world, pro-Palestinian, there isn't this security. Israel supporters aren't trying to kill Palestinian supporters,"" she added.
Several hundred people also marched through the streets of Berlin on Sunday, waving Israeli flags to demand the ""immediate"" release of the hostages.
Marchers carried signs reading ""100 days in hell"" and ""bring the hostages home now"".
Others held up placards criticising the Israeli government for ""betraying the hostages"" and calling for ""an immediate ceasefire"".
And in Paris, a series of events took place at the foot of the Eiffel Tower.
""The French nation is determined that... all the hostages of the terrorist attacks of October 7 should be freed,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday.
Earlier in London, around 250 cyclists completed a 4.5 mile (7.2km) ride inside Regents Park to draw attention to those still detained.
""I'm hoping to remind the world of the existence of the hostages, still unfortunately living where they are living in Gaza under the conditions they are living in, which is inhumane,"" said accountant David Landau, 57.
""The Pakistanis have thrown the Afghans back into Afghanistan and the Chinese are doing what they are doing to the Uighur Muslims, but apparently the world is focussed on one thing and one thing alone, which is hypocrisy and anti-Semitism,"" he added.

Q060VUP1EY_QYB427EEHELOL3A,Ukraine Situation Report: Long-Range Drone Strikes Expand To St. Petersburg,Thomas Newdick,"January 19, 2024 at 8:01 AM·11 min read",20240119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-situation-report-long-range-000116362.html,"Ukraine launched a long-range drone strike against Russia’s second largest city, St. Petersburg, overnight, where the target was reportedly an oil terminal. An unnamed Ukrainian military source said that the attack kicked off a “new phase” in the conflict, which looks like it will rely heavily on the country’s recently developed long-range one-way attack drones.
https://twitter.com/KyivIndependent/status/1747937335881179536
Citing a Ukrainian intelligence source, the Ukrainska Pravda reported that the drone attack was undertaken by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense’s Main Directorate of Intelligence, or GUR.
“This is a Defense Intelligence operation involving modern Ukrainian assets. Data collection continues, and there are confirmed strikes on targets,” the source told the newspaper.
https://twitter.com/Gerashchenko_en/status/1747894083693982016
Meanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that a Ukrainian drone was intercepted over the Leningrad region, in which St. Petersburg is located, early this morning.
Unofficial Russian sources, including on the Telegram messaging app, reported that a drone was shot down close to the St. Petersburg Oil Terminal on the Gulf of Finland. It’s unclear if this is the same drone referenced by the Russian Ministry of Defense, but accounts suggest that it exploded on impact and started a fire at the terminal.
https://twitter.com/front_ukrainian/status/1748048019012899245 https://twitter.com/TWMCLtd/status/1747877933849411903
Unconfirmed reports suggest that the drone, or drones, may have passed over a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Lake Valdai, in the Novgorod region of northwestern Russia, as it flew toward St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg is Putin's home town.
https://twitter.com/scottfieldsa/status/1748078807561429266
According to Ukrainian officials, this is not the first time that targets in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad region have been hit by Ukrainian attacks. However, the latest development suggests that new long-range drone technology is now being put to use, with these types offering not only greater reach but also a higher level of performance and greater payloads, compared with previous drone designs.
Already this month, other targets reportedly struck by Ukrainian drones in Russia include an oil depot and energy provider in the Oryol region, which you can read more about here.
In December, The War Zone reported on how the Ukrainian military had received an initial batch of a new kind of relatively low-cost, long-range, one-way attack drone, the AQ 400 Scythe drone. Officials also announced plans to drastically scale up production soon.
https://twitter.com/terminal_AI_Inc/status/1735015877228048546
Another new Ukrainian drone design has also recently broken cover, this one notably featuring jet propulsion.
https://twitter.com/clashreport/status/1747661632975606083
Many other types with increasing range and performance or cost saving features have been developed or are in development in Ukraine.
Ukraine’s campaign of long-range drone strikes is perhaps the best example of the country’s long-standing desire to ‘bring the war home’ to Russia, as well as to offer an alternative means of fighting back as the situation along the front lines continues to stagnate.
At the same time, the Ukrainian attacks on Russian infrastructure can also be seen as a response in kind to Moscow’s ongoing winter campaign of missile and drone strikes that have targeted Ukraine energy infrastructure.
Before diving into more developments from the conflict in Ukraine, The War Zone readers can review our previous coverage here.
Russia claims that its forces have taken control of the settlement of Vesele in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region. The information comes from the Russian Ministry of Defense and was reported by Reuters, although the ministry provided few further details and the claim has not been independently verified.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said that the settlement had been taken by what it called the active efforts of units that are part of Russia’s Southern Military Group. Vesele, which has an estimated population of around 100 people, is located 12 miles northeast of the Russian-controlled city of Bakhmut. The surrounding area has seen heavy fighting in recent months.

A new batch of French-made weaponry is headed to Ukraine, including more CAESAR 155m self-propelled wheeled howitzers. The CAESAR — which stands for Camion Équipé d’un Système d’Artillerie, or ‘Truck equipped with an artillery system’ — has been supplied to Ukraine before, by both France and Denmark, which provided 36 and 19 examples, respectively.
https://twitter.com/DefenceU/status/1747969275837415645
The new purchase, amounting to six CAESARs, valued at around $3.3 million-$4.4 million each, was announced today by Sebastien Lecornu, the French defense minister. It is Ukraine’s first purchase of French-made weapons since the start of the war. Lecornu also said that France would provide 50 examples of the Safran Armement Air-Sol Modulaire (AASM) Hammer precision-guided bomb to Ukraine each month. You can read more about that air-launched weapon in our recent writeup on it here.
https://twitter.com/thewarzonewire/status/1748129192989102268?s=20
Lecornu noted that Nexter, manufacturer of the CAESAR, has cut the production time of the howitzer in half, to 15 months, meaning that around 78 units will be available this year.
https://twitter.com/Armees_Gouv/status/1748045553445851593
France has also committed to spending around $54 million from a fund it has created for Ukraine to buy a further 12 CAESARs that it will transfer to Kyiv. Lecornu said he hoped that other allies would team up to buy a further 60 CAESARs for Ukraine at a cost of about $310 million. “We want to share the bill and enable European countries to share the financial burden,” Lecornu said.
The latest Russian drone attack on Ukraine last night reportedly involved 33 Iranian-designed Shahed-type one-way attack drones, as well as missiles fired at Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, in the east. The Ukrainian Air Force said that its air defense systems brought down 22 of the drones and added that Russian forces also fired two S-300 surface-to-air missiles — repurposed for the land-attack role — from the Belgorod border region.
The Ukrainian Air Force stated that the 33 Shahed-136/131 attack drones were launched from the Primorsko-Akhtarsk area and the Kursk region of Russia, Agence France-Presse reported.

Interactive software is helping Ukrainian high-school students prepare for future combat, with rifle and pistol shooting practice added to the curriculum.
A regional official confirmed that the new software was being introduced in the Ivano-Frankivsk region in western Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reports. Svitlana Onyshchuk said: “Prykarpattia high-school students will learn shooting on safe interactive systems at Defence of Ukraine classes.” She added that the training will be introduced in three dozen schools across the western region.
As well as the demands of fielding new soldiers, the move reflects how much of school life has already been forced to go online, with thousands of schools damaged or destroyed by Russian attacks, as well as more general turmoil in Ukraine’s education system.
The interactive software is being introduced together with mobile multimedia equipment and replica weapons. Onyshchuk said that the training is part of a broader effort to “improve skills related to military and patriotic education.”

A total of 68 alleged foreign mercenaries have had charges filed against them in Russia, accused of fighting for Ukraine.
The Russian state-run TASS news agency cites a statement provided by Russia’s Investigative Committee (IC), which says: “In the criminal case on mercenary activities, investigators received additional materials and filed charges in absentia against 68 more nationals from seven countries.”
The same report adds that criminal proceedings are now underway against 591 foreign citizens from 46 countries. Most of these are citizens of the United States, Canada, Georgia, Israel, the United Kingdom, Germany, Lithuania, and Latvia, according to the IC.
Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has said Ukrainians “must make the choice between being part of Russia or death,” in one of his most belligerent statements since the start of the full-scale invasion.
Medvedev, who now serves as deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, has made previous outlandish threats directed against Ukraine and its Western allies.
In a post on Telegram, Medvedev added that Ukrainians must choose between “eternal war and inevitable death and life.” He added: “They [Ukrainians] will understand that life in a large common state, which they do not like very much now, is better than death. Their deaths and the deaths of their loved ones. And the sooner Ukrainians realize this, the better.”
https://twitter.com/olex_scherba/status/1747889877683679355
Other statements from Medvedev on January 17 included reiterating Russia’s commitment to eliminating Ukrainian statehood and independence, as discussed in the threat below from the U.S.-based think tank, The Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

Reports emerged today suggesting that another Russian patrol ship has been sunk in the Crimean port of Sevastopol.
The individual ship has so far not been identified, but the incident was reportedly claimed by agents of the Atesh group, a military partisan movement active in the occupied territories of Ukraine, as well as in the territory of Russia.
It is claimed that the ship fell victim to an attack by some kind of naval drone some weeks ago, but that its loss had been concealed by Russia until now.
https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1747904735896645887
A report from the British think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) states that North Korea has, to date, supplied Russia with “several dozen” short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs).
The report states that the U.S. government first identified the Russian use of a single North Korean-designed SRBM in a failed effort to hit a Ukrainian target on December 30, 2023, with multiple missiles fired on January 2, 2024.
The IISS states:
“Ukraine estimates that Russia has launched more than 800 SRBMs during its invasion. North Korea’s transfer of several dozen SRBMs will be welcomed by Moscow, which has depleted its pre-war stockpile despite efforts to increase missile production. An unknown number of North Korean transporter erector launchers (TEL), and presumably support vehicles, have also been sent.”
Based on images presented at a U.S. government press gathering, Russia has likely received examples of the road-mobile Hwasong-11A (KN-23) and/or Hwasong-11B (KN-24) SRBMs.
The KN-23 and KN-24 are relatively new solid-fuel SRBMs, which were first test launched in 2019.

Among the latest drone systems to appear in Russian hands is this uncrewed ground vehicle (UGV), named Bratishka, meaning “little brother.”
As can be seen in the video below, the UGV combines a tracked power unit that can pull a variety of payloads, including a wounded soldier or a pallet of ammunition, also over fairly steep terrain and obstacles.
https://twitter.com/clashreport/status/1747677255520657707
While the presence of the MIM-23 HAWK surface-to-air missile in Ukrainian hands is well known by now, photos and videos showing the system remain generally scarce. The photo below, date and location unconfirmed, shows a Ukrainian serviceman posing in front of a former U.S. Army HAWK missile. Other HAWKS and related subsystems have been provided to Ukraine by Spain and Sweden.
https://twitter.com/trip_to_valkiri/status/1747707720768061821
U.S.-designed air defense systems of a more modern nature next, with a statement from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he praises the capabilities of the Patriot surface-to-air missile.
Zelensky describes the Patriot as “the most effective air defense system in the world today ... I must bow deeply to its creators ... Both Russians and our partners are in shock.”
The Ukrainian leader may be pointing to the reported shooting down of a Russian A-50 Mainstay airborne early warning aircraft over the Sea of Azov last weekend. While the exact cause of that loss remains unclear, the Patriot has been suggested as one possible candidate.
https://twitter.com/wartranslated/status/1747664472209052088
While no evidence of the wreckage of the A-50 has appeared so far, a Telegram channel has provided a list of crew members who are currently listed as missing.
Reports suggest that Russia may be developing a new range of armor-piercing rounds, in 12.7mm caliber.
The monolithic steel penetrators are claimed to be able to penetrate the side armor of a NATO armored personnel carrier at around 100 yards.
https://twitter.com/JakOSpades/status/1747329975953273037
One of the latest videos that shows a first-person-view (FPV) drone in action reveals the destruction of a Russian T-72 tank by one of these devices, reportedly in Dibrova, in the Luhansk region, eastern Ukraine. The destination of the explosive payload very quickly leads to a catastrophic ammunition “cook-off.”
https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1747040487180026248
Finally, intriguing photos have appeared on social media showing the wreckage of an unusual-looking weapon, apparently an example of the Soviet-era P-35B supersonic anti-ship missile. This missile is used in the static Utes system coastal defense system as well as the road-mobile Redut coastal defense system.
As far as is known, the missile has not previously been used in the Ukrainian war. With no Ukrainian naval vessels to target, it seems probable that the P-35B has been repurposed for a land-attack role, perhaps launched from the Utes complex on the Crimean peninsula.

NATO is mobilizing 90,000 troops as part of its biggest military drill since the Cold War. The exercise, coined Steadfast Defender 2024, will include at least 1,100 combat vehicles, 80 aircraft, and 50 naval vessels from all 31 NATO member states, as well as from NATO candidate Sweden.
The drill will start next week and last until May, NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander said at a press conference Thursday. The drill comes after a host of European leaders warned that Russia remains a real threat, despite expending a significant amount of its manpower and resources in Ukraine.
On Friday, the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania also announced they will build a common defensive line along their borders with Russia and Belarus to ensure they are prepared to ward off any future Russian attack. Earlier this week, the prime minister of Estonia warned that Europe has three to five years until the Kremlin rebuilds its forces and poses a serious threat to NATO’s eastern flank.
The drill will allow NATO to practice its first major defense plan in decades, which the alliance approved last year as it sought to increase its readiness for a conventional war after decades of preparing for low-intensity conflicts and peacekeeping operations. The defense plan “will reassure those allies most exposed to potential Russian aggression and improve the ability of all of the allies to act effectively together,” defense expert Kori Schake wrote in The Atlantic. European officials are increasingly sounding the alarm about the Russia threat, with the German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius warning that an attack could be possible in five to eight years. Earlier this month, Sweden’s commander-in-chief caused panic among the country’s children by announcing on a kids television show that war could come to Sweden.
Despite frequent warnings about European security, the continent has been slower to ramp up its production of military equipment than its militaries would have liked. “The uncomfortable truth,” analysts from The International Institute for Strategic Studies wrote, “is that European countries have hardly prepared for war at all.” Last year, the European Union delivered less than half of the one million artillery shells it had promised to Ukraine by spring of this year. Most of the shells the EU did provide came from existing reserves, raising questions about whether the EU will be able to continue supplying Ukraine at the same rate once European stockpiles empty out. While several countries are ramping up their production — both Finland and Norway have announced major funding packages for their arms industries in the past weeks — defense companies have warned that without further investment they will be unable to develop the production capacity European countries hope to build.
The coming military drill will also allow NATO to continue integrating its newest member, Finland, as well as Sweden, which is expected to join NATO eventually despite sustained Hungarian opposition to its membership application. The two countries will strengthen NATO’s military capacities in the Baltics, with analysts frequently quipping that the Baltic Sea has become a “NATO lake.” The Baltics have been a concern for NATO for decades: One war game conducted by the think tank RAND in 2016 concluded that Russian forces could reach the capitals of Estonia and Latvia within less than three days in the event of a full-scale invasion. But Finland’s accession has also created a new challenge for the alliance, which now has to manage an 800-mile border with Russia that is “highly exposed to Russian military threats,” according to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies."
Q6RT8K6RR8_WCLC5NG24Y4827F,Russia threatens fresh invasion of northern Ukraine to stop bombardment of Belgorod,Joe Barnes,"January 10, 2024 at 12:04 PM·4 min read",20240110,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-threatens-fresh-invasion-northern-180457782.html,"Russia has threatened a fresh invasion of north-eastern Ukraine as calls escalate for a “buffer zone” to stop attacks on the border city of Belgorod.
Dimitri Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said Russian forces would do “everything” to prevent further Ukrainian bombardment of the frontier region after a string of recent attacks that left scores dead.
His comments prompted demands from pro-war Russian ultra-nationalists for a large-scale offensive to advance at least 15 kilometres (9 miles) into the Kharkiv region in order to push Ukrainian artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) out of range of Belgorod.
Kyiv’s forces have repeatedly struck the city, which sits 20 miles inside Russia, in retaliation for Moscow’s deadly bombardments on Ukraine in recent weeks.
“Of course, our military will continue to do everything to first minimise this danger and then completely get rid of it,” Mr Peskov told reporters this week. “The SVO [special military operation] continues for this purpose.”
His veiled threat came after The Telegraph reported last week that Ukraine was braced for a renewed offensive near Kharkiv as Russian forces ramped up bombardments on military targets in the north-eastern city and the surrounding region.
There has been significant pressure on the Kremlin to launch a new assault on Ukraine’s second-largest city, which Russian forces have never occupied, amid discontent over cross-border raids into Belgorod by pro-Ukrainian Russian rebels.
Last week, Ukraine’s military intelligence published video footage purportedly showing an incursion by Ukrainian forces across the frontier in a bid to target Russian commanders visiting the area.
Belgorod has become one of the main targets of Ukrainian retaliation for Russia’s winter campaign of long-range strikes against civilian and military infrastructure.
Russian authorities have claimed the Ukrainian armed forces have killed and wounded dozens of the city’s inhabitants with drone and missile strikes.
Meanwhile, pro-Russian sources on the Telegram messaging app have seized on the attacks to challenge the Kremlin to take action to protect Belgorod.
“This can only be done by significantly moving the border,” wrote the Unofficial Bezsonov channel, which has more than 300,000 followers.
The prominent Warrior Kitten channel said: “A 15-kilometre buffer zone is not a panacea. So, 15 kilometres will reduce shelling from MLRS, mortars and a number of cannon artillery, but nothing more. Therefore, we need a radically larger exclusion zone.
“It is necessary to return Kharkov, Sumy and Chernigov regions to Russia,” it added, using the Russian names for the Ukrainian regions of Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv.
But analysts at the US-based Institute for the Study of War said Russia was unlikely to possess the manpower or resources to conduct a successful large-scale offensive into Kharkiv.
“A Russian incursion 15 kilometres in depth and several hundred kilometres in width would be a massive operational undertaking that would require a grouping of forces far larger and significantly better resourced than what Russian forces currently have concentrated along the entire international border with Ukraine, least of all in Belgorod Oblast,” it wrote in its latest battlefield update.
Ukrainian authorities have urged Kharkiv’s residents to remain calm amid reports of a possible new offensive.
But Moscow has been bolstering its forces in an effort to capture the Kharkiv region town of Kupiansk, which is seen as strategically important for any future Russian advances in the area.
Russian troops have been boosted by the deployment of reserves and strengthened engineering structures, according to Ukrainian officials.
Still, Ukraine has managed to repel daily Russian offensive efforts in the area in recent weeks, according to its General Staff.
Volodymyr Fito, a spokesman for Ukraine’s ground forces, said: “We see that the enemy has no major advances on the Kupiansk front. Our defenders are on active defence, seeking to improve their tactical position at every opportunity and launching offensive actions. And there are no successes.”
After visiting the front line in the region this week, Rustem Umerov, the Ukrainian defence minister, said: “Decisions will be made in the near future – the enemy will not like it.”

Q6T7Z8PD8Y_1D6XA8ELVU02O5H,US military figures left ‘frustrated’ when news of Houthi attacks leaked,Ben Riley-Smith,"January 12, 2024 at 12:01 PM·8 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-military-figures-left-frustrated-200128154.html,"The decision that led to British bombs falling on Houthi targets in Yemen was made by Rishi Sunak at around 11am on Thursday.
Sitting at the head of the table in the Cabinet Office’s suite of rooms, specially protected for national security discussions, the Prime Minister gave the green light.
Alongside him were the Government’s most senior political, security and military figures. Grant Shapps, the Defence Secretary, Lord Cameron, the Foreign Secretary, Oliver Dowden, the Deputy Prime Minister, and James Cleverly, the Home Secretary, all attended.
So too did Mark Harper, the Transport Secretary – a nod to the disruption the Houthi Red Sea attacks were having on world trade – and Victoria Prentis, the attorney general whose legal approval was needed for action.Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the Chief of the Defence Staff, headed up military representation, a man who knew the realities of naval warfare, having been First Sea Lord. Sir Tim Barrow, the Prime Minister’s National Security Adviser, was present too.
That 10.30am gathering of Cobra was not the first time a military strike on the Houthis was considered.
The possibility had been discussed in Cobra meetings in December after a spate of attacks by the Houthis, a pro-Palestine Shia Islamist group which has been targeting cargo vessels passing through the Red Sea since the Israel-Hamas war broke out.
As aides and MPs took their Christmas holidays to catch a breath before election year, Whitehall security figures were mulling options for military intervention.
Hopes that action would not be needed after an apparent easing of Houthi attacks were dashed by a flurry of activity in the New Year, leading to a joint statement from Britain’s allies on Jan 3 that amounted to a “cease and desist” demand.
But on Tuesday night, the Houthis fired at US cargo ships with US military vessels stationed nearby. The rebel group fired almost 20 drones and a wave of missiles – ones that American and British military forces had to repel by force.
The assault, Washington and London decided, demanded a tough response. One that would be framed as self-defence but would also force the US and UK to step on to the front foot.
Then, on Wednesday night, a legal and diplomatic case to support the UK’s missile strike on Houthis gathered momentum after a UN Security Council resolution demanding an end to the group’s attacks was passed. Notably China and Russia abstained rather than vetoing.
The gathering of Cobra on Thursday morning, with some 15 people in the room, was meant to last 30 minutes. It overran, but only a little. By the end, Mr Sunak had made up his mind. “He made clear he agreed with the proposed operation,” said one source familiar with discussions.
There would be more formal steps to come. A wider National Security Council meeting came straight afterwards. A Cabinet meeting would be called for sign-off.
But from that Cobra meeting onwards, the plan to strike military targets was now being operationalised.
Complications abounded, however. For one, the Prime Minister had long planned to make news on Friday on military matters – just not about the Middle East.
Before Christmas, Downing Street had decided that Ukraine should be the first location in Mr Sunak’s 2024 international travel schedule and had been carefully preparing a secret Kyiv trip.
The destination had been selected as the perfect place to unveil Britain’s military aid donation to Ukraine for 2024, a delayed announcement which has left Tory MPs grumbling.
The £2.5 billion package of support to counter the Russian invasion, £200 million more than the amount pledged by Britain in previous years, includes drones and help on long-range missile capability.
But was it right for the Prime Minister to fly overseas as British fighter jets executed a military mission he had signed off? What if something went wrong?
The inevitable conversation about whether to cancel the trip to see Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, was ended by Mr Sunak himself, who decided travelling there would emphasise his message to the Kremlin that the West was not taking its eye off the conflict.
“He thought it sent an even bigger signal to Russia with the trip going ahead,” said a Downing Street source. “It shows we won’t be distracted one week from another from Ukraine by what is happening elsewhere. We will keep supporting Kyiv.”
The second complication was co-ordinating with the Americans. It is Washington, Whitehall insiders familiar with the planning for the strike accept that is leading on military matters.
Behind the scenes, the White House has been planning strikes on the Houthis for weeks. Joe Biden, the US president, has been meeting his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, on a “near daily basis” to discuss the Houthis and Operation Prosperity Guardian – the US-formed coalition of 22 countries to protect shipping in the Red Sea.
On New Year’s Day, following an attack on the Danish Maersk Hangzhou container ship that was repelled by US forces, Mr Biden ordered his team to “accelerate the pace” of building support for military action at the UN, according to a senior official.
The US and 13 allies issued a “final warning” on Jan 3, but Houthi rebels struck again on Tuesday in a complex attack of nearly 20 drones and three missiles – all shot down by US and UK forces.
“As soon as that attack was defeated, the president again convened his national security team and was presented with military options for a collective response together with close partners,” the official said.
“At the end of that meeting, the president directed [defence secretary Lloyd] Austin to carry out this response.”
The administration turned to its allies – including the UK – for assistance on the operation to take out more than 60 Houthi-controlled sites that intelligence had revealed were involved in launching drones and ballistic missiles.
The UK, unlike other members of Operation Prosperity Guardian, was willing to partake in the strikes, not just give rhetorical support.
Britain agreed to send four Typhoons and a refuelling plane from RAF’s Akrotiri base in Cyprus, while the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and Bahrain added logistical and intelligence support.
Italy declined to join the operation, telling the Biden administration it wanted to pursue a “calming” policy in the region.
A division of labour emerged, Britain becoming responsible for striking two targets – a site at Bani in the north-west said to be used for drone attacks and an airfield at Abbs – with the US hitting another 14.
Military co-operation between the two nations has long been the cornerstone of the “special relationship”, with British defence figures historically given passes to the Pentagon in Washington to roam freely.
But there came a point of tension on Thursday evening, as the strike time approached. It came when The Times reported that a Cabinet meeting had been called to discuss military action.
The Daily Telegraph has been told by one well-placed source that the US military expressed frustration with their counterparts. Usually such strikes are made public only once jets have returned to their bases.
The disquiet spread across Whitehall, as diplomatic and political figures tried to work out how the news leaked. “Deep disappointment” was said to be the prevailing mood.
As news of an imminent strike leaked in the UK, the Wall Street Journal published a story citing “maritime executives” in Yemen who had been warned by the US government to expect strikes in the coming hours.
The newspaper said it had been told of plans to strike radar stations, weapons depots and drone launch sites.
It has become convention over the past 20 years, rather than law or constitution, that Parliament is given a say, and a vote, on military action. But Parliament was bypassed this time, with ministers fearing it would make the strike less effective by giving the Houthis more time to react.
Ministers on Friday argued that the strike was self-defense and one-off in nature, so skipping a vote was justifiable – an argument Labour did not contest.
Meanwhile, the true scale of US grumbling about the leak is unclear. In an interview with the Telegraph on Friday, Mr Shapps said he was not aware of any frustrations in Washington over the leak.
Senior Whitehall figures insisted that it had no impact on the timing or approach of the military action itself.
A Cabinet call took place at 7.45pm on Thursday. Mr Sunak, who had left Downing Street late afternoon to travel to Ukraine, spoke first, followed by most of the senior ministers who attended the Cobra meeting that morning.
“Warnings to the Houthis have not been heeded. These are targeted and proportionate actions,” the Prime Minister said, or words to that effect, according to one person present.
The next task was to bring the official opposition into the loop.
Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and John Healey, the Labour shadow defence secretary, were called into the Cabinet Office for around 8.15pm, along with Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the House of Commons Speaker, for a briefing.
Stephen Flynn, who as SNP leader headed up the third biggest party in the Commons, was not invited, triggering heated complaints the following day. Nor were the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Dowden led the briefing. He would remain in Whitehall with Mr Sunak overseas, as British pilots dropped their payload on the Yemeni sites at about 11.30pm.
Only once the mission was complete, in the early hours of Friday morning, did the Deputy Prime Minister head home, with the job done.

Q6UEG4PGGQ_6K884QFKJ0WKY93,UK and US launch strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen,Ben Farmer,"January 12, 2024 at 7:49 PM·4 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/uk-us-launch-strikes-against-114957425.html,"Britain and the United States have launched missile and air strikes against Yemen’s Houthi militants, prompting rebel officials to warn that the allies would pay a “heavy price” in response.
Jets and warships struck dozens of targets overnight in retaliation against weeks of Houthi drone and missile strikes on commercial shipping in one of the world’s busiest waterways.
Rishi Sunak said Britain was standing up “for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade”, while Joe Biden said the strikes were a response to “unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea”.
The US Air Force said it had hit more than 60 targets at 16 sites, including “command-and-control nodes, munitions depots, launching systems, production facilities and air defence radar systems”.
Houthi television said strikes hit the capital Sana’a, as well as the cities of Hodeida and Saada.
The strikes began at around 2.30am (11.30pm GMT) with American jets flying from the carrier USS Eisenhower and Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from a submarine and other warships.
Four RAF Typhoon jets supported by a refuelling tanker flew from Akrotiri in Cyprus to hit two targets with laser-guided 500lb Paveway bombs. The first, in Bani in north-western Yemen, was described as a facility to launch reconnaissance and attack drones. The second, an airfield at Abbs, was described as a launch site for cruise missiles and drones.
James Heappey, the armed forces minister, said the strikes were legitimate and were in self-defence.
“Whatever you think of the Houthis’ cause and their justification… we cannot allow them to seek to choke off global trade as a ransom to achieve whatever their political and diplomatic aims are,” he told the BBC.
The Iran-backed Houthis said in total the allied strikes had killed five people and wounded six.
The movement said they would expand their response to the attacks “very soon”, without giving further details.
Hussein al-Ezzi, a Houthi official in their foreign ministry, said there had been “a massive aggressive attack by American and British ships, submarines and warplanes”.
“America and Britain will undoubtedly have to prepare to pay a heavy price and bear all the dire consequences of this blatant aggression,” he said.
The Houthis began attacking and seizing ships in mid-November, saying they were acting in support of Hamas and would not back down until Israel stopped fighting in Gaza.
There have been at least 26 attacks so far, prompting a lot of traffic to avoid the Red Sea and instead take longer, more costly routes around the Cape of Good Hope.
Mohammed Abdul-Salam, the Houthis’ chief negotiator and spokesman, accused America and Britain of having “committed foolishness with this treacherous aggression”.
“They were wrong if they thought that they would deter Yemen from supporting Palestine and Gaza,” he wrote online. Houthi “targeting will continue to affect Israeli ships or those heading to the ports of occupied Palestine”, he wrote.
Oil prices jumped by more than 2 per cent in trading after the strikes.
Saudi Arabia, which has led a military campaign against the Houthis since 2015, called for “restraint and avoiding escalation” following the US and UK strikes. The official Saudi Press Agency said the Gulf kingdom was watching the operation with “great concern”.
Yemen has been blighted by war and political crisis for more than a decade and is regarded as one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises.
Protests in 2011 inspired by the Arab Spring, forced Ali Abdullah Saleh, the president, to resign and in the ensuing turmoil Houthi rebels seized much of the country.
Saudi-led forces intervened to support the internationally recognised government and years of fighting has also included activity by al-Qaeda and Islamic State jihadist groups.
At least 150,000 people are estimated to have died in the civil war and three quarters of the population are judged to need some form of aid.

QA31TV8XUL_P4YJHMDK3GUULV1,Tesla puts German factory production on hold as Red Sea attacks disrupt supply chains,Associated Press,"January 12, 2024 at 6:03 PM·1 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/tesla-puts-german-factory-production-100307659.html,"BERLIN (AP) — Tesla says it's temporarily halting most production at its German factory because of attacks in the Red Sea, a vital global shipping corridor.
The electric vehicle maker said in a statement Thursday night that its factory near Berlin, which makes Model Y vehicles and batteries, will pause from Jan. 29 to Feb. 11.
It’s a fresh sign of how the hostilities in the Mideast are disrupting global manufacturing supply chains, with shipping companies reporting that they’re being forced to reroute vessels carrying goods and components on the longer route around the southern tip of Africa. Analysts say the detour adds 10 days or more to the journey.
“The armed conflicts in the Red Sea and the associated shifts in transport routes between Europe and Asia via the Cape of Good Hope are also affecting production in Grünheide,"" Tesla said. “The significantly longer transport times create a gap in the supply chains.”
The U.S. led airstrikes on Thursday against Yemen's Houthi rebels in response to their attacks on Red Sea shipping,
Tesla said normal operations are expected to resume on Feb. 12. The factory in Grünheide, southeast of Berlin, is Tesla's first in Europe. It opened in 2022 and employs 11,000 workers."

The world’s governments and major international organizations are meeting in the Swiss town of Davos for the 54th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) this week from Jan. 14-19. The forum’s theme this year is “Rebuilding Trust” and is focused on four pillars: security, job growth, artificial intelligence, and climate.
For Ukraine, Davos is a chance to keep the world’s attention on its cause and to get in front of the global business elite in the hopes of convincing them Ukraine is a worthwhile place to put its money.
Eighty countries and one international organization attended the fourth national security advisers' meeting on Ukraine’s Peace Formula at Davos on Jan. 14. Andriy Yermak, head of the office of the president, was present at the meeting.
President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in Davos on Jan. 16, where he met with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, as well as the world’s finance leaders, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, BlackRock Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand, and CEO of Blackstone Group Stephen Schwarzman.
Lakshmi Mittal, the chairman of ArcelorMittal, a steel manufacturer that is one of Ukraine's biggest international investors, as well as Carlyle Group Inc. co-founder David Rubenstein, U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine's Economic Recovery Penny Pritzker, and others were also present at the meeting with the finance giants.
During the meeting, Zelensky underscored the importance of attracting private capital to reconstruction projects in Ukraine, the Presidential Office's website said.
The New York-based bank has been working with the presidential administration to attract that private capital. Last September, JPMorgan executives hosted a roundtable with Zelensky that included billionaire Mike Bloomberg, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and others to discuss reconstruction and investment opportunities in Ukraine.
Ukraine’s Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov was also at Davos, where he met with Palantir, IBM, Cisco, Amazon Web Services, Visa, SAP. In a post on Telegram, Fedorov personally thanked each company for their work in Ukraine. According to the minister, IBM is planning on translating its software into Ukrainian, and Amazon Web Services has allocated $100 million in aid to Ukraine since 2022.
“The day was very busy and productive. We will continue to work for Ukraine,” Fedorov wrote on Telegram on Jan. 15.
Before heading to Davos, U.S. Special Representative for Economic Recovery in Ukraine Penny Pritzker, along with representatives of American businesses, arrived in Kyiv on Jan. 12, where she met with top Ukrainian officials, including Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov.
""The key theme (of the meeting) is the strengthening of the Ukrainian economy, the short-term recovery, and long-term development,"" said Shmyhal. ""We are counting on the participation of private companies from the U.S. in the reconstruction of Ukraine,” adding that one of the main focuses was ensuring the stability of Ukrainian exports.
Pritzker commented on the meeting with Shmyhal, saying they discussed ""the positive impacts of Ukraine’s reform agenda, export routes, and how we can operationalize ways to increase private sector investment.""
She also thanked Kubrakov for ""a substantive discussion with Ukrainian officials and private sector reps on practical steps to increase Ukraine’s exports and restore its economic vitality, a crucial counterpoint to Russia’s aggression.""
Pritzker and the delegation also met with Parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk and representatives of the political parties in the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s parliament. The parties addressed assistance to Ukraine’s private sector and confiscating Russian sovereign assets frozen in the West.
Speaking of those frozen assets at Davos on Jan. 15, Pritzker said the decision to seize them is unlikely to happen quickly, but isn’t unrealistic. ""I think there's enormous hope that the Russian sovereign assets could become an easy source of financing,"" Pritzker said.
This year, Ukraine has its sights on deeper ties with Western defense companies. To do so, the country is planning on creating joint defense enterprises with Western companies and bringing more weapons production to Ukraine.
As aid for Ukraine is at risk around the world, Kyiv knows developing its domestic weapons production is key in continuing to fight off its invading neighbor.
Speaking with the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 10, Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said that Ukraine plans to launch five joint ventures with Western arms manufacturers this year, adding that Ukrainian Defense Industry, a state-owned enterprise that also operates under the name Ukroboronprom, is a ""top priority"" for the coming year.
President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Jan. 10 during his visit to Vilnius that Ukraine had ""reached a number of significant agreements"" that pave the way to joint defense production with Lithuanian companies.
Defense Minister Rustem Umerov also announced on Jan. 5 that Ukraine and Latvia are planning joint projects in drone production. Umerov had said in December that the government aims to localize arms production in Ukraine in 2024.
The country is also planning to develop industrial parks and funds have been allocated for their renovation and construction. Currently there are 70 industrial parks registered in Ukraine, but in reality there are only 10 actually in operation, Svyrydenko said on Jan. 11 at an event dedicated to the review of the Ukrainian economy in 2023, organized by the Kyiv-based Center for Economic Strategy.
With future funding from allies now uncertain and the state budget deficit estimated at Hr 1.57 trillion ($41.3 billion) this year, Ukraine’s private sector must step in to keep the country afloat through tax contributions and employment while the government’s fiscal efforts focus primarily on the war, Kyiv Independent business reporter Dominic Culverwell writes in a recent op-ed.
Culverwell says he’s spoken with numerous business leaders and financial chiefs who have all told him the same thing: Ukrainian companies need investments, not just financial aid. While the latter is important, foreign investors are more likely to inject larger sums of money into Ukraine, helping its economic revival.
There are obvious risks while the war is ongoing, but foreign investments will ensure that Ukrainian businesses can stand on their own two feet in the long run as well as forge relationships with international companies. If successful, the rewards for both parties will be high, particularly for those who get in early.
Ukrainian companies want to be self-sustainable, not constantly begging for donations. With reconstruction costs estimated to be around 411 billion euros ($449.9 billion), Ukraine will need to partially pay for this itself, which will have to be a joint effort from both the public and private sectors.
Foreign entities willing to work with Ukrainian companies will bolster not only Ukraine’s economy but also provide jobs and income to the countries investing, easing the fiscal pressure on Ukraine’s allies and building fruitful commercial connections post-war, Culverwell writes.

In our latest interview for our Talking Business in Ukraine series, we spoke to the mobile-only hugely popular Monobank’s two co-owners Oleg Gorokhovskyi and Mykhailo Rogalskyi. The bank’s application has facilitated nearly $1 billion in donations to fund the war effort since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
The Kyiv Independent: How has Monobank lived through these almost two years of war?
Oleg Gorokhovskyi: These almost two years have been mentally challenging for us, as for everyone. We had to make many unconventional business decisions regarding the team's safety, server security, and continuous office operation. We also had to shift our focus from business solutions to charity tools, organize fundraisers, and provide banking services for Ukrainians in Europe.
The Kyiv Independent: If we compare Monobank in December 2023 and January 2022, how does it differ from the pre-war period?
Oleg Gorokhovskyi: We haven't laid off anyone or reduced any salaries. We have acquired a fintech startup and went from 2,611 to 2,741 employees (since the start of the full-scale invasion), which includes Universal Bank (Monobank’s partner bank) and (Monobank developer) Fintech Band. Regarding the number of clients, on Jan. 1, 2022, we had 6.77 million active clients, and now it's almost 8 million.
The Kyiv Independent: How do you assess the current business climate in Ukraine?
Mykhailo Rogalskyi: It's a good time for the development of small and medium-sized businesses in many niches. As one of our acquaintances says, ""In Kyiv now, it's like this: put a stick in the ground—and a cherry tree will grow.""

Five EU members sign letter to Brussels demanding customs duties on Ukrainian food products. The EU members bordering Ukraine appealed to Brussels to impose customs duties on Ukrainian agricultural products, claiming local farmers are suffering significant losses, Hungary’s Agriculture Minister Istvan Nagy said on Jan. 15. The agriculture ministries of Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia sent a letter to Brussels requesting solutions for farmers in the eastern EU states. They claim that cheaper Ukrainian products are undercutting local farmers, burdening agricultural production. Meanwhile, Romania's Agriculture Ministry agreed to meet several demands of Romanian farmers who have been blocking the country's major roads and two crossings on the border with Ukraine, Euractiv reported on Jan. 16.
Border Guard: Polish truckers unblock 2 crossings at Ukraine border. Polish truckers ended their blockade of Korczowa-Krakovets and Hrebenne-Rava Ruska checkpoints — two of the three border crossings with Ukraine that have been blocked by the truckers’ protests since November last year, Ukraine’s Border Guard Service reported on Jan. 16. Earlier the same day, Polish Infrastructure Minister Dariusz Klimczak announced that Warsaw had reached an agreement with the Polish truckers who would end their blockade of the border until March 1. Discussions are reportedly ongoing, the success of which will determine whether the truckers resume their protest after March 1.
Reuters: US Treasury deputy secretary to coordinate new Russia sanctions authority in Europe and Japan. U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo will hold meetings in Europe and Japan this month to coordinate a new Russia sanctions authority that focuses on financial institutions, Reuters reported on Jan. 15, citing a Treasury spokesperson. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the spokesperson told Reuters that the deputy secretary will focus on coordination with partners in using a “new tool” to prevent Russia’s government from bypassing sanctions and getting supplied by G7 economies with critical goods for its military.
European Commission approves Romanian 126-million-euro fund to support Danube ports impacted by war. The European Commission approved on Jan. 11 a 126-million-euro ($138 million) fund to help strengthen Romanian port infrastructure and reduce congestion caused by increased Ukrainian exports. Romania plays a crucial role in Ukrainian exports amid Russia's threats to Black Sea maritime transport, shipping out almost 60% of Ukraine's produce. Romanian and Ukrainian officials have been working to expand the capacity of Romania's shipping infrastructure on the Danube River and Black Sea.
Ukraine designates Subway as 'international sponsor of war.' American fast food chain Subway has been added to Ukraine's list of ""international sponsors of war"" for its continued presence in the Russian market, the National Agency on Corruption Prevention (NACP) announced on Jan. 10. Over 500 Subway franchises continue to operate in the Russian market, which pay ""hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes to the budget of the Russian Federation,"" the NACP said. The ""international sponsor of war"" list is designed to be ""a powerful reputational tool"" to encourage the exit of international business from Russia and reduce Moscow's financial ability to continue its war against Ukraine.

QD31PBTU94_CIO5TT4T3O8FACI,Belarus accused of illegally transferring Ukrainian children across border,Euronews,10 January 2024 at 12:47 pm·1-min read,20240110,yahoo.com,https://au.news.yahoo.com/belarus-accused-illegally-transferring-ukrainian-184734349.html,"Belarus state television is reporting that authorities sent a recently arrived group of Ukrainian children from occupied Ukraine to train with the Belarusian military to learn how to evacuate in the event of a fire.
Ukraine and the Belarusian opposition allege that Russian ally Belarus is engaging in the illegal transfer of Ukrainian children to Belarus on a mass scale, which critics say is a campaign to indoctrinate the children as pro-Russian.
The report, released on Wednesday, referred to some 35 children from the Russian-occupied Ukrainian town of Antratsyt in eastern Ukraine.
It’s been claimed that they were sent to the eastern Belarusian city of Mogilev.
The Belarus1 state television channel said the children are being housed in a sanatorium and are being cared for by employees from the Ministry of Emergency Situations. The military is “teaching the children how to behave in extreme situations,” the state television channel reported.
More than 2,400 Ukrainian children aged 6 to 17 have been brought to Belarus from four Ukrainian regions partially occupied by Russian troops, a recent Yale University study found.

The Belarusian opposition has called on the International Criminal Court to bring Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and officials in his government to justice for their involvement in the illegal transfer of Ukrainian children to Belarus.
State television footage released on Wednesday showed the Ukrainian children wearing the Russian flag sewn onto their sleeves. The state television program said the Belarusian military is conducting “emergency survival training” for the children.
Ukrainian authorities said they are investigating the deportation of the children as a possible genocide. The Prosecutor General of Ukraine has said Belarus is also being investigated over the alleged forced deportation of more than 19,000 children from occupied Ukrainian territories."

In measures Ottawa said were aimed at shielding advanced and emerging technologies, government grants will not be provided to researchers with links to universities connected to defense and security entities of countries that could harm security.
The universities are mostly based in China but a few from Iran and Russia are also listed.
""While Canadian-led research is defined by its excellence and collaborative nature, its openness can make it a target for foreign influence,"" the ministers of innovation, health, and public safety said in a joint statement.
An official said that while the policy affected only federal funding, the Ottawa government hoped it would used as guidance by provincial governments and Canadian institutions.
In 2022, Canada arrested and charged a researcher with espionage for allegedly trying to steal trade secrets to benefit China.
Canada is a member of the ""Five Eyes"" alliance with Britain, the United States, New Zealand and Australia. Last year the grouping's intelligence chiefs accused China of intellectual property theft and using artificial intelligence for hacking and spying against the nations.
China routinely rejects such charges.
The U.S. has long accused China of intellectual property theft and the issue has been a major sore point in U.S.-China relations.

Since the industry cannot deliver the desired precision ammunition immediately, the option to first release ammunition from German army stocks is being considered, in order to respond to the request promptly, according to the report.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean appeals court has thrown out the conviction of a local company charged with violating trade laws for its work on Taiwan's new military submarine program, a ruling reviewed by Reuters showed.
Prosecutors had accused SI Innotec, a marine technology firm, of supplying Taiwan with submarine manufacturing equipment without a government approval.
A lower court in 2022 found SI Innotec guilty and handed a company executive a suspended jail sentence. The firm has denied wrongdoing and appealed, saying that the equipment was not designed solely for military purposes and did not involve sensitive technology.
A three-judge panel at the Changwon District Court on Thursday found there was not sufficient evidence to consider the equipment as military goods that require export approval from the government, according to the ruling.
""The evidence submitted by the prosecution alone is not sufficient to acknowledge that the equipment in this case is equivalent to production equipment specially designed for submarine production,"" the panel said in the SI Innotec ruling.
Prosecutors did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. SI Innotec declined to comment.
Reuters reported in October that South Korean authorities cited the risk of Chinese economic retaliation when they charged SI Innotec for its work on Taiwan's submarine project.
Reuters found two other South Korean companies, Keumha Naval Technology (KHNT) and S2&K, were also on trial on charges of breaking trade laws over their work on the Taiwan submarine program, and one of their executives was accused of industrial espionage. KHNT was not immediately reachable for comment. S2&K declined to comment.
Amid rising military tensions with China, Taiwan unveiled its first home-grown submarine on Sept. 28 in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.

Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of the Security Council of Russia, took aim at the country in a post Friday on X as U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was arriving in Kyiv to announce a major funding package for Ukraine.
The U.K. will provide around $3.2 billion of military aid to Ukraine over the coming year, its largest annual commitment since Russia's invasion nearly two years ago.
Medvedev, who served as Russian president from 2008 and 2012, also posited a hypothetical situation where Sunak would come under military fire while in the Ukrainian capital.
THE BIGGEST TWISTS IN RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR IN 2023
""The British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has arrived in Kiev to sign a ‘historic UK-Ukraine Agreement on Security Cooperation,’"" Medvedev wrote.
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
""What would [the] Western public say, if the British representatives happened to be bombarded with cluster ammunition in the center of Kiev, just as was the case with our innocent civilians in Belgorod?""
Medvedev was referring to a Dec. 30 attack on Russian civilians in the city of Belgorod, in southern Russia near the Ukrainian border, where at least 20 people were killed, including two children, and 111 injured in what it called an ""indiscriminate"" Ukrainian strike using cluster bombs.
Medvedev then went on to warn the U.K. about potentially deploying a military contingent in Ukraine.
YEMEN'S HOUTHIS VOW US-UK JOINT AIRSTRIKES WILL 'NOT GO UNANSWERED OR UNPUNISHED'
""And I also hope that our archenemies, the impudent British understand that officially stationing their troops in Ukraine would mean declaration of war against our country,"" Medvedev wrote.
Ukrainian news outlet RBC-Ukraine quoted unnamed sources as saying Ukrainian forces had directed fire at military targets in Belgorod in response to the massive Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities the previous day.
On Friday, Sunak said that the U.K. ""will not falter"" in its commitment to help Ukraine forces stand up to Putin’s full-scale invasion.
""Today we are going further — increasing our military aid, delivering thousands of cutting-edge drones, and signing a historic new Security Agreement to provide Ukraine with the assurances it needs for the long term,"" Sunak said.
Ukraine and Russia are seeking to replenish their arsenals this year, military analysts say, in anticipation of possible major ground offensives in 2025.
On X, Sunak wrote that Britain is with Ukraine for ""as long as it takes.""

The move was expected, with Deutz saying it plans to focus more on classic engines and its service business.
The sale is expected to be finalized towards the end of the first quarter and should result in a book profit in the lower double-digit million euro range.

Allegedly, the partisans received some information directly from Russian conscripts manning the base, though it is unclear whether the conscripts were motivated by pro-Ukrainian sentiment or were simply tricked.
All intelligence gathered was passed on to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Atesh said.
Atesh has been responsible for a number of infiltrations of Russian military facilities and bases, having previously revealed the existence of complex fortifications in Crimea, bases in occupied eastern Ukraine, and factory plans from within Russia itself.

De Croo also noted that 2024 will be a ""decisive year,"" when democracy and freedom will be “tested"" and he called on MEPs to maintain solidarity with Ukraine and continue military support.
The Belgian leader also mentioned the U.S. presidential election, noting that if former U.S. President Donald Trump wins the presidential election, Europe will be left ""on its own.""
""If 2024 brings us America First again, it will be more than ever Europe on its own,"" he said.

Bild, citing its own sources in the intelligence service of one European country, reported that Russia may try to attack Europe in late 2024 or early 2025, when the United States will be ""without a leader"" and unable to come Europe’s, at least temporarily.
This refers to the period between the possible departure of current U.S. President Joe Biden in early November 2024 and the inauguration of his potential successor in January 2025.
The U.S. presidential election is scheduled for Nov. 5, 2024. The main candidates are incumbent Joe Biden and Donald Trump.
The New York Times wrote on Dec. 9, 2023, that Europe fears that Donald Trump's second presidency could lead to the actual withdrawal of the United States from NATO and the destruction of the North Atlantic Alliance, which would only benefit Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.

The National Resistance Center pointed out that the Russian Federation is already transporting rubbish from Rostov Oblast to the temporarily occupied territories of Donetsk Oblast, having abandoned plans to build a new landfill site near the city of Rostov due to protests from local residents.

Sweden applied to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in May 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine but the accession process, which requires the approval of all existing members, has been held up by Turkey and Hungary.
Ratification has been stranded in the Hungarian parliament for more than a year, with Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling nationalists saying there is no threat to Sweden's security and citing what they call undue Swedish allegations that they have eroded democracy in Hungary.
Sweden was ""not taking any steps to strengthen trust in order for our relationship to become one of allies and friends"", Gergely Gulyas, Orban's chief of staff, told a briefing.
""This relationship is one of allies legally right now, but it cannot be considered friendly, thus I need to conclude that it is not a priority for Sweden to join NATO quickly at all today.""
The Swedish foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
Gulyas suggested that Sweden's foreign minister or prime minister should ""get in touch and ask what concerns the Hungarian parliament has"" about Sweden's NATO accession.
Replying to a reporter's question, he said Hungary wanted to avoid being the last country to ratify Sweden's NATO accession, but ""we will probably not manage to do so without Sweden's help. Why should it be important to me if it is not important to Sweden?""
Orban's government, which has maintained warm ties with Moscow despite Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has repeatedly promised that it will not be the last to ratify the Nordic country's bid.
Hungary's parliament, currently on a winter break, will resume its work some time around mid-February.
The Turkish parliament's general assembly may debate Sweden's NATO membership bid in the coming weeks, the ruling AK Party's parliamentary group chairman said last week.

The EU is seeking to agree more financial aid for Ukraine as it battles a Russian invasion when the bloc's leaders meet at the start of February, although Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban remains opposed.
""We are negotiating with the (European) Commission but our positions are far from each other, so an agreement is not certain,"" Gergely Gulyas told a briefing.
""However, a lack of agreement would not be a tragedy either because in that case the 26 members states can support Ukraine,"" he said, adding that Hungary did not rule out supporting Ukraine bilaterally.
Ursula von der Leyen, who heads the EU's executive Commission, said on Wednesday she was confident of finding a solution between the bloc's 27 members.
Gulyas said that Hungary was against supporting Ukraine ""by taking out a loan, and we do not think it is a good idea to do it within the EU's budget either because Hungary's money might end up being given to Ukraine.""
While EU leaders last month agreed to start accession talks with Ukraine, Hungary vetoed extending the money to Kyiv.
The Commission has proposed channelling the aid through a review of the EU's shared 2024-27 budget, which would also provide more financing for migration and other priorities.
Providing aid under 26 bilateral deals is an option that has been discussed, but is more complicated and expensive than going via central coffers, and could damage EU unity.

The inseparable duo have decided to make it official and purchase a home together. After all, her current luxury penthouse in Miami just won’t do. No doubt it is lacking the extra square footage needed for welcome home parties every day Marcus steps through their private elevator door.
View this post on Instagram
A post shared by Larsa Pippen (@larsapippen)
Larsa has made it loud and clear all season long that she wants to be with her boyfriend Marcus 24/7. Much to the dismay of her bestie, Kiki Barth. And apparently being together all the time requires as much square footage as possible for their living quarters. Because although they are joined at the hip, they need at least a few rooms to have their space at some point during the day.
TMZ reported Larsa wants to have more living space with Marcus. Her current Miami home is a 3,312 square foot penthouse. Which is obviously too small for two people. Her home is listed on the market for a mere $4.199 million. Larsa originally bought the property in 2022 for $3.375 million. She has since made several upgrades, such as fancy wallpaper and window blackouts.
Once her current downtown Miami home is sold, will the love birds stay on the east coast or move to the west coast? Lately, Los Angeles has been like a second home for the couple. However, the two are looking to make their purchase in Miami. Which makes sense as Larsa would need to stay in the area to keep her mojito.
Next season will be a battle of who has the biggest and bougiest Miami penthouse as both Lisa Hochstein and Alexia Nepola are also on the hunt for new digs. And even though Alexia’s son Frankie won’t settle for less, I’m sure that Larsa will end up top dog in the group with the most luxurious and spacious penthouse.
If you can’t get enough of Larsa and Marcus on RHOM, you can also catch them on Season 2 of The Traitors, which is streaming on Peacock. Real Housewives of Miami continues Wednesdays, 9/8c on Bravo.

Noor Mohammad Hanif, director of Information and Culture department in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarhar province said that officials at the Torkham began asking for passports and visas from Afghan drivers.
Truckers have for years been able to pass the border without documents so they generally do not have them.
Hanif said that, in response, Afghanistan is now asking Pakistani drivers for passports and visas.
In a separate statement, the Nangarhar governor’s office said that officials from both sides are in talks to solve the problem, and a “decision will be made soon,” it added.
The Torkham border crossing has been closed a number of times in recent months, including in September when it was shut for nine days due to clashes between border forces.
On Saturday, dozens of trucks carrying perishable items, including vegetables and fruits, waited on each side of the border for the reopening of the crossing, which is a vital commercial artery and a trade route to Central Asian countries for Pakistan.
Pakistan is concerned about the presence in Afghanistan of the Pakistani Taliban, which is a close ally of the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan has said many Pakistani Taliban leaders and fighters have found sanctuary in Afghanistan and have been emboldened to carry out more attacks on security forces in Pakistan.
The Afghan Taliban government insists it does not allow the Pakistani Taliban to use its soil to launch attacks in Pakistan.
This comes just days after one of Pakistan’s most senior politicians, Fazlur Rehman, whose Jamiat Ulema Islam party is known for backing the Afghan Taliban, visited Kabul in an attempt to reduce lingering tensions between the two countries.
Rehman was the first senior Pakistani politician to visit Kabul since the Taliban seized power in neighboring Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops withdrew from the country after 20 years of war.
Tensions also exist around Pakistan’s ongoing expulsion of Afghans.
Pakistan has deported more than half a million Afghans without valid papers in recent months. Pakistan has long hosted about 1.7 million Afghans, most of whom fled during the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation. More than half a million fled Afghanistan when the Taliban seized power."

The Somali authorities turned back Ethiopian Airlines flight ET8372 “after it became clear that the aircraft did not have any permission to use Somali air space,” the Somalia Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement on Wednesday. The flight’s passengers included “VIP Ethiopian delegates” en route to the Somaliland capital of Hargeisa, CAA Director-General Ahmed Moalim said by phone, without identifying them.
Relations between the two nations have been strained since Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced on Jan. 1 that his country will recognize Somaliland as a sovereign state and hand over an unspecified stake in state-owned Ethiopian Airlines Group in return for access to the Red Sea. The accord will enable Addis Ababa to lease land from Somaliland that it can use to establish a military base and for commercial maritime purposes.
Somalia lays sovereign claim to Somaliland and has threatened military retaliation should Ethiopia advance with its plans. Officials from Egypt, Eritrea and Saudi Arabia have either visited Somalia or issued statements in support of its sovereignty since the agreement was signed.

Ethiopian Airlines operates a commercial service between Addis Ababa and Hargeisa. Flight ET8372 took off from the Ethiopian capital at 8:32 a.m. local time, turned back before it reached the Somali border, and landed again at 10:20 a.m., according to the aircraft-tracker FlightRadar24’s website.
Ethiopian Airlines and Ethiopian State Minister for Government Communication Services Selamawit Kassa didn’t respond to a request for comment. Somaliland officials declined to comment on the planned delegation, or who was part of the trip citing security reasons.
A former British protectorate, Somaliland united with Italian Somalia in 1960 after independence, before breaking away in 1991 after a civil war erupted.
It holds elections, issues its own passports, prints its own currency and has signed international investment deals, including with Dubai’s DP World Ltd. to expand its main port, and with London-based Genel Energy Plc for oil exploration. But it’s failed to gain international recognition that would allow it to receive funding and aid from institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, with only Taiwan having recognized its independence.
Arab League
Egypt’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday it “will spare no effort” in its support of Somalia. Egypt invites “all Arab and international parties to carry out their responsibility to express their respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Somalia,” it said. The message came as foreign ministers from the 22-member Arab League held a virtual meeting on Ethiopia’s deal with Somaliland.
The US is concerned that Ethiopia’s deal to access the Red Sea may undermine efforts to contain the Islamist military group al-Shabaab, which controls parts of Somalia and has been fighting to overthrow the government.
“We support Somalia’s sovereignty, their territorial integrity,” John Kirby, a spokesman the US National Security Council, told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. “What we’re particularly concerned about is that this MOU recently now inked between Ethiopia and Somaliland threatens to disrupt the fight that Somalis, Africans, and regional international partners, including us, are waging against al-Shabaab. And al-Shabaab remains a viable terrorist threat in the region, without question.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Dozens of U.S. lawmakers co-sponsored legislation on Wednesday praising democracy in Taiwan ahead of its presidential and parliamentary elections, prompting China to call for the U.S. to stop official contact with the island.
""Resolved, That the Senate ... is committed to supporting Taiwan's self-defense and the liberty of its people through effective deterrence using all elements of United States power,"" read the resolution, which has at least 28 Republican and Democratic sponsors in the Senate.
The resolution praises Taiwan's ""rule of law and vibrant civil society, diverse economy, and stable political system,"" and contrasts that with the situation in China.
Taiwan's voters head to the polls on Saturday for presidential and parliamentary elections that are taking place against a backdrop of a ramped-up war of words between Taiwan and China, which views the island as its own territory despite the strong objections of the Taiwanese government.
Taiwan's government has accused China of an unprecedented campaign of election interference, using everything from military activity to trade sanctions to sway the vote toward candidates Beijing may prefer.
The resolution's sponsors hope it will pass by unanimous consent this week.
Republican Dan Sullivan, who led the resolution with Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, said, ""I think it's really important for the United States in a bipartisan way to show steady, unwavering support and commitment to Taiwan's democracy and continue to undertake policies to enhance cross-Strait deterrence.""
He stressed that the measure's backers are not choosing sides in Taiwan's presidential race. ""There's three strong candidates, three strong parties. Our commitment just needs to be to a fair process that's not undermined by coercive activities by Beijing,"" he told Reuters.
Asked for comment on the resolution, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China's embassy in the U.S., said in an emailed statement that China ""firmly opposes"" the U.S. having any official contact with Taiwan and said Washington must refrain from ""interfering"" in its elections.
SECURITY ASSISTANCE IN LIMBO
The U.S. is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties with the island, which China views as its own territory.
Democratic President Joe Biden asked the Senate last year to approve billions of dollars in security assistance for Taiwan, but lawmakers have not yet voted on his request. Republicans insist the aid package - which also includes money for Ukraine's war with Russia - be tied to an overhaul of U.S. immigration policy.
Sullivan said negotiators were ""making progress"" on the Taiwan component of the supplemental funding request, but that it depended on whether Democrats would agree to a significant border security component.
Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives introduced a nearly identical measure on Taiwan. The House version of the resolution is led by Democratic Representatives Gerald Connolly and Ami Bera, and Republicans Andy Barr and Mario Diaz-Balart, leaders of the Taiwan caucus.
Taiwan's de facto ambassador to the United States, Alexander Yui, met with House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday, prompting a complaint from China.
Beijing says Taiwan is the most sensitive and important issue in Sino-U.S. relations.

RAZD11AAVN_GGLNM0MU4QJ0UGG,Franz Welser-Möst is back with Cleveland Orchestra after cancer surgery and slipped disk,RONALD BLUM,"January 19, 2024 at 12:51 AM·5 min read",20240111,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/franz-welser-m-st-back-165111860.html,"NEW YORK (AP) — Franz Welser-Möst is back on the Cleveland Orchestra's podium, concentrating again on music instead of his health.
“It was not my best year, the last year,"" he said Wednesday. “I feel good. You learn to live with the circumstances, and I'm extremely and grateful that I'm back at work.”
On track to surpass George Szell as Cleveland's longest-tenured music director, the 63-year-old Austrian returned to his orchestra at Cleveland's Severance Music Center last week and leads it in a pair of programs at Carnegie Hall this weekend. He will be in Austria for five concerts with the Vienna Philharmonic in late February, then leads that orchestra on a seven-concert tour in early March to New York and Naples and West Palm Beach, Florida.
Quite a schedule, given his setbacks in 2023.
He had a slipped disk in his neck while conducting Wagner's four-opera “Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung)” at the Vienna State Opera in June, an injury that caused him to enter an orthopedic clinic in the second half of July and again in August. He was forced to cancel a high-profile new production of Verdi's “Macbeth” at the Salzburg Festival.
Welser-Möst had surgery Sept. 1 to remove a cancerous tumor from his bladder and came back to Cleveland to conduct the orchestra's season opener on Sept. 28. After leading two weeks of programs there, he took the orchestra to Vienna and Linz for their 21st international tour together, then had a second operation on Oct. 25.
That was followed in November by six weeks of once-a-week immunotherapy treatment. He is scheduled for additional three-week cycles of treatment in March, July and October.
“The doctors are very happy. So am I, that it seems to work. It has been in my family, so it’s genetic,” Welser-Möst said. “Both my brothers had the same thing a couple of years ago. Both are very well now, so there’s every reason to be optimistic.”
Welser-Möst has been Cleveland's music director since 2002-03 and has appointed 69 musicians, including 52 of the current 105 members.
“One of the keys to Franz's success is his incredible discipline. He's like a great athlete in that way,” said André Gremillet, the Cleveland Orchestra’s president and CEO. “He’s very focused, very disciplined in the way he approaches everything, and I think that has served him well also in facing his health challenges.”
His name at birth in Linz, Austria, was Franz Leopold Maria Möst, and he switched it in 1985 to Welser-Möst in honor of Wels, a nearby city he grew up in. The change was made on the advice of a benefactor, Baron Andreas von Bennigsen of Liechtenstein.
Welser-Möst spent a decade studying the technique of Herbert von Karajan, the Berlin Philharmonic’s chief conductor from 1954-89. He was 19 when he was brought to Karajan in 1979 by Albert Moser, then general director of Vienna’s Musikverein. Welser-Möst was among the 10 finalists of the Karajan International Conductors Competition, though he failed to win.
“I’d been to a lot of rehearsals in Vienna, in Salzburg and Berlin, and that made a huge impression on me because Karajan was highly efficient in rehearsals,” Welser-Möst recalled. “He would just say one sentence and the sound of the orchestra changed completely. And in those days, of course, I was like: How on earth is he doing that?”
Welser-Möst first conducted the Cleveland Orchestra in 1993 and became music director for the 2002-03 season. On the afternoon of his return concert on Jan. 11, he announced he will retire as music director at the end of 2026-27, his 25th season. Welser-Möst maintained he wasn't focused on topping Szell's reign, which stretched from 1946-70.
“I’m not into that game. It just happened,” he said.
Welser-Möst's New York concerts are part of Carnegie Hall's “Perspectives” series and its focus this winter and spring on the fall of the Weimar Republic.
“It is something that is so important to him and so important to his life,” Carnegie Hall executive director Clive Gillinson said. “I remember doing one Zoom call where he was in his library and he showed me all the books he's got on Weimar.”
Welser-Möst is proud of extending the orchestra's flexibility by programming semi-staged operas, with Mozart's ""Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute)"" next this May. He already has scheduled Janáček's “Jenůfa” for next season, Beethoven's “Fidelio” for 2025-26 and Strauss' “Die Frau ohne Schatten (The Woman without a Shadow)” for 2026-27.
“I’m an old dog when it comes to opera,” he said. “I’ve conducted about 90 different operas in my life. When I was in Zurich for nearly 14 years, I conducted 43 opening nights of a piece.”
His retirement creates another coveted U.S. podium vacancy. Riccardo Muti stepped down from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in June and Gustavo Dudamel shifts from the Los Angeles Philharmonic to the New York Philharmonic for the 2026-27 season.
“Every institution needs once in a while new input and new ideas,” Welser-Möst said. “I’m not saying I'm running out of ideas, but I always tried to live that philosophy here, that music comes first, the institution second, the individual third.”"

RKNWZA4TSN_XWIXH5DN8ZVXCOM,Boeing 747 cargo plane makes emergency landing in Miami,AFP,"January 20, 2024 at 4:00 AM·2 min read",20240119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/boeing-747-cargo-plane-makes-200014137.html,"An Atlas Air Boeing 747 cargo plane made an emergency return to Miami International Airport following an engine problem shortly after takeoff, the airline said -- prompting another investigation into the aviation giant.
The plane, which was headed to Puerto Rico, landed safely late Thursday ""after experiencing an engine malfunction soon after departure,"" an Atlas Air spokesperson told AFP in a statement. No injuries were reported.
""The crew followed all standard procedures and safely returned to MIA,"" the spokesperson said, adding that the airline would investigate the cause of the incident.
A post-flight inspection revealed a softball-size hole above the second engine, said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in a notice.
The National Transportation Safety Board told AFP that it has opened an investigation into the case.
Boeing said in a separate statement that it is supporting its customers and will aid with the NTSB review.
The plane uses four engines made by GE Aerospace, which is also providing technical assistance as investigations proceed.
Atlas Air, which started operations in 1992, said on its website that it runs the world's biggest fleet of Boeing 747 freighter aircraft.
- Heightened scrutiny -
US aviation giant Boeing is under intense global scrutiny over its 737 MAX 9 jet, following a scare on an Alaska Airlines plane this month when a panel came off mid-flight and forced an emergency landing.
There were no fatalities or serious injuries in that case either, but US regulators grounded 171 MAX 9 planes with the same configuration as the jet involved in the incident.
Boeing shares took a hit earlier in the month, with the FAA launching a safety probe into the January 5 Alaska Airlines incident too.
The FAA said this week that its probe would extend to Boeing's manufacturing practices and production lines.
This was the first major in-flight safety issue on a Boeing plane since two fatal 737 MAX crashes, one in 2018 and one in 2019, led to a nearly two-year grounding of the aircraft.
Several incidents involving Boeing planes have since garnered attention, with an All Nippon Airways flight reportedly having to turn back on Saturday after a crack was found on the cockpit window of the Boeing 737-800.
On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was forced to delay his return from Switzerland due to what a US official called a ""critical failure"" of his airplane, also a Boeing.
A separate plane was sent to retrieve Blinken, with aides returning to Washington by commercial flight.
While US air safety regulators have completed inspections on 40 grounded 737 MAX planes, they have not specified when the aircraft would be cleared to return to service.

Macron told reporters at a news conference that Europe's priority must be to ""not let Russia win"", announcing he would make a new visit to the Ukrainian capital in February.
""Letting Russia win would mean accepting that international law is not respected,"" he said.
Macron said that France was working on a new bilateral security agreement with Ukraine -- along the lines of a pact agreed between Kyiv and London -- that would be announced during his February visit.
The SCALP is capable of striking targets far into the country's Russian-occupied east, well behind front lines that have remained relatively fixed for months.
He said ""some forty"" more SCALP missies would be delivered along with ""several hundreds"" of bombs.
The first consignment of the weapons was delivered by France to Ukraine in the summer, though it was never clear how many had been delivered.
Analysts have said the West must keep up and even increase military support to Ukraine if it is to prevent Russia gaining the upper hand in the almost two-year conflict.

Source: Institute for the Study of War (ISW)
Details: Military analysts noted that this is being done despite the Russian military's likely inability to conduct an operation to seize significant territory in Kharkiv Oblast in the near future.
Dmitry Peskov, Spokesperson for the Russian president, said on 9 January that Russian troops would do everything possible to prevent attacks on Belgorod Oblast by Ukraine.
Russian sources, using Peskov's comment, called on Russian troops to create a ""buffer zone"" up to 15 kilometres deep in Kharkiv Oblast to push Ukrainian MLRS and artillery away from the border with Belgorod Oblast.
Russian ultranationalists have regularly called for a similar operation in the summer of 2023 amid widespread discontent with cross-border raids by pro-Ukrainian forces in Belgorod Oblast. ISW believes that a Russian invasion 15 kilometres deep and several hundred kilometres wide would be a large-scale operation that would require a grouping of forces much larger and much better equipped than the troops currently concentrated along the entire border with Ukraine, least of all in Belgorod Oblast.
ISW has already assessed that Russian forces may intensify their efforts to capture Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast in the coming weeks, and that the Russian grouping on the Kupiansk front appears better equipped to conduct an intensive offensive than elsewhere in Ukraine or along the border.
The Russian military is currently only capable of conducting tactical operations in Kharkiv Oblast. And they will serve to distract Ukrainian forces from possible Russian operational efforts on the Kupiansk front.
To quote the ISW’s Key Takeaways on 9 January:
A Ukrainian public opinion survey on Ukrainian attitudes towards the Ukrainian government and military indicates that Ukrainian society overwhelmingly supports Ukraine’s military and its leadership while experiencing tensions typical in a society fighting an existential defensive war.
A new independent poll from the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center (NORC) found that Russian President Vladimir Putin maintains strong domestic support for his regime and his war in Ukraine, despite relatively poor economic conditions and living standards in Russia.
Russian ultranationalist vitriolic responses to gender integration in the Ukrainian military highlight Russia's ongoing shift towards a cultural-ideological worldview that seeks to restore rigid and traditional gender roles and exposes gaps between Russia and Ukraine's respective abilities to mobilise their own societies.
Ukrainian Air Force Spokesperson Colonel Yurii Ihnat reported that Ukraine has a shortage of anti-aircraft guided missiles after several recent large Russian missile and drone strikes against Ukraine.
Russian sources continue to complain about persistent command and communication problems that degrade Russian combat capability in east (left) bank Kherson Oblast.
Russian sources are reviving longstanding calls for a large-scale Russian offensive operation in Kharkiv Oblast to create a ""buffer zone"" with Belgorod Oblast despite the Russian military’s likely inability to conduct an operation to seize significant territory in Kharkiv Oblast in the near term.
Recent Kremlin and Russian media rhetoric aimed at threatening Moldova likely continues to embolden pro-Russian separatist leaders in Moldova to attempt to sow political instability and division in Moldova.
Bloomberg reported that officials from Ukraine, the Group of Seven (G7) countries, India, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, and other unspecified countries held a meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on 16 December to build support for Ukrainian conditions to negotiate with Russia.
Russian forces made confirmed advances southwest of Donetsk City, and positional engagements continued along the entire frontline.
The Russian military is reportedly abusing Serbian nationals whom Russian officials have recruited to serve in Russian formations in Ukraine.
Russian occupation officials continue the systematic oppression of residents of occupied Crimea using law enforcement and administrative means.

This marks the first agreement between the warring sides since a weeklong cease-fire collapsed in late November.
In Yemen, the U.S. launched the third strike in recent days against the Houthi rebel group, according to a U.S. official. The Houthis have attacked shipping in the crucial Red Sea corridor, saying they seek to halt Israel’s war in Gaza against Hamas.
In northern Gaza, Palestinian militants battled Israeli forces and launched a barrage of rockets from farther south. In the past 24 hours, the bodies of 158 people killed in Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals, bringing the Palestinian death toll to 24,285 people, Gaza's Health Ministry said Tuesday.

U.S. SENATORS REJECT BERNIE SANDERS' EFFORT TO CURB ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR
WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday forced colleagues to decide whether to investigate human rights abuses in the Israel-Hamas war, a step toward potentially limiting U.S. military aid to Israel.
Senators overwhelmingly rejected the effort, a first of its kind that would have required the U.S. State Department to produce a report within 30 days on whether the Israeli war effort in Gaza is violating human rights and international accords. Had the vote passed and the administration failed to do so, U.S. military aid to Israel, long assured without question, could have been quickly halted.
In all, 11 senators joined Sanders in the vote, while 72 opposed. The White House has rejected Sanders' approach as “unworkable.”
MACRON SAYS FRANCE DIDN'T JOIN U.S. STRIKES ON YEMEN TO AVOID ESCALATING TENSIONS
PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron said his country decided not to join U.S.-led strikes against Houthis attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea because France is seeking to avoid escalation in Mideast tensions.
French warships in the zone will continue to help defend shipping corridors and the freedom of navigation, he said, noting that the French Navy has already intercepted missiles and drones targeting commercial ships in the Red Sea in recent weeks.
Asked at a news conference in Paris why France didn’t join U.S.-led military operations against the Houthis, Macron said, ‘’France decided not to join a coalition that carried out preventive strikes against others on their soil. Why? Because we have a posture that seeks to avoid any escalation. ... It’s a diplomatic issue, because we are vigilant and attentive about balance in the region.’’
The Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The group says it has attacked the ships in response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel.
Macron called for a cease-fire in Gaza and stressed France’s efforts to mediate in the region’s conflicts, including an unprecedented deal negotiated along with Qatar to deliver medicines Wednesday to hostages held by Hamas.
Macron noted that 41 French citizens were killed in the Hamas attack, and four French people are among those still held hostage in Gaza.
UNITED NATIONS CALLS FOR YEMEN'S HOUTHIS TO STOP ATTACKS ON SHIPPING
UNITED NATIONS – The United Nations is calling on Yemen’s Houthi rebels to implement the Security Council resolution adopted last week demanding an immediate halt to its attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
“We’re very concerned by the continuing strikes,” U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday.
The Iranian-backed Houthis, who have been engaged in a civil war with Yemen’s internationally recognized government since 2014, have said they launched the attacks with the aim of ending Israel’s devastation air-and-ground offensive in the Gaza Strip.
The U.N. resolution condemns the more than two dozen Houthi attacks which have disrupted one of the world’s major trade routes and raised shipping costs.
Dujarric said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke to Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian on Monday about the situation in the Red Sea and in Gaza. The U.N. chief “reiterated his call to all the parties to avoid any further escalation” in Yemen and implement last week’s resolution, and reiterated the need for greater humanitarian access in Gaza and the immediate release of all hostages, the U.N. spokesman said.
The U.N. special envoy for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, who has been consulting with all sides, spoke to the Iranian foreign minister’s senior advisor, Ali Asghar Khaji ,earlier Tuesday, Dujarric said. They discussed “the need to maintain an environment conducive to constructive dialogue and sustained concerted regional efforts to peace in Yemen,” the U.N. spokesperson said. Grundberg and others then briefed the Security Council behind closed doors.
TWO ISRAELI HOSTAGES CONFIRMED DEAD IN GAZA
JERUSALEM — Two Israeli men who were captured in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack have been confirmed dead after the militant group released a video saying they were killed in Israeli airstrikes.
A forum for families of hostages released statements Tuesday confirming that Yossi Sharabi, 53, and Itai Svirsky, 38, had died in captivity in Gaza. They did not say how the men died.
The two were kidnapped from Kibbutz Be’eri, one of several communities near Gaza that Hamas and other militants overran after breaking through Israel’s border defenses. The attack ignited the war in Gaza, which is still raging.
Hamas released a video on Monday showing Sharabi and Svirsky giving statements on camera, likely under duress, followed by images of what appeared to be their dead bodies. It said they were killed in Israeli airstrikes.
Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, said Monday that the army had feared for their lives. He said Israeli forces had struck a building near where the hostages were being held but did not know their location at the time.
Hamas and other militants captured some 250 people in the Oct. 7 attack. More than 100 were released in November during a weeklong cease-fire in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Most of the rest are still in captivity.
Hamas has said no more hostages will be released until there is a permanent cease-fire.
BERNIE SANDERS TO MAKE U.S. SENATORS VOTE ON INVESTIGATING ISRAEL FOR POSSIBLE WAR CRIMES IN GAZA
WASHINGTON — In a notable test Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders is forcing colleagues to vote on record whether to investigate human rights abuses in the Israel-Hamas war, a step toward potentially limiting U.S. military aid to Israel as its devastating attacks on Gaza grind past 100 days.
The Senate vote, a first of its kind tapping into a decades-old law, would require the U.S. State Department to, within 30 days, produce a report on whether the Israeli war effort in Gaza is violating human rights and international accords. If so, U.S. military aid to Israel, long assured without question, could be quickly halted.
While the Senate is unlikely to approve the measure, the vote by senators will begin to reveal the depth of unease among U.S. lawmakers over Israel’s prosecution of the war against Hamas. With no apparent end to the bombardment, Israel’s attacks against Palestinians, an attempt to root out Hamas leaders, are viewed by some as disproportional to the initial terrorist attack on Israel.
DEAL WILL A LLOW DELIVERY OF MEDICINE TO ISRAELI HOSTAGES, AND HUMANITARIAN AID TO GAZA
JERUSALEM — Qatar and France say they have mediated a deal between Israel and Hamas to allow the delivery of medications to the more than 100 Israeli hostages held captive in Gaza.
The Gulf Arab country announced Tuesday that additional quantities of humanitarian aid would be delivered to Palestinians in Gaza as part of the deal.
It marks the first agreement between the warring sides since a weeklong cease-fire collapsed in late November.
France said it had been working on the deal since October, and would provide three months’ worth of medication for 45 hostages with chronic illnesses, as well as other medicines and vitamins. The medicines are expected to enter Gaza from Egypt on Wednesday.
Hamas captured the hostages in its Oct. 7 cross-border attack that began the war. The hostages have not been visited by the Red Cross, and many, including several elderly men, are believed to be in desperate need of medication.
Qatar said the deal was reached with French assistance. The medicines are expected to be delivered on Wednesday.
U.S. STRIKES HIT YEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS FOR THIRD TIME
WASHINGTON — The U.S. launched a new strike against the Yemen-based Houthis on Tuesday, hitting anti-ship missiles in a third assault on the Iranian-backed group in recent days, a U.S. official said.
The U.S. official said no other details were available yet on the American strike, including the precise location. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the operation had not been made public.
The strike came as the Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile attack against the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Zografia in the Red Sea. No one was injured. The Greek-owned vessel had been heading north to the Suez Canal when it was attacked, the Greek Shipping and Island Policy Ministry said.
This latest exchange suggests there has been no let-up in Houthi attacks on shipping in the region, despite the massive U.S. and British assault on the group Friday, bombing more than 60 targets in 28 locations.
A Saudi-led, U.S.-backed war in Yemen against the Houthis has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. The conflict, which began in 2014, has slowed to a stalemate as the Houthis maintain control of the capital and northern and western Yemen, where most of the population lives.

AL-JAZEERA BUREAU CHIEF WHO LOST WIFE AND CHILDREN IN GAZA IS SEEKING TREATMENT ABROAD
CAIRO — Al-Jazeera’s veteran bureau chief in Gaza, who lost his wife, three of his children and a grandchild in Israeli airstrikes, has left the territory for medical treatment.
The head of Egypt’s journalist syndicate, Khaled al-Balshy, says Wael Dahdouh will travel to Qatar, where Al Jazeera is based, for medical treatment. Dahdouh, 53, crossed into Egypt earlier.
He has reported continuously on the fighting between Israel and Hamas even as it has taken a devastating toll on his own family abd was wounded in an Israeli airstrike last month that killed a cameraman working with him.
Dahdouh told Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV that he would get treatment for the hand injury he suffered in the strike and would return to work, without providing further details.
He has been the face of Al Jazeera’s 24-hour coverage of the war for millions of Arabic-speaking viewers across the region.
EUROPEAN UNION PUTS HAMAS LEADER IN GAZA ON ITS TERRORIST LIST
BRUSSELS — The European Union said Tuesday that is has put the mastermind behind the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, Hamas leader Yehya Sinwar, on its terrorist list.
EU headquarters said the move was in “response to the threat posed by Hamas and its brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks in Israel.”
The EU says Sinwar “is subject to the freezing of his funds and other financial assets in EU member states. It is also prohibited for EU operators to make funds and economic resources available to him.” No further details were provided.
Israel believes Sinwar is operating from tunnels somewhere in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis.
In November, the EU froze the funds and other assets in Europe of Mohammed Deif, the commander general of Hamas’ military wing, and of deputy commander Marwan Issa.
Hamas and its military wing have been on the EU’s terrorist list as organizations for about 20 years.
QATAR'S PRIME MINISTER SPEAKS OF GAZA'S DESTRUCTION: ''GAZA IS NOT THERE ANY MORE.'
JERUSALEM — Qatar’s prime minister offered stinging criticism of Israel and the international community on Tuesday over the ongoing Israeli war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, who also serves as Qatar’s foreign minister, said a two-state solution was required to end the conflict and warned that Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and the Israeli response showed the region could not go back to the way it was before.
“Gaza is not there anymore. I mean, there is nothing over there,” he said, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""It’s carpet bombing everywhere.”
He also brought up the ongoing tensions in the West Bank, which has seen Palestinians killed as well by Israeli security forces, and urged for an end to Palestinian divisions.
""We cannot have a two-state solution without having a government and politicians in Israel who believe in coexisting together side by side peacefully and we cannot have all this ongoing without ending this war,” he said.
He warned that a military confrontation in the Mideast waterways “will not contain” the attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels who on Monday fired a missile, striking a U.S.-owned ship just off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden.
“What we have right now in the region is a recipe of escalation everywhere,” Sheikh Mohammed added.
ISRAEL SAYS ROCKETS FIRED FROM GAZA, REPORTEDLY ONE OF THE STRONGEST BOMBARDMENTS IN MORE THAN A WEEK
TEL AVIV — Israel says a barrage of at least 25 rockets was launched on Tuesday from the Gaza Strip toward southern Israel, damaging a store. It was one of the strongest bombardments from Gaza in more than a week.
It came a day after Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the Israeli army was expanding military control from northern Gaza toward other parts of the strip.
Hamas has continued to fire rockets at Israel throughout the war, even as Israel says it is dismantling Hamas’s military capabilities in ever-expanding areas of Gaza. Israeli Channel 12 TV said the rockets on Tuesday were launched from the central Gaza town of Bureij.
In the area of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, Israeli troops located approximately 100 rocket set-installations and 60 ready-to-use rockets, the military said, claiming its forces killed dozens of militants during the activity.
At a news conference on Monday, Gallant said he expects military operations in southern Gaza to “end soon” but gave no timeframe. He spoke a day after the White House called on Israel to curtail its offensive.
Gallant said Israel is still targeting Hamas’ leaders, calling them the “head of the snake” and said they are believed to be hiding in Khan Younis, the southern city where the offensive has been focused in recent weeks.
He stressed that military pressure is the only way to win the release of the more than 100 hostages still in Hamas captivity. “Only from a position of strength can we ensure the release of hostages,” he said.
ISRAELI MILITARY LOOKING INTO WEST BANK CLASHES ON MONDAY THAT KILLED A PALESTINIAN WOMAN
TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it’s reviewing an incident in the occupied West Bank the previous day when a Palestinian woman was killed in clashes with Israeli forces.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said the woman — 23-year-old Ahed Mohammed — was killed along with a man, and nine Palestinians were wounded.
The Israeli military said the clashes occurred in the town of Dura, where about 100 people threw firebombs and blocks at troops, who fired back. The military said one person was killed, others were hit and that the incident was “under review.” It did not confirm reports of the woman’s death.
The West Bank has experienced a surge in violence since the war in Gaza erupted and the Palestinian Health Ministry says Israeli forces have killed some 350 Palestinians there since Oct. 7. Most have been killed in confrontations with Israeli forces during arrest raids or violent protests.
Palestinians from the West Bank have also carried out attacks against Israelis during that time.
EXCHANGE OF FIRE ALONG ISRAEL-EGYPT BORDER KILLS 1 IN EGYPT, INJURES AN ISRAELI SOLDIER
JERUSALEM — Israel said one of its troops was “slightly injured” in an exchange of fire along the country’s border with Egypt, which Cairo attributed to drug smuggling. One person in Egypt was killed.
The statement from the Israeli military late on Monday said the fighting happened near the Nitzana border crossing with Egypt on the Sinai Peninsula, and that there were 20 armed suspects. The Israelis and the suspects exchanged fire, with Israel saying “hits were identified” among the suspects, without elaborating.
The Israeli soldier who was hit “was evacuated to a hospital to receive medical treatment and her family has been informed,” the military said.
The Israeli military did not identify the suspects. An Egyptian military statement on Tuesday described the suspects involved as trying to smuggle drugs. It said one person was killed and six people were arrested afterwards.
Egypt and Israel have had a peace deal since 1979, but Israel’s monthslong war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip has strained ties.
U.N. CHIEF WARNS OF STARVATION AND DISEASE IN GAZA AS AID STAGGERS
UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. secretary-general says Gaza faces “the long shadow of starvation” and the risk of disease outbreaks because of barriers to delivering vital aid.
Antonio Guterres did not mention Israel by name in his remarks Monday, but blamed the inability to meet Gaza’s growing humanitarian needs on widespread bombardment, barriers to entering the territory and restrictions on distribution inside of it — all under Israel’s control.
He said he was “deeply troubled by the clear violation of international humanitarian law that we are witnessing.”
Israeli officials have denied hindering aid delivery, saying the U.N. needs to provide more workers and trucks.
But Guterres said the U.N. and its partners “cannot effectively deliver humanitarian aid while Gaza is under such heavy, widespread and unrelenting bombardment.” He pointed to the deaths of 152 U.N. staffers in Gaza since the start of the war, “the largest single loss of life in the history of our organization.”"
S3GPD20FRF_IC022NDN65AY88O,Houthis vow revenge after UK and US launch airstrikes on Yemen,"Kate Devlin,Kim Sengupta and Andrew Feinberg","January 12, 2024 at 3:33 PM·7 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/rishi-sunak-does-not-rule-141334071.html,"Houthi rebels in Yemen have warned the West to expect bloody retaliation after a series of UK and US-led airstrikes against them, amid fears of dramatically escalating tensions in the Middle East.
Rishi Sunak said the action showed that the militants’ attacks on ships in the Red Sea could not be carried out with “impunity”, while foreign secretary Lord Cameron said they sent a “very clear message” to their backers, Iran.
British and American forces hit 60 targets in 16 locations in the early hours, taking out command centres and drone and missile sites. In response, the Houthis promised reprisals and said that UK and US interests were now “legitimate targets”.
It came as:
Iran described the overnight strikes as a “clear violation of Yemen’s sovereignty”
Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan accused the US and the UK of trying to turn the Red Sea into a “sea of blood”
General Sir Richard Barrons, a former chief of joint operations who served in Afghanistan, said the West should expect a “defiant response”
Experts warned the move had put the both the US and UK on “riskier terrain”
A fresh missile attack against a vessel was reported on Friday evening, with British maritime security firm Ambrey saying Houthi militants mistakenly targeted a tanker carrying Russian oil
The Hamas-backing Houthis claim they are targeting vessels linked to Israel in one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, because of the war in Gaza. As the world waited for the Houthi response, a defiant Mr Sunak, speaking during a visit to Ukraine, did not rule out further military action in Yemen, saying attacks on ships “can’t be met without a response”.
Downing Street denied the UK was at war with the Iran-backed group and said the strikes, targeting military facilities used by rebels, had been proportionate and carried out in self-defence.
President Joe Biden, who green-lit the attacks on Tuesday, has also said he would not hesitate to take further action if necessary.
Houthi rebels said the strikes killed at least five people and wounded six, and would “not go unanswered and unpunished”. Turkey also criticised the US and the UK, accusing them of trying to turn the Red Sea into a “sea of blood”, while the strikes were also condemned by Russia.
At home, Labour leader Keir Starmer backed the government, but demanded a statement to MPs “at the first opportunity”.
However, a political row erupted over the PM’s failure to seek the approval of parliament for the strikes – despite briefing the Labour leader ahead of time and holding a late-night cabinet meeting.
The Lib Dems’ foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, said it was “shameful” for Mr Sunak to bypass parliament. No 10 said MPs would not get a “retrospective” vote, but did not rule out further strikes.
Meanwhile, General Sir Richard Barrons said the UK must be prepared to attack Yemen again as he warned the West “should expect a defiant response, which will most likely include at least some further attacks to show the rebels are not defeated”. He added: “Things might then settle down.”
That view was echoed by former defence secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind who told The Independent he believed there would be further strikes.
“The Houthis will want to prove ‘we cannot be deterred’,” he said. “So I will be very surprised if there’s not at least one further incident. It might not even be immediate, it might be in a week’s time or 10 days. Or it might be in the next 48 hours. When it does happen there will be a further American strike. And then there won’t be any more after that, at least for some period of time.”
Former British military intelligence officer Philip Ingram warned the “critical” period was the next 12 to 48 hours, to see how the Houthis respond.
He said British military vessels could be “swarmed” by drones, adding that while he was “confident” there was the manpower to shoot them down, “it’s (still) hugely dangerous. And nothing is 100 per cent. That means there’s always a percentage chance that something will get through.”
And Major General Tim Cross, who served in Iraq, the Balkans and Northern Ireland, warned it would be a natural tactic for the Houthis to try to “swarm” a warship with drones.
“We know from experience in places like Ukraine that if you send enough drones then there are chances of a small number getting through – 90 per cent can be shot down, but the rest may get through,” he told The Independent. “A small drone wouldn’t sink a ship, but it can cause damage, and will be a great propaganda victory for the Houthis.”
But Lord West, the chief of UK naval staff from 2002 to 2006, played down the chances of a wider escalation with Iran. “I think the strikes will make Iran think, ‘Oh hang on – they do take it seriously’. I don’t believe it will escalate,” he said.
He warned, however, that Mr Sunak would have to be prepared to strike again if necessary. “What do we do if they [the Houthis] do the next attacks? Do we up the ante? That’s the next difficult decision. If they keep attacking innocent merchant ships and our warships then I think we will have to do something.”
Sophia Gaston, head of foreign policy at the think tank Policy Exchange, also warned of a wider conflict in the region following the strikes.
She added that retaliation in the form of intensified attacks on ships in the Red Sea could push the US and UK into “areas that they’re not going to feel very comfortable with”.
“We are moving into a much riskier terrain because the US and the UK certainly do not want to be in a situation where we are required to engage beyond a limited targeted strike capacity and certainly not one that may invite the participation of other regional powers,” she said.
She added that the existence of so many proxies for different states, such as the Houthis and Hezbollah for Iran, “necessarily makes this a kind of tinderbox”. “And I think there are a lot of these players who believe that the stakes at the moment are becoming existential. So I think that always is a recipe for a higher risk of conflict.”
Backing Mr Sunak’s airstrikes, former prime minister Boris Johnson stressed that what happens in Yemen ‘affects us all’, with disruption to shipping routes adding to everyday costs in the west.
“The spate of Houthi attacks on shipping, if it continues, has the potential to do incalculable damage to the world economy — and to the UK,” he said in his Daily Mail column on Friday. “The madness of the Houthis will ultimately affect you — your mortgage, your cost of living; and we cannot allow them to continue as they are.”
Lord Ricketts, who served as the UK’s first national security adviser, warned that the conflict in the Red Sea was “already having a major disruptive effect on this big maritime artery which carries 20 per cent of all the world’s container traffic, as well as a lot of oil and gas exports”.
Huge explosions were seen in Yemeni cities in the early hours of Friday.
The Ministry of Defence said four Royal Air Force jets struck two Houthi facilities involved in their targeting of HMS Diamond and US Navy vessels on Tuesday.
One was a site at Bani and the other the Abbs airfield, used to launch drones and cruise missiles.
Dr Tobias Borck, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think tank, said the threat of a wider regional war had existed since Hamas’s deadly 7 October attack on Israel.
“However, escalation can happen as a result of accidents and miscalculation, or as a simple compounding of risk, a normalisation of an extremely high level of violence,” he said."
S4GOQN6B3N_KDIVAFB0UNU87MP,Finland extends closure of border with Russia for another month,Kateryna Hodunova,"January 11, 2024 at 11:32 PM·1 min read",20240111,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/finland-extends-closure-border-russia-153257772.html,"Finland will extend the closure of all eight checkpoints along its border with Russia until at least Feb. 11, the Finnish news outlet YLE reported on Jan. 11, citing Finnish Interior Minister Mari Rantanen.
Finland fully closed its border with Russia in late November to prevent an influx of migrants from entering the country via Russia. In November alone, around 900 asylum seekers from countries like Kenya, Morocco, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen entered Finland from Russia.
Finnish authorities suspected the asylum seekers were being pushed to the border by Russia in what Helsinki labeled a ""hybrid operation against Finland.""
While Helsinki initially decided to reopen two crossing points with Russia on Dec. 14, it quickly reversed the decision the following day.
The situation at the Finnish border has remained unchanged since December, according to Rantanen. Migrants are reportedly waiting on Russia's side of the border for entry into Finland.
Rantanen said the Finnish government is continuing to search for a solution to the crisis.
When Finland re-closed the border on Dec. 15, Finnish Interior Minister Mari Rantanen attributed the ongoing border crisis to Russian aggression and interference.
“This is a sign that the Russian authorities are continuing their hybrid operation against Finland. This is something that Finland will not tolerate,” Rantanen said.
Moscow’s strategy echoes that of Minsk, which orchestrated a migrant crisis along its borders with its EU neighbors.

Washington and Beijing are at loggerheads over everything from the future of democratically ruled Taiwan to territorial claims in the South China Sea. Ties are still recovering after the U.S. downed an alleged Chinese spy balloon in February.
U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed late last year to resume military ties, severed by Beijing after a visit in August 2022 by then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.
The 17th round of the talks saw Michael Chase, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan, and Mongolia, meet China's Major General Song Yanchao, deputy director of the central military commission office for international military co-operation, the Pentagon said.
""The two sides discussed U.S.-PRC defense relations, and Chase highlighted the importance of maintaining open lines of military-to-military communication in order to prevent competition from veering into conflict,"" the statement added, using an acronym for the People's Republic of China.
Pentagon officials say communication between the two militaries is key to preventing a miscalculation from spiraling into conflict.
The top U.S. military officer, General Charles Q. Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff held a virtual meeting last month with his Chinese counterpart, General Liu Zhenli.
China is willing to develop healthy and stable military-to-military relations with the U.S. ""on the basis of equality and respect"", its defence ministry said in a statement on Wednesday, citing the meeting.
It urged the U.S. to cut military deployment and ""provocative actions"" in the South China Sea, as well halt support for such actions by ""certain countries"", but did not identify them.
It asked the U.S. to abide by the one-China principle and stop arming Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, despite Taiwan's strong objections, and vowed never to compromise on the issue.
""The United States should fully understand the root causes of the maritime and air security issues, strictly restrain its front-line forces, and stop hyping up (the issues),"" it added.
Taiwan is holding presidential and parliamentary polls this weekend amid a ramped-up war of words between Taiwan and China.
U.S. officials have cautioned that even with some restoration of military communications, forging truly functional dialogue between the two sides could take time.

S5SNI3GCRK_4U8GQ27MSAJLEG7,Iran fires missiles into Pakistan as Israel-Hamas war tension spreads,"Chris Livesay, Tucker Reals","Updated January 18, 2024 at 12:09 AM·4 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/iran-fires-missiles-pakistan-israel-125723266.html,"Tel Aviv — Tension fueled by the Israel-Hamas war was broadening across the Middle East and beyond Wednesday, as U.S. ally Pakistan condemned its neighbor Iran for launching what Pakistani officials called an unprovoked attack on their territory. Iran said its Revolutionary Guard struck bases of the Sunni Muslim militant group Jaish al-Adl in Pakistan, but Islamabad angrily condemned the attack as a ""blatant violation"" of its airspace and said two children were killed in the strikes.
A local police officer told CBS News' Sami Yousafzai that two women injured in the strikes were brought to a regional hospital, along with the bodies of the two slain children, as rescuers sifted through the debris searching for any other victims.
Iran missile strikes in Pakistan
Resident Abdul Baluch told CBS News the strikes hit a village called Sabz Koh, near the Iranian border.
""We heard the blasts and sound of missiles,"" he said, adding that the houses targeted were near his home, and that he had never ""seen any kind of military activists"" in the area over the last five years.
A spokesperson for the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Tuesday that it was ""even more concerning that this illegal act has taken place despite the existence of several channels of communication between Pakistan and Iran,"" adding that ""Pakistan's strong protest has already been lodged with the concerned senior official in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran.""
Pakistan later recalled its ambassador from Tehran and expelled the Iranian ambassador in Islamabad.
The Iranian strikes, which officials in Tehran claimed had only killed Iranian nationals who were members of the militant group, came just a day after Iran's Revolutionary Guard fired missiles at targets in Iraq and Syria, with Tehran claiming those were also against ""anti-Iran groups"" operating in the region.
Houthis keep attacking ships in Red Sea
Iran's direct military action against regional foes comes after weeks of attacks by its proxy group in Yemen, the Shiite Houthi rebels, on international commercial shipping. Video has emerged of Houthi militants celebrating — even dancing — aboard cargo ships they have seized off Yemen's coast in the Red Sea.
The attacks on commercial vessels have continued, disrupting global trade and regional stability, despite strikes launched Friday by the U.S. and British militaries, with other allies, targeting Houthi missile sites in Yemen.
For months the Houthis have attacked the vital Red Sea shipping routes, claiming the drone and missile strikes and seizures are in support of Iran's other allies, the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is currently facing the full might of Israel's military in the Gaza Strip.
The U.S. has been a staunch supporter of Israel's offensive against Hamas, launched in response to the group's unprecedented Oct. 7 terror attack. Hamas has long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union.
Last week, U.S. Navy SEALs raided a small vessel that was allegedly headed for the Houthis in Yemen. America's Central Command said advanced weaponry from Iran was discovered on the boat. Two Navy SEALs fell overboard during the Jan. 11 operation and remained missing on Wednesday.
Hamas-Israel tension spills into Iraq, Syria
In addition to Pakistan and the Red Sea, hostilities have been boiling over in the greater Middle East, with Iran launching attacks this week in Iraq and Syria — including a missile strike that killed four people in the northern Iraqi city of Erbil, very close to a still-under-construction U.S. consulate. The U.S. condemned the Iranian strike as ""reckless.""
All of the flashpoints show the risk of the war between Israel and Iran's Hamas allies spiraling further out of control. All of the tension was sparked by the Hamas massacre in southern Israel on Oct. 7, which Israeli officials say left some 1,200 people dead and saw the Palestinian militants kidnap about 240 others.
The war in Gaza sparked by that attack has killed more than 24,000 people in the small, densely populated Palestinian territory, according to its Hamas-run Ministry of Health.
""My house was bombed and I fled here without bringing anything with me, not even money,"" said Gaza resident Youssef Abu Ishaq as he arrived at one of the enclave's few functioning hospitals. ""We need food, bread, and blankets.""
More humanitarian aid of that kind is on the way thanks to a deal brokered between Israel and Hamas on Tuesday. The agreement calls for the delivery of additional aid to Palestinians in exchange for medicine being allowed to reach the roughly 130 Israeli hostages who are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza.
That deal was brokered by Qatar, which was behind a weeklong cease-fire in November that saw the release of about half of the Israeli hostages in exchange for dozens of Palestinian prisoners being freed by Israel. The hope on Wednesday was that the new agreement could lead to another halt in the fighting, and the release of more hostages.

West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) crude went as high as 4% during trading but settled 0.9% higher at just over $72 per barrel. Brent (BZ=F) crude oil, the international benchmark, closed up more than 1%, above $78 per barrel after surpassing $80 per barrel during Friday's session.
Over the last month, the price for both WTI and Brent has risen more than 6%.
In a statement delivered on Thursday, President Biden said, ""These strikes are in direct response to unprecedented Houthi attacks against international maritime vessels in the Red Sea.""
Oil has been seesawing as traders weigh geopolitical risks against growing supplies from the US and other countries.
""While higher global stocks of oil provide a buffer to small disruptions, the escalation of conflict on the Arabian Peninsula itself with a US-led military strike against Houthi rebels is shaking the crude oil market out of complacency,"" Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrials, materials, and energy at Third Bridge, told Yahoo Finance on Friday.
A further escalation of tensions in the region could amplify fears of a broader war with Iran, which produces close to 3 million barrels of production per day.
""If Iranian production was interrupted, there could be a rise in global prices of up to $30 per barrel,"" Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, told Yahoo Finance.
Vessels have been advised by the global shipping industry to avoid the Red Sea region that connects to the Suez canal, a critical pathway between Asia and Europe.
On Friday, Danish oil tanker group Torm (TRMD) said it was pausing all shipments through the southern Red Sea, Bloomberg reported. The company owns more than 80 vessels that transport refined energy products and chemicals.
For the last month, Houthis have been targeting vessels as a sign of support for Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war. Since mid-November ""at least 23 commercial vessels have been targeted,"" according to Freightos Terminal, a shipping data platform.
In response, shipping rates have soared, data from Bank of America shows.
Last week cargo giants Maersk (MAERSK-A.CO, MAERSK-B.CO) and German shipment company Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.DE) said they would pause voyages through the region until further notice.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate at least 70%-80% of vessels have been rerouted as of last month, making their journeys 30% longer and more expensive.
""Re-routing of vessels from Suez via the Cape in response to recent attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea is significantly reducing available space on container ships,"" Goldman analyst Patrick Creuset wrote in a note to investors. ""Depending on how long the disruption lasts, it could lead to supply chain disruptions and significantly higher transport costs, especially on Asia-Europe trades.""

(WKRN) — One Tennessee lawmaker wants to give Tennesseans the “right to die.”
Rep. Bob Freeman (D-Nashville) filed a bill in the General Assembly this month that would create a process for those suffering terminal diseases to die in a “humane and dignified manner.”
HB1710 would allow for qualified patients to request a prescription of medication that would end their lives if certain conditions are met.
📧 Have breaking come to you: Subscribe to News 2 email alerts →
Specifically, the bill states “[a]n adult who is capable, is a resident of this state, and has been determined by an attending physician and a consulting physician to be suffering from a terminal disease, and who has voluntarily expressed the wish to die, may make a written request for medication for the purpose of ending the adult’s life in a humane and dignified manner in accordance with this part.”
According to Freeman, the bill was inspired by friends’ struggles with aging family members’ end of life.
“Recently I’ve had some close friends go through really horrible end-of-life situations for their family members that wanted the pain to be over, and it’s not an option, They just had to live in pain for the last six months of their life,” he told News 2.
According to the bill, the disease must be one that is incurable, irreversible and would likely result in death within six months; there must also be two witnesses to the request, one of which cannot be a relative, the attending physician, or anyone who would have a vested interest in the patient’s estate.
Read the latest from the TN State Capitol Newsroom
In order to receive the prescription, the bill states they must make an initial oral request to their attending physician, followed by a written request. They must then make a second oral request within 15 days of the initial oral request. They would also retain the right to rescind the request under the terms of the bill.
There are around a dozen states that honor the right to die, including Oregon, Maine, Montana and Washington, D.C. Tennessee does not currently recognize the right to die, only offering hospice or palliative care for those at the end of life.
In those instances, Freeman said, the care is more about treating the pain to the best of the ability.
“When you talk about hospice, they talk about quality of life, and quality of life at the end of life should be honored as well,” he said. “When you enter into hospice, and you know the end is near—it’s not medically treatable—and you’re just treating the pain until the person dies naturally, I think that people should have the choice to choose how they want to die.”
Elections-related bills filed in Tennessee General Assembly
Freeman also shared he had an acquaintance choose to take their own life instead of endure long-term pain management after a terminal diagnosis, which was another inspiration for the bill.
“They should have been able to go into a facility, speak to a medical professional, get the counseling needed and go through that medically, and that decision’s not available for Tennesseans today,” he said.
Freeman said he’s spoken with multiple hospice facilities, and they agree their role is more about quality of life, and part of quality of life is dignity in death.
“There’s a false belief that there’s a killer dose of morphine at the end of someone’s life that they can give, and the reality is that’s not the case. People are in so much pain that they have to get massive doses of morphine at the end of their life to continue to treat the pain,” Freeman said. “When we know somebody’s not going to get better and they’re not going to recover, we should have an opportunity for that person, if they’re in the right mind, to be able to make that decision and act on that decision.”

Some other protections included in Freeman’s bill include prohibitions on requests from family members—only the patient can make the request; not family—required consultation with physicians, witnesses, and the right to rescind, all of which he said he saw in other state’s bills.
“More than anything I just want to open it up to a debate. Let’s see if this is something that people really want,” he said. “Let them reach out to their representatives and, if so, let’s move this forward.”
Tennessee should “allow people dignity in death,” he added.
“Let them choose, if they have a terminal disease, how they want to end their life,” Freeman said.
According to Death With Dignity, there are 14 different states considering right to die bills in 2024, including Tennessee.
Hundreds of bills will be up for debate during the 113th General Assembly. Tennessee lawmakers shared their thoughts on some of the major issues up for discussion at this year’s legislative session.

He was 92.
The Charter 77 Foundation said Janouch died on Friday morning in Sweden's capital, Stockholm, where he had lived since the 1970s. No details about the cause of his death were given.
Born on Sept. 22, 1931 in the town of Lysa nad Labem near Prague, Janouch studied nuclear physics at Charles University in Prague and at universities in Moscow and St. Petersburg in the then Soviet Union.
As a leading expert in his field, he worked in a senior position at the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and was professor at Charles University.
After the 1968 Soviet-led invasion crushed a period of liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia known as the Prague Spring and the country was taken over by a hard-line communist regime, Janouch was fired from the institute and banned from lecturing.
At the invitation of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, he moved to Sweden in 1974. He was stripped of his Czech citizenship and became a Swedish citizen in 1979.
In December 1978, he established the foundation to support those in Czechoslovakia who signed the Charter 77 human rights manifesto co-drafted by then dissident Václav Havel.
The signatories of the manifesto faced harsh persecution from communist authorities.
Among its activities, Janouch’s foundation smuggled banned books to Czechoslovakia, and also equipment that made it possible for dissidents to publish books and other materials by banned authors.
After the 1989 anti-communist Velvet Revolution led by Havel, the foundation moved to Prague and has been involved in various charity and other projects since then.
“František Janouch contributed significantly to the return of freedom to our country,” Prime Minister Petr Fiala said."
SW85O4YVJS_JPYTZEZ6NB1Y1IN,Russia jails officer for buying wrong hardware to protect Crimean bridge from Ukrainian attack - TASS,Reuters,"January 16, 2024 at 9:21 AM·2 min read",20240116,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-jails-officer-buying-wrong-152118713.html,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A court on Tuesday sentenced a former senior officer in the National Guard to six years in a prison colony after convicting him of buying equipment unable to protect the bridge which links southern Russia to Crimea, the TASS state news agency reported.
TASS said that Colonel Sergei Volkov had purchased two radar-based air defence systems for 395 million roubles ($4.5 million) which were meant to be able to bring down Ukrainian attack drones by suppressing their signal.
A military court in Moscow had determined that the equipment - which was also meant to protect a gas pipeline running from southern Russia to Crimea - needed modernising and upgrading to be effective and had found Volkov guilty of abusing his position, it said.
Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that Kyiv and the West do not recognise and say was illegal.
Volkov was reported to deny his guilt, saying he had acted within the law, and that the equipment was in fact intended to protect National Guard troops in various locations.
The Kommersant newspaper reported that Volkov's oversight had left the bridge being ""within range of (Ukrainian) fire.""
The road and rail bridge was a flagship project for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who opened it to road traffic to much fanfare by driving a truck across it in 2018.
After Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, the bridge became a prime target for the Ukrainian military and special services.
It was severely damaged in October 2022 by a massive explosion.
Russian officials said the blast was caused by a lorry that exploded while driving over the bridge, killing three people. A few months later, in July 2023, Ukrainian security services claimed responsibility for the explosion.

T6ML4WBQHI_U04Q7GQVN6FO2O4,White House says official is discussing release of Hamas hostages in Doha,John Bowden,"January 17, 2024 at 6:50 AM·3 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/white-house-says-official-discussing-225022014.html,"White House officials said on Tuesday that a US official was in Doha seeking talks with Hamas and Qatari negotiatiors regarding the possibility of a second deal to secure a ceasefire and accompanying release of hostages in the Gaza Strip.
Brett McGurk was engaged in ""very serious and intensive discussions"" with Qatari officials on that topic, National Security Council (NSC) spokesman John Kirby told reporters during a virtual press briefing.
“We are hopeful it will bear fruit and bear fruit soon,” he added.
Such a development would provide a much-needed boost to the Biden administration’s image on the issue of Israel’s military invasion of the Gaza Strip, launched after a deadly Hamas-led terrorist attack in October that left some 1,200 people killed and saw more than 200 kidnapped. Criticism of the Israeli military’s seemingly indiscriminate leveling of whole city blocks across the Gaza Strip is growing in the US, particularly among progressives but also among other groups, including employees of the federal government who are planning a walkout this week to protest the issue.
Arab-American and progressive groups in the US have been livid with the administration for months, accusing the president of only addressing the suffering of Palestinian civilians under Israeli siege as an afterthought.
At the top of Joe Biden’s list of problems remains his relationship with the Israeli government. Despite reporting indicating that he had undercut President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the issue of holding Israel to the standard of international law when he was vice president, Mr Biden’s current relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is described as frosty — if not outright hostile. The US president is reported to have hung up on his Israeli counterpart in anger last year, ending their regular direct communication.
Biden administration officials have been working overtime to rehabilitate the public perception of their efforts. A report from Axios detailing the call between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu included a quote from Mr Kirby that surprisingly insisted the exchange did not reflect upon their relationship, while also revealing a growing anger in the West Wing centred around Israel’s repeated pattern of ignoring or outright dismissing the stated concerns of US officials, including the president.
Meanwhile, more than 20,000 residents of Gaza are now reported dead amid the Israeli invasion that has been punctuated with calls for the removal and even eradication of the Palestinian population — almost entirely civilian — from backbencher Israeli elected politicians and officials. Statements describing Palestinian non-combatants as “animals” and supporting their removal to Arab countries have fueled allegations of genocide, which Israel is now facing at the International Court of Justice. The Israeli government and their US partners both officialy deny that a genocide is occurring. Few, however, have seriously reckoned in public with the rhetoric coming from some Israeli leaders.
Hamas is thought to still have numerous hostages in the Gaza Strip — access to the hostages by neutral rights and medical groups has been restricted if not cut off entirely by the militants. Several Americans are believed to be among those held by the militants.
Previously, a temporary ceasefire negotiated by the Qataris led to the release of about half of those hostages. Around 25 others have been killed in captivity, according to Israel, with Hamas and Israel’s government trading blame for their deaths. On Monday, the group released a video in which one hostage reads from a script and claims that two others have been killed, blaming an Israeli strike. Israel’s government said that the building identified as holding them had not been targeted.
""We don't attack a place if we know there may be hostages inside,"" said an Israeli military spokesman.
Israel’s military has, however, already killed three of its own hostages. In December, a statement from Israeli officials confirmed that three hostages released by Hamas had approached Israeli lines bearing a white flag, only to be shot dead by their own countrymen."

Tasaraf Hussain had arrived at Islamabad International Airport on 8 January to surprise his relatives, but was gunned down in an act of “senseless violence”, leaving his family distraught.
In a petition launched by his relatives, they say his death forms part of a “disturbing trend” of overseas Kashmiris being targeted upon their return to their homeland.
Rochade MP Tony Lloyd, alongside Rochdale Council leader Neil Emmott, has now written to the UK Foreign Office and the Pakistan Ambassador in a bit to bring his killers to justice.

In a statement, they said: ""Shocking news from Rawalpindi as Tasaraf Hussain, a resident of Rochdale, was recently killed in Pakistan.
""Our thoughts and condolences are with the family and both Cllr Neil Emmott and I have written to the UK Foreign Office and the Pakistan Ambassador to look into this with urgency and outline what action will be taken to bring the murderers to justice.""
His grieving family have called on their local MP and the Pakistani government to take “immediate action” and to impose stricter security measures.
They wrote in an online petition: “Our family is mourning the tragic loss of a loved one, Tasaraf Hussain Village Behari, Tehsil Dadyal, Azad Kashmir. an overseas British Kashmiri from Rochdale,Greater Manchester, who was visiting his homeland to surprise his family.
“He was brutally shot and killed on his way home after just leaving Islamabad airport. This heartbreaking incident is not isolated; it’s part of a disturbing trend targeting overseas Kashmiris/Pakistanis.
“Our relative, a loving father of two children and husband to a grieving widow, is just one among many victims. His life was cut short in an act of senseless violence that could have been prevented with proper supervision and security measures on commonly travelled routes.
“We are calling upon our MP Tony Lloyd and the Government of Pakistan to take immediate action. We urge them to conduct a thorough investigation into this murder and bring the perpetrators to justice swiftly. Moreover, we implore them to implement stricter security measures for those traveling within the region.
“This plea isn’t just about our family; it’s about all families who live in fear for their loved ones visiting their homeland. It’s time for change – we need actions that will ensure safety for all overseas British Kashmiris/Pakistanis when they visit home.

Source: Sky News
Quote: ""The Shahed-107 was described as an ‘explosive and reconnaissance’ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), possibly fitted with technology to seek out high-value battlefield targets such as British and American multiple-launch rocket systems used by Ukrainian forces.""
Details: A Sky News source said that ""a few units"" of the specially designed drone may have been offered to Russia as part of the deal, estimated to be worth more than US$2 million (£1.6 million).
The source noted that this is evidence of ""the significant force design work Iran is engaged in to support Russia's interests regarding Ukraine"".
The article noted that the Shahed-107 belongs to the Shahed-101 family of uncrewed aerial vehicles with V-shaped tails.
It measures about 2.5 metres long, has a wingspan of 3 metres, can be launched from a vehicle and is estimated to have a range of up to 1,500km (932 miles).
A source told Sky News that it was thought to be equipped with a transmitter for real-time video transmission. ""Such reconnaissance capabilities mean the drone could be used to identify targets on Ukraine's frontline for other UAVs or weapons systems to hit,"" the TV channel pointed out.
The TV channel's sources in security agencies reported that the Iranian security forces had tested the Shahed-107 together with the Russians at an airbase in central Iran.
""If confirmed, defence experts said the development by Iran of a new drone would underline its growing military manufacturing capabilities and its importance to Russia's war effort,"" Sky News stressed.
Furthermore, according to the TV channel's sources, Russia expects to receive high-precision surface-to-surface missile systems from Iran shortly. In particular, these are missiles with a range of over 300km (186 miles).

The National Wellbeing Fund’s holdings of cash and investments that can be easily liquidated slumped to 5 trillion rubles ($56.5 billion) at the end of last year from 8.9 trillion rubles before the war, while total holdings fell almost 12% to 12 trillion rubles, Finance Ministry data showed. The value of the fund’s stakes in Russian companies and in bonds that were issued to finance infrastructure projects has surged by more than 2 trillion rubles, according to Bloomberg calculations.
“The total size of the NWF seems quite irrelevant now that a big chunk of it has been invested in Russian shares and infrastructure – essentially illiquid investments,” said Tatiana Orlova, economist at Oxford Economics. “Only liquid investments can be considered as rainy day reserves, the rest is gone.”
The wealth fund, which has taken years to build up its assets, is set to come under further pressure as Russia’s economy continues to be buffeted by sanctions that were imposed by Western nations in response to President Vladimir Putin’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Finance Ministry tapped around 3 trillion rubles from the fund to cover the budget deficit last year as it ramped up spending on the military and measures to cushion the economy. It plans to take another 1.3 trillion rubles this year.
In addition, budget rules provide for NWF funds to be paid over to the Finance Ministry to compensate it for a loss of export revenue should its earnings from oil sales undershoot the budget estimate of $60 a barrel.
What Bloomberg Economics Says:
“If oil prices continue to ignore the risks of supply disruption from the Israel-Hamas war, the remaining stock of the NWF’s liquid assets will continue to dwindle, making Russia increasingly vulnerable to shocks. It will last only another one to two years if Russia’s oil export price declines below $50.”
— Alex Isakov, Russia economist
“If the situation regarding energy prices is completely negative, we will use the National Wellbeing Fund,” Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told reporters last month. “But if we see that it decreases, then we will take other budget balancing measures. It’s clear that we are not interested in nullifying the National Wellbeing Fund and sitting without a penny in reserve.”

Such measures could include the partial privatization of state companies or increasing local borrowing.
The average price of Urals, Russia’s main crude-export blend, dropped more than 17% last year to $62.99 a barrel, according to the Finance Ministry. Bloomberg Economics projects that NWF will continue to be depleted this year unless the price exceeds about $73.

A video shows the burned-up tank spinning out of control after being bombarded by the Bradleys.
The T-90 is Russia's most advanced battle tank.
A video shows two US-made Bradley infantry fighting vehicles taking out one of Russia's main battle tanks.
In the drone footage shared online, two of Ukraine's vehicles can be seen engaging a Russian T-90 tank in the village of Stepove, on the outskirts of Avdiivka in northeastern Ukraine.
Reports say the tank was a T-90M Proryv, the latest in the series, with the most advanced armor, mobility, and firepower.

The Russian tank fires first at the fighting vehicles, and misses.
The two Bradley fighting vehicles spray the tank with 25mm one-pound shells. The Bradleys aimed at the juncture of the hull and the turret housing the gun systems, the weakest point on any tank, said Bulgariamilitary.com.
The Bradleys, firing at close range from different directions in a combat lasting 10 minutes, eventually caused the burned-up tank's turret to spin uncontrollably and then veer into a tree.
Drones also help the vehicles on the ground by firing from above throughout the exchange.
The Bradley vehicles were likely being operated by Ukraine's 47th Brigade, as it is the only brigade fighting with the US-supplied vehicles, according to Forbes.
Russia's T-90s are the main battle tanks used by the Russian military. The three-crew vehicles typically have a 125 mm smoothbore gun and thick composite armor.
Independent analysis suggests that Russia might have lost two-thirds of the tanks it began its invasion of Ukraine with.
Bradleys are also three-crew vehicles, that can also carry an additional seven infantry, armed with a 25 mm cannon that can fire at 200 rounds per minute.
The US provided Ukraine with around 200, of which at least 31 have been lost, per Forbes.
Russian soldiers are ""afraid"" of facing against Bradleys, a Ukrainian commander said, Newsweek reported.
The Ukrainian soldier, who goes by his call sign of ""Kach,"" said that Russian troops in tanks and troop carriers fear going into battle against the tracked armored fighting vehicles.
The Bradley is fast and ""very maneuverable"" and protects soldiers with its heavy armor, Kach told Newsweek. The Ukrainian commander also praised its ""powerful machine gun.""
Avdiivka has become a flash point of fighting in Ukraine, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the city in Donetsk in large numbers.
Russia has reportedly lost scores of tanks and armored vehicles in its attempted assaults on Avdiivka.

At the end of a two-day visit to Brazil, Wang made a stop in the Brazilian city of Fortaleza to meet President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva at an air force base before departing to Jamaica by the late afternoon. There were no details of Friday's meeting.
In Brasilia earlier, Wang said their two countries, both members of the BRICS group of leading emerging economies, must work together to build a multi-polar world based on peace and security.
Brazil's Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira said he and Wang discussed the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza and how they can be resolved, with China's top diplomat saying the two trade partners need to build closer levels of confidence.
China-Brazil relations were ruffled during the far-right government of former president Jair Bolsonaro, and have improved under Lula, a popular leftist leader in his third term.
Wang and Vieira signed a visa agreement between the two nations extending their validity from five to 10 years, aimed at spurring business travel and tourism.
Wang stopped in Fortaleza en route to Jamaica, the last stop of his tour that began in African nations.
Brazil's position on Taiwan was established in April in a foreign ministry statement that expressed Brazil's ""firm support to the One China Principle"" and said China was ""the sole legitimate government of the whole of China, and Taiwan being an inseparable part of the Chinese territory"".
China is Brazil's largest export market, mainly for soy and iron ore. Chinese companies are planning to increase their investments in Brazil, in power transmission, oil and electric vehicles, businessmen said at a Brazil-China meeting last week in Shenzhen with major Chinese corporations."

Netanyahu spoke after the International Court of Justice at The Hague held two days of hearings on South Africa's allegations that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians, a charge Israel has rejected as libelous and hypocritical. South Africa asked the court to order Israel to halt its blistering air and ground offensive in an interim step.
“No one will stop us, not The Hague, not the axis of evil and not anyone else,"" Netanyahu said in televised remarks Saturday evening, referring to Iran and its allied militias.
The case before the world court is expected to go on for years, but a ruling on interim steps could come within weeks. Court rulings are binding but difficult to enforce. Netanyahu made clear that Israel would ignore orders to halt the fighting, potentially deepening its isolation.
Israel has been under growing international pressure to end the war, which has killed more than 23,000 Palestinians in Gaza and led to widespread suffering in the besieged enclave, but has so far been shielded by U.S. diplomatic and military support.
Thousands took to the streets of Washington, London, Paris, Rome, Milan and Dublin on Saturday to demand an end to the war. Protesters converging on the White House held aloft signs questioning President Joe Biden’s viability as a presidential candidate because of his staunch support for Israel during the war.
Israel argues that ending the war means victory for Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007 and is bent on Israel's destruction.
The war was triggered by a deadly Oct. 7 attack in which Hamas and other militants killed some 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians. About 250 more were taken hostage, and while some have been released or confirmed dead, more than half are believed to still be in captivity. Sunday marks 100 days of fighting.
Fears of a wider conflagration have been palpable since the start of the war. New fronts quickly opened, with Iran-backed groups — Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria — carrying out a range of attacks. From the start, the U.S. increased its military presence in the region to deter an escalation.
Following a Houthi campaign of drone and missile attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea, the U.S. and Britain launched multiple airstrikes against the rebels Friday, and the U.S. hit another site Saturday.
In more fallout from the war, the world court this week heard arguments on South Africa's complaint against Israel. South Africa cited the soaring death toll and hardships among Gaza civilians, along with inflammatory comments from Israeli leaders presented, as proof of what it called genocidal intent.
In counter arguments Friday, Israel asked for the case to be dismissed as meritless. Israel's defense argued that the country has the right to fight back against a ruthless enemy, that South Africa had barely mentioned Hamas, and that it ignored what Israel considers attempts to mitigate civilian harm.
Meanwhile, Netanyahu and his army chief, Herzl Halevi, said they have no immediate plans to allow the return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza, the initial focus of Israel's offensive. Fighting in the northern half has been scaled back, with forces now focusing on the southern city of Khan Younis, though combat continues in parts of the north.
Netanyahu said the issue had been raised by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken during his visit earlier this week. The Israeli leader said he told Blinken that “we will not return residents (to their homes) when there is fighting.”
At the same time, Netanyahu said Israel would eventually need to close what he said were breaches along Gaza's border with Egypt. Over the years of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade, smuggling tunnels under Egypt-Gaza border had constituted a major supply line for Gaza.
However, the border area, particularly the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, is packed with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who had fled northern Gaza, and their presence would complicate any plans to widen Israel's ground offensive.
“We will not end the war until we close this breach,” Netanyahu said Saturday, adding that the government has not yet decided how to do that.
In Gaza, where Hamas has put up stiff resistance to Israel's blistering air and ground campaign, the war continued unabated.
The Gaza Health Ministry said Saturday that 135 Palestinians had been killed in the last 24 hours, bringing the overall toll of the war to 23,843. The count does not differentiate between combatants and civilians, but the ministry has said about two-thirds of the dead are women and children. The ministry said the total number of war-wounded surpassed 60,000.
Following an Israeli airstrike before dawn Saturday, video provided by Gaza's Civil Defense department showed rescue workers searching through the twisted rubble of a building in Gaza City by flashlight.
Footage showed them carrying a young girl wrapped in blankets with injuries to her face, and at least two other children who appeared dead. A boy, covered in dust, winced as he was loaded into an ambulance.
The attack on the home in the Daraj neighborhood killed at least 20 people, according to Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal.
Another strike late Friday near the southern city of Rafah on the Egyptian border killed at least 13 people, including two children. The bodies of those killed, primarily from a family displaced from central Gaza, were taken to the city's Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital where they were seen by an Associated Press reporter.
The Palestinian telecommunications company Jawwal said two of its employees were killed Saturday as they tried to repair the network in Khan Younis. They company said the two were hit by shelling. Jawwal said it has lost 13 employees since the start of the war.
Israel has argued that Hamas is responsible for the high civilian casualties, saying its fighters make use of civilian buildings and launch attacks from densely populated urban areas.
The Israeli military released a video Saturday that it said showed the destruction of two ready-to-use rocket launching compounds in Al-Muharraqa in central Gaza. A large grove of palm trees and some homes are seen in the frame. In the video, a rocket is being thrown into the air by the blast. The military said there had been dozens of launchers ready to be used.
Since the start of Israel’s ground operation in late October, 187 Israeli soldiers have been killed and another 1,099 injured in Gaza, according to the military.
More than 85% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has been displaced as a result of Israel’s air and ground offensive, and vast swaths of the territory have been leveled.
Fewer than half of the territory's 36 hospitals are still partially functional, according to OCHA, the United Nations' humanitarian affairs agency.
Amid already severe shortages of food, clean water and fuel in Gaza, OCHA said in its daily report that Israel's severe constraints on humanitarian missions and outright denials had increased since the start of the year.
The agency said only 21% of planned deliveries of food, medicine, water and other supplies have been successfully reaching northern Gaza.
American and other international efforts pushing Israel to do more to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians have met with little success.

TIRANA (Reuters) - Leonard Farruku, an Albanian migrant who died last month on a barge housing migrants in the United Kingdom, was buried close to the Albanian capital Tirana on Wednesday in a funeral attended by his relatives.
The death of Farruku, 27, reignited controversy surrounding the Bibby Stockholm, a barge for asylum seekers moored in southern England that rights groups have compared to a prison ship but which authorities say is necessary to cut the costs of accommodating migrants.
""He said he was treated very badly there ... like an animal,"" Farruku's aunt Drita Kapllani told Reuters, wiping away tears. ""Our souls and our hearts will have peace only when the truth is out.""
The British interior ministry said, ""This was a tragic incident, and our thoughts are with everyone affected. This is being investigated by the police and coroner.""
It added it took the welfare of those in its care very seriously and had rigorous safeguarding processes in place.
A coroner said at the opening of an inquest that there was nothing suspicious about his death and that he had died from ""compression of the neck"" caused by ""suspension by ligature"".
His death on Dec. 12 was a shock for Farruku's family who said he used to deliver pizzas across the Albanian capital, was calm and a hard worker, although like many young Albanians he struggled to earn much money.
He was encouraged by the fortunes of other family members who had already made it to Britain.
""He went there for a better life,"" said Marenglen Farruku, Leonard's cousin. ""He never showed any sign of distress ... there are so many unanswered questions what has happened there (on the barge).""
More than 11,000 Albanian asylum seekers arrived by boat in Britain between May and September 2022, representing nearly half of the total migrants arriving during that period.
In October 2023 the U.K. said that crossings by Albanians fell by 90% after collaboration between the two governments in December 2022.
Farruku was one of the few who still came. One relative said that Farruku thought his asylum claim would be fast tracked if he went onto the barge, only to become disillusioned once aboard. He was unable to move around and felt like he was permanently being watched, relatives said.
His sisters raised money online to bring his body home and pay for the funeral, led by an imam.
""My dearest brother that I will never see again. You will always be in our hearts,"" Farruku's sister Marsida said, as she threw soil over his coffin.

U2JSNGPLKI_WT8Z1DZCGZ8WI8J,"European Union institutions gear up for a fight over Orbán's rule of law record, funds for Hungary",RAF CASERT,"January 18, 2024 at 10:12 PM·3 min read",20240118,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/european-union-institutions-gear-fight-141245848.html,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's institutions are gearing up for a fight over Hungary and a contentious transfer of 10 billion euros (nearly $11 billion) in funds to Budapest.
The European Parliament decided to assess Thursday whether to take the bloc's executive branch, the European Commission, to court over allegations that it gave into blackmail from Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to get his approval to start membership talks with Ukraine.
The European Parliament made the decision in a 345-104 vote and tasked its legal department to prepare the groundwork for a possible challenge at the EU's highest court. It wants to see whether the European Commission took all measures “to protect the EU’s financial interests” in its dealings with Orbán. They said that Hungary didn't meet the rule of law requirements to get the money.
The vote followed a bruising debate in the plenary during which legislators of major center-right and center-left groups all criticized European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for making sure the money was approved just before Orbán unexpectedly and crucially abstained from the Ukraine vote at a summit in December.
The funds were only supposed to be released if Hungary had shown enough effort to force through some rule of law reforms on judicial independence and political interference, and during Wednesday's plenary, von der Leyen said that the country had pushed through measures to earn the release of funds.
She said the European Commission had no option but to approve the funds and strongly denied the two issues were linked.
“These are the rules we have all agreed to,” she said. “We will follow them. This is what makes the rule of law stand out from arbitrary power.
Many parliamentarians disagreed, however.
“Once again the Parliament is having to step in,"" said parliamentary rapporteur Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield of the Greens group, complaining that the European Commission and the member states “seem happy to give a carte blanche to Viktor Orbán to continue his bullying tactics and attacks on the rule of law.”
The EU is still blocking around 20 billion euros (nearly $22 billion) in funds over similar rule of law concerns, and the parliament doesn't want to see them fall prey to political brinkmanship. On Feb. 1, EU leaders will have another summit, hoping to approve 50 billion euros (nearly $55 billion) in much-needed financial aid to Ukraine, which Orbán did block at the last summit in December.
It wasn't the first time Orbán had derailed EU plans to provide funding to Ukraine. The nationalist leader is widely considered to be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest ally in the EU, and has been accused by his critics of promoting Moscow’s interests over those of his EU and NATO allies.
Orbán has advocated for an immediate end to the fighting and pushed for peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, though he hasn't detailed what such a step would entail for Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
Orbán has been at odds with his fellow EU leaders, top officials and legislators for years, ranging from fights over COVID-19 recovery money to his declining respect for the Western democratic principles that are the essence of the EU. Yet as the longest-serving EU leader, he knows the EU rules inside out and has been able to extract financial concessions time and again to shore up his struggling economy."
U33AWHSDCK_R17PRRXC3AJ6AML,Bee-harming neonicotinoid pesticide has emergency approval again,Malcolm Prior - BBC News rural affairs producer,"January 19, 2024 at 4:45 AM·2 min read",20240118,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/bee-harming-pesticide-granted-emergency-190452611.html,"The UK government has given emergency approval for the use of a pesticide banned because of the harm it can cause bees, for the fourth year in a row.
Permission to use the neonicotinoid on sugar beet seeds has been needed despite a vow by the industry to find an alternative by the end of 2023.
The Wildlife Trusts said the decision was a ""deathblow"" for wildlife.
The government said it was a ""necessary and proportionate measure"" to tackle a damaging crop virus spread by aphids.
It added that the product - which has been banned since 2018 - can only be used if an independent, scientifically-verified level of threat posed by the disease, Virus Yellows, is met in March.
That threshold will be a 65% infection across the national sugar beet crop.
The NFU said the Virus Yellows disease had already caused sugar beet crop losses of up to 80% in recent years and threatened an industry with more than 9,500 jobs.
Sugar-beet farmer Michael Sly, who has land across north Cambridgeshire and south Lincolnshire and is the chair of the NFU's sugar board, said he was ""relieved"" the derogation had been granted.
He said farmers would ""ensure safe and responsible use of the treatment"" if the pesticide had to be used.
""The homegrown sugar industry is working hard to find viable, long-term solutions to this disease,"" he added.
Environmental and wildlife campaigners warned that the neonicotinoid - a seed treatment called thiamethoxam - disrupts bees' ability to navigate and reproduce.
Barnaby Coupe, land use policy manager at The Wildlife Trusts, said the decision to authorise its use was ""a deathblow for wildlife, a backwards step in evidence-based decision making, and a betrayal of farmers who are producing food sustainably"".
Richard Benwell, CEO of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of environmental and rural campaign groups, said the decision ""flies in the face of ecological sense"".
Back in 2020, British Sugar - which supplies 60% of the UK's sugar - had told the government that in three years it would have developed alternatives to the seed treatment.
Dan Green, the company's agriculture director, told the BBC that research was continuing and included ""research into how the industry can benefit from gene editing"".
The company hopes Virus Yellows resistant crops will be available commercially by 2026.
Farming Minister Mark Spencer said his decision had been based on robust scientific assessment with the risk evaluated ""very carefully"".
""We recognise the damaging impact that an outbreak of beet yellow virus could have on farmer livelihoods. We therefore regard issuing an emergency authorisation as a necessary and proportionate measure,"" he added."

They were responding to a call by the Israeli umbrella organization of trade unions, Histadrut, to mark 100 days since the start of the Gaza war on October 7.
At the beginning of the strike, thousands of participants in a rally organized by relatives and supporters of the hostages remained silent for 100 seconds as a sign of solidarity. The rally in Tel Aviv is set to last 24 hours until Sunday evening.
Histadrut leader Arnon Ben-David said at the rally: ""[Israel is] in the middle of a terrible dream, and I want to wake up from this terrible dream and create a new Israel.""
""We are striking today to work together to rebuild the land of Israel.
""We will rebuild everything they have tried to destroy.""
Israel has been fighting the Palestinian Islamist organization Hamas in Gaza since Hamas militants and other extremist groups launched a bloody raid on Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 and kidnapping around 240.
Israel estimates that 136 hostages are still being held in Gaza and that two dozen of them have died.
Israel responded to the massacre with massive airstrikes and launched a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip.
According to the Hamas-controlled health authorities in Gaza, about 24,000 have been killed and some 60,600 others injured in the sealed-off coastal strip since the beginning of the Israeli campaign. These figures cannot currently be independently verified.
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock reaffirmed her hope for the release of all hostages. ""We will not give up, we will not let up in our work until all Hamas hostages are back home,"" Baerbock wrote on the social media platform X on Sunday.
""For 100 days, children, parents, brothers, sisters, friends have been missing in #Israel. 100 days of uncertainty, despair, grief - and hope.""
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) renewed its appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire. ""The massive death, destruction, displacement, hunger, loss, and grief of the last 100 days are staining our shared humanity,"" UNRWA Commissioner General Philippe Lazzarini wrote in a statement.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has once again pledged that his country will fight ""until total victory.""
""Nobody will stop us,"" Netanyahu said late Saturday, referring to the genocide lawsuit filed by South Africa at the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
""The hypocritical onslaught at The Hague against the state of the Jews that arose from the ashes of the Holocaust, at the behest of those who came to perpetrate another Holocaust against the Jews – is a moral low point in the history of nations,"" Netanyahu said.
The state of Israel, its armed forces and security services are waging a ""moral and just war that is unrivalled, against the Hamas monsters, the new Nazis,"" said Netanyahu, who is under pressure domestically.
In the Hamas tunnels under the Gaza Strip, the army had found copies of Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kampf,"" Netanyahu said.
Hamas members are ""the new Nazis,"" said Netanyahu, saying he was quoting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
However, at a joint press conference with Netanyahu on October 17 in Tel Aviv, it was Netanyahu himself, not Scholz, who said this phrase.
A German government spokesperson on Sunday said that Scholz had ""never used this formulation himself.""
In his speech, Netanyahu thanked Scholz for Germany's clear rejection of the genocide claim brought against Israel.
""We are continuing the war until the end – until total victory, until we achieve all of our goals: Eliminating Hamas, returning all of our hostages and ensuring that Gaza will never again constitute a threat to Israel.""
There were civilian casualties in new attacks from Lebanon in northern Israel on Sunday. A 40-year-old man was killed and a 70-year-old woman seriously injured in the border town of Kfar Yuval, according to the Magen David Adom rescue service.
The Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack with anti-tank missiles on the village and three others in the border area. According to the militia, the attack was in support of the Palestinian people.
According to the Israeli army, a house in Kfar Yuval was hit by a rocket. For their part, Israeli fighter jets had attacked ""Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure and military targets in Lebanon.""
There was another exchange of fire overnight, the army said earlier in the day. The soldiers returned fire, and four militants were killed, it said."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) -Hamas aired video on Sunday showing three Israeli hostages it is holding in Gaza in which they urged their government to stop the offensive against the Palestinian Islamist group and bring about their release, as both sides marked the 100th day of the war.
The undated 37-second video of Noa Argamani, 26, Yossi Sharabi, 53, and Itai Svirsky, 38, ended with the chyron: ""Tomorrow we will inform you of their fate.""
Hamas said earlier on Sunday it had lost contact with some hostages as Israeli forces shelled Gaza, noting that they might have been killed in the process. At the outset of the war, it also threatened to execute hostages in retaliation for Israeli military strikes.
Israeli officials have generally declined to respond to Hamas' public messaging on the hostages, casting it as psychological warfare. Hagar Mizrahi, a forensic official with Israel's Health Ministry, told local TV on Dec. 31 that autopsies of slain hostages who had been recovered found causes of death inconsistent with Hamas' account they had died in air strikes.
But Israel has also made clear it is aware of the risks to hostages from its offensive, and is taking precautions.
""The military operation takes time. It obligates us to be precise, and we are adapting it in accordance with the threats and the hostages who are in the field,"" chief armed forces spokesperson Rear-Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Sunday.
Of some 240 people seized by Hamas in an Oct. 7 cross-border killing spree that sparked the war, around half were released in a November truce. Israel says 132 remain in Gaza and that 25 of them have died in captivity.
The hostage crisis has riveted Israelis reeling from the worst attack in their history. Some hostages' relatives have called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to enter another truce or even call off the war. He has vowed to fight on until Hamas is destroyed, which he argued would enable the hostages' release.
Last month, Netanyahu said in parliament he had asked Beijing to help free Argamani, whose mother Liora is Chinese. Suffering from a terminal illness, Liora Argamani has appealed to be reunited with her daughter before she dies.

""We are determined to sustain our support for Ukraine and we're working very closely with Congress in order to work to do that. I know our European colleagues will do the same thing,"" Blinken told Zelenskyy as they met at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
The Biden administration has struggled to get Congress to approve a $60 billion aid package for Ukraine in the face of opposition from Republican lawmakers.
U.S. funding for Ukraine locked up in Congress
President Biden's request for the Ukraine aid, part of a $106 billion foreign aid package, has been stalled for weeks amid demands from Republicans — including many supportive of the Ukraine assistance — that it include strict new border security provisions and changes to U.S. immigration policy.
Negotiations continue, but the White House warned before Christmas that the U.S. would run out of funding to assist Ukraine by the end of 2023 if more was not approved, with Mr. Biden warning that if the funding wasn't approved, it would be the ""greatest Christmas gift"" for Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
Given former President Donald Trump's bid to return to the White House with the U.S. elections in November, and his previous remarks suggesting some level of trust in Putin, Zelenskyy has been keen to stress to American politicians the importance of U.S. assistance as his country tries to fend off Russia's ongoing invasion.
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan had both discussed with Zelenskyy in Davos ""the importance of continued global assistance to support Ukraine as it fights for its freedom and sovereignty"" and ""strongly reiterated the United States' enduring support for Ukraine and its territorial integrity in the face of Russia's illegal war of aggression.""
European funding for Ukraine blocked by Hungary
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday said Ukraine's allies need to guarantee stable backing for Kyiv as questions swirl over future support from not only the United States, but the European Union. ""Ukraine can prevail in this war. But we must continue to empower their resistance,"" the head of the EU's executive arm told the Davos forum. ""Ukrainians need predictable financing throughout 2024 and beyond. They need a sufficient and sustained supply of weapons to defend Ukraine and regain its rightful territory."" EU leaders will hold a summit on Feb. 1 to try to overcome a block from Hungary on providing 50 billion euros ($54.5 billion) in financial aid to Ukraine over the next four years.
The government in Kyiv desperately needs the funds to prop up its economy and keep services working as Russia's all-out war heads toward the start of its third year. Budapest — Moscow's closest ally in the 27-nation EU — has signaled that it could agree to the aid if it is given the chance each year to veto further payments. EU officials say that if they cannot win over Hungary, the other 26 member states will look to provide cash outside the EU's budget, but this would likely be for a shorter timeframe. Despite the concerns over funding and Ukraine's failure to make a breakthrough on the battlefield, von der Leyen said Russia was still ""failing on strategic goals"" with its war. ""Russia has lost roughly half of its military capabilities. Ukraine has driven Russia out of half the territories it had captured. Ukraine has pushed back Russia's Black Sea Fleet,"" she said. ""Russia's failure is also economic. Sanctions have decoupled its economy from modern technology and innovation. It is now dependent on China.""

UH25S20YGS_MLB2ZTA84MW372I,UK lobbied White House to lift Houthis ban shortly after Joe Biden elected,Edward Malnick,"January 21, 2024 at 3:18 AM·3 min read",20240120,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/uk-lobbied-white-house-lift-191818566.html,"Britain lobbied the US to lift its ban on the Houthi rebel movement shortly after Joe Biden entered the White House, The Telegraph can disclose.
The Foreign Office joined the United Nations in pressuring Washington to lift severe penalties imposed on the Iran-backed militant group in the final months of Donald Trump’s administration.
Last week Antony Blinken, the US Secretary of State, announced that the US would once again designate the Houthis as a terrorist organisation, after weeks of attacks on UK and US vessels in the Red Sea. The UK is considering following suit.
Writing in The Telegraph, Robert Jenrick, the former immigration minister, urges Rishi Sunak’s government to proscribe both the Houthis and Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, insisting “it cannot be business as usual for the UK’s posture towards Iran”.
A parliamentary answer delivered by Lord Ahmad, the Middle East minister, in March 2021, two months after Mr Biden entered the White House, revealed that the UK had been raising concerns that the Houthis’ designation by the US would disrupt the flow of aid to Yemen. At the time, Boris Johnson was Prime Minister and Dominic Raab was foreign secretary.
Asked on March 22 2021 what steps, if any, the UK was taking to designate the Houthi movement as a terrorist organisation, Lord Ahmad said: “We have no plans to proscribe the Houthis, but we keep the use of sanctions under review.
“We welcomed the US announcement to revoke the previous administration’s designation of the Houthis as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation.
“The UK had engaged closely with the US administration on this matter, sharing our concerns that designation would disrupt humanitarian operations in Yemen.”
This weekend, the Foreign Office declined to answer further questions about its approach in 2021, including who signed off the decision to press the US to drop its terror designation.
Lord Ahmad acknowledged at the time “the Houthis’ dangerous military escalation, including cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia and their renewed offensive on Marib. In addition, the UN Security Council recently adopted a UK drafted resolution sanctioning Houthi official Sultan Zabin for the use of sexual violence as a tool of war.” He added: “We must address the Houthi sense of impunity.”
Writing in this newspaper, Mr Jenrick states: “Behind the Houthis lies the hand of Iran who have spent years training and supplying them as one of their many regional proxies. Indeed, Hamas’s October 7th massacre would not have been possible without Iran, even if Tehran’s tactical involvement is currently unclear. And in the last fortnight alone the Iranian regime itself has sent a wave of violence reverberating through the region.
“Against this backdrop, it cannot be business as usual for the UK’s posture towards Iran. It’s time we took the fanatical Iranian regime at their word and treated them as the zealots they openly profess to be. Their friends the Houthis should be proscribed as a terrorist group as the American Government has now done for the second time, as should the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp, which we have been painfully slow to do.”
A government spokesman said: “The UK government, law enforcement and our international partners continue to work together to identify, deter and respond to global threats.
“Whilst the government keeps the list of proscribed organisations under review, we do not comment on whether a specific organisation is or is not being considered for proscription.”

Lawmakers have conveyed as much directly to the White House, a US official told CNN. And underscoring the current gridlock, Pentagon officials have not held a single meeting since last month to decide on what to send Ukraine from the Defense Department’s weapons stockpiles — because there is no money left to fund the aid packages.
Biden met with House and Senate lawmakers at the White House on Wednesday to outline what is at stake for Ukraine. At one point, the President turned to his national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to lay out specific capabilities that Ukraine would run out of in the coming months, according to a White House official familiar with the meeting, who declined to get into more detail. Another official told CNN that they specifically pointed to air defense systems and artillery ammunition as examples of key capabilities that could be depleted without US support.
Biden also warned that US personnel were on the line, saying that if the Ukraine-Russia war spills over into NATO territory, the US would have to get directly involved in the conflict.
But House Speaker Mike Johnson, who along with other House Republicans has tied additional Ukraine funding to a broader immigration deal, said afterward that continuing to fund Ukraine risked turning it into a quagmire for the US akin to its two-decade war in Afghanistan.
“We cannot spend billions of dollars without a clear strategy articulated and I told the president in the meeting today again, as I’ve been saying repeatedly, ‘Sir, you have to articulate what the strategy is. What is the endgame?’” Johnson said Wednesday night in an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.
At the White House on Thursday, Biden told reporters he thought the meeting went well and that he believed “the vast majority of members of Congress support aid” to Ukraine.
“The question is whether or not a small minority are going to hold it up, which would be a disaster,” Biden said.
Meanwhile, inside the White House, NATO headquarters and in Kyiv, there is a keen awareness that if Donald Trump is reelected in November, he will likely slash support for Kyiv.
“The number one reason Republicans will not come out in favor of a supplemental for Ukraine is they don’t want to offend candidate Trump and his supporters,” Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley said on CNN Max on Wednesday. “He’s already made it clear what he would do — the war would be over on his first day, which means Putin gets to keep the borders he has, if not more.”
No matter what happens in American politics this year, US and Western intelligence officials believe that Russia’s war in Ukraine is likely to go on for much longer.
Assessments vary, but virtually all of them assume that there will be at least two more years of fighting, according to multiple sources familiar with the intelligence — long enough to outlast Biden’s first term. Privately, some US and Western officials say there could be as many as five more years of fighting.
Administration officials and lawmakers, including some hawkish Republicans, have for that reason been eager to approve and channel the funding to Ukraine before the clock potentially runs out at the end of 2024.
“Aside from there being a desperate need, getting as much aid in before January 2025 is on the minds of a lot of folks I’ve spoken to,” said one US official. “Not only is it important that the monies get appropriated, but that they get disbursed before the election as any FY24 funds still waiting to be spent can get blocked by Trump.”
A congressional aide familiar with the discussions said that the more hawkish lawmakers, like Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, were among those pushing last fall for Congress to approve enough funding to hold Ukrainian military forces over through the 2024 election. The administration ultimately requested $60 billion, but Congress could not reach a deal before the end of last year — doing anything more in a fraught election year may now be little more than a pipedream, the aide said.
“We are out of money,” said a US military official stationed in Europe. “The administration was able to do some magic [but] we’re getting down to the last of it.”
Said one source familiar with Western intelligence, “Basically everything depends on Biden getting reelected, doesn’t it?”
Continued Western support for Ukraine is critical, US and Western officials argue, even as the battle lines have remained largely static over the last several months following a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive to retake territory seized by Russia.
Still, in the short term, US intelligence officials don’t believe a drop-off in US funding will have a major battlefield impact for Ukraine. Russia is struggling to regroup, which buys Ukraine some time, people familiar with the assessments said. But in the longer term, a lack of US aid could allow Moscow to regain momentum by ramping up its weapons supply and taking advantage of support from Iran and North Korea, one of the people said.
US officials have also considered the impact that a pullback of US support could have on other allies, particularly the message it sends about the US not having the political will to support allies and partners long term. Another concern is that Europe, which is already at the bottom of the barrel of its weapons and ammunition supplies, follows the US lead and begins to withdraw some aid.
More immediately, an end to US funding for Ukraine could limit Ukraine’s ability to conduct long-range strikes into Russian-occupied Crimea and the Black Sea —strikes that have been supported by Western weapons, including US-provided Army Tactical Missile Systems, also known as ATACMS.
If that pipeline were to dry up, US officials believe that Ukraine could lose its ability to conduct some of its most high-profile operations, a person familiar with US intelligence assessments told CNN. Ukraine’s strikes on Russia’s Black Sea fleet last fall, which forced Russia to withdraw many of its ships from Sevastopol in occupied Crimea, have been seen as a particularly effective use of the Western-provided long-range missiles.
Ukraine is expected to spend this year working to bolster its defense industrial base and rebuild its forces in anticipation of even more fighting in 2025, the US official said— a strategy that Russia is likely to focus on as well.
“That’s why continued Western support is so critical, as this next year will be when everything is done that will decide how 2025 and possibly beyond play out,” this person said.
Another attempt at a major counteroffensive by Ukraine, with the goal of splitting the Russian forces at the southern occupied city of Melitopol, is likely still at least two years away, said the US military official stationed in Europe, and US and Western officials do not expect either Ukraine or Russia to make major battlefield gains in 2024.
Both sides are “too exhausted in terms of troops and equipment to see huge moves in 2024,” this person said. The Ukrainians have discussed 2025 being “a more feasible option in terms of what they can generate to start another offensive,” the military official said.
Still, Russia has continued to try to force Ukraine into submission with huge barrages of missile and drone attacks targeting Kyiv and other major cities across the country, spreading Ukrainian air defenses thin. Ukraine is also struggling to recruit new troops, especially in the wake of a grueling attempted counteroffensive that cost thousands of lives.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a news conference last month that his military had proposed mobilizing an additional 450,000 to 500,000 men to join the war, but that he had not yet authorized the plan because it will cost Ukraine billions.
“The mobilization of an additional 450,000 to 500,000 people will cost Ukraine 500 billion hryvnia [$13 billion] and I would like to know where the money will come from,” Zelenskyy said. “Considering that it takes six Ukrainian working civilians paying taxes to pay the salary of one soldier, I would need to get 3 million more working people somewhere to be able to pay for the additional troops.”
This is not where the Biden administration hoped to be on the two-year anniversary of the conflict, with the possibility of a second Trump administration looming.
Administration and congressional officials began discussing last year how to channel as much aid to Ukraine as possible before January 2025, sources familiar with the talks told CNN.
“Not only is it important that the monies get appropriated, but that they get disbursed before the election, as any FY24 funds still waiting to be spent can get blocked by Trump,” the US official said.
At one point last fall, some more hawkish members of Congress privately estimated that Ukraine would need as much as $100 billion to get through 2024, the congressional aide said. The White House ultimately settled on a $61 billion request for 2024, around $7 billion more than it requested for Ukrainian military aid for 2023.
A congressional aide familiar with the discussions said that the longer negotiations over the supplemental drag on, the less likely it is to be approved.
“We’re in the middle of an intense election cycle, where taking a tough vote like this in the shadow of presidential and down-ballot elections is a nonstarter for a lot of people,” the aide said. “So for the hawks among us, frontloading is the way to sustain support through what is going to be a politically intense year on the home front.”
Meanwhile, senior US officials have been working for the last year to come up with a legal case for seizing and transferring to Ukraine the roughly $300 billion in Russian Central Bank assets held in the West, CNN previously reported. Those assets were frozen after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
The rare maneuver would require buy-in from US allies in the Group of 7 advanced economies, as well as an act of Congress to give the president the authority to seize Russian assets held in the US.  With Congress still fighting over the supplemental and how to avoid a government shutdown, it is unclear how soon that bill will come to a vote.
In the near term, Ukraine may be able to hang on, albeit in a stalemate, without US support, a Western intelligence source said. But that would still be a significant loss not only for Ukraine, but also for the US’ standing in the world, this person said.
“It shows [Russia] they were able to take territory and shows other nations they can take territory by force,” this person said. “The whole point here is to show that in today’s day and age, major powers cannot just go and take territory by force.”

Russian officials blamed Ukraine for the attack near the town of Klintsy 60 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border with domestic media reporting fires in four oil tanks initially affected had spread, engulfing a 10,000 square-foot area, but no injuries.
Bryansk governor Alexander Bogomaz said air defenses disabled the drone, one of three targeted at the area, with electronic jamming but its munitions fell on the depot forcing nearby residents from their homes. The other two were shot down.
""Four oil tanks are burning in Klintsy. For safety reasons, 32 residents were temporarily evacuated to relatives. A temporary accommodation center has been prepared,"" Bogomaz
Authorities dispatched 13 fire trucks with 140 firefighters to the scene to battle the blaze.
Acknowledging responsibility for the attack, Ukraine said it was ""fair"" retaliation for a wave of Russian missile and attack drone strikes on its civilian infrastructure in recent weeks, most recently a large-scale missile attack Saturday, a Jan. 8 assault on provincial Ukrainian cities and villages that killed four people and injured at least 38 and a Jan. 2 onslaught against Kyiv and Kharkiv that killed at least six people and injured more than 130.
Another Ukrainian retaliatory attack Thursday targeted a major oil loading terminal hundreds of miles inside Russia in St. Petersburg, the country's second-largest city.
Ukraine's Strategic Industries Minister Oleksandr Kamyshin claimed the drone hit its target but Russian reports suggested it was shot down without causing damage.
A source at Ukraine's intelligence directorate told local media the military planned to mount more attacks to take advantage of the fact most of Russia's air defense and electronic warfare systems had been redeployed to occupied areas of Ukraine, the BBC reported."

After years of federal efforts to lower prescription drug prices, is a shaky plan to import them from Canada the best the U.S. can do?

“The U.S. needs to solve its own drug pricing problem, and not rely on other countries to do it for them,” said Dr. Joel Lexchin, a professor emeritus at the School of Health Policy and Management at York University in Toronto.
Under a new policy the Food and Drug Administration approved last week, the Florida government will be able to purchase prescription drugs in bulk directly from wholesalers in Canada, where drugs are often cheaper than in the U.S.

The agreement will remain in force until Ukraine joins NATO.
Source: European Pravda
Details: The two leaders signed the document entitled ""Agreement on Security Cooperation between Ukraine and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland"" after talks at the Mariinskyi Palace in Kyiv, on 12 January.
This agreement was the first in the field of security agreements to implement the agreements agreed upon during the Vilnius NATO summit between Ukraine, members of the G7 group, and the states that joined them.
The UK's security commitments under this document will remain in effect until Ukraine joins NATO, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after signing it.
""If such guarantees had been reached in 1991, particularly with the UK, the war would not have started,"" Volodymyr Zelenskyy is convinced.
Rishi Sunak, for his part, stressed that this is ""the first of the security assurances signed by Ukraine"". The UK Prime Minister stressed that the UK was the first to provide Ukraine with lethal weapons, tanks, long-range missiles, etc.
The leaders also said that the agreement stipulates a ten-year validity term with the possibility of extension. However, if Ukraine joins NATO before the expiration of its security commitments, it will end and be incorporated into the NATO system.
Background:
On 10 January, the Office of the President stated that the participants in the relevant negotiations moved on to direct processing of the draft agreement between Ukraine and the UK, discussed its main elements and individual thematic blocks, and agreed on a further schedule of bilateral negotiations.
Before that, Ukraine held the second round of consultations on concluding a bilateral agreement on providing ""security guarantees"" to Kyiv with the United Kingdom.
Earlier, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukrainian Foreign Minister, said that he received signals from the EU that there are no problems in the negotiations on a bilateral agreement on ""security guarantees"" between the EU and Ukraine in continuation of the G7 declaration.
The G7 group countries at the NATO summit in Vilnius in July agreed on a framework document on security guarantees for Ukraine. Specific bilateral agreements with states agreeing to provide security obligations were supposed to be signed later.

A member of the SI Swimsuit family since 2015, Hailey Clauson first posed for the annual issue in Hawai’i and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Her breathtaking rookie features earned her the cover of the magazine the following year, after an incredible photoshoot in Turks and Caicos with James Macari.
The 28-year-old California native has returned to the fold plenty of times since, traveling to Finland, Indonesia, the Bahamas, Australia, Barbados and the Dominican Republic with the publication. Clauson has also worked with notable brands like Jean Paul Gaultier, Calvin Klein, Louis Vuitton and Versace throughout her time in the industry.
Modeling since the age of 13, the industry veteran also took on a new role last spring, as the co-owner and creative director of Margaux, a boutique modeling agency based in Los Angeles.
“I have been modeling for 15 years and I got this opportunity to become a partner of an agency and I thought it was a really unique opportunity, coming from somebody that’s been in the model’s shoes, using all my good and bad experiences with modeling agencies and being a model, kind of bringing that to the agency,” she told us last summer of her new career opportunity. “I really feel like I’m taking my power back in the industry, really making the change that I want to see.”

Some 300 residents have already left the city, one of the biggest civilian evacuations on Russian soil since Moscow launched hostilities against Ukraine in February 2022.
""Today, 392 schoolchildren from Belgorod will go to out-of-town health camps in the Voronezh and Kaluga regions for 21 days,"" Belgorod mayor Valentin Demidov said.
The evacuations come a day after the Kremlin vowed Russia's military would do ""everything"" it could to stop the shelling, which officials say has left over two dozen people dead.
""Nowhere is safe,"" 42-year-old kindergarten teacher Evgenia Savenko told AFP, as she walked through the city's main square with her preschool-age son.
""It can happen anywhere -- at home or in a neighbouring town,"" she said. ""The fear is always present. It never goes away.""
At the train station, which was guarded by military and transport police, parents could be seen escorting children carrying rucksacks and small suitcases.
- 'Every day they bomb' -
The evacuations are a blow to the Kremlin, which has tried to maintain a semblance of normalcy in Russia ahead of President Vladimir Putin's re-election campaign.
Schools near the border with Ukraine had already been ordered to shut beyond their winter holidays, after a Ukrainian attack on December 30 killed 25 people.
Putin vowed to intensify strikes in response to that attack, the deadliest on Russian territory since its Ukraine offensive began almost two years ago.
""Every day they bomb, in the morning and in the evening,"" said 83-year-old pensioner Nina Tikhonova, whose neighbour's house was damaged by shelling.
""My acquaintances took their children to Ivanovo,"" a Russian city some 250 kilometres (155 miles) northeast of the capital Moscow, she said.
The first group of children have left Belgorod for camps in the neighbouring region of Voronezh, further from the border, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said earlier on Telegram.
The city estimates that in total, some 1,300 schoolchildren are ready to leave, the mayor Demidov said, citing surveys given to their parents.

There should be a complete liberation of Ukrainian territory from Russian forces within the internationally recognized borders of 1991, said Havryliuk.
At the same time, he says, all wars end at the negotiation table, where documents are signed.

“This document should include a clause on Russia’s abandonment of nuclear weapons because this state is a threat to the world.”
Havryliuk stated that preventive mechanisms should be established to prevent Russia from preparing for an attack on Ukraine or any other neighboring country again.

PARIS (Reuters) -French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he would head to Ukraine in February to finalise a bilateral security guarantee deal under which Paris would deliver more sophisticated weaponry, including long-range cruise missiles.
The trip comes at a time when political infighting in the U.S. and European Union has held up two major packages of assistance for Ukraine.
Macron said some 40 SCALP long-range missiles and several hundred bombs would be delivered in the coming weeks.
""We are going to deliver a lot more equipment and help Ukraine with what it needs to defend its skies,"" Macron told a news conference. ""I will go myself to Ukraine in February and finalise these texts.""
France has already delivered about 50 SCALP missiles, which have a range of about 250 km, three times as far as Ukraine's existing missile capacities.
Macron added that Europeans would in the coming weeks ramp up their support for Ukraine so it could continue to defend itself against Russia because Moscow could not be allowed to defeat Ukraine otherwise the security of Europe would be put at risk.
Ukraine's defence minister will be in Paris on Thursday, France's defence ministry said on Tuesday.
G7 countries in June unveiled an international framework for the long-term security of Ukraine to boost its finances and defences against Russia with a view to deterring Moscow from future aggression, officials said.
Ukraine has lobbied for long-term security commitments from its main backers. France has been negotiating bilaterally since June, but there has been scant detail on what countries are willing to do and with the war entering its third year there are questions about how committed Kyiv's allies may be.
French diplomatic sources have said the accord would outline the framework for long-term humanitarian aid, support for reconstruction and military assistance.
Kyiv is seeking to maintain flows of military and financial aid from its Western allies after nearly two years of fighting a full-scale Russian invasion.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was in Kyiv last week to sign a new security agreement and announce an increase in military funding for Ukraine to buy drones, including surveillance, long-range strike and sea drones.

Credit - Russian FMA Telegram Channel Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images
North Korea has officially dropped peaceful reunification with the South as a key policy goal, according to state reports on Tuesday.
In a speech to the Supreme People’s Assembly, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he no longer saw the South as a “partner of reconciliation and reunification,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.
The policy shift will see the closure of three government agencies tasked with unification and inter-Korean tourism, namely the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification, the National Economic Cooperation Bureau, and the Mount Kumgang International Tourism Administration.
Kim has also reportedly ordered revisions to the North’s constitution, aiming to remove all reference to “peaceful reunification” and “great national unity” from broadcasts, websites, and monuments.
“We can specify in our constitution the issue of completely occupying, subjugating and reclaiming the ROK and annexing it as a part of the territory of our ​republic in case a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula,” Kim said.
Although North Korea’s approach to the South has fluctuated widely over decades, at times calling Seoul its main enemy and threatening to “annihilate it” with nuclear weapons, reunification has remained the state's official goal. But the growing economic gap between the North and South as well as rising North-South tensions has further diminished the prospect.
On Tuesday, South Korea’s President Yoon Suk Yeol described the decision as “anti-national and ahistorical.” The North and South have been engaged in a truce—but not a peace treaty—since the end of the Korean war, which took place from 1950 to 1953. As a result, the two nations have technically remained in a state of war since.
“We don’t want war, but we have no intention of avoiding it,” Kim said.
Pyongyang has stepped up its missile tests in recent months amid escalating tensions with Seoul. On Monday, North Korea said it successfully tested its first solid-fuel hypersonic missile, another breakthrough in advanced weaponry.
According to a report released last week by 38 North, published by the Washington, D.C.-based Stimson Center think-tank, former state department official Robert Carlin and nuclear scientist Siegfried Hecke described current North-South relations as “more dangerous than it has been at any time since early June 1950.”

The strikes come as the U.S and other countries launched separate strikes in Yemen on Friday and Saturday.
According to the Turkish Defense Ministry, aircraft struck Kurdish militant targets in Metina, Hakurk, Gara and Qandil in northern Iraq. The strikes were in response to an attack on a Turkish military base in Iraq that left nine Turkish soldiers dead.
The defense ministry said fighter jets destroyed caves, bunkers, shelters and oil facilities ""to eliminate terrorist attacks against our people and security forces ... and to ensure our border security."" The statement said ""many"" militants were ""neutralized."" It did not specify any attacks in Syria.
The targets were affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), a banned Kurdish separatist group that maintains bases in northern Iraq, the ministry said. The PKK is considered a terror organization by the United States and other Turkish allies in Europe.

The Iraqi news website Rudaw, based in Erbil, reported that the base attacked on Friday was located on Mount Zap in Amedi district, approximately 10 miles from the Turkish border.
Turkey’s state-run news agency Anadolu said a senior PKK militant was ""neutralized"" in Iraq, some 100 miles inside the Turkey-Iraq border.
The Turkish Defense Ministry said Friday night’s attack on the military base in northern Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, left five soldiers dead. Four additional soldiers died later of critical injuries. Fifteen militants were also killed during the assault, the ministry said.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan expressed his condolences for the deaths of the Turkish soldiers on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.
""We will fight to the end against the PKK terrorist organization within and outside our borders,"" he wrote. Turkey often launches strikes against targets it believes to be affiliated with the PKK.
Previously, Turkish officials said PKK-affiliated militants tried to break into a Turkish base in northern Iraq three weeks ago. The attack left six Turkish soldiers dead. The following day, six more Turkish soldiers were killed in clashes.
The Turkish military responded to the attacks by launching airstrikes and land assaults that left dozens of Kurdish militants dead, Defense Minister Yasar Guler said at the time.
Tensions throughout the Middle East have escalated since the Israel-Hamas war started in October.

VOHPCDL127_THSOFMLD9I7VP7N,Should Triangle governments take a stand on Gaza? Hundreds speak out in Raleigh.,Anna Johnson,"January 17, 2024 at 9:12 PM·3 min read",20240117,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/hundreds-ask-raleigh-stand-hamas-131201957.html,"Nearly 200 people spoke to the Raleigh City Council about the war in Gaza on Tuesday night, as local groups continue putting pressure on local government leaders across the Triangle.
Most of those who spoke during the 4-hour meeting asked for a cease-fire resolution in the Israel-Hamas war. It’s the fourth time people have filled the Raleigh Municipal Building during a council meeting to speak on the issue.
On Tuesday, however, there was an increase in the number of supporters of Israel, with some holding signs that read “Lies” or “Peace when Hamas surrenders.”
Four Raleigh City Council members — Mary Black, Jane Harrison, Christina Jones and Megan Patton — all signed a letter calling on the Biden Administration and North Carolina’s congressional delegation to support a ceasefire resolution.
“I do want to validate to the audience that the reason you don’t feel heard is because council has not responded to your concerns,” Jones said at the start of the meeting. “We currently have no resolution on the table because we have only met as a group once on this topic.”
She and Black plan to circulate their thoughts on the issue to the rest of the council to gain support.
Mayor Mary-Ann Baldwin was not at the meeting because she was traveling to The U.S. Conference of Mayors winter meeting in Washington, D.C. Mayor Pro Tem Jonathan Melton presided over the meeting, repeatedly calling on people to remain quiet so all the speakers could be heard and not interrupted.
Melton called the topic “difficult” and said normally staff is able to provide direction on topics the elected officials are asked to weigh in on.
“This is not something that we’ve ever really been faced with before, this sort of global international crisis,” he said in an interview with The News & Observer. “And so at times, I feel a bit rudderless. But I want folks in Raleigh to know is that they are welcome here.
“I certainly condemn antisemitism,” he continued. “I condemn anti-Islamophobia. And, you know, sometimes international issues become local issues because members of our community are personally affected by them. And so I do hope that we can find some way to send that message that we feel the pain and we hear their concerns and that there’s going to be a way forward and some healing can begin.”
The town of Carrboro, in a split 4-3 vote, approved a cease-fire resolution in November, the first municipality in the state to take that action.
In Charlotte, a City Council meeting in December grew so contentious that the meeting had to be recessed and the public cleared from the chambers. And earlier this month the city of Greensboro approved a resolution for “peace and support” but fell short of calling for a cease-fire.
Newly elected Durham Mayor Leonardo Williams has fielded calls from residents to take a stance since early December.
Most Durham residents who have shown up to City Council meetings are in favor of a cease fire resolution, but a handful ask local leaders not to wade into international politics.
Williams, who said “the advocacy on this issue is just as loud on all sides,” said he is bringing together a small group of advisers to privately hash out a plan.
People have also asked Chapel Hill and Orange County to pass resolutions since October.

VQXWK4OG0O_KWCGXMW3CMVKFDW,Jeremy Hunt vows to clamp down on Russia sanctions evasion,Szu Ping Chan,"January 19, 2024 at 3:41 AM·2 min read",20240118,yahoo.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jeremy-hunt-vows-clamp-down-194143426.html,"Jeremy Hunt has vowed to launch a further crackdown on Russia amid fears that Vladimir Putin is using countries such as the United Arab Emirates to dodge western sanctions.
The Chancellor said the issue of the Kremlin’s sanctions evasion remained a concern at the highest level as he said world leaders were exploring ways to “toughen it up” in meetings at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Several companies based in the UAE have already been sanctioned by the US for selling aircraft parts and equipment to Russian firms.
The US Treasury took action against a UAE-based shipping company, Hennesea Holdings, on Thursday.
Hennesea was founded in 2022 and bought a fleet of 18 ships that officials claim have repeatedly docked at Russian ports.
The US government said Hennesea has been trading in Russian oil above a $60 per barrel cap imposed by G7 countries, the EU and Australia aimed at depriving Russia of income. US citizens can no longer do business with Hennesea.
Last November, the UK also sanctioned a UAE-based network responsible for channelling more than $300m (£235m) in gold revenues to Russia.
Asked if Britain and other Western countries are doing enough to stop money laundering in countries such as the UAE, Mr Hunt said: “Dealing with people who are getting round the sanctions we have against Russia is on the agenda at every finance minister’s meeting that I go to with my G7 colleagues. And it really does matter, because the longer that Russia is able to afford the war in Ukraine, the longer that war will go on.”
The UAE has also come under scrutiny over its potential ownership of the Telegraph.
Regulators are currently reviewing a planned takeover by Redbird IMI following concerns about the threat to press freedom.
Redbird IMI is a joint venture that is majority backed by Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour. Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) must report their findings to Lucy Frazer, the Culture Secretary, by Jan 26.
While Mr Hunt refused to detail any fresh sanctions against countries aiding Russia, he said: “We continue to want to tighten the sanctions regime. And we continually review where we think it’s being breached and where we can toughen it up. And this is not just a UK endeavour, it’s a joint endeavour, with the US, the French, the Germans, because we all recognise how profoundly important it is.
“And frankly, we haven’t gone as far as we need to in terms of preventing Russia from making money from a war that they themselves started.”

U.S. and British warplanes, ships and submarines launched dozens of air strikes against Houthi forces in Yemen overnight Thursday to Friday in retaliation for attacks on Red Sea shipping that the Iran-backed group says is a response to the war in Gaza.
RAF Akrotiri was used as a staging point for Typhoon fighter jets involved in the operation.
Several hundred protesters chanted ""Out with the Bases of Death"" at the entrance to RAF Akrotiri, one of two bases Britain retains in Cyprus, a former colony.
The iron gates to the heavily-guarded compound, which sits on a peninsula on Cyprus's southernmost tip, were locked with dozens of police present.
""We are here because we condemn the complicity of the UK government and using Cypriot land for their agenda to support Israel in their onslaught of Gaza,"" said Natalia Olivia of the Cyprus-based United for Palestine organisation.
Another activist, Nicos Panayiotou, called the use of the British bases a disgrace. ""They are using Cypriot land to do something every Cypriot is condemning,"" he said.
Britain is not obliged to seek permission from Cyprus for operations out of Akrotiri under the terms of the bases' presence on the island.
The strikes have added to concerns that the Israel-Gaza war could spread through the Middle East, with Iran's allies also entering the fray from Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.
Sunday's demonstration was organised before Akrotiri was used for the strikes on Yemen amid perceptions - denied by Britain - that the base is being used to offer logistical support to Israel.
In response to the protests, a British Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ""British Forces Cyprus continue to support the delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza and no RAF flights into Israel have transported any lethal cargo.""

A video shows the burned-up tank spinning out of control after being bombarded by the Bradleys.
The T-90 is Russia's most advanced battle tank.
A video shows two US-made Bradley infantry fighting vehicles taking out one of Russia's main battle tanks.
In the drone footage shared online, two of Ukraine's vehicles can be seen engaging a Russian T-90 tank in the village of Stepove, on the outskirts of Avdiivka in northeastern Ukraine.
Reports say the tank was a T-90M Proryv, the latest in the series, with the most advanced armor, mobility, and firepower.

The Russian tank fires first at the fighting vehicles, and misses.
The two Bradley fighting vehicles spray the tank with 25mm one-pound shells. The Bradleys aimed at the juncture of the hull and the turret housing the gun systems, the weakest point on any tank, said Bulgariamilitary.com.
The Bradleys, firing at close range from different directions in a combat lasting 10 minutes, eventually caused the burned-up tank's turret to spin uncontrollably and then veer into a tree.
Drones also help the vehicles on the ground by firing from above throughout the exchange.
The Bradley vehicles were likely being operated by Ukraine's 47th Brigade, as it is the only brigade fighting with the US-supplied vehicles, according to Forbes.
Russia's T-90s are the main battle tanks used by the Russian military. The three-crew vehicles typically have a 125 mm smoothbore gun and thick composite armor.
Independent analysis suggests that Russia might have lost two-thirds of the tanks it began its invasion of Ukraine with.
Bradleys are also three-crew vehicles, that can also carry an additional seven infantry, armed with a 25 mm cannon that can fire at 200 rounds per minute.
The US provided Ukraine with around 200, of which at least 31 have been lost, per Forbes.
Russian soldiers are ""afraid"" of facing against Bradleys, a Ukrainian commander said, Newsweek reported.
The Ukrainian soldier, who goes by his call sign of ""Kach,"" said that Russian troops in tanks and troop carriers fear going into battle against the tracked armored fighting vehicles.
The Bradley is fast and ""very maneuverable"" and protects soldiers with its heavy armor, Kach told Newsweek. The Ukrainian commander also praised its ""powerful machine gun.""
Avdiivka has become a flash point of fighting in Ukraine, as Russian forces have been trying to capture the city in Donetsk in large numbers.
Russia has reportedly lost scores of tanks and armored vehicles in its attempted assaults on Avdiivka.

VTYOBMILHA_RU75P6MXUCNO831,Israel reaches deal with Qatar to provide medicine to Hamas hostages in war-torn Gaza,Lauren Irwin,"January 14, 2024 at 12:58 AM·2 min read",20240115,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/news/israel-reaches-deal-qatar-medicine-165838462.html,"Israel officials said Friday that they’ve reached a deal with Qatar negotiators to move medicine into Gaza for hostages held by militant group Hamas amid the ongoing war in the region, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office.
The remaining hostages could receive the medicine in the next few days, Reuters reported.
More than 240 hostages were captured by Hamas when it launched a surprise attack that killed 1,200 people on Oct. 7. In the more than three months since, Israel has launched a counteroffensive that has killed more than 23,000 Palestinians in Gaza, and has vowed to continue fighting until all of the hostages are returned.
Qatar and the United States helped Israel broker a deal in November for a temporary cease-fire in exchange for returning some hostages. Hamas freed almost half of the hostages in return for the release of many Palestinian detainees that were held in Israel and shipments of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.
Released hostages have described torture, sexual assault and the lack of necessary medicine for many people, as a large amount of hostages taken were elderly or have chronic illnesses, Reuters reported.
Families of the hostages have asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to deliver medicine and inspect the condition of the hostages, which the organization said Hamas blocked access, per the news wire.
The Hostages and Missing Families Forum also said it would demand visual proof that the medications reached the hostages. In a statement, the group warned that all of the hostages face mortal danger and need life-saving medicine and many require extensive medical treatment.
The United States State Department announced this week that after a trip to the Middle East, Secretary Antony Blinken was able to agree with many Arab countries to focus on short-term and long-term solutions for the reconstruction and future governance in Gaza — if Israel is able to agree as well.
The countries are continuing diplomatic relations as tensions in the region have spiked surrounding the war.
U.S. officials have urged Israel to dial back its attacks and operate in a more precise manner.

The changes apply to services including Azure, Microsoft 365, Power Platform, and Dynamics 365, the Seattle-based tech company said.
Cloud computing companies have been moving to localize data storage and processing amid tightening requirements in the 27-nation European Union, which has strict data privacy laws.
Brussels and Washington have spent years wrangling over the safety of EU citizens’ data that tech companies store in the U.S. following revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that the American government eavesdropped on people’s online data and communications.
Microsoft said its “EU Data Boundary solution goes beyond European compliance requirements."" The company has previously pledged that customers wouldn't have their data moved outside the EU.
Last year, it started storing and processing some data inside Europe. Now it's expanding that to all personal data, including pseudonymized data found in automated system logs, which are generated automatically when online services run.
Later this year, Microsoft will start making sure technical support data is kept within Europe. It also plans a paid option for initial tech support response from within the EU.
Amazon last year rolled out independent cloud infrastructure for the EU as it looked to address strict regulations that companies and public sector organizations face.

W5DJT0V2KE_K16TJ69QXPZU5PG,Federal Lawsuit Would Significantly Reduce Wolf Trapping Seasons in Idaho,Travis Hall,"January 11, 2024 at 3:54 AM·3 min read",20240110,yahoo.com,https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/federal-lawsuit-significantly-reduce-wolf-195424819.html,"On January 5, a group of 13 wildlife-advocacy groups asked a federal judge in Idaho to put an end to wolf trapping in the Gem State during the time of year when grizzly bears are not in their dens hibernating. The groups, which include Earth Justice, the Center for Biological Diversity, the Humane Society of the United States, and the Sierra Club, say wolf traps cause ""indiscriminate harm"" to the federally-protected bears. But the state of Idaho argues that licensed trappers who adhere to rules and regulations aren't posing a threat to the state's grizzlies.
The groups' lawsuit states that since the ESA-delisting of gray wolves in 2011, ""trapping and snaring has resulted in wolf trappers in Idaho capturing threatened grizzly bears and lynx in wolf traps and snares."" It goes on to argue that the court should deem the state of Idaho in violation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and force the Idaho Department of Fish & Game (IDFG) to bring its wolf trapping regulations ""into compliance with the ESA.""
Arguing on behalf of the state, Deputy Attorney General Kathleen Trever said that while two grizzlies were caught in traps in Idaho's northern panhandle in 2020, those trappers weren't following the state's rules. If legally-set traps were posing a threat to grizzlies or other protected species, the IDFG would be capable of making its own adjustments to its trapping rules. ""If something did happen, which we have not seen, the state has a long history of adapting,"" she recently told the Capitol Press, ""whether to refine its seasons or make additional adjustments or requirements.""
Both the IDFG and the Idaho Trappers Association declined to comment when contacted by Field & Stream, citing the pending litigation. The IDFG does have an official policy of working with hunters and trappers to reduce wolf populations in hopes of mitigating livestock depredation and reducing predation pressure on the state's elk herds. The state's wolf hunting and trapping seasons currently run year round with no bag limits.

The IDFG said that at last count there were approximately 1,100 wolves in the state. Those estimates were based on camera trap surveys conducted statewide throughout 2022. That recent estimate was said to be down by 13 percent, or roughly 200 wolves, since the state expanded its wolf hunting and trapping seasons in early 2021.
“We are encouraged by efforts that have resulted in a drop in wolf numbers, and this aligns with our long-term goal to reduce Idaho’s wolf population,"" said former IDFG Director Ed Scrivner at the time of the most recent population estimate. ""We’d like to see it fluctuate around 500, which is outlined in our draft wolf management plan and aligns with the federal rule that delisted wolves.” Scrivner has since been replaced by acting director Jim Fredricks."

Iran late on Monday struck Erbil, the capital of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, with ballistic missiles in what it said was an attack on an Israeli spy headquarters, claims vehemently denied by Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish officials.
The attack killed at least four people, including a prominent Kurdish businessman and his infant child.
The Iranian strikes have led to a rare diplomatic row with Iraq's government, with Baghdad filing a complaint against Iranian ""aggression"" at the United Nations Security Council and recalling its ambassador to Tehran.
Tehran has grown its influence in Iraq since the U.S. toppled former ruler Saddam Hussein in a U.S.-led invasion in 2003, particularly among Shi'ite Muslim factions, while the Kurds have traditionally been closer to the West.
Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, a Shi'ite, was brought to power with the backing of some pro-Iranian factions, but has been keen to show his government opposes any infringement on Iraq's sovereignty.

Hundreds of protestors had attended a planned march to oppose Israel’s inclusion at the Vicenzaoro fair, one of the biggest industry events in the gold and jewellery world.
Footage of the unrest shows protestors firing smoke bombs and flares as the two groups police rammed against each other.
Lines of officers wearing blue hard hats and carrying shields appeared to be trying to push the group back.Some protestors could be seen holding up banners saying “free Palestine” and “stop bombing Gaza.”
Sirens could also be heard as a water cannon was fired at the crowd, with demonstrators attempting to take cover from the blast behind their signs.
In other clips, police officers could be seen dragging a protester away and hitting him with a baton.
More than 1,300 exhibitors from almost 40 countries are showing at the Vicenzaoro fair, which opened on Friday and runs until Tuesday.
This year, Israel had been given its own pavilion at the fair, according to Press TV.
A Vicenzaoro spokesman said the clashes took place several miles away and had no impact on the event, while declining to give information on the Israeli presence at the fair.
Giacomo Possamai, the mayor of north-east Italian city, said there was “no justification” for the violence.
“It also hurts the causes that it claims to support - it is a contradiction in terms to demonstrate for peace and a ceasefire through violence,” he said on social media.
Earlier Germano Raniero, a member of the Boycott Israel Group, told PressTV that Israel’s “diamonds are drenched in blood”.
Khaled Al Zeer, who is part of the region’s Palestinian community, said he is “against having Israel at the Vicenzaoro fair”.
‘‘It’s immoral for everybody and mostly for our city doing business with a country that is standing before the International Court of Justice is dishonorable, a country that is committing genocide now as we speak.”
Hamas launched an attack on Israel on October 7, resulting in the death of about 1,140 people, mostly civilians.
Militants also seized about 250 hostages, around 132 of whom Israel says remain in Gaza. At least 27 captives are believed to have been killed.
Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has been conducting a relentless air and ground offensive in Gaza that has killed at least 24,927 Palestinians, around 70 percent of them women, children and adolescents, according to the health ministry in Hamas-run territory.

Details: The Russians are reportedly checking whether people have a Ukrainian passport, are registered, and examining whether they possess smartphones or any other devices that could transmit information to the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
In this way, the Russians are attempting to identify any operational information about the activities of the resistance movement against them, whose actions often lead to local setbacks for the Russian occupation forces, both on the front lines and in the occupied territories.

WN5LB3NDUN_F05SO0RMREBPYLZ,US plans to send an unofficial delegation to Taiwan to meet its new leader amid tensions with China,DIDI TANG,"Updated January 11, 2024 at 7:33 PM·3 min read",20240111,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-plans-unofficial-delegation-taiwan-024242253.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration will send an unofficial delegation comprised of former senior officials to Taiwan shortly after the self-governed island holds an election for a new president this weekend, a move that could upset Beijing in an already-fragile bilateral relationship.
A senior administration official confirmed the plan on Wednesday without offering more details, but said such a face-to-face meeting was the “most effective way” to engage the new Taiwanese government and convey U.S. policy in the region.
The official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive plans, said the administration believed the move would contribute to peace and stability in the region.
Beijing, which claims that Taiwan is part of China and vows to unify with it eventually, said Thursday that it firmly opposes any official exchange between the U.S. and Taiwan. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning didn't say whether China regards the planned delegation as a form of “official exchange.”
In August 2022, Beijing reacted angrily by firing missiles and blockading the island after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping, at his most recent meeting with President Joe Biden in November, called Taiwan the “most sensitive issue” in U.S.-Chinese relations.
Washington has a security pact with Taiwan to provide it with sufficient hardware and technology to deter any armed attack from the mainland. The U.S. has stepped up support for Taiwan and its democratically elected government in recent years as Beijing ratchets up military and diplomatic pressure on the island.
The U.S. government officially takes no side on the island’s statehood but insists the differences must be resolved peacefully. Biden told Xi in November that the U.S. government opposes any unilateral change to the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.
The Biden administration has endorsed no political party or candidate in Taiwan's upcoming presidential election. Beijing, for its part, has made it clear that it does not want a victory by Lai Ching-te, also known as William Lai, the candidate from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party known for its pro-independence leaning.
Lai is considered the front-runner in the race, but Hou Yu-ih from the opposition Kuomintang party trails closely. Kuomintang opposes independence, but it does not support unification with the mainland, either.
Beijing has labeled Lai as a “Taiwan independence element,"" and Chinese officials have suggested to Taiwan voters that they could be choosing between war and peace, for Beijing has vowed to annex the island forcibly should it declare independence. Lai, however, is unlikely to take such a drastic step.
Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Thursday on X, formerly Twitter, that the “upcoming elections are in the international spotlight” and that China’s “repeated interference steals the focus.” He added that Beijing “should stop messing with other countries’ elections & hold their own. Let the #Chinese people freely choose their leaders.”
The U.S. official acknowledged a period of higher tensions lies ahead with Taiwan's presidential election but said there have been “contingency conversations"" in the U.S. government for dealing with them. The official added that the White House also is engaging with Beijing on Taiwan to manage “difficult situations” and avoid unintended conflict.
The U.S. official also said the Biden administration opposes any outside interference in Taiwan's election and that the administration has repeatedly raised the concern with Chinese officials.
Mao, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, responded by framing Taiwan's election as a local Chinese affair in which foreign actors should not interfere. “We strongly oppose and deplore the U.S. making irresponsible remarks on the Taiwan region’s elections,” she said."

(Reuters) -Contenders for the Republican presidential nomination will face off in the second contest of their nominating process on Tuesday in New Hampshire, while Democrats compete there on the same day in a battle expected to be significantly less competitive.
The New Hampshire primary comes eight days after Iowa's Republican caucuses, which former President Donald Trump dominated. His competitors will be eager to prove their candidacies are still viable despite Trump's nearly 30-percentage point victory in the Republicans' first nominating state.
Here are some key facts about the primary:
WHEN IS IT AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
The New Hampshire primary will take place on Tuesday with the precise hours dependent on the voting location. Unlike in Iowa and some other states, which rely on a relatively complicated ""caucus"" system, voters in New Hampshire cast their ballots much as they would during any other vote.
On the Republican side, 22 delegates to the Republican National Convention are up for grabs and will be awarded on a proportional basis. While that is a tiny portion of the 1,215 delegates needed to clinch the nomination, the state has traditionally played an outsized role in the nominating process because of its early spot on the calendar.
For Democrats, 33 delegates will be sent to the Democratic National Convention from New Hampshire, but their vote won't be bound by the primary results after a dispute over the timing of the vote. That means the New Hampshire primary will serve purely as a barometer of support for the Democrats in the race.
The national Democratic Party moved its first 2024 contest to South Carolina, which is significantly more diverse than New Hampshire's nearly 90% white population, to better reflect the party. But New Hampshire state law requires it to host the first primary, and the Republican-controlled state government declined to make any legislative change to its primary date.
WHO WILL BE ON THE BALLOT?
Trump, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis are all on the ballot in New Hampshire. DeSantis and Haley placed second and third in Iowa, respectively.
DeSantis, facing exceptionally tough odds in New Hampshire, has opted to spend much of the the lead-up to the state's primary in South Carolina, where the next major Republican nominating contest takes place on Feb. 24. Haley is a former South Carolina governor.
The main Democratic candidates on the ballot are U.S. Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota and self-help guru Marianne Williamson. Democratic President Joe Biden is running for reelection but will not be on the ballot because of the primary date dispute. Some of his supporters, however, have launched a write-in campaign on Biden's behalf.
WHO IS WINNING IN THE POLLS?
According to polling and analysis website 538, Trump leads the Republican field in New Hampshire with 47% of likely primary voters planning to cast a ballot for the former president. Haley is in second with nearly 34% support, and DeSantis trails in third place with about 5% support.
The Northeastern state is well-known for its relatively moderate, libertarian-minded brand of Republicanism. Moreover, the primary in New Hampshire is ""semi-open,"" meaning voters who are not registered with any party can participate, which can help candidates perceived to be centrists.
Biden is winning handily among Democrats, though the polling has been extremely inconsistent, with support for Phillips, his closest competitor, landing anywhere between the mid-single-digits and the upper 20s depending on the pollster. The fact that Biden supporters will need to write his name on the ballot adds another element of uncertainty.
WHY IS THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY IMPORTANT?
On the Republican side, most political analysts agree that New Hampshire presents Trump's competitors with their best opportunity to notch a victory - or at least a close second. This is particularly true of Haley, who has gained significant momentum in the state in recent months.
If Haley fails to mount a spirited challenge to Trump, the former president could emerge as the presumptive Republican nominee to take on Biden in the November general election. If Haley does well, she will likely retain enough donors and interested voters to present a credible challenge in the subsequent weeks.
Even if Trump loses, his competitors face an uphill battle. The former president leads by roughly 30 percentage points in South Carolina. Nationally, Trump holds a 37-point lead, according to the most recent Reuters/Ipsos poll.
New Hampshire represents an opportunity for Biden's Democratic challengers to prove there is appetite among voters to replace the party's incumbent. Biden has dedicated most of his energy to South Carolina, which is home to his party's first fully sanctioned contest and where support from the state's Democrats helped him secure the 2020 nomination.

BEIJING (Reuters) -A reporter from Xinhua landed in Nauru on Wednesday, the first from China's official news agency to step foot on the remote Pacific Islands nation after it ditched Taiwan for China, as Chinese state media raced to build up its local presence.
On the tiny island nation, which has a land area of just 21.1 sq km (8.1 sq miles), China's state television CCTV has moved even more quickly, filing its first report from Nauru on the same day when Nauru said it would no longer recognise Taiwan as a country and instead would re-establish ties with China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory.
With the Nauru presidential office in the background, a CCTV reporter on Monday said Nauru had severed its ""so-called diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan and recognised the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government representing the whole of China.
The CCTV reporter was in Nauru even before the island nation switched its ties back to China from Taiwan. Nauru briefly recognised China in the 2000s.
According to state-owned Beijing Daily, the CCTV reporter arrived in Nauru in May 2023 as the Communist Party representative of a Chinese harbour engineering company working on a local project.
The race to plant a Chinese media presence in the island nation of just around 12,000 people precedes even any official announcement on the arrival of Chinese diplomats in Nauru.
Xinhua, in a report filed from the Nauru capital Yaren on Wednesday, said it had hired a correspondent and set up a reporting office in Nauru on the same day when diplomatic ties changed.
Taiwan said the news of Nauru's diplomatic change of heart had come ""suddenly"" and China specifically chose the timing after the Taiwanese presidential election to target Nauru just as countries were offering congratulations to Taiwan on the smooth voting process on Saturday.
Since the break in ties, Taiwanese media have run stories about Nauru's health problems, particularly the high obesity figures, and its role in housing refugees for Australia.
Taiwan's internet users have also left angry messages on the Nauru government's Facebook page denouncing the decision, prompting the Nauru government to post that ""This page invites educated, informed and constructive criticism. It does not condone abuse and profanity"".
Nauru's government has since restricted comments on its official Facebook page, and warned that online abuse could attract criminal sanctions, after a wave of derogatory comments were posted in the wake of the announcement.
In Beijing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the resumption of ties would ""bring unprecedented development opportunities to Nauru"".

AMMAN (Reuters) -Jordan said on Friday Israeli ""war crimes"" against Palestinians were to blame for heightened regional tension and violence in the Red Sea which it said threatened to ignite a wider war in the Middle East.
Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi also voiced support for South Africa's ""genocide"" case against Israel at the U.N.'s top court over the war against Hamas in Gaza, and said Amman was ready to submit legal documents and appear in court if the case proceeds.
Israel has denied allegations that it has committed war crimes, and rejected as ""grossly distorted"" the accusations brought by South Africa that the military operation in Gaza is a state-led genocide campaign against the Palestinian population.
In comments after the U.S. and Britain launched strikes on Houthi military targets in Yemen in response to the movement's attacks on ships in the Red Sea, Safadi said the international community had failed to act to stop Israeli ""aggression"" against Palestinians which was endangering regional security.
""The Israeli aggression on Gaza and its continued committing of war crimes against the Palestinian people and violating international law with impunity are responsible for the rising tensions witnessed in the region,"" Safadi said in remarks carried by state media.
The stability of the region and its security were closely tied, Safadi said.
""The international community is at a humanitarian, moral, legal and security crossroads,"" he said.
""Either it shoulders its responsibilities and ends Israel's arrogant aggression and protect civilians, or allows Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his extremist ministers to drag us to a regional war that threatens world peace.""
Safadi said Israel was pushing the region towards more conflict ""by continuing its aggression and its attempt to open new fronts,"" and that Israeli military actions against civilians in Gaza met the legal definition of genocide.
""Jordan supports South Africa in its case against Israel,"" he said. ""We will submit legal documentation and appear at the court when or if the case is accepted.""

Girkin, who also goes by the pseudonym ""Strelkov"", was instrumental in fomenting the conflict between Kremlin-backed militias and Kyiv's armed forces in eastern Ukraine in 2014.
But the hardline nationalist was arrested after months of public attacks on Russia's military leaders and Putin, as he called for a much more aggressive offensive against Ukraine.
""The prosecutor requested four years and 11 months in a general regime prison colony for Igor Strelkov,"" his allies said on social media.
""This is one month less than the maximum possible punishment under the article he is charged with,"" they added after the behind-closed-doors hearing.
In some of his final social media posts before being arrested, Girkin had called Putin an ""old idiot"", adding that ""the country will not survive another six years of this cowardly mediocrity in power"".
For months the authorities tolerated his sharp criticism, posted daily on social media in hours-long video blogs, even as the Kremlin's liberal opponents were handed severe jail terms for opposing the campaign in Ukraine.
- Rebel turned blogger -
But the mood in Moscow changed after Wagner commander Yevgeny Prigozhin and hundreds of his troops launched an abortive mutiny last June to oust Russia's military leadership.
Girkin's arrest was a high-profile demonstration that Russia was reining in the nationalist critics.
Behind bars in pre-trial detention, he mounted a doomed campaign to run against Vladimir Putin in March's presidential elections, doubling down on his anti-Kremlin position.
In an interview with Russian media from jail he said the country had ""entered a period of acute instability"" and faced an ""imminent catastrophe"".
Girkin, 53, was a key figure behind Moscow's initial military foray into Ukraine in 2014.
Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula that year following a pro-European revolution in Kyiv that toppled the country's Moscow-friendly president.
Girkin, a former FSB officer, formed and commanded Moscow-backed forces in the eastern Donbas region.
He marshalled troops out of a base in the captured city of Sloviansk, where he reportedly ordered executions for minor crimes such as petty theft.
- Role in MH17 downing -
A court in the Netherlands last year sentenced him to life imprisonment in absentia for the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines plane MH17 over eastern Ukraine in July 2014.
All 298 people on board were killed when a missile fired from rebel-held territory hit the jet. The Kremlin has always denied its involvement and refused to extradite Girkin to the Netherlands.
""In the West, I have already been recognised as a terrorist... and in my homeland, I have the dubious notoriety as an extremist,"" he said after his arrest.
He left eastern Ukraine shortly after MH17 was downed, becoming a ultra-nationalist blogger and backer of the hardline ""Novorossiya"" ideology that calls for Russia to subsume vast swathes of Ukraine.
When Russia sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, 2022 he said the entire country needed to be captured in a ""swift and decisive victory"".
But within days he had become disillusioned with what he called Russia's ""major mistakes"" and turned into a persistent critic of how Moscow was prosecuting the offensive.
He wanted Russia's entire political system to be put on a hardened military footing and for significantly more men and resources to be thrown at the campaign.
Girkin's lawyer told Russia's state-run RIA Novosti agency that the court would issue its verdict on January 25.

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) is requesting a transcribed interview with a former Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) official for allegedly flagging consumer transactions that had the phrases “TRUMP” or “MAGA” in them.
On behalf of the Judiciary Committee’s Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, Jordan sent a letter requesting testimony to Noah Bishoff, the former director of an office in the Strategic Operations Division of FinCEN, which is part of the Treasury Department.
Jordan said the committee had obtained documents showing that FinCEN outlined “typologies” of persons of interest in materials distributed to financial institutions. He said these materials included “suggested search terms and Merchant Category Codes (MCCs) for identifying transactions on behalf of federal law enforcement” after Jan. 6, 2021.
“These materials included a document recommending the use of generic terms like ‘TRUMP’ and ‘MAGA’ to ‘search Zelle payment messages’ as well as a ‘prior FinCEN analysis’ of ‘Lone Actor/Homegrown Violent Extremism Indicators,” the letter states.
Jordan said FinCEN warned financial institutions of “extremism indicators,” such as transportation charges “for travel to areas with no apparent purchase” or “subscriptions to other media containing extremist views.”
“In other words, FinCEN urged large financial institutions to comb through the private transactions of their customers for suspicious charges on the basis of protected political and religious expression,” he said in the letter.

The Treasury Department declined to comment on the letter. FinCEN’s mission is “to safeguard the financial system from illicit use, combat money laundering and its related crimes including terrorism,” according to its website.
Jordan also said FinCEN distributed slides that showed financial institutions how to flag customers who may be potential active shooters or terrorists based on their transactions. He contends that those who may have purchased a firearm, made a purchase at Cabela’s or Dick’s Sporting Goods and other businesses may have had their transactions flagged.
“Despite these transactions having no apparent criminal nexus — and, in fact, relate to Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights — FinCEN seems to have adopted a characterization of these Americans as potential threat actors,” Jordan wrote.
“This kind of pervasive financial surveillance, carried out in coordination with and at the request of federal law enforcement, into Americans’ private transactions is alarming and raises serious doubts about FinCEN’s respect for fundamental civil liberties,” he added.
Jordan is asking Bishoff to contact the committee staff to schedule a transcribed interview with the committee no later than Jan. 31.

Pretoria has lodged an urgent appeal at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to force Israel to ""immediately suspend"" its military operations in Gaza.
Israel has dismissed the case as ""atrocious"" and ""preposterous"" and vowed to set out a robust defence on Friday.
""No armed attack on a state territory, no matter how serious... can provide justification for or defend breaches of the convention,"" said Pretoria's Justice Minister Ronald Lamola.
""Israel's response to the October 7 attack has crossed this line and given rise to the breaches of the convention,"" he added.
The Gaza war erupted when Hamas launched its unprecedented attack, which resulted in about 1,140 people killed in Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Israel has responded with a relentless military campaign that has killed at least 23,469 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.
A world away from the death and destruction in Gaza and Israel, robed lawyers battled it out over technical legal arguments in the Peace Palace in The Hague.
South Africa argues Israel is breaking its commitments under the UN Genocide Convention, a treaty signed in 1948 in the wake of the Holocaust.
Top lawyer for South Africa Adila Hassim said Israel's bombing campaign aimed at the ""destruction of Palestinian life"" and had pushed Palestinians ""to the brink of famine"".
""Genocides are never declared in advance, but this court has the benefit of the past 13 weeks of evidence that shows incontrovertibly a pattern of conduct and related intention that justifies a plausible claim of genocidal acts,"" she said.
As a fellow signatory to the treaty, South Africa can take Israel to the ICJ, which rules on disputes between countries and is often described as the ""World Court"".
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) has long been a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause, often linking it to its own historic struggle against the white-minority government, which had cooperative relations with Israel.
South Africa has acknowledged the ""particular weight of responsibility"" of accusing Israel of genocide. It ""unequivocally"" condemned the Hamas attacks that sparked off the war in Gaza.
Describing South Africa as the ""legal arm"" of Hamas, Israel's foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat said Pretoria's case was ""one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history.""
- 'Atrocious and preposterous'
Israel President Isaac Herzog has already hinted at his country's likely defence against what he called an ""atrocious and preposterous... claim"".
""We will present proudly our case of using self defence... under international humanitarian law,"" he said.
Herzog said the Israeli army was ""doing its utmost under extremely complicated circumstances on the ground to make sure that there will be no unintended consequences and no civilian casualties"".
The United States is backing its ally Israel, with the State Department describing the charges as ""unfounded"".
As it is an urgent procedure, the ICJ could rule in a matter of weeks.
Its rulings are final and cannot be appealed. However, countries do not always follow the court's verdicts -- the ICJ has ordered Russia to stop its invasion of Ukraine, for example.
But a court ruling against Israel would certainly increase political pressure on the country, with many speculating it could serve as a pretext for sanctions.
Cecily Rose, assistant professor of public international law at Leiden University, noted the court did not have to rule on the fundamentals of the case at this stage -- that issue will likely take years.
""Instead, the court would only be evaluating whether there is a risk of irreparable prejudice to rights held under the Genocide Convention, in particular the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts that threaten their existence as a group,"" Rose told AFP.
Dutch police kept rival demonstrations apart in The Hague. Hundreds of pro-Israeli protesters waving flags marched through the streets while a smaller group of pro-Palestinian supporters brandished placards saying: ""End Israel apartheid.""
Pro-Israeli protester Ada Deyl, an 80-year-old pensioner, said: ""I think it's a shame that Israel -- who is doing all the right things and is attacked by Hamas -- is now facing a lawsuit.""
On the other side, Zohar Janovitch, 40, alleged that Israeli leaders had ""explicitly expressed their disregard for the lives of Palestinian civilians.""

XMKIPK7UI6_CA0HQFLNZA13IMZ,Alec Baldwin again charged with manslaughter in 'Rust' movie-set shooting,Andrew Hay and Steve Gorman,"Updated January 19, 2024 at 6:01 PM·4 min read",20240119,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/alec-baldwin-again-charged-manslaughter-194121455.html,"By Andrew Hay and Steve Gorman
ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (Reuters) -Alec Baldwin on Friday was charged again with involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on the set of the film ""Rust,"" reinstating a criminal case against the actor months after previous charges were dropped.
Friday's indictment by a New Mexico grand jury followed an independent forensic test concluding that Baldwin, 65, would have had to pull the trigger of a revolver he was using in a rehearsal for it to fire the live round that struck Hutchins in the chest and killed her.
The finding was the same as a previous FBI test on the firearm.
Baldwin's attorneys, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, issued a statement on Friday on behalf of their client saying, ""We look forward to our day in court.""
When prosecutors announced their intention in October to bring the case to a grand jury, the defense lawyers called the situation a ""terrible tragedy"" that ""has been turned into this misguided prosecution.""
Baldwin, the Emmy-winning performer who starred in the hit NBC television comedy ""30 Rock,"" has denied pulling the trigger and said he was not responsible for Hutchins' death in the Oct. 21, 2021, shooting.
The movie's director, Joel Souza, was struck and wounded in the shoulder by the same bullet that killed Hutchins during production of the film on a set outside Santa Fe, the state capital.
According to a police report, David Halls, the assistant director who handed the gun to Baldwin, told the actor the weapon was ""cold,"" an industry term meaning it did not contain live ammunition or even blank rounds. Halls told police he was unaware the gun was loaded.
Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey had said she would seek new charges against Baldwin if the independent test showed the reproduction long Colt .45 revolver was in ""working condition.""
Prosecutors previously dismissed charges against Baldwin based on evidence the hammer of the revolver might been modified, allowing it to fire without the trigger being pulled.
TWO CRIMINAL THEORIES
The single-page indictment filed with the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe charges Baldwin with involuntary manslaughter under two alternative legal definitions - causing a death by ""negligent use of a firearm"" and by acting ""without due caution or circumspection.""
Should the case go to trial, it would be up to a jury to decide whether either theory was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Involuntary manslaughter is classified in New Mexico as a fourth-degree felony punishable by up to 18 months in prison.
Baldwin was similarly charged with involuntary manslaughter in January via a criminal complaint filed by prosecutors. Those charges were dismissed in April.
A grand jury indictment allows prosecutors to avoid the additional legal step of convincing a judge during an evidentiary hearing that there is probable cause to proceed to trial.
No arraignment was immediately scheduled in the renewed case. Baldwin could choose to enter a not guilty plea without appearing for an arraignment.
The movie's chief armorer, Hannah Gutierrez, who handled the gun before Halls, was also charged with involuntary manslaughter. She faces a 2024 trial. Halls signed a plea agreement for the charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon.
Among witnesses who testified before the grand jury were Alexandra Hancock, lead detective on the case for the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, and Lane Luper, a cameraman who walked off the ""Rust"" set shortly before the shooting over complaints about working conditions and safety.
""Our clients have always sought the truth about what happened on the day that Halyna Hutchins was tragically shot and killed,"" attorney Gloria Allred, who is representing Hutchins' parents, Olga Solovey and Anatolii Androsovych, said in a statement on Friday.
""They continue to seek the truth in our civil lawsuit for them, and they also would like there to be accountability in the criminal justice system,"" Allred added.
Baldwin and other ""Rust"" producers reached a settlement in October 2022 of wrongful death claims brought by Hutchins' family. Production of the film resumed last April in Montana. No release date for the film has been set.

Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was handed a 2.5-year sentence on Tuesday which was commuted to a fine of 27,300 Turkish Liras ($910 USD) after he accepted the charge of “reckless killing” for fatally striking Yunus Emre Gocer, a married father of two, in late November, according to Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber.
The case initially sparked controversy in Turkey after Mohamud left the country following the deadly incident, prompting criticism of perceived inaction by police and prosecutors. An arrest warrant for Mohamud was dropped when he returned to Turkey in order to give a statement in court on Friday, according to TRT.
Mohamud was not required to be in court on Tuesday when the verdict in the case was read. He was originally handed a 3-year prison sentence, which was decreased to 2.5 years for “good conduct,” according to TRT. According to Turkish penal code, the court can opt to convert a sentence of that length to a fine, which it did, sparing Mohamud any prison time. His driver’s license will also be cancelled for six months, according to TRT.
Iyaz Cimen, the lawyer representing Gocer’s family, told CNN that his clients had agreed to drop their formal complaint against Mohamud. He would not say what, if any, deal with Mohamud prompted that decision, or whether the family would be financially compensated.
Mohamud’s case is one of two incidents involving the sons of prominent foreign officials that have raised questions about fairness in the justice system. In December, there was a second collision allegedly involving the son of a former Yemeni defense minister, who police say hit two pedestrians. One of the victims was seriously injured.
The two cases have no direct connection to one another, beyond the coincidental timing, and the harsh public spotlight cast on both – especially after early missteps and discrepancies by police and prosecutors in the first.
According to Turkish police, 40-year-old Mohamud, the son of Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, was behind the wheel of a black BMW with diplomatic plates in southwest Istanbul when it struck Gocer, a delivery driver on a scooter, on November 30.
According to a statement from the prosecutor, Gocer died on December 6 and “therefore the nature of the crime changed” from the charge of “reckless injury” to “reckless killing.” Two days later, an arrest warrant was issued.
Cimen, the lawyer representing Gocer’s family, told CNN in December that Mohamud had left the country on December 2, before the warrant was issued.
Cimen had previously told CNN that the initial police report suggested the victim had made an illegal lane change, but only after public scrutiny, and after the victim died and the charge became more serious, did a subsequent report cast doubt on the initial police assessment of what happened. That second report, written by independent experts, says that the “primarily negligent party” was Mohamud.
A third report, meant to resolve discrepancies between the initial police report and the subsequent expert report, produced a more mixed result. Published December 18 by the Traffic Specialization Department of the Forensic Medicine Institute, it affirmed that Mohamud was “primarily at fault,” but also found that Gocer was also “secondarily at fault.” The report says that Gocer was in front of Mohamud in the second-to-right lane, while Mohamud was behind in the right lane.
Gocer slowed to change lanes to the right, and that’s when he was hit. It blames Mohamud for failing to hit the brakes and slow down, but it also blames Gocer for failing to adequately check his mirrors to see Mohamud behind him and slowing to a stop on a road with a speed limit of 80 kilometers (50 miles) per hour.
The perceived initial failings quickly led to public outrage, with motorcycle drivers and couriers staging a protest in December calling for justice for Gocer.
Istanbul’s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, said in December that he was glad the prosecutor’s office had issued the arrest warrant. The mayor had written on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the prosecutor’s office would need to explain discrepancies between the initial police report and the latest statement “which allowed the suspect to flee abroad.”
CNN reached out to the Somali consulate for comment in December but did not receive a response. In an interview with the Associated Press published December 14, the Somali president denied that his son had fled the country, saying that he left because he had business elsewhere and there was no arrest warrant for him. President Mohamud told the AP he was sorry for Gocer’s family for his loss, and said that he has advised his son to go back to Turkey for court proceedings. “The decision is his — but I am giving that advice,” he said.
At the time, Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported that Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc told reporters in Ankara he had personally spoken with the Somali justice minister.
“In the coming days, the defendant will come to Turkey and participate in the trial process,” he said, according to Anadolu. “”We will never allow any of our citizens to lose their rights and legal interests in favor of a foreigner. We will follow the incident to the end. We will work for justice to prevail.”
In the second, separate incident in early December in central Istanbul, Musaeed Ahmed Musaeed Hussein, the son of Yemen’s former Defense Minister Ahmed Musaeed Hussein, was behind the wheel of a vehicle that hit two people as they were crossing the street, according to the statement Hussein gave to prosecutors.One of them was a 71-year-old named Pakize Ozer, who was seriously injured, according to CNN Turk. “The complainant suddenly appeared in front of me. Since the sun was coming from the opposite direction, I didn’t see exactly where she was coming from,” he said in his statement to prosecutors. In that report he said that Ozer was not in a pedestrian crosswalk and he denied that he was at fault.
Hussein’s father was in the passenger seat at the time. CNN Turk reported in December that Ozer was in hospital in life-threatening condition, but Hussein’s lawyer, Kerim Bahadır Seker, now says that she has since left hospital. He says his client is currently under house arrest and a travel ban prevents him from leaving the country.
Last month, he told CNN Turk that his client was not speeding or under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of the collision.
Grainy videos purportedly showing security camera footage of each crash have been widely broadcast on Turkish media, which has heavily covered both incidents.

XQAFN7BDCE_57MCHLDDUN3CR61,Queen breaks silence on King’s health as William visits Kate in hospital after abdominal surgery,Joe Middleton,"January 18, 2024 at 10:21 AM·3 min read",20240118,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/queen-gives-health-king-william-131011314.html,"Queen Camilla has said that the King is “fine” as he awaits treatment for an enlarged prostate, as the Prince of Wales visited his wife, the Princess of Wales, in hospital while she recuperates from abdominal surgery.
Charles is set to be admitted to hospital next week for a corrective procedure after being diagnosed with a benign enlarged prostate, prompting concern about the monarch’s health.
Camilla, who was visiting the Aberdeen Art Gallery, was asked about Charles by the Lord Provost on Thursday afternoon.
Camilla said: “He’s fine, thank you very much. Looking forward to getting back to work.”
Meanwhile, Prince William was pictured driving himself to The London Clinic, where Kate is recovering following surgery. The couple’s three young children were not with their father.
Buckingham Palace, in an unprecedented double royal health scare, announced the news of the King’s medical issue just an hour and a half after Kensington Palace revealed Kate’s operation on Wednesday afternoon.
The 75-year-old monarch, who acceded to the throne 16 months ago, was said to be keen to go public with his condition to encourage other men who may be experiencing symptoms to get checked.
The King is staying at Birkhall in Aberdeenshire with the Queen but the palace has not confirmed whether he will be treated in London or Scotland next week.
Charles had a series of meetings and events planned at Dumfries House in East Ayrshire on Thursday and Friday, which have been postponed on his doctor’s advice.
William was seen leaving the private London Clinic at around 12.35pm on Thursday after visiting Kate. Sources say that Kate is “doing well” but will spend up to three months recovering.
The princess was admitted on Tuesday for the successful, planned procedure but is expected to stay in hospital for 10 to 14 days before returning to her Adelaide Cottage home in Windsor.
The nature of the princess’s condition has not been revealed, although Kensington Palace confirmed it was not cancerous.
It is serious enough, however, for heir to the throne to be postponing official duties while his wife is in hospital and in the immediate aftermath while she recuperates.
The princess is not expected to return to public duties until after Easter but this will depend on medical advice at the time.
William was looking after George, 10, Charlotte, eight, and five-year-old Louis on Wednesday evening.
The royal youngsters were at school all day and are yet to visit their mother in hospital.
A spokesperson said the princess wanted to share news of her surgery to explain to those affected by the postponement of her engagements.
“She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible, and her wish that her personal medical information remains private,” they added.
“Kensington Palace will, therefore, only provide updates on Her Royal Highness’ progress when there is significant new information to share.”
There will now be no international travel for the prince and princess in the coming months.
The London Clinic was chosen to care for Kate this time, rather than King Edward VII’s Hospital which is usually the go-to establishment for royal medical matters and where she was admitted in 2012."

Milieudefensie, the Dutch branch of Friends of the Earth, said Friday they have started legal proceedings against ING, and warned that other top companies could be next.
""ING is the biggest bank in the Netherlands and finances polluting companies with more money than all other Dutch banks,"" the group said in a press release.
The group's director Donald Pols said ING is responsible for more emissions than Sweden, with 99 percent of them stemming from loans and working with highly polluting companies.
It called on ING to slash these CO2 emissions by 48 percent by 2030 compared to 2019 levels.
""The bank finances oil and gas companies, deforestation and heavy industry, all of which add to the climate crisis,"" he said.
ING said in a statement to AFP it would ""of course respond in court if necessary.""
The added that it is ""confident that we take impactful action to fight climate change and sustainability is part of our overall strategic direction.""
ING pointed to measures announced in December to phase out financing upstream oil and gas activities by 2040.
The bank also indicated a pledge to triple new financing of renewable power generation to 7.5 billion euros ($8.2 billion) annually by 2025, up from 2.5 billion euros in 2022.
""ING is taking baby steps in the right direction... nevertheless, Friends of the Earth Netherlands believes this policy is still highly inadequate,"" the activists said.
- 'Historic' verdict -
In 2021, Milieudefensie won a major Dutch court battle against Shell, when judges ordered the oil giant to slash carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2030, saying the company was contributing to the ""dire"" effects of clte change.
At the time, campaigners hailed as ""historic"" the verdict that for the first time made a company align its policy with the 2015 Paris climate accords.
""What applies to Shell, applies to all large corporations and therefore also to ING: they have a duty to reduce their own contribution to dangerous climate change,"" said the group.
Last year, the group put 28 firms on notice, challenging them to produce plans to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 45 percent by 2030 compared to 2019 levels.
The warning targeted major companies including supermarket group Ahold Delhaize, paint manufacturer AkzoNobel, BP, chemical firm Dow, ExxonMobil, airline KLM, consumer goods firm Unilever and Tata Steel.
The case against ING does not let these other companies ""off the hook"", Milieudefensie cautioned.
""Whether you are drilling for oil yourself, or have paid for the drill, in both cases you are contributing to and bear responsibility for the climate crisis we are currently experiencing,"" said the group.
Milieudefensie has launched a fundraising effort to finance the new lawsuit, saying it needed 300,000 euros ($327,000). It has raised just over 40 percent of the target, according to its website.
Pols said the group had been in talks with the bank since 1990 but the time had come to take action.
""We've asked nicely enough times.""

Unrest in the West Bank has surged alongside the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.
The latest death followed the deaths of five people in the Tulkarem refugee camp on Wednesday in an air strike which the Israeli military said targeted ""terrorists"".
A 27-year-old man was shot dead in Nur Shams camp on the edge of Tulkarem on Thursday, the Palestinian Red Crescent and the health ministry said.
Local official Rami Elyan said the man killed was a civilian not involved in fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants.
The Israeli army said troops had killed ""at least eight terrorists"" in Tulkarem in an operation that had already lasted 35 hours.
The military told AFP troops had returned fire and were working to ""uncover roads where explosive devices were planted"".
A young resident said a bulldozer had been used in Nur Shams and AFP footage showed children playing in the wreckage of a destroyed house, with collapsed walls and debris all around.
""We won't leave the camp. It's our camp,"" Qais Muhayen al-Shams told AFP, adding the bulldozer had been driven into a house while people were still inside.
- 'Ignite more fires' -
Drawing on the impact on civilians, the Palestinian foreign ministry slammed the Tulkarem raid as pandering to ""calls from the ruling (Israeli) far right to escalate violence and ignite more fires in the conflict zone"".
The Palestinian Prisoners' Club advocacy group said hundreds of residents have been rounded up in Tulkarem and subjected to interrogation, with some subjected to ""severe beatings"" by Israeli forces.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967 and its troops regularly carry out incursions into Palestinian communities.
West Bank raids have escalated since the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza began more than three months ago, increasingly lasting days and accompanied by air strikes.
Five Palestinian militants were also killed Wednesday in an Israeli strike targeting a car in Balata refugee camp near Nablus.
Mourners gathered Thursday for the funeral of one of those killed, whose body was shrouded in a Palestinian flag.
The Red Crescent said its medics treated multiple people wounded in Tulkarem, as well as Ramallah in the central West Bank.
Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 360 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7, according to the Palestinian health ministry.
Over the same period, Israeli forces have arrested more than 6,000 Palestinians, according to the Prisoners' Club.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded study found only 17% of children age 5 to 11 with sickle cell disease had gotten just a primary COVID-19 vaccine, but not a second round. The same went for 31% of the age 12 to 17 demographic. That was compared with 25% and 41% of Michigan's general population in these age groups.
""It is essential to develop targeted interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccination among people with sickle cell disease,"" said the study's principal investigator, Dr. Sarah Reeves.

Large numbers of civilians will need to be mobilised in case of the outbreak of war and governments should put in place systems to manage the process, Adml Bauer told reporters after a meeting of Nato defence chiefs in Brussels.
“We have to realise it’s not a given that we are in peace. And that’s why we [Nato forces] are preparing for a conflict with Russia.
“But the discussion is much wider. It is also the industrial base and also the people that have to understand they play a role.”

Stockholm’s move, announced earlier this month, has led to a surge in volunteers for the country’s civil defence organisation and a spike in sales of torches and battery-powered radios.
“It starts there,” Adml Bauer said. “The realisation that not everything is planable and not everything is going to be hunky dory in the next 20 years.”
Some 90,000 Nato troops will next week begin the bloc’s largest military exercise since the Cold War.
The Steadfast Defender 2024 operation has more than doubled in size since it was announced last year, and is explicitly designed to prepare the alliance for a Russian invasion.
Britain has committed around 20,000 soldiers, as well as tanks, artillery and fighter jets to the drills taking place across Europe until May.
But senior Nato officials are increasingly concerned that governments and private arms manufacturers are falling behind in preparations on the domestic front.
Stockpiles of weapons and ammunition have been drained by the conflict in Ukraine and will take years to replenish at the current rate of production.
Meanwhile, Russia has tripled its military expenditure to 40 per cent of the entire national budget, while drastically speeding up manufacturing lines.
“We need to be readier across the whole spectrum,” Adml Bauer said. “You have to have a system in place to find more people if it comes to war, whether it does or not. Then you talk mobilisation, reservists or conscription.
“You need to be able to fall back on an industrial base that is able to produce weapons and ammunition fast enough to be able to continue a conflict if you are in it.”
Western aid to Ukraine has dwindled amid growing public resistance in the United States and European Union.
The EU has been unable to deliver on its promise to send one million 155mm artillery shells to Kyiv by next month, contributing to a collapse in the rate of fire of Ukrainian artillery.
Joe Biden has also been unable to convince Republican leaders to back further spending packages for Ukraine, as they argue the money should be spent on domestic priorities, such as border security, instead.
On Thursday, David Cameron warned against 1930s-style appeasement of Vladimir Putin and promised Britain would keep supporting Ukraine in the “struggle of our generation”.
The Foreign Secretary urged Britain’s allies not to push for peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow, arguing that unifying behind Ukraine was the best way to end the war.
At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Lord Cameron compared the calls for negotiations to the appeasement of Adolf Hitler by prime minister Neville Chamberlain in the lead-up to the Second World War.
“If foreign ministers keep saying ‘Yes, we will support Ukraine but, yes, we must also start a peace process’, they’ll neither get a strong Ukraine nor a peace process,” he told the gathering of diplomats, foreign leaders and executives.
“This is like being a foreign minister or prime minister in the 1930s and fighting that aggression. And what we know from that is, if you appease aggression you get more of it.”
Lord Cameron also nodded as Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, stood up and said: “There is never a shortage of pocket Chamberlains willing to sacrifice other people’s land or freedom for their own peace of mind. We shouldn’t do it.”
It came as France’s defence minister hit back at German accusations it had fallen short on supporting Ukraine.
Sebastien Lecornu said a list compiled by the Kiel Institute, a German think tank, showing Paris 12th in terms of military deliveries was “neither trustworthy nor viable”.
The tracker, last updated before Emmanuel Macron’s latest promises of missiles and bombs, showed that Paris had provided just €544 million in bilateral military aid to Kyiv since the start of the full-scale invasion almost two years ago.
In comparison, Germany was credited with promising €17 billion towards Ukraine’s war effort.
“It’s entirely based on promises and declarations,” Mr Lecornu said.
“You have certain countries which, for domestic political reasons, have made a lot of announcements and then the promises have not been kept, or when they have been kept, it’s with equipment that is sometimes faulty.”
He also lashed out at Germany for shying away from sending “game-changing” long-range missiles to Ukraine, in a further escalation of the row between the EU’s first and second largest economies.
“Germany refuses to deliver Taurus missiles which are the equivalent of SCALPs and which are the real game-changers,” Mr Lecornu said.
“And yet President (Macron) has announced a new delivery of 40 or so of these missiles.”

Source: Le Monde, citing the French Defence Ministry’s official statement, available to the editorial staff.
Details: The statement that reached the media in the evening mentions that Umierov cancelled the scheduled trip on 18 January ""due to security considerations"" and will join the events with his French counterpart, Sébastien Lecornu, via video conferencing.
During Umierov's visit, an ""artillery coalition"" was expected to be announced within the Ramstein-format meeting, involving 20 states led by France and the USA.
Lecornu and Umierov had planned to visit one of the facilities of arms maker Nexter in Bourges, where self-propelled howitzers including the CAESAR are produced, as well as the MBDA missile factory. The detailed program of the visit was published for the media on 15 January.
Background:
As is known, Ukraine received 18 self-propelled artillery units Caesar from France, and Paris has already been able to partially replenish its artillery systems stock – thanks to the arrival of previously ordered howitzers.
The creation of the artillery coalition and its launch were announced in December, with the implementation set for January.

""This election has been a real test for whether the Taiwan electorate is willing to push back against Chinese pressure and coercion and make an independent choice for who they want to be their next leader,"" Matt McInnis, senior fellow for the Institute for the Study of War’s China program, told Fox News Digital.
""That choice is going to determine the nature of the security situation over the next four years — in particular in the western Pacific,"" McInnis said, noting the most expected result will see the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) win.
BIDEN TO SEND DELEGATION TO TAIWAN DAYS AFTER ELECTION IN MOVE LIKELY TO ANGER CHINA
The DPP faces stiff competition from the Koumintang (KMT), or Chinese Nationalist Party, which has tried to cast the ruling party as dangerous leadership that will steer the country towards conflict with China due to its insistence on pursuing formal independence.
However, early results showed William Lai's DPP with a comfortable lead of around 40% of the vote compared to KMT's 33% after around 40% of the vote had been counted. One voter, who only gave his name as Wang, told Fox News Digital that he believed those who voted for third-place TPP were ""stupid.""
READ ON THE FOX NEWS APP
McInnis noted that Taiwan officials have already highlighted ""pervasive"" Chinese information operations ""at unprecedented levels,"" framing the election as a ""choice between war and peace.""
China has not publicly named a preferred candidate or specified what the ""right"" choice is, but Beijing’s Taiwan Affairs Office labeled DPP’s candidate William Lai as an ""obstinate Taiwan independence worker"" who would further promote separatist activities.
TAIWAN APOLOGIZES AFTER EMERGENCY ALERT MISTRANSLATION LED TO ‘MISSILE’ WARNING FOR CHINESE SATELLITE LAUNCH
Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry condemned China for ""once again blatantly intimidating the Taiwanese people and the international community"" and trying to influence the election.
""China has tried to shape that narrative over the past 10 to 12 months, and I think they’ve been fairly effective with that,"" McInnis explained, arguing that ""China’s influence operations, psychological operations during the campaign… ultimately is not dramatically swinging the election in the way they would like it to.""
Beijing has employed other tactics to influence Taiwanese voters, including economic pressure and some broad military coercion: China launched a satellite on Tuesday that flew over Taiwan as it exited the atmosphere, and some surveillance balloons wandered into Taiwan’s airspace, China expert Gordon Chang told Fox News Digital.
""[Chinese President] Xi Jinping in his 2024 New Year message actually listed the annexation of Taiwan in the portion of his speech where he put all the things he hoped would occur [this year],"" Chang explained. ""Of course, there have been threats to cut off trade, they have worked very closely in China with some of the candidates in Taiwan, so the election interference has been substantial.""
NEW FOCUS IN MILITARY SPENDING CAN KEEP PENTAGON STEP AHEAD OF CHINA: EXPERT
Chang also noted the negative impact China’s pressure has had on its ambitions, prompting the voters to instead focus on geopolitical issues and ""issues of identity.""
""Those who identify as Chinese only [on Taiwan] is usually less than 5%, and that is the core support of KMT,"" Chang said.
Chang called Taiwan’s election ""fascinating,"" arguing that even if China’s preferred candidate should win, he expects to see ""friction"" between the island and the mainland.
""If you have a pro-China president… there’s going to be friction regardless of who was elected, and we have just got to make sure we do not permit China to interfere anymore,"" he said.
CHINA FLOATS PLAN TO FOSTER ECONOMIC TIES WITH DEMOCRAT-LED CITIES: REPORT
Lai has tried to reach out and start a dialogue with Beijing following eight years of near-total non-communication, but insisted that he would continue to ""build up Taiwan’s defense deterrence, strengthen Taiwan’s capabilities in economic security, enhance partnerships with democracies around the world and maintain stable and principled leadership on cross-Strait relations.""
Lai has also, in turn, portrayed the KMT as a pro-Beijing group, which has various levels of allegiance to the mainland ranging from a similar stance to the DPP’s own to one that seeks distance with the U.S. to maintain strong, positive relations with the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP), according to The Diplomat. A small number of die-hard party members still seek reunification with China — a stance at odds with the opinion of the public.
Heino Klinck, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia and military attaché to China, puts a lot of weight on public sentiment to maintain autonomy.
""The election in Taiwan is a manifestation of what a vibrant democracy looks like,"" Klinck told Fox News Digital, calling Taiwan ""a very striking juxtaposition to what the People’s Republic of China represents.""
GIANT PANDAS SET TO RETURN TO CALIFORNIA IN 2024, CHINA'S FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS
""It evolved relatively peacefully from an autocratic one-party nation to a very, very vibrant democracy in all its forms, and it shows you that democracy can work,"" Klinck added, suggesting that, ""From a U.S.-Taiwan bilateral perspective… whoever will be leading [Taiwan], it’s not going to change much.""
""I could see nuances in the approach that a new Taiwanese president, depending on who it is, will take with respect to the cross-Strait relationship and, more specifically, from a national security and defense perspective,"" Klinck explained. He highlighted concerns that the KMT might ""roll back some of the progress that has been made under the leadership of President Tsai [Ing-wen].""
Klinck visited Taiwan as part of a delegation from the Ronald Reagan Foundation to demonstrate the strong ties between the U.S. and Taiwan and meet with Tsai, who stressed the shared values of freedom and democracy between the two countries.
Klinck stressed that as much as the election itself matters, he would suggest keeping an eye on the months between the election and the inauguration in May, during which time he expects Beijing to ramp up pressure on the president-elect — especially in the event DPP’s Lai does win.
""I envision that the Chinese will escalate their pressure on the president-elect because the inaugural speech will set a tone and the Chinese will try to influence that tone,"" Klinck said.

YG1BIS606T_QSS4WZ4TCW2H5H7,5 dead in Israel strike on Syria targeting 'Iran-aligned leaders': monitor,AFP,"January 20, 2024 at 5:23 PM·3 min read",20240120,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/5-dead-israel-strike-syria-092326381.html,"An Israeli strike on Damascus killed five people in a building where ""Iran-aligned leaders"" were meeting on Saturday, a war monitor said, as regional tensions soar over the Israel-Hamas war.
""An Israeli missile strike targeted a four-storey building, killing five people... and destroying the whole building where Iran-aligned leaders were meeting,"" said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The British-based monitor with a network of sources inside Syria said the targeted neighbourhood is known to be a high-security zone home to leaders of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and pro-Iran Palestinian factions.
""They were for sure targeting senior members"" of those groups, said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman.
The mid-morning strike, which caused a large plume of smoke to billow into the sky, was also reported by Syrian state media.
""An attack targeted a residential building in the Mazzeh neighbourhood in Damascus, resulting from an Israeli aggression,"" the official SANA news agency reported. It did not say if there were any casualties.
An AFP correspondent at the scene said the destroyed building was cordoned off with ambulances, firefighters and Syrian Arab Red Crescent rescue teams all present at the site.
Civil defence were busy searching for survivors under the rubble of the totally collapsed building, he said.
The Mazzeh area is also home to the United Nations' headquarters, embassies and restaurants.
""I heard the explosion clearly in the western Mazzeh area, and I saw a large cloud of smoke,"" a resident told AFP.
""The sound was similar to a missile explosion, and minutes later I heard the sound of ambulances,"" he added.
- Hundreds of Israeli strikes -
During more than a decade of civil war in Syria, Israel has launched hundreds of air strikes on its territory, primarily targeting Iran-backed forces as well as Syrian army positions.
But it has intensified attacks since the war between Israel and Hamas, which like Lebanon's Hezbollah movement is an ally of Iran, began on October 7.
In December, an Israeli air strike killed a senior general with Iran's Revolutionary Guards, the military force said.
Razi Moussavi was the most senior commander of the Guards' foreign operations arm, the Quds Force, to be killed outside Iran since a US drone strike in Baghdad on January 3, 2020 killed the Force's commander, Qasem Soleimani.
In the same month, air strikes in eastern Syria, ""likely"" carried out by Israel, killed at least 23 pro-Iran fighters, the Observatory said at the time, reporting four more dead in the country's north.
Recent months have also seen regular cross-border exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.
Israel rarely comments on individual strikes targeting Syria, but it has repeatedly said it will not allow arch foe Iran, which backs President Bashar al-Assad's government, to expand its presence there.
Since 2011, Syria has endured a bloody conflict that has claimed over half a million lives and displaced several million people and plunged.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan welcomed a record number of visitors in December, official data showed on Wednesday, closing out a year of rapid recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The number of foreign visitors for business and leisure rose to 2.73 million last month from 2.44 million in November, data from the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO) showed.
It was the highest-ever number of tourists for the month of December and about 8% higher than the pre-pandemic level seen in 2019.
For the full-year 2023, a little more than 25 million visitors arrived in Japan, the agency said.
Tourism to Japan all but halted for more than two years during the pandemic as the country put up some of the world's strictest border controls. But arrivals bounced back quickly after the government resumed visa-free travel for many countries in October 2022.
Arrivals exceeded 2 million every month since June last year, boosted by a weakening in the yen that makes Japan cheaper compared to other destinations.
Visitors this year are likely to break 2019's record of 31.9 million, but tourist spending last year may have already reached the government's goal of 5 trillion yen ($33.81 billion), said Teppei Kawanishi, general manager at travel industry consultancy mov Honichi Lab.
Average spending per visitor is about 30% higher than before the pandemic, driven in part by repeat travellers from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other parts of Asia, Kawanishi said.
""Spending levels are very high nowadays,"" he added.
December saw record arrivals for any single month among people from Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia, the JNTO said.
That is helping to compensate for a slow recovery in visitors from mainland China, who made up nearly a third of all visitors and 40% of all tourist spending in Japan in 2019. The number of Chinese travellers in December was still 56% below pre-pandemic levels.
Inbound tourism has become a key part of Japan's economic recovery, but a severe shortage of workers is hobbling the sector's ability to keep up with demand.
""The industry cannot cope,"" said Wanping Aw, managing director of boutique travel agency TokudAw that specialises in private car tours of Japan. ""Experienced personnel are burnt out and overworked and have no time to train staff.""

(Reuters) -Google will invest $1 billion on building a data centre just outside of London, the U.S. technology giant said on Thursday, in its latest investment in Britain as it meets growing demand for internet services in the region.
The data centre, located on a 33-acre (13-hectare) site bought by Google in 2020, will be located in the town of Waltham Cross, about 15 miles north of central London, the Alphabet-owned company said in a statement.
The British government, which is pushing for investment by businesses to help fund new infrastructure, particularly in growth industries like technology and artificial intelligence, described Google's investment as a ""huge vote of confidence"" in the UK.
""Google's $1 billion investment is testament to the fact that the UK is a centre of excellence in technology and has huge potential for growth,"" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in the Google statement.
The investment follows Google's $1 billion purchase of a central London office building in 2022, close to Covent Garden, and another site in nearby King's Cross, where it is building a new office and where its AI company DeepMind is also based.
It also comes weeks after Microsoft unveiled plans to pump 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) into Britain over three years, including in growing its data centre capacity, to underpin future AI services.
""This new data centre will help meet growing demand for our AI and cloud services and bring crucial compute capacity to businesses across the UK while creating construction and technical jobs,"" Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in the statement.
Google, which employs over 7,000 people in Britain, also said that waste heat generated from the data centre would be an opportunity for energy conservation that can benefit the local community.

Earlier this week, KCNA said Choe and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov discussed strengthening the ""strategic and tactical cooperation"" and implementing the agreement between their leaders to forge closer ties when they met in September.
Choe's visit was the latest in a series of high-level exchanges since last year amid growing criticism of Pyongyang's role in the Ukraine war by allegedly shipping artillery and missiles to Russia.
Both North Korea and Russia deny the accusation and also the charge that Pyongyang was receiving advanced technology for developing strategic military capability from Moscow in return.

""I think the nature of North Korea as a threat in the region could drastically change over the coming decade as a result of this cooperation,"" Vaddi said.

The Democratic party sent out the cards on Jan. 12 but were not accepted in person at the caucuses. The presidential preference cards must be postmarked by March 5, a deadline that aligns with Super Tuesday, meaning the presidential primary starts in South Carolina.

Johnson County Democrats still gathered at 13 locations across the county to elect central committee members who will serve for two years, representing their precinct and the Democratic Party.
Johnson County Democratic Party chair Ed Cranston said the new process has made voting more inclusive not only for Johnson County Democrats but also across the state.
""What we've done this year is we made it possible for really every Democrat in the state of Iowa to request a Presidential Preference card,"" Cranston said. ""All they have to do is fill it out and mail it in, so it's much more inclusive; the delegates this year are not attached to a candidate in the past, as opposed to years in the past.""

About 50 registered Democrats arrived at Iowa City West High to participate in the reinvented festivities.
Carolyn Shultz, of Iowa City's 9th precinct, remembers attending the caucuses with her parents when she was young. She remembers her first caucus in 2004. This year's caucus is the third she has participated in as a registered voter, where she was serving as a volunteer.
She said she has mixed feelings about the new process.
""I came out as a volunteer because I felt like some of the people who volunteered might not want to because of the weather,"" Schultz said. ""I have mixed feelings about caucuses, but it sounds like it was one hell of a negotiation to figure out what to do.""
The new format was welcomed with open arms by other Democrats, noting how it eliminates competition seen at previous caucuses.

For democratic party members like Pat Bauer, the caucus is an opportunity to build unity.
""I'm a big fan of political parties fulfilling very important functions,"" Bauer said. ""It's not a spectator sport. You have to get involved. It's a great way to meet people and get involved, serve on the central committee, and go to the county convention. You'll make contacts and get to know people.""
Democrats in Johnson County are remaining hopeful of the 2024 election despite former President Trump winning the Republican Caucus,
""Biden has already beaten Trump once, and he has a lot of options under his belt with incumbency advantage,"" said Shultz.
Cranston believes local interest will help carry the Democratic party through the November election. He says the registered voters invest time to learn about pressing issues and how to best see the country forward.
Cranston said the party has prepared for the coming year.
""Johnson County has a strong turnout for Democrats. Democrats across the state really turn out to see the candidates and share Iowa issues with them,"" Cranston said. ""We really care about politics here, and we've been doing a pretty creative campaign this past year. Our view is that there is no off year.
There was no major election last year, and we used that time to do listening tours, where we're listening to swing voters, and folks that maybe are no party folks that have not voted for a Democrat and some time.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -An Atlas Air Boeing 747-8 cargo plane made an emergency landing in Miami late Thursday shortly after departure after suffering an engine fire.
The plane with five crew members safely returned and no injuries were reported.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. The FAA said a post-flight inspection showed a softball-size hole above the engine, while the NTSB said it ""has opened an investigation and is collecting information to evaluate and determine scope of the investigation.""
Unverified videos on social media platform X showed flames shooting out of the left wing of the aircraft while in flight.
""The crew followed all standard procedures and safely returned to (Miami International),"" the air freight company said, adding that it would conduct an inspection to find the cause.
U.S. air safety expert John Cox said having problems with one engine is generally not a significant event, but the incident sounded like an uncontained engine failure due to the hole and NTSB investigation.
“On the interior of that engine there are a lot of rotating parts including blades,"" Cox said. ""An engine is designed to try and contain a blade separation and they do testing and certification for it. But it does happen that you get an uncontained failure. When you do, it does elevate the investigative significance of it.""
Cox said incidents of uncontained engine failures, like a 2018 Southwest Airlines flight where a passenger was partially sucked out the window are coming under increased scrutiny.
Investigators will be looking at questions like the age of the engine and its maintenance record.
Boeing said it is supporting Atlas and ""the NTSB investigation into this incident.""
The Atlas Boeing 747-8 is eight years old, according to the FAA and is powered by four General Electric GEnx engines.
GE Aerospace said it is providing technical assistance to the FAA and the NTSB.
The engine failure comes against the backdrop of two high-profile jetliner accidents this year.
An Airbus A350 passenger plane operated by Japan Airlines collided with a Coast Guard aircraft in Tokyo, killing five crew members on Jan. 2.
A few days later, a Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet made an emergency landing following a cabin panel blowout, which prompted the FAA to temporarily ground 171 jets for safety checks.
SNAG OCCURRED ON THE CLIMB
The Atlas Air Flight was headed for San Juan, Puerto Rico, from Miami International Airport late on Thursday.
The pilot made an emergency call to report an engine fire and requested to return to the airport, according to multi-channel recordings of conversations between air traffic control and the plane available on liveatc.net.
""We have a engine fire,"" one of the plane crew said, adding the fire occurred ""on the climb out"" of the airport.
Atlas Air, customers of which include parcel delivery giants DHL and FedEx, went private last year when it was bought by a group led by private equity Apollo Global Management.
A freighter version of the last commercial Boeing jumbo was delivered to Atlas Air last year.

The powerful military has seized power in Pakistan at least four times, but Musharraf's death sentence was the first time a general was punished for a coup.
Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and ruled Pakistan for nine years, was handed a death sentence by a special tribunal in 2019 after finding him guilty of treason.
But the sentence was overturned by a high court weeks later and an appeal was filed in the Supreme Court that remained pending for years.

It comes after both countries exchanged drone and missile strikes on militant bases on each other's territory.
As a result of the tit-for-tat attacks Iran and Pakistan withdrew their ambassadors from the respective capitals.
Both ambassadors are now expected to return to their posts following talks.
Iran said Thursday's strikes killed nine people in a border village on its territory, including four children. Pakistan said an Iranian attack on Tuesday killed two children.
There has been no immediate comment from Iran on the talks.
Earlier on Friday, Pakistan expressed its willingness to work with Iran on ""all issues"" following a call between their foreign ministers.
""Foreign Minister Jilani expressed Pakistan's readiness to work with Iran on all issues based on spirit of mutual trust and cooperation,"" the Pakistan foreign ministry said.
""They also agreed to de-escalate the situation. The return of ambassadors of the two countries to their respective capitals was also discussed.""
Iran demonstrates missile capabilities with regional strikes
The reciprocal attacks came as tensions in the Middle East are high with several overlapping crises.
Israel is fighting the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza and exchanging fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Meanwhile, Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria are targeting US forces, and the US and UK have struck the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, who have been attacking shipping.
On Thursday, Pakistan's foreign ministry said its strikes around the Iranian city of Saravan had come in light of ""credible intelligence of impending large-scale terrorist activities"".
The ministry added it ""fully respects"" Iran's ""sovereignty and territorial integrity"".
Pakistan's army said the ""precision strikes"" were conducted with drones, rockets and long-range missiles and targeted the Balochistan Liberation Army and the Balochistan Liberation Front.
Both groups are part of a decades-long struggle for greater autonomy in Balochistan, a remote region in south-western Pakistan."
ZG5C9UE6VU_FW4YJVLFRZ20MVM,UPDATED: Poland extends protection for third-country refugees who fled Ukraine after war,Martin Fornusek,"January 19, 2024 at 2:31 AM·2 min read",20240118,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/poland-extends-protection-ukrainian-refugees-183109983.html,"Editor's note: This article was updated after the Ukrainian embassy in Poland clarified that the extension concerned only third-country residents of Ukraine, not Ukrainian citizens granted protection under a special law.
The Polish government announced on Jan. 18 an extension of temporary protection for third-country residents of Ukraine who fled the war until March 2025.
Poland hosts around 1 million Ukrainians who fled from Russia's war, the highest number of all countries. The U.N. records approximately 6 million refugees residing abroad as a result of Russian aggression.
The EU initially activated the Temporary Protection Directive for Ukrainian refugees in March 2022, shortly after the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. The European bloc has extended the measure several times since then, most recently in October 2023.
The extension is provided to third-country citizens who had permanent residency in Ukraine at the start of the full-scale war and fled to Poland.
Foreigners who received a certificate of temporary protection do not have to apply for new ones as their validity is extended, the Polish government's statement read.
According to the Polish newspaper Gazeta Prawna, the Polish government is working on amendments to the special law to extend the stay for Ukrainian refugees as well.
The document is expected to be submitted to the parliament for approval in the coming weeks.
Poland has provided extensive support to Ukrainian refugees coming to its country, which included waiving residency requirements and providing free access to education, healthcare, and family benefits.
The aid for refugees was initially instituted under the previous conservative Law and Justice (PiS) government.
Last September, the PiS government spokesperson hinted that the support may not be extended to the same extent also for the following year. The statement came amid a Polish-Ukrainian row over grain imports. The conservative party has since then been voted out of power and replaced by a coalition of formerly opposition parties.

Nine Turkish soldiers died in clashes with the PKK in northern Iraq on Friday, prompting Ankara to conduct air strikes and operations both there and in northern Syria.
The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, took up arms in 1984 for the rights of ethnic Kurdish people. Turkish forces regularly strike PKK militants based in the mountains of northern Iraq.
Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media that police had detained 18 people for ""praising a terrorist organisation"", ""spreading terrorism propaganda,"" and ""spreading misleading information"" over Turkey's operations in Iraq.
Arrest warrants were issued for 19 others in Turkey and 133 abroad, Yerlikaya added, without giving further details.
A Turkish security source said that National Intelligence Agency (MIT) had ""neutralised"" Hulya Mercen, a high-level PKK member who led several attacks on Turkish troops in the past, in northern Iraq's Metina region.
Many other PKK militants have also been ""neutralised"" in operations since Friday, the defence ministry said, using a term typically meaning killed.
There was no immediate reaction from the PKK, which seldom confirms attacks against it.
Schools across Turkey observed a minute's silence on Monday morning to honour the dead soldiers, the government said.

Source: Tagesschau, as reported by European Pravda
Details: The proposal of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, which directly calls on the federal government to supply Taurus, was rejected by a majority of votes.
MPs from the Greens and the Free Democratic Party, who have long insisted on such a supply in the coalition, motivated their refusal by the fact that the opposition's request was connected with the plenary debate on the annual report of the military commissar.
For example, FDP MP Nils Gründer explained: ""Of course, the FDP parliamentary group is in favour of supplying Taurus (...), but I find it weak that we are holding this debate today amid the concern of our soldiers.""
It was also reported that the Greens accused the CDU and CSU of looking only for headlines. ""Sadly, the current proposition of the CDU/CSU fraction is aimed solely at a tactical advantage in internal political debates in the Federative Republic of Germany,"" the Greens stated.
The CDU and CSU already wanted to put the issue of the supply of Taurus missiles to a vote in the past. But the corresponding proposal was submitted to the committees by the coalition majority.
Even if a majority of the Bundestag votes to supply Taurus, the federal government, in particular the Federal Security Council, has the final say on arms exports.
The German government continues to refuse to supply Taurus to Ukraine.

The show comes at a good time for Madix, who found out in the past year that her longtime partner and “Vanderpump Rules” co-star Tom Sandoval was cheating on her with another co-star. Madix hopes that her stint on “Dancing with the Stars” and playing Roxie in “Chicago” will continue the trend of her being associated with something other than gossip and tabloid headlines.
“If I am in the papers, it’ll be for things that are positive. It’ll be for the work that I’m doing. It will be for more things like this and hopefully less things that are not fun,” Madix told The Associated Press at a recent press day for the show.
She says that appearing on the reality television show taught her how to be herself, and that’s something she plans on bringing to her version of Roxie, which she stars in starting Jan. 29 for eight weeks.
“The Ariana Roxie is going to be unlike anyone else, because we’re all different people and we’re all going to bring our own experiences to it. So, I’m really looking forward to that.”
Set in the 1920s, the musical is a scathing satire of how show business and the media make celebrities out of criminals. It has Bob Fosse-inspired choreography, skimpy outfits and killer songs such as “All That Jazz” and “Cell Block Tango.”
On the Broadway stage, Madix is surrounded by an entire cast, so she expects the run to be “really fun.” But that doesn’t mean she won’t react to her nerves.
“If anyone hears me screaming in my dressing room, it’s just part of me getting out my nervousness. It’s what I do,” Madix said."

Thousands gathered late Tuesday in the capital Belgrade to celebrate the news that the European Parliament will discuss the situation in Serbia Wednesday after President Vucic's party won controversial landslide victories in parliamentary and local elections on December 17.
""We have achieved our objective, and today Europe and the whole world know that we caught the thieves in the act,"" Marinika Tepic of the opposition ""Serbia against violence"" (SPN) coalition told the crowds Tuesday.
The SPN got just 23.66 percent of the vote in the parliamentary poll, with Vucic's Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) taking 46.75 percent.
But international observers -- including the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) -- reported ""irregularities"", including ""vote buying"" and ""ballot box stuffing"".
Their findings added to the backlash with thousands joining a string of protests that included an attempt to storm Belgrade's city hall.
The protests have done little to move Vucic, who has dismissed both the demonstrations and the debate in Strasbourg.
""I am interested in the session of the Serbian parliament"" rather than the European Parliament, Vucic said over the weekend. ""Any attempt on their part to influence the decisions of the Serbian administration will be doomed to failure.""
- Legal battles -
By law, the Serbian parliament must have its first session by mid-February, with the SNS holding an absolute majority of 129 seats to the SPN's 65.
The opposition has suggested they may resign en masse -- however, no formal plan has been tabled just yet.
They have zeroed in on accusations that the government allowed unregistered voters from neighbouring Bosnia to cast ballots illegally in the capital, allegedly tipping the results in several tight municipal races.
""We are talking here about an operation which must have cost hundreds of thousands of euros,"" said Rasa Nedeljkov of the Belgrade-based Centre for Research, Transparency and Accountability.
Despite hopes that the debate in the European Parliament may pile pressure on Vucic, the opposition appear to have few options to challenge the election results.
A court on Tuesday rejected a complaint against alleged election fraud filed by Miodrag Gavrilovic, a Serbian MP and vice-president of the Democratic Party, which is a member of the SNP coalition.
According to several lawyers, legal appeals are unlikely to make much headway in a system largely controlled by Vucic's party and its allies.
""It remains to be seen what the Constitutional Court will say, but if we exhaust all legal mechanisms without result, then we will be able to conclude that we are no longer a pseudo-democracy, but rather an autocracy,"" constitutional law professor Tanasije Marinkovic told local media.
The SPN movement was formed in the wake of back-to-back mass shootings last year, which spurred hundreds of thousands to take to the streets in rallies that morphed into anti-government protests that lasted several months.
Vucic has vowed that nothing will change the results.
""The elections are over,"" the president said Friday.
As for the protests, Vucic said he had no problem with the rallies, ""as long as they don't beat up anyone and don't enter the institutions.""

ZRDIF0CGRZ_FY99YWAS6IRFBWR,US will respond if Houthis continue attacks - Biden,BBC,"January 13, 2024 at 8:12 AM·5 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/us-respond-houthis-continue-attacks-223236033.html,"US President Joe Biden says there will be further retaliation against the Houthis should the group continue with its ""outrageous behaviour"".
The US and UK launched dozens of airstrikes on Friday - targeting nearly 30 Houthi positions in response to recent attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
Five people were killed, the group reported - vowing to retaliate.
Mr Biden said the strikes were a success and that he thought the Houthis were a ""terrorist"" group.
Some 73 missiles were launched at Yemen during the strike, the Houthis reported. They said the attack meant UK and US interests were now legitimate targets.
""They [US and UK] committed an idiocy with this treacherous aggression,"" said Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam.
""We're not interested in a war with Yemen,"" said White House national security spokesperson John Kirby.
However, he added that Mr Biden ""won't hesitate to take further action to protect our troops and our facilities and international commerce"".
Friday's attacks had the backing of US-UK allies including Canada and Australia.
According to the Pentagon, the group may currently not have the ability to mount a significant military response.
""We did see one anti-ship ballistic missile that was fired today that did not hit any ships of any kind,"" said Director of Operations Lt Gen Douglas A Sims ll.
Earlier, there were reports from a UK maritime security group that a missile was fired at a vessel off the southern coast of Yemen but no damage or injury was reported.
The British maritime security firm Ambrey said it was a tanker carrying Russian oil that was wrongly targeted by the Houthis, who thought the vessel had a UK connection.
But the US has made it clear they believe Iran - a Houthi ally - is pulling the strings and providing the group with the resources it needs to carry out the Red Sea attacks.
Tehran, for its part, has condemned the strikes on Yemen as a violation of international laws.
Who are the Houthis attacking Red Sea ships?
What we know about strikes on Houthis and strategy behind them
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak denied Friday's strikes were excessive - a claim levelled by Tukey, who accused the two countries of trying to turn the Red Sea into a ""sea of blood"".
Both Mr Sunak and Mr Biden faced criticism that their legislatures were not fully consulted before the attacks were launched.
With tensions high over the possibility that the strikes could further destabilise the Middle East, both the UK and US are keen to stress that the airstrikes were simply to protect shipping routes and nothing to do with the Israel-Gaza conflict.
The countries have backed Israel following the 7 October attacks by Hamas in which about 1,300 died and some 240 people were taken hostage.
The Houthis support Hamas, which is the focus of a military campaign by Israel in Gaza that has seen 23,350 people die so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
In response to the outbreak of war, the Houthis began attacking ships they said were destined for Israel or with Israeli links, describing them as a ""legitimate target"".
Some 27 ships have been targeted in the Red Sea to date, according to the Pentagon, but many commercial vessels that have been targeted appear to have no such connection.
The threat posed by the Houthis has become so great that major shipping companies have ceased sailing in the region and insurance costs have risen 10-fold since early December.
In the Yemeni capital Sanaa - which is under Houthi control - there were mass demonstrations against the US-UK strikes.
""This rally is first to condemn this aggression against the Republic of Yemen last night,"" one man told the Reuters news agency.
""It is also a message to Britain and the United States of America in particular, that they will pay a heavy price for this aggression.""
There have been regular mass rallies in Yemen in support of the Palestinians and Gaza since October but this Friday's were exceptionally large.
The Houthis are an armed group from a sub-sect of Yemen's Shia Muslim minority, the Zaidis. They declare themselves to be part of the Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" - along with the Hamas and Hezbollah groups - against Israel, the US and the wider West.
They control a large swathe of north-western Yemen - including the country's largest city, Sana'a - and have effectively become the de-facto government there after seizing control in 2014.
There is a whole spectrum of possible scenarios which could now develop in the Red Sea, ranging from the optimistic to the catastrophic.
Best case: tempers cool, the Houthis have second thoughts and refrain from attacking any more shipping. This is unlikely. Today's mass demo shows they have massive popular support at home and they have already issued defiant warnings of retaliation.
Worst case: the Houthis continue targeting shipping and also make good on their promise to attack US/UK assets and manage to score a direct missile hit on a warship.
This is a militia that has spent years resisting devastating airstrikes by the Saudi Air Force and is now, thanks in part to help from Iran, more firmly in control of much of Yemen than ever. The Houthis think they are invincible. They certainly have patience and an abundance of weaponry, much of it hidden in mountain tunnels.
There is now a dangerous inflection point for the US-led coalition in the Red Sea whereby it risks getting sucked into a costly and unwinnable war, just as the Saudis did."

While many voters are concerned about domestic issues such as sluggish economic growth and energy security, the threat from China -- which has repeatedly vowed to seize control of the island it considers a wayward province -- looms large over the campaign's final days.
The contest also kicks off a year in which dozens of countries will be holding elections of their own and is being framed by front-runner candidate Lai Ching-te of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party as a referendum on democracy itself.
""I am confident that you will see the robustness of Taiwan's democracy,"" Lai, who is Taiwan's vice president, said at a news conference earlier this week. ""Our people stand firmly with democracy even as we stand at the forefront of defending our values against authoritarianism.""
Outgoing President Tsai Ing-wen took a strong stance against Beijing's pressure and moved closer to Washington over her eight years in office, with the island becoming one of the biggest flashpoints in U.S.-China relations.
Lai has said he will maintain the cross-strait status quo while continuing to build up Taiwan's defense capabilities and enhancing partnerships with like-minded democracies around the world. He also argues there is no need to pursue formal independence, saying that Taiwan is a ""sovereign, independent country.""
Lai's main opponent, Hou You-ih of the traditionally Beijing-friendly Kuomintang party, or KMT, argues that better relations with China will benefit Taiwan's economy. His campaign has warned that a DPP victory would heighten the risk of war with its giant neighbor, a message that Beijing has echoed.
A Lai victory would create ""a dangerous situation in the Taiwan Strait,"" a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office said Thursday.
""Taiwan would be farther and farther away from peace and prosperity and closer and closer to war and recession,"" spokesman Chen Binhua said.
At the same time, Hou has looked to maintain more of a distance from Beijing than past KMT leaders, including former President Ma Ying-jeou.
""Former President Ma had many positions, and some of those views are different from mine,"" Hou said at a press conference Thursday. ""During my term, I will not touch on the issue of unification.""
However, Fang-long Shih, co-director of the Taiwan research program at the London School of Economics, said a KMT victory would eventually bring Taiwan under China's influence.
""Supporters of the KMT say the choice is peace in the Taiwan Strait versus war,"" she told UPI. ""This is wrong. The choice is either unification or non-unification"" with China.
While Lai has maintained a steady lead, polls have been close in the run-up to the election. A third candidate, former Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je of the upstart Taiwan People's Party, is a wildcard with a huge social media following. He is looking to carve a middle path between the establishment parties and offers a new voice that has resonated with younger voters.
At a DPP campaign rally on Thursday evening, speakers praised the past eight years of their party's rule and called for a continuation of Tsai's policies, while many supporters framed the election as an existential choice for Taiwan's future.
""We want to protect Taiwan,"" 67-year-old rally-goer Huang Chih-chen said. ""We are different from China. We don't belong to them. We are already an independent country.""
First-time voter Yi Hsien-ling, 21, pointed to China's crackdown on Hong Kong after pro-democracy protests in 2019 as a warning against growing closer to Beijing.
""We have to protect our democracy,"" she said. ""We don't want to be a second Hong Kong.""
The DPP and independent research groups have accused China of meddling in the upcoming elections by financing and coordinating online disinformation campaigns.
Beijing has also kept up a steady stream of incursions by fighter jets, naval ships and, more recently, large balloons in what Taipei calls ""gray zone"" warfare meant to strain the island's defense capabilities and wear down its morale.
China ""will use any means to influence Taiwan's elections,"" Marco Ho, a security specialist who co-founded the civil defense training group Kuma Academy, said.
""They are not looking for a full-scale military invasion in the short-term,"" Ho told UPI. ""For them, the political way is the best strategy.""
More than 19.5 million people are eligible to vote Saturday, according to Taiwan's Central Election Commission. In addition to the presidential and vice presidential races, 113 seats in the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's parliament, are also up for grabs."
ZYZTOXHVQJ_VV000RY3ZY1TPYU,Three conclusions after Russia's missile attack on Ukraine on January 8,The New Voice of Ukraine,"January 12, 2024 at 7:10 AM·3 min read",20240112,yahoo.com,https://news.yahoo.com/three-conclusions-russias-missile-attack-231000259.html,"Unexpectedly, today's attack was smaller than the previous two
One of the factors that influenced the January 8 missile attack was the sharp drop in temperature throughout Ukraine. It is clear that for Russians (remembering the experience of last year), the lower the temperature, the worse the consequences of such attacks. The destruction of the heating system in one place then leads to a cascading effect. In Russia, this happens even without shelling, and they would be thrilled to spark this in Ukraine because, among other things, the Russian public likes it very much. It takes attention away from their own problems.
The second thing I would point out is that Monday’s attack was unexpectedly smaller than the previous two. Again, it's too early to draw conclusions, but it may be a sign that Russia's ability to conduct such attacks, as we saw in late December and early January, is limited. But, again, that would be an overly optimistic conclusion.
One more thing that I think is important to remember when assessing the goals of the attacks is that terror is still the primary motive for Russia.
Why did the Russians start to use Kinzhals actively?
On the one hand, they are indeed more active, but on the other hand, they are also analyzing the effectiveness of these missiles. That is, if they assessed that the 10 Kinzhals launched last time did not achieve their goal, then obviously, this time, they at least refrained from throwing them at places where there are Patriot SAMs or other systems that are likely to destroy ballistic missiles. This is also a risk for the Russians as arms manufacturers and distributors. There are already several criminal cases against them. This may be one of the reasons.
We cannot allow a situation where Ukraine will have nothing to shoot down ballistic missiles with
Recently, the New York Times suggested that the United States will not be able to provide Ukraine with ammunition for the Patriot for long. Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat has already denied this information, but he also noted that the shortage of missiles is a permanent phenomenon.
I will say this. For the majority of Ukrainian citizens who have no way of influencing this situation, it is first and foremost important not to react emotionally to every such report, even in very reputable publications. We cannot do anything about it. For those who are supposed to respond to and communicate this, one thing is that we cannot allow a situation where Ukraine will have nothing to shoot down ballistic missiles with. Regarding the Patriot, we must do everything possible actively and proactively. In addition to the objective reasons why supplies are limited, there are many subjective ones. That is, the situation is not as hopeless as it may sometimes seem.
Recently, the United States has stated that Russia is likely to use North Korean missiles to fire at Ukraine. There has already been a statement from the spokesman for the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office, Dmytro Chubenko, about the similarity between the elements of the missile that the Russians launched at Kharkiv and those of North Korea. The Air Force has yet to confirm this information officially. In this case, the primary consideration is that when evidence is provided that these missiles originated from North Korea, this data should not be questioned. The stakes of the issue are severe. If Russia has purchased missiles from North Korea, which is almost apparent today, then this violates the UN Security Council sanctions that Russia itself voted for.
That is, the evidence must be absolutely indisputable. Evidence, facts, not just photos, but parts of these missiles. If Russia can question this (and if we give them grounds to do so), it will be even harder to prove Russia's involvement in sanctions violations in the following cases.

KYIV (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited wartime Kyiv on Friday to sign a new security agreement and announce an increase in military funding for Ukraine to buy drones, including surveillance, long-range strike and sea drones.
Britain, one of Ukraine's closest allies during President Vladimir Putin's Russian invasion, will increase its support in the next financial year to 2.5 billion pounds ($3.19 billion), an increase of 200 million pounds on the previous two years, Sunak said.
""Our opponents around the world believe that we have neither the patience nor resources for long wars. So waver now, and we embolden not just Putin, but his allies in North Korea, Iran and elsewhere,"" Sunak told a press conference.
His trip comes at an important juncture for Kyiv in the nearly two-year-old war. Political infighting in the United States and European Union has held up two major packages of assistance.
Kyiv has relied heavily on military and financial aid from the West since the Russian invasion in February 2022.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the press conference he felt vital U.S. financial assistance would also materialise and that he felt more positive now than last month.
The two leaders signed what Zelenskiy described as an ""unprecedented security agreement"" - an arrangement the Ukrainian leader said would remain in place until Kyiv joined the NATO military alliance.
""This is not simply a declaration,"" Zelenskiy wrote on social media platform X.
In his nightly video address, the president praised the agreement as a ""very serious and modern accord"" providing help with weapons, intelligence, and cyber know-how, as well as sanctions and other punitive actions against Russia.
It was, he suggested, similar to Israel's longstanding relations with the United States.
""Many have heard about exemplary security agreements of the 20th century between the United States and Israel, as well as some other similar agreements,"" Zelenskiy said.
""Now we have formed such an example for our time - it is what gives us confidence now as we defend ourselves against Russian aggression.""
Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a senior Putin ally, warned on Friday that Moscow would regard any move by Britain to deploy a military contingent to Ukraine as a declaration of war against Russia.
SUPPORT FROM LONDON
Zelenskiy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the agreement set out the support that London would continue to provide, including intelligence sharing, medical and military training, and defence industrial cooperation.
The UK-Ukraine Agreement on Security Cooperation follows an earlier agreement by the Group of Seven nations to provide Ukraine with bilateral security guarantees.
Ukrainian lawmakers posted short video clips of Sunak addressing members of parliament in Kyiv and receiving a standing ovation.
""We meet today at a difficult moment in the struggle for Ukraine's freedom. And as always during conflict there will be difficult moments. But we must prepare for this to be a long war,"" Sunak told the lawmakers.
Britain said it would provide the largest delivery of drones to Ukraine from any nation, with most of them expected to be manufactured in Britain.
Ukraine had been fighting for the principles of freedom and democracy for two years, Sunak said in a statement.
""We will stand with Ukraine, in their darkest hours and in the better times to come,"" he said.
