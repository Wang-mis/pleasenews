Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin issued a statement Thursday saying the talks would begin ""in the coming days."" Last August, Iraq and the U.S. committed to the talks, which Austin said would allow a relationship between the two countries to build on the success of Iraq's campaign known as Defeat Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or D-ISIS.
""U.S. military personnel are in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve's mission to advise, assist, and enable the Iraqi security forces in their ongoing fight against ISIS. The United States remains committed to a secure, stable, and sovereign Iraq,"" Austin said.
The U.S. has about 2,500 troops in Iraq tasked with advising and assisting Iraqi security forces as they pursue the remnants of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or Daesh.
A separate statement from Iraq's Foreign Ministry described the talks as an effort to ""initiate the gradual and deliberate reduction"" of U.S. military advisors in Iraq.
The talks will ""formulate a specific and clear timetable that specifies the duration of the presence of international coalition advisors,"" it said.
But what impact the talks will have on the U.S. military footprint in Iraq is unclear.
While some Iraqi government statements seem to suggest a more rapid drawdown of U.S. forces, U.S. officials argue there is no rush.
'There's no timeline set,' Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said, while acknowledging the number of U.S. troops is 'something that this working group is going to take a look at.'
'It will certainly be part of the conversations as it goes forward,' she said. 'But there are certain conditions that have to be met or certain factors that have to be met in order for both Iraq and the United States to feel that we can ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS.'
The announcement on the high-level talks - expected to start sometime in the coming days, according to U.S. defense officials - comes just days after the U.S. launched a series of strikes against Iran-backed militias in Iraq. The U.S. blames them for scores of attacks against American forces in Iraq.
US Strikes Back at Iran-Supported Militants in Iraq
Militia officials have said they are carrying out the strikes in support of Palestinians in Gaza under attack from Israel. But some U.S. officials have characterized them as part of an ongoing push by Iran to evict the U.S. from the region.
There have also been increased tensions between Washington and Baghdad.
Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said in early January that he was determined to 'put an end' to the U.S.-led coalition to defeat IS in Iraq, following a U.S. airstrike that killed an Iran-backed militia leader in the heart of the Iraqi capital.
US Hits Back at Iran-Backed Militia in Iraq
But U.S. officials Thursday denied attacks by the Iran-backed militias were in any way connected to the announcement of the talks.
""It's not connected to recent events,"" a senior U.S. defense official told reporters Thursday, briefing on the condition of anonymity under rules set by the Pentagon.
'If anything, the militia attacks delayed our original plan,' the official said. 'The plan was to proceed later in 2023. Obviously, events in recent weeks have caused everyone to have to attend to other business.'
The prospect of high-level talks dates back to August of last year, when Iraqi Defense Minister Thabit Muhammad al-Abbasi met with Defense Secretary Austin at the Pentagon.
US, Iraq Talking Long-Term Defense Cooperation
At the time, U.S. officials envisioned eventually moving to what they described as a more normal bilateral defense relationship with Baghdad, acknowledging that it would result in a reduction of U.S. forces in Iraq as Iraq's military capabilities grew.
But multiple U.S. officials emphasized when and how that happens remains to be determined, according to U.S. officials, who played down any notion of an abrupt U.S. military pullout.
'Let me be clear. The HMC [Higher Military Commission] meeting is not a negotiation about the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq,' the senior U.S. defense official told reporters during Thursday's briefing.
""Our Iraqi partners have assured us of their commitment,"" the official said. 'We are going to, together with our Iraqi partners, help determine the shape of the future U.S. military presence in Iraq and at the same time ensure an Iraqi-led enduring defeat of ISIS.'
'Beyond that, we won't speculate,' the official said.
The arrangement to defeat the Islamic State terror group, with Iraqi forces in the lead since December 2021, has proven successful, according to the officials. U.S. estimates show IS ranks have been cut to fewer than 1,000 fighters in Iraq while the group's leadership there has been continually degraded by Iraqi forces.
Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse."

""The nation rejoices in the Pran Pratishtha ceremony at the grand Bhagwan Sri Ram Mandir in Ayodhya today.

""Lord Ram is worshipped by millions in our country. Religion is a personal matter. But the RSS/BJP have long made a political project of the temple in Ayodhya.

According to the Yokohama City Fire Bureau, 10 people on board were transported to the hospital, with two moderately injured and eight others slightly injured.
The passenger ship was the 14.98-meter-long Santa Barca. A total of 13 passengers and crew members were on board, according to the Yokohama Coast Guard Office.
The ship had reportedly left the Port of Yokohama for the city of Kawasaki that evening, and was returning to Yokohama when it hit the breakwater."

The Council, which is tasked with validating the constitutionality of laws approved by parliament, threw out all or part of 32 of the law's 86 articles, largely for procedural reasons.
It notably struck down the bulk of clauses introduced by opposition rightwing lawmakers to further toughen the bill during a turbulent parliamentary process.
Read moreFrench court scraps large parts of hardline immigration law as unconstitutional
Opponents of the reform had accused President Emmanuel Macron's government of caving in to pressure from the far right to get the law through parliament.
About 75,000 people took to the streets nationwide over the weekend to protest the proposed legislation, in anticipation of the Constitutional Council's decision.
Below are some of the key measures that were thrown out by the court.
Delayed access to social benefits
The Constitutional Council rejected a key article making it harder for immigrants to access social welfare, which discriminated between French citizens and foreigners.
The proposed legislation made the payment of some social benefits to foreigners conditional on their employment status.
Immigrants without a job would have had to wait five years before receiving monthly rent assistance, known as APL, while those in employment would have waited three months.
The measure was seen as a major concession to the French far right and parts of the conservative Les Republicains, who want French citizens to enjoy priority status when it comes to social welfare.
Migration quotas
The Council also rejected the introduction of migration ""quotas"", which would have capped the number of immigrants accepted in France - excluding asylum seekers - over a three-year period.
This measure had been recognised as unconstitutional by Macron's own ruling coalition. It nevertheless agreed to add it to the revised bill in order to win the support of Les Republicains, while hoping the Constitutional Council would strike it down.
The move prompted critics to accuse Macron of seeking to pass the buck onto the Constitutional Council by submitting legislation he knew was contrary to France's basic law.
Family reunification
The top court also threw out a deeply divisive measure making it harder for immigrants to bring their families to France.
The bill stipulated that immigrants needed to prove they had resided in France for 24 months - up from the current 18 months - before applying to bring their families to France.
It also required applicants to provide evidence of a ""regular"" income and of French health insurance for each member of the family.
Such requirements would have been impossible to meet, Green lawmaker Melanie Vogel argued during parliamentary debates in November.
""If the family of a foreigner is not in France, they are not going to be affiliated to its social security and their private insurance in their country of origin will not be valid in France,"" she said.

Nikolay Kharitonov, the Communist candidate for president of Russia, has endorsed a referendum to make St. Petersburg Leningrad again and vowed to give Volgograd its old name - Stalingrad.
Kharitonov is challenging the incumbent President Vladimir Putin in the March 17 election, on behalf of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF). He was asked about the city names at a press conference on Monday.
""You elect me, the very next day I will take up that issue,"" Kharitonov said. All of Russia should decide on the naming of St. Petersburg in a referendum, he explained, adding that the Stalingrad issue didn't even need a debate.
""Volgograd, the city where the back of the fascist vermin was finally broken, should return the name Stalingrad without any further discussion!"" he said.
His comments came a day after the 100th anniversary of the death of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union whose name was bestowed on the former northern capital from 1924 to 1991.

Saint Petersburg (City of St. Peter) was founded in 1703 by Russian Emperor Peter the Great. The original Dutch spelling of its name was Sankt-Pieter-Burch, but swiftly shifted to the more Germanic Sankt Petersburg. In 1914, Emperor Nicholas II had it renamed Petrograd - a translation first used by the legendary poet Alexander Pushkin almost a century earlier - amid a tide of anti-German feelings triggered by the First World War.
Following the 1917 October Revolution, the northern capital first became Red Petrograd, and then Leningrad, as it was known during the USSR. Its original Germanic-sounding name was restored in 1991, but the Soviet moniker lives on in the surrounding Leningrad Region.
The story of Stalingrad is somewhat different. Lenin's heir Joseph Stalin had commanded the Bolshevik units that took the city - then known as Tsaritsyn - during the Russian Civil War, so it was renamed in his honor in 1925. In 1942-43 it became the site of the fiercest battle of the Second World War, and the total defeat of the Wehrmacht's 6th Army.
Stalin's successor Nikita Khrushchev changed the city's name to Volgograd in 1961, as part of the ""de-Stalinization"" campaign in the USSR. Since 1991, there have been multiple petitions to rename it either Tsaritsyn or Stalingrad again.
In 2013, the local authorities allowed the use of ""Hero City Stalingrad"" on nine specific dates every year, including the start and end dates of the Battle of Stalingrad (August 23 and February 2), the anniversary of the Soviet 'Operation Uranus' counteroffensive (November 19), the anniversary of the Nazi invasion (June 28), and Victory Day (May 9).

Aoba, now 45 years old, admitted setting the fire at the anime studio Kyoto Animation after spreading gasoline on the ground floor.
In addition to those killed, the attack also injured 32 people.
Aoba believed the studio had stolen ideas from a contest entry he submitted. The company denied those claims. He was also badly burned in the fire and appeared in court in a wheelchair.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for an ""urgent"" vaccine campaign to combat measles outbreaks across Europe, after registering over 42,000 infections last year.
The agency's European branch sounded alarms over the surge in cases in a press release published on Tuesday, noting that Kazakhstan has been among the hardest-hit nations.
""As in other countries of the region, the virus is spreading rapidly and the outbreak is attributed largely to an accumulation of susceptible children who missed routine immunization doses during the Covid-19 pandemic; 65% of the reported measles cases in Kazakhstan have been children under 5 years of age,"" the statement said, adding that Kazakh authorities were implementing ""extensive outbreak response measures,"" including a major vaccination campaign.
WHO Europe went on to note that more than 42,000 measles cases had been registered across 41 countries in 2023 - a massive increase over the 941 cases reported in all of 2022.
In a previous notice issued in December, the health body called for ""urgent action"" to address the outbreak, with the WHO's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, stressing that vaccines must be a top priority for any mitigation efforts.
""Vaccination is the only way to protect children from this potentially dangerous disease. Urgent vaccination efforts are needed to halt transmission and prevent further spread,"" he said. ""It is vital that all countries are prepared to rapidly detect and timely respond to measles outbreaks, which could endanger progress towards measles elimination.""
The rapid rise in measles infections is largely the result of a ""backsliding in vaccination coverage"" during the Covid-19 pandemic, which ""significantly impacted immunization system performance"" in Europe, according to the WHO. Children have accounted for much of the drop in vaccinations, with over 1.8 million infants missing their measles shots between 2020 and 2022.
To roll back the outbreak, the agency recommended that countries achieve at least 95% coverage with standard two-dose measles vaccines. In 2022, second dose coverage had dropped to just 91%.
Caused by a highly contagious airborne virus, measles symptoms typically include coughing and fever, and in rare cases can lead to brain inflammation, pneumonia, blindness and even death. Though palliative treatments are available to reduce the severity of symptoms, and vaccinations have led to major reductions in global infections in recent decades, there is currently no cure for the illness.

It represents the concluding segment of the journey, spanning from the distribution center to the customer's front door. This pivotal phase possesses the potential to either enhance or jeopardize the entire delivery ordeal. Swift and efficient product delivery to the customer is paramount, but it's equally crucial to ensure profitability while upholding top-tier customer satisfaction and fostering loyalty. Within this blog post, we will delve into the economics of last-mile delivery and present strategies for optimizing profitability while ensuring customer contentment.
Understanding the Last Mile Challenge
The last mile of delivery is often the most complex and costly part of the entire supply chain. It involves several unique challenges:
Proximity to the Customer: The last mile is, by definition, the closest to the customer. This means that any delays, mistakes, or issues in this phase are highly visible and can have a significant impact on customer satisfaction.
Diverse Delivery Locations: Deliveries can range from densely populated urban areas to remote rural locations, each with its own set of challenges and costs.
Traffic and Congestion: Urban areas often suffer from traffic congestion and limited parking, making deliveries more time-consuming and costly.
Customer Expectations: Customers now expect faster and more convenient delivery options, putting pressure on businesses to meet these demands.
Returns and Failed Deliveries: Handling returns and failed deliveries adds additional costs and complexity to last-mile operations.
Balancing Profitability and Customer Loyalty
Balancing profitability and customer loyalty in last-mile delivery requires a strategic approach. Here are key strategies to achieve this delicate balance:
Efficient Routing and Optimization
Efficiency stands at the forefront of last-mile delivery. Employing state-of-the-art route planning and optimization software becomes imperative to curtail driving distances, cut down on fuel consumption, and, consequently, drive down operational expenses. Furthermore, this meticulous route optimization not only results in cost savings but also plays a pivotal role in adhering to precise delivery timeframes, thus elevating overall customer satisfaction levels. Working with expert courier companies can be beneficial as they will have expert knowledge and will have solved all the problems before you. You can click here to learn more about such companies.
Use of Technology and Automation
Harnessing technology is pivotal for streamlining operations. Incorporating GPS tracking and digital signatures and providing real-time updates to customers enhances transparency and efficiency. Moreover, automation, such as deploying drones and autonomous vehicles in suitable contexts, not only trims labor costs but also amplifies operational efficiency significantly. Embracing these tech-driven solutions is essential for staying competitive and meeting the evolving demands of the modern delivery landscape.
Local Warehousing and Micro-Fulfillment Centers
Contemplating the establishment of local warehousing and micro-fulfillment centers in proximity to customers can be a strategic move. This approach facilitates swifter delivery times, curtails transportation expenditures, and optimizes the entire order processing system. By having goods stored closer to the end-users, you're poised to enhance the overall efficiency of your delivery operations while bolstering customer satisfaction. It's a solution that aligns perfectly with the evolving dynamics of the e-commerce and last-mile delivery landscape.
Collaboration and Shared Services
Fostering collaborations with other businesses or embracing shared services can revolutionize your approach to last-mile delivery. By teaming up with partners, you can strategically optimize delivery routes and distribute costs more efficiently. Shared delivery services or partnerships with local retailers, for instance, present opportunities to collectively tackle the expenses associated with last-mile delivery. Such synergistic efforts can be a win-win solution, driving down costs while maintaining high service standards.
Dynamic Pricing and Delivery Fees
Implementing dynamic pricing strategies and transparent delivery fees that accurately represent the real delivery costs can be a game-changer. Additionally, offering complimentary or reduced delivery charges to high-value or loyal customers through loyalty programs strikes a delicate balance between profitability and customer incentives. These dynamic pricing tactics not only contribute to sustainable profitability but also enhance customer retention and satisfaction, creating a win-win scenario for your last-mile delivery operations.
Visibility and Communication
Empowering customers with real-time visibility into their deliveries is a paramount aspect of modern last-mile delivery. Keeping them well-informed about delivery windows and enabling order tracking fosters transparency and reliability. This seamless communication not only mitigates potential frustrations but also cultivates trust and loyalty among customers. By prioritizing customer experience in this manner, you create a solid foundation for lasting relationships and continued business growth.
Returns Management
Effective returns management is integral to cost reduction. By providing customers with user-friendly returns procedures and exploring partnerships with local return drop-off points, you can streamline the returns process while minimizing associated expenses. Simplifying returns not only enhances customer satisfaction but also optimizes your last-mile delivery operations, making them more efficient and cost-effective.
Eco-Friendly Initiatives
Delving into eco-friendly delivery solutions, such as electric or hybrid vehicles, not only curbs fuel costs and emissions but also aligns with the growing environmental consciousness of customers. Embracing sustainability not only supports cost efficiency but also strengthens brand loyalty by demonstrating a commitment to responsible business practices.
Customer-Centric Solutions
Customizing last-mile delivery solutions to align with customer preferences is pivotal. By providing flexible delivery time slots, same-day delivery options, and alternative delivery locations like lockers or pickup points, you can cater to a wide range of customer requirements and enhance their overall satisfaction. This adaptability in your delivery services underscores your commitment to meeting the diverse needs of your clientele.
Data Analysis and Continuous Improvement
Frequent scrutiny of delivery data is crucial for identifying bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for enhancement within your last-mile operations. This ongoing optimization process not only contributes to cost reduction but also elevates the overall quality of service, reinforcing your competitive edge in the dynamic realm of last-mile delivery.
Conclusion
The last mile of delivery is a crucial component of the modern supply chain. It presents unique challenges but also offers opportunities for businesses to differentiate themselves and build customer loyalty. By implementing efficient routing, embracing technology and automation, and focusing on customer-centric solutions, companies can maximize profitability while exceeding customer expectations. Balancing profitability and customer loyalty in last-mile delivery is not only possible but also essential for long-term success in today's competitive marketplace.

0FZRRVKX28_RD8DXXMR8MSA03U,Attacks on Lebanon-Israel Border Prompt Warnings of Escalation,"Voice of America 25th January 2024, 05:06 GMT+11","Voice of America 25th January 2024, 05:06 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105326/attacks-on-lebanon-israel-border-prompt-warnings-of-escalation,"AMMAN, JORDAN - Continuing retaliatory attacks and targeted assassinations along the Lebanon-Israel border are prompting warnings of an escalation that could unleash a wider conflict in the region.
Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militia said it targeted Israel's northern army command Mount Meron base Tuesday, its second such attack on the post in recent days. Later Tuesday, Israeli warplanes fired missiles at Lebanon's southern districts of Bint Jbeil, Nabatieh and Iqlim al-Tuffah, destroying homes and wounding several people, Lebanon's National News Agency reported.
The border skirmishes have forced citizens on both sides to move further inland for safety.
Lebanon's caretaker foreign minister, Abdullah Bou Habib, in remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York this week, linked the retaliatory aerial bombings to the war in Gaza.
""It is minor fighting, and I don't think the intention is to have a big war,"" he said. ""It also has to do with what's going on in Gaza - it's not acceptable Arab-wise, it's not acceptable world-wise.""
However, analyst Dania Koleilat Khatib points to Israel's increasing use of targeted assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders in Lebanon, such as Wissam al-Tawil and Saleh Arouri, as potential triggers for a wider conflict with Hezbollah.
Khatib, president of the Research Center for Cooperation and Peace Building in Beirut, told VOA that Hezbollah is ""poking"" Israel but doesn't want an escalation. However, she said an escalation is possible if the United States does not rein in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
""I think the Israeli army doesn't want to go to Lebanon because they know they cannot win,"" she said. ""They can destroy Beirut, but they cannot destroy Hezbollah. But I see it escalating unless there is U.S. pressure.""
Professor Filippo Dionigi of the University of Bristol in Britain told the France 24 TV network that Israel's targeted assassinations have gone beyond the ""rules of engagement.""
""The other possibility is error, is over-shooting, involving citizens to a greater [degree] than they're already involved,"" he said. ""That can create unwanted consequences on both sides of the conflict and therefore open the possibility of a greater escalation and even a possibility of an all-out war.""
Other observers say that Lebanon's dire economic crisis means there is little appetite for war with Israel and that Hezbollah would risk a significant public backlash.
Tobias Borck, a researcher at the Royal United Services Institute in London, warned in Britain's MailOnline, as the Gaza war continues, ""I think the risk of something going wrong compounds the longer this goes on."""

Among various generic sinners engulfed in the flames of hell is a clear depiction of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin pleading with three angels as they cast him into damnation.
A fresco inside a church in Sujuna. Lenin is visible at lower center of the image.
The image is one of several paintings of Soviet leaders in churches that have come to light since a recent uproar broke out over the depiction of Josef Stalin inside Tbilisi's cathedral.
The detail of the artwork featuring Lenin's damnation
Davit Khidasheli was one of a group of artists who painted the interior of the Sujuna church in the 1990s, soon after Georgia regained its independence after 70 years of atheist Soviet rule. The icon painter told RFE/RL's Georgian Service the depiction of Lenin represents the Godlessness of the political system that 'sacrificed millions of people and stifled the development of society.'
Icon painter Davit Khidasheli
RFE/RL's Georgian Service has identified more examples of explicit anti-Soviet paintings inside several churches across the Caucasus country.
In a church in an eastern suburb of Tbilisi named after monk Gabriel Urgebadze, an interior painting depicts a famous historical protest in which Urgebadze set fire to a giant propaganda poster of Vladimir Lenin during a parade in Tbilisi in 1965. The monk died in 1995 and was designated a saint in 2012.
A fresco depicts Georgian monk Gabriel Urgebadze setting fire to a banner of Vladimir Lenin.
Other Orthodox Christians in Georgia have been less willing to include likenesses of Soviet leaders. In 2022, painter Tea Intskirveli was asked to replicate Urgebadze's iconic poster-burning scene on an icon but her clients later asked her to obscure Lenin's face.
Before and after versions of the same icon show how Lenin's likeness was hidden in the final painting.
'When you represent a story about the burning of an effigy of Lenin, it's necessary to show what is burning, and what the hero of the story did. But I'm answerable to the congregation,' Intskirveli told RFE/RL's Georgian Service. The painter obscured the Soviet founder's face with fire.
Another political-religious painting has been slightly adapted from its original. A mural inside the cathedral of Rustavi, near Tbilisi, is almost identical to the Sujuna painting featuring Lenin, but also includes the ethnic Georgian Stalin.

Icon painter Davit Khidasheli says painting the communist rulers was the idea of the artists themselves and the head of the cathedral was not paying close attention to who was being depicted. But he says a parishioner in Rustavi spotted Stalin being painted and begged the young artists not to continue.

'A virtuous lady came and fell to her knees crying, asking us not to paint [Stalin]. Her request was understandable, she had certain feelings about Stalin,' Khidasheli said. 'We partially acquiesced and changed his face. But you can at least recognize him by his moustache.'
A detail of an icon inside Tbilisi's Holy Trinity Cathedral shows St. Matrona of Moscow with an image of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
After the recent uproar over the depiction of Stalin inside Tbilisi's cathedral, the icon was defaced, then eventually removed. It is reportedly being repainted and will be returned to display in the cathedral without Stalin.
Georgia is not the only formerly communist country whose artists have cast their former leaders into figurative hell. In Montenegro, an anonymous fresco painter depicted Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito suffering damnation inside Podgorica's Church of Resurrection alongside socialist godheads Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.

The church faced some criticism for mixing politics with faith when the painting was unveiled in 2014, but a church leader at the time told journalists the trio 'personify communist evil in the Balkans' and added that the artist should be 'allowed the freedom to see things as he wishes.'

Efforts to recruit Russians on X (formerly known as Twitter) are unlikely to be successful in attracting potential CIA assets, since the platform is blocked in the country, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.
On Monday, the US Central Intelligence Agency released a three-minute video in Russian appealing to the country's citizens to tell the ""truth"" to American intelligence officials about what is really happening there. Doing so will help their motherland prosper and have a secure future, the video claimed.
Commenting on the video on Tuesday, Peskov noted that attempting to reach out to a Russian audience is ""a common practice"" for intelligence agencies.
""Numerous secret services across the world quite often resort to mass media, and social networks to recruit new agents,"" he said, adding that the CIA is no exception.
However, the spokesman added: ""someone should have told the CIA that VKontakte [social media network] is much more popular in our country than X,"" which has been blocked since March 2022 for discriminating against Russian media and allegedly spreading false information about the Ukraine conflict.
According to data provided by VKontakte, as of June 2023, its monthly audience was around 107 million people, of which 84 million are from Russia. Although similar statistics are not available for X, as of 2024, the number of users from Russia on the platform was estimated at about 767,000, according to the World Population Review analytical company.
In May 2023, the CIA created a Telegram channel where it shared instructions on how Russians could secretly get in touch with the intelligence agency. In November 2022, David Marlowe, the CIA's deputy director of operations, said that the US was ""open for business"" with Russians who disapprove of Moscow's actions against Ukraine.

As its consistent position, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) respects and supports the one-China principle, said ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn, noting that the above position has been expressed by ASEAN many times before.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia noted that ""Malaysia has always, and will continue, to adhere to the 'one-China Policy' that has been the basis of this strong and mutually-beneficial partnership.""
The Arab Parliament reiterated its position on supporting the one-China principle, and its opposition to the so-called ""Taiwan independence"" and interference in the internal affairs of China.
Stressing that the one-China principle is well-established in the foreign policy of the Arab side, the parliament said it has always firmly adhered to this position.
Backing China's legitimate rights to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the parliament noted that the recent elections that took place in the Taiwan region will not affect the Arab side's adherence to the one-China principle.
Beninese Foreign Minister Shegun Adjadi Bakari said that the Beninese government always adheres to the one-China principle, supports the principle of non-interference in internal affairs and firmly supports China's efforts to safeguard regional peace and stability.
Malawian Foreign Minister Nancy Tembo said that the Malawian government reiterates its adherence to the one-China principle and opposes interference in China's internal affairs.
Cote d'Ivoire's position on the Taiwan question is clear and definite: there is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is part of China, said President of Cote d'Ivoire Alassane Ouattara, noting that Cote d'Ivoire would continue to abide by the one-China principle.
Fernando Miguel, director of the Office of the Ministry of External Relations of Angola, said that the one-China principle is the cornerstone of China-Angola relations.
Angola firmly upholds the one-China principle, opposes all ""Taiwan independence"" separatist activities, opposes external interference in China's internal affairs, and supports the just cause of the Chinese people for national reunification, he said.
Stressing that the Taiwan regional election outside the framework of ""one country, two systems"" is not in the interests of all Chinese people, and that the Democratic Progressive Party is a separatist party endangering global stability and the future of Taiwan, Eswatini's largest opposition party, the People's United Democratic Movement, condemned the Eswatini government for maintaining so-called ""diplomatic relations"" with a Chinese province, and appreciates the right choice of the Nauru government to ""sever diplomatic relations"" with the Taiwan authorities.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that the Irish government has always adhered to the one-China principle and hoped that China could realize peaceful reunification at an early date.
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Barbados Kerrie Symmonds said that since the establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries, the Barbados side has always adhered to the one-China principle universally recognized by the international community, which means there is only one China in the world.
Barbados only recognizes and maintains diplomatic relations with the government of the People's Republic of China, and Taiwan is part of China, Symmonds said.
The Barbados government firmly adheres to the one-China principle and believes that China will eventually be reunified, Symmonds stressed.
Yeidckol Polevnsky, president of the Mexico-China Friendship Group of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies, member of the Chamber of Deputies, and former general secretary of the ruling National Regeneration Movement party of Mexico, said that there is only one China in the world, and the one-China principle has been confirmed by the United Nations and supported by the overwhelming majority of countries.
Taiwan is not a country, and it is an integral part of China's territory, Polevnsky said.
Cyprus, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Grenada and other countries, as well as the Bolivia-China Friendship Association, have also expressed their continued adherence to the one-China principle by various means."

""In the 2024 Lok Sabha election...AAP will get 13 seats (in Punjab),"" Mann said at a media briefing.
Mann's remarks came amid seat-sharing talks between AAP and Congress for the Lok Sabha polls, expected in April-May this year. The two parties have reportedly paused seat-sharing talks in the border state.
Mann's remarks are being seen as a setback to the seat-sharing talks between the two parties. Punjab has 13 Lok Sabha seats. Both AAP and Trinamool Congress are part of the INDIA bloc.
The AAP leader was asked about West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's remarks that her party Trinamool Congress would fight the Lok Sabha polls alone.
Mamata Banerjee said earlier in the day that the made by the party had not been accepted and Trinamool Congress would fight it alone in West Bengal.
""I had no discussions with the Congress party. I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we will alone will defeat BJP. I gave many proposals but they rejected them from the beginning. From then, we have decided to fight the elections in Bengal alone"" the TMC supremo said.
The Bengal Chief Minister also claimed she had not been informed of Rahul Gandhi's Nyay Yatra passing through Bengal.
""They did not even bother to inform me that they will be coming to West Bengal as a matter of courtesy even though I am a part of the INDIA bloc. So there is no with relation with me as far as Bengal is concerned"" Mamata Banerjee said""We will decide on what to do at the all-India level. We are a secular party. We will do whatever we can to defeat the BJP. The alliance does not comprise any one party. We have said that they should fight in some states and the regional parties should be left to fight alone in the other states. They should not interfere"" she added.
Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has continued to attack the Bengal Chief Minister.
In a news conference on Tuesday Adhir Chowdhury claimed that in the 2011 elections, Mamata Banerjee came to power with the mercy of Congress.
""This time, the elections will not be fought at the mercy of Mamata Banerjee. The Congress defeated the BJP and TMC in the two seats that Mamata Banerjee is leaving. The Congress party knows how to contest the elections. Mamta Banerjee is an opportunist; she came to power in 2011, with the mercy of Congress,"" the Congress MP said.
Rahul Gandhi who is in Assam as part of his Nyay Yatra tried to contain the damage by insisting that he had a good relationship with the TMC supremo.
""The negotiations on seat-sharing is underway, I don't want to comment here. But Mamata Banerjee is very close to me and our party. Sometimes our leaders say something, their leaders say something, and it goes on. It's a natural thing. Such comments won't matter and these are not things that are going to disrupt things,"" Rahul Gandhi said on Tuesday.
The Trinamool Congress reportedly was willing to offer the Congress two to three Lok Sabha seats of the 42 seats in Bengal. In the 2019 elections, the Congress had won two Lok Sabha seats while the TMC had won 22 seats. (ANI)"

These moves were intended to degrade the Houthis' capability to continue their attacks on commercial and naval vessels sailing in the Red Sea, Bab-Al-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Aden, the command said.

""Republicans have been trying to push nonpartisan and Democratic voters to participate in their primary. What a bunch of malarkey,"" says the digitally altered Biden voice, which appears to be AI-generated.
""We know the value of voting Democratic when our votes count. It's important that you save your vote for the November election. We'll need your help in electing Democrats up and down the ticket. Voting this Tuesday only enables the Republicans in their quest to elect Donald Trump again,"" it added.
The application rates the number of calls, which were first reported by NBC News, as ""severe,"" among its highest ratings for calls.
Nomorobo CEO Aaron Foss said that their data showed that 76 per cent of the robocalls targeted New Hampshire, with 12 per cent directed at Boston and the remaining 12 per cent covering other areas. They estimated that the number of these fraudulent calls ranged from 5,000 to 25,000.
Notably, Biden's name will not appear on the ballot in the upcoming New Hampshire primary on Tuesday over a dispute between the state and the Democratic National Committee, which voted to move the New Hampshire primary out of its traditional first-in-the-nation position. As a result, there is an organised effort to write in Biden's name, CNN reported.
""This matter has already been referred to the New Hampshire Attorney General, and the campaign is actively discussing additional actions to take immediately. Spreading disinformation to suppress voting and deliberately undermine free and fair elections will not stand, and fighting back against any attempt to undermine our democracy will continue to be a top priority for this campaign,"" Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden's campaign manager, said in a statement.
Aaron Jacobs, a spokesperson for Write-In Biden, said in a statement, ""This is deep fake disinformation designed to harm Joe Biden, suppress votes, and damage our democracy,"" adding that the group remains ""focused on one goal until polls close on Tuesday: encouraging Granite Staters to write-in Joe Biden.""At the end of the call, the voice of an unknown male directs listeners to call a local New Hampshire number to be removed from future calls.
The call uses spoofing -- a common practice in fraudulent robocalling which manipulates caller ID information to display a false phone number -- obscuring the true identity of the caller, CNN reported. (ANI)"

Brought on by pressure from environmental groups, the ban creates a no-fishing zone from Finistere, in the west of Brittany, all the way down to the Spanish border.
It was ordered by the Council of State, France's top administrative court, and will run until 20 February.
Proponents hope the measure will reduce the number of cetaceans, which are protected in EU waters, from drowning in fishing nets and becoming stranded on Atlantic beaches.
The French government has promised to compensate the fishing industry, which estimates the ban could cost up to 60 million euros.
9,000 deaths a year
The non-profit Pelagis marine observatory says dolphins' principal cause of death is becoming entangled in fishing gear.
The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea estimates that 9,000 dolphins die each year off the French Atlantic coast. Though, according to Sea Shepherd France, another NGO, the toll is probably much higher than reported.
High mortality rates in wintertime in the Bay of Biscay are decimating populations, says the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA).
For the survival of the species, the council says existing populations cannot survive another winter of normal fishing risks.
French health chiefs ban Bordeaux oysters amid norovirus scare Surge in number of dolphin deaths sparks call for halt to Atlantic fishing
Since 2019, a group of NGOs have pressured the French government to take more productive steps to protect dolphins.
""France has repeatedly failed to introduce robust measures to prevent these deaths, despite being legally obliged to do so,"" says EIA ocean campaigner Sarah Dolman.
In March last year, the Council of State promised the closure of some fisheries to lower deaths on the Atlantic coast, including month-long winter bans in 2024, 2025 and 2026.
Dolman says the no-fishing zones are ""great news for common dolphins"", adding that ""the issue in Biscay is urgent, as it is in other regions of Europe. Fisheries closures happen due to a lack of adequate action"".
Industry opposition
The National Fisheries Committee labelled the measures ""extremist"", saying the common dolphin was ""not in danger"" in the Bay of Biscay.
The ban, which affects boats longer than eight metres, will force an estimated 500 French vessels to dock.
""It's absurd to stop businesses like that for a month,"" Raymond Millet, a fisher from La Rochelle, told the AFP news agency.
Breton shipowners were promised compensation of around 80 percent of their turnover. The French government also said it would provide ""partial unemployment measures and specific aid, if necessary"".
Franck Lalande, a boat owner in Arcachon, said the compensation payments were insufficient.
Another boat owner, Thibault Georget, from Concarneau, said: ""They want to bleed us. We are in the process of killing small coastal fisheries and things are getting out of hand. We are here to work, to earn our bread.""
It is the first time fishing industry workers have been confined to port since 1945.
Local authorities have countered threats to sidestep bans by saying they will intensify patrols.
Philippe Garcia, head of Protection of Aquatic Environments, said it was counterproductive for the fisherfolk to not ""play along"".
The EIA said that while European governments had ""much more to do"" to bring down fishing-caused marine deaths, the new ban is a step in the right direction.

Britain was ""dead right"" to leave the European Union and Germany could end up following suit, Alternative for Germany (AfD) leader Alice Weidel has said. Weidel's right-wing faction has become the country's second-largest party, despite left-wing protests and rumors of an impending ban.
In an interview with the Financial Times published on Monday, Weidel said that an AfD-led government would seek to reform the EU to wrest back national sovereignty from the ""unelected executive"" that is the European Commission. Should this fail, she said that she would ""let the people decide"" whether or not the country would stay in the union, ""just as Britain did.""
The UK's 2016 Brexit referendum is ""a model for Germany, that one can make a sovereign decision like that,"" she added.
The AfD has long called for the ""orderly dissolution of the EU,"" but dropped this language from its latest policy document, published last summer. The new paper describes the EU as a ""failed project,"" and calls for the bloc to be reformed as a ""federation of European nations,"" with all EU laws that supersede national law to be scrapped.
The AfD opposes the EU's migrant resettlement quotas, its environmental policies, its military reliance on the US, and its embargo on Russian fossil fuel imports.
Since its inception in 2013, the AfD has become best known for its hardline stance on immigration. If elected, Weidel told the Financial Times that her party would ""introduce effective border controls ... and immediately deport foreign criminals.""
This position saw the AfD surge in support after former Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the country to more than one million non-European migrants in 2015. The party is now polling at around 23%, eight points ahead of Chancellor Olaf Scholz' Social Democrats (SPD) and second only to Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).
Scholz' party has reacted to this rise with panic. After it emerged last week that some AfD lawmakers met with Austrian right-wing activist Martin Sellner last year to discuss the potential ""remigration"" of criminal and ""non-assimilated"" immigrants from Germany, more than two dozen Social Democrat parliamentarians urged the government to ban the AfD over its allegedly ""extremist"" positions.
A parliament-funded watchdog group called for such a ban last year, while a court in Cologne ruled in 2022 that Germany's domestic intelligence agency could legally place the party under surveillance.
Over the weekend, left-wing groups marshaled hundreds of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets of Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, and other major cities to protest against the party.
These protests will not stop the ""inevitable"" participation of the AfD in government, Weidel told the Financial Times. However, while the party may score some wins in upcoming state elections this year, she said that the refusal of Germany's major parties to work with the AfD will likely prevent it from coming to power in Berlin until the federal election after next in 2029.
The center-right CDU will be the first party to abandon its boycott, Weidel predicted. Elections in the state of Hesse last year proved ""that we can form a clear right-wing majority. And the CDU can't refuse to accept that in the long term,"" she said.

Speaking to ANI, the Deputy CM said that the world was waiting for this day.
""After 500 years of struggle, finally, the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Lalla is going to be done at his birthplace today...The world was waiting for this day. The amount of happiness is difficult to be expressed in words..."" teary-eyed Maurya said.
The 'Pran Pratistha' of Ram Lalla is scheduled for Paush Shukla Kurma Dwadashi, Vikram Samvat 2080, which falls today, January 22.
The ceremony will witness the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, Governor Anandiben Patel, and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, among other dignitaries.
People from all walks of life, including representatives of various tribal communities, will also attend the ceremony. The Prime Minister will address the gathering on occasion.
The ceremony is being held after the first phase of the temple's construction, made possible by a Supreme Court judgement in 2019 on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit. The Hindu litigants argued that the Babri Mosque was constructed at the site of a temple marking the birthplace of Lord Ram. In 1992, the 16th-century mosque was demolished by ""kar sevaks"".
Maurya further said that people were overwhelmed by the event, except a few.
Notably, Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Mallikarjun Kharge, and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury ""respectfully"" declined the invitation extended by the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple Trust to attend the 'Pran Prathista' ceremony.
The UP Deputy CM also said that the arrival of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Ayodhya, who has held an 11-day special ritual for the ceremony, is a tribute to the 'kar sevaks' who laid their life during the struggle for the Ram Janmabhoomi.
On January 12, at Kala Ram Mandir in Nashik, PM Modi began an 11-day sacred ceremony, leading up to the consecration of Lord Ram. He initiated the ritual from Nashik Dham, Panchavati, where Lord Ram spent significant time. (ANI)"

The swearing-in event took place at 11 a.m., witnessed by key figures such as National Assembly Chair Rosen Zhelyazkov, Supreme Court of Cassation President Galina Zaharova, and Supreme Administrative Court President Georgi Cholakov.
The new judges replace Grozdan Iliev and Anastas Anastasov, whose terms expired two years ago. However, the ceremony did not include President Rumen Radev, who chose not to attend. In a press release, Radev cited serious suspicions of constitutional violations, deeming it illogical to take an oath against such a backdrop. The president emphasized his refusal to tolerate inconsistencies between words and deeds.
Desislava Atanasova and Borislav Belazelkov secured their positions as Constitutional Court judges through parliamentary support on January 19. Atanasova received 159 votes, while Belazelkov garnered 154.
President Radev contested the constitutionality of the election on January 23, urging the Constitutional Court to rule on the compatibility of the election with constitutional procedures before the new judges were sworn in. The election faced criticism from MPs of Vazrazhdane, There Is Such a People, and BSP.

""Indraprastha Apollo Hospital today announced a pioneering robotic-assisted procedure performed by renowned gynaecological oncologist and robotic surgeon Dr. Pakhee Aggarwal to successfully treat multiple uterine fibroids and abnormal uterine bleeding in a 37-year old patient, while preserving her uterus and thereby her fertility and chances of future pregnancy,"" as per a press release from the Apollo Hospital.
The complex procedure involved robotic excision of several intramural and sub-serosal fibroids, as well as hysteroscopic removal of a large submucosal fibroid protruding into the cervix which was causing heavy bleeding, simultaneously. The surgery involved small incisions, and the use of robotics minimised blood loss.
Advanced robotic techniques were carefully used to stitch the areas of the uterus where fibroids were removed, without causing any damage to the organ. The multi-disciplinary clinical team included gynaecological oncologist and robotic surgeon, Dr Pakhee Aggarwal, anesthetist and consulting physician, Dr LR Sharma. The 4-hour procedure concluded without complications.
Speaking on the path breaking development, Dr Pakhee Aggarwal, Senior Consultant, Gynaecological Oncology and Robotic Surgery said ""Traditionally, patients presenting with abnormal growths both inside and outside the uterus along with heavy uncontrollable bleeding would require highly invasive surgery, often resulting in removal of the uterus itself.
He further said in our patient's case, this would have meant taking away her prospects of getting pregnant in the future, which can detrimentally impact unmarried women both medically and psychosocially. It was the patient's wish to not remove her uterus and we made sure to abide by it. Our state-of-the-art minimally invasive robotic procedure ingeniously enabled tackling all the symptomatic uterine fibroids simultaneously, while retaining and reconstructing the uterus in its entirety using advanced suturing methods.
Thereby we successfully preserved uterine and ovarian function and the possibilities of conception of this 37-year old patient should she plan for pregnancy later on. This truly demonstrates how cutting-edge medical technology when combined with the expertise of seasoned doctors can come up with solutions for even complex gynecological conditions without compromising the future Quality of Life of the patients, Dr Pakhee Aggarwal said.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said Israel's bombardment of Gaza will fuel hatred among Palestinians ""for generations,"" urging the country to wind down its military campaign and find a peaceful path to a two-state solution.
Speaking ahead of an EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting on Monday, Borrell said he would engage Israel's delegation about a ""comprehensive approach"" to peace, including both an end to the conflict, as well as longer-term issues regarding Palestinian statehood.
""What we want to do is to build a two-state solution, so let's talk about it. The way you are naming it is important. So, from now on, I will not talk about the peace process, but about the two-state solution process,"" he said. ""If we are serious about that, we have to study the underlying causes that prevent this solution from being implemented. Certainly, Hamas is one of them - an important one - but there are others.""
The diplomat lamented the dire conditions in the Palestinian enclave, saying the ""humanitarian situation could not be worse"" while noting the rapidly climbing death toll among women and children.
Asked about the Israeli government's current opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state - as was recently reiterated by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - Borrell said further negotiations were needed, also warning of the consequences should the issue not be resolved.
""If they do not agree [about a Palestinian state] we have to discuss. That is why we are here. We have to discuss even if they disagree,"" he continued, asking what alternative Israeli officials had in mind.
""To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill them? 25,000 already in Gaza, 70% women and children. Certainly, the way of trying to destroy Hamas is not the way they are doing, because they are seeding the hate for generations,"" Borrell said.
Though most EU states were quick to support Israel's military response to the deadly Hamas terrorist attack in October, the bloc has gradually grown more critical of the ongoing operation given the immense humanitarian toll. Earlier on Monday, the Financial Times reported that the EU had urged its members to warn Israel of ""consequences"" if it refuses to recognize a Palestinian state, citing an internal document prepared ahead of Monday's foreign policy meeting.
In a video address on Sunday, Netanyahu stated that Israel would not ""surrender"" to Hamas, affirming the previously stated goal of ""eradicating"" the Palestinian armed group. ""I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of the Jordan [River],"" he said.

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has received a setback to his flagship policy of deporting thousands of asylum seekers to Rwanda under an agreement with the East African country. On Monday, the House of Lords voted 214 to 171 in favor of a motion urging parliament not to ratify a bill promoting Rwanda as a safe haven for refugees.
The upper house of the UK Parliament wants the treaty delayed until ministers can demonstrate that Kigali is safe.
The Rwanda plan, which has been stalled by a court ruling, is part of the government's flagship 'stop the boats' policy, which aims to reduce illegal immigration into the UK. Under the plan, immigrants arriving via the English Channel in small boats would be resettled in Rwanda.
Britain signed a new treaty with the Rwandan government to overcome the UK Supreme Court's decision that the plan is unlawful and to address concerns that the African country is unsafe for asylum seekers. The bill seeks to direct judges to disregard sections of the Human Rights Act, as well as domestic and international law provisions, that might classify Rwanda as an unsafe country for deportation. It allows ministers to ignore orders from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to temporarily halt a flight to Rwanda during appeals hearings.
The bill passed the legislative stage in the House of Commons last week, despite opposition from Tory MPs including former home secretary Suella Braverman and ex-immigration minister Robert Jenrick, who proposed tougher amendments.
The upper chamber's vote on Monday, while largely symbolic, is the latest blow to Sunak's desire to see the first deportation flights depart for Rwanda in the coming months, ahead of a general election scheduled for the second half of this year.
""The considerations of international law and national reputation... convince me that it would not be right to ratify this treaty at any time; and arguments from history suggest that it would be very reckless to do so any time soon,"" said John Kerr, a former diplomat who sits in the House of Lords.
The Lords, who are appointed rather than elected, have the authority to delay and amend legislation but cannot overturn the decisions of elected House of Commons members. The House of Lords is expected to debate the bill next week.
Britain has paid Rwanda at least Pound 240 million ($305 million) under the controversial deal reached two years ago, but no asylum seekers have been sent there.
Prime Minister Sunak stated on Thursday that he is prepared to disregard ECHR Rule 39, which imposes a temporary injunction on deportations.

The inferno, which took place at the Yingcai School in Yanshanpu village, was reported to the local fire department at 11:00 p.m. (1500 GMT) Friday and was put out around 40 minutes later, official news agency Xinhua said.
Thirteen students died in the accident, while one other person suffered injuries.
Dozens of police were in and around a cordoned-off area near the school Sunday, AFP journalists witnessed.
An official at the scene told AFP, 'There is an investigation ongoing inside. Nobody can go in.'
Several windows on the side of the school were broken - the only obvious signs of a major accident at the building.
Vertical metal bars covered the school's windows, AFP saw, while a permanent sign on the building's facade read: 'Enter the kindergarten happily and go home happily.'
In a video shared Sunday on Chinese social media site Weibo, a man surnamed Fan - the father of a boy who died in the fire - said that blood samples had been taken from parents to compare their DNA with the victims.
'We parents haven't seen our kids yet... We can only see them when the results are available,' said Fan.
'My kid has been studying very hard,' he added.
'I can't accept it.'
Little information about the boarding school is publicly available, though social media videos published earlier showed young children including kindergarteners wearing smocks with the school's logo as well as older children learning calligraphy.
A teacher at the school told state-run newspaper Hebei Daily that all the victims were from the same third-grade class of nine and 10-year-olds.
Rapid response
On Sunday morning, a row of shops next to the school stood mostly shuttered, while a small clinic in a crumbling courtyard building appeared unattended.
A few locals went about their day and a couple of children played as police cars made loops around the cordoned-off area.
Some people passing by Sunday morning stared at the scene, and one man at an auto workshop across the street told AFP that he had been unaware of the fire until the following morning.
Authorities in the area are investigating the fire's cause, and at least one person linked to the school has been detained, Xinhua reported Saturday.
No official explanation of the precise cause of the deadly blaze has yet been provided, although some domestic media reports suggested it was related to an electric heating device.
Yanshanpu village lies on the outskirts of Nanyang, a city of nearly 10 million people about 850 kilometers (528.2 miles) west of Shanghai.
Nanyang Radio and Television reported Sunday that local officials had held a meeting Saturday to discuss follow-up work for the deadly fire and improving safety measures in the future.
'Life is above all else and a rapid response is necessary,' a readout of the meeting published by Nanyang Radio and Television said.
'Do a good job in dealing with the aftermath, put oneself in the others' shoes, be compassionate, patient and meticulous in giving emotional comfort to families of the victims, lawfully compensate them, and provide relief for those in need,' read the report.
The reason for the fire must be 'quickly identified,' it said, adding that 'relevant duties will be strictly investigated in accordance with the law.'
Fires and other deadly accidents are common in China due to lax safety standards and poor enforcement.
In November, 26 people died and dozens were sent to hospital after a fire at a coal company office in northern China's Shanxi province.
The month before, an explosion at a barbecue restaurant in northwestern China left 31 dead and prompted official pledges of a nationwide campaign to promote workplace safety.
In April, a hospital fire in Beijing killed 29 people and forced desperate survivors to jump out of windows to escape."

The 12th seed Zheng is closing in on ending a decade-long title drought in Grand Slam singles for Chinese players after a 6-4, 6-4 win in one hour and 42 minutes.
Her idol Li Na is the only Chinese player to have won a Grand Slam singles title, having famously triumphed at Roland Garros in 2011 before lifting the trophy at the Australian Open exactly a decade ago.
""It feels unbelievable. I'm super excited to have such a great performance. It's tough to explain my emotions right now,"" said Zheng after her first Grand Slam semifinal.
The 21-year-old Zheng started warm favorite but was wary against No.93 Yastremska, whose giant-killing run in Melbourne included reigning Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic and two-time former tournament winner Victoria Azarenka of Belarus.
After a see-saw start, the Ukrainian was in distress and clutching at her stomach muscle after running for a forehand. She needed a medical timeout after the seventh game, but continued as Zheng took control to take out the first set.
Zheng gained a stranglehold when she broke in the third game of the second set, but failed to capitalize as the unpredictable contest continued. Zheng raised her intensity and crushed Yastremska's resistance to clinch victory on serve as she raised her arms aloft and let out a roar in celebration.
Zheng has impressively built on a breakout season last year, but her quest for a first Grand Slam crown will have to go through the formidable presence of Sabalenka, who has not lost a set in the tournament."

According to a Cabinet press release, this decision reflects the commitment of both nations to deepen bilateral relations and foster a more robust economic partnership.
Currently, there is no bilateral institutional mechanism specifically focused on trade and commerce between India and the Dominican Republic.
The approval for the establishment of JETCO is expected to fill this gap, providing a dedicated platform for discussions, information exchange, and collaboration in various economic sectors.
India's bilateral relations with the Dominican Republic have been characterised by friendship, and the establishment of JETCO is poised to further strengthen these ties.
The two nations engage in trade primarily involving Indian imports of gold from the Dominican Republic and Indian exports of pharmaceuticals, marine products, motor vehicles, two and three-wheelers, among others.
The newly approved protocol for JETCO will serve as a pivotal instrument for fostering dialogue and cooperation between the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industry of the Republic of India, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Dominican Republic.
This committee is envisioned to be a catalyst for discussions, information exchange, and collaboration in various economic sectors, providing a structured framework for economic cooperation.
The Joint Committee aims to facilitate the exchange of information between authorities from both nations, creating a platform for dialogue that can lead to the growth of trade and industry.
By serving as an effective gateway to the larger Latin American and Caribbean markets, the JETCO is expected to open up new avenues for economic collaboration and mutual growth.
One of the anticipated outcomes of JETCO is the mitigation of challenges in the export of Indian products to the Dominican Republic.
This includes boosting exports of pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and engineering goods manufactured in India. The collaborative effort is expected to contribute to the foreign exchange earnings for an 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (self-reliant India).
As India continues to engage with nations globally to enhance economic partnerships and explore new avenues for collaboration, the approval of the protocol for JETCO with the Dominican Republic stands as a testament to the commitment to fostering stronger economic ties and facilitating mutually beneficial exchanges between the two nations.

India is set to overtake China as the single biggest driver of global oil demand growth by 2030, Oilprice reported on Wednesday, citing analysts and forecasters.
India's economy has seen ""robust"" growth over the past year, while China's ""has spluttered,"" according to the outlet. India's high GDP growth, as well as its increasing industrialization and urbanization, are among the factors Oilprice expects to propel the country to being the largest global driver of incremental oil demand.
India was one of the fastest-growing major economies in the financial year 2022/2023, with GDP growth of 7.2%, according to the World Bank, which forecasts India's growth at 6.3% for the next year. China, meanwhile, is projected to have grown by 5.2% in 2023, while the forecast for 2024 is for a more sluggish 4.5%, according to the World Bank.
Being the world's third-largest crude oil importer and consumer, India does not shy away from buying crude from whomever offers the lowest price, Oilprice writes. Since 2022, New Delhi has become a top buyer of Russian crude, taking advantage of the discounts following a ban on Russian grades in the West.
""If there's a 30% discount, the Russians are putting a ribbon around it and sending it to us free. That's what it means,"" India's petroleum minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, told CNBC last year.
In 2023, India's oil consumption hit a record high of 231 million tons, up from 219 million tons in 2022, according to Reuters, which cited data from the Indian Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.
The Asian nation has also been boosting its refining capacity, which is expected to increase by 22% in the next five years, Oilprice noted. The government aims to expand domestic refining capacities to a level that will be able to meet the country's fuel demand in the long term.
India imports about 85% of its crude oil needs. According to S&P Global, it sources crude mainly from the Middle East and Russia.
Some analysts estimate India's economic growth will average around 6.3% annually until 2030, mainly driven by investment and consumer spending. Stronger economic growth would entail higher demand for oil.

Addressing a public meeting organised at the Police Shooting Ground following the launch of development projects worth more than Rs 20,000 crore for Western Uttar Pradesh, PM Modi added that while people blow the bugle for him, he focuses on serving people.
Inaugurating a range of crucial projects, including a railway line, highway, petroleum pipeline, water and sewerage facilities, a medical college, and an industrial area, PM Modi underscored the significant contributions of the western Uttar Pradesh region to the nation. He specifically acknowledged the legacy of Kalyan Singh, referring to him as a son of the region who dedicated his life to both the cause of Lord Ram and the nation, as per the statement.
The PM expressed a belief that Kalyan Singh, wherever he is today, would be pleased to witness the progress in Ayodhya Dham. The realisation of this dream, shared by Kalyan Singh and many others, signifies a momentous achievement for the country. With the consecration of Ram Lalla's life accomplished, Prime Minister Modi emphasised that the current focus should be on elevating the nation's prestige to new heights, the statement added.
The Prime Minister highlighted that in the decades following independence, the governance approach in India resembled rulership rather than inclusive development. ""Progress, during this period, was concentrated in specific regions, leaving a significant portion of the country devoid of growth. Uttar Pradesh, despite being home to the largest population in the country, unfortunately, did not receive due attention in this development narrative. This oversight can be attributed to the long-standing behaviour of those in government, who, for an extended period, adopted a ruler-centric approach, he remarked.
According to the PM, the consequences of this approach to governance were evident, as a substantial part of the population in Uttar Pradesh endured persistent poverty. Moreover, a divisive strategy was employed to gain and consolidate power, further exacerbating societal divisions, as he pointed out. The Prime Minister underscored the need for a departure from such historical practices, emphasising the importance of inclusive development that reaches every corner of the nation.
It added that Prime Minister Modi highlighted the transformative impact of the double-engine government formed in 2017, citing a surge in economic development and the effective resolution of longstanding challenges in Uttar Pradesh. He noted the significant progress in the establishment of two major defence corridors across India, with one notably taking shape in western Uttar Pradesh.
The press release further stated that the Prime Minister also outlined the extensive connectivity initiatives, including the development of modern motorways that aim to link every part of Uttar Pradesh. He announced the commencement of India's first Namo Bharat train project in Western UP, coupled with the ongoing expansion of metro facilities connecting various cities in the state. Uttar Pradesh is rapidly evolving into a central hub for both the Eastern and Western Dedicated Freight Corridors.
The inauguration of Jewar Airport is poised to bring newfound strength and vitality to the region, introducing enhanced air connectivity, he said. ""Furthermore, the central government is actively planning the establishment of four new industrial smart cities nationwide, with one of these visionary cities already inaugurated in Greater Noida,"" he added.
The Prime Minister expressed his enthusiasm for the promising developments, underscoring his commitment to fostering comprehensive growth and innovation across Uttar Pradesh, as per the statement.
Congratulating Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the Prime Minister lauded the significant step of increasing the price of sugarcane for the upcoming crushing season. He acknowledged the challenges farmers previously faced, waiting extensively to receive payments for their produce. Under the double-engine government, a transformative initiative has been implemented to ensure that funds from the sale of grains go directly into the farmers' bank accounts, as per the statement.
The statement further added that the Prime Minister emphasised the government's consistent efforts to alleviate the challenges faced by sugarcane farmers, with a special focus on maximising their earnings through the production of ethanol. The priority remains steadfastly on the welfare of farmers, and the government is committed to ensuring they receive the maximum benefits, contributing to the enhancement of their financial well-being, he stated.
The Prime Minister highlighted a remarkable disparity in global agriculture, noting that while farmers worldwide are paying around Rs 3,000 for a bag of urea, in India, it is available for less than Rs 300. He proudly announced the country's foray into nano-urea production, showcasing India's commitment to innovation in agricultural practices. The government has initiated the world's largest scheme for storage facilities, aiming to establish a comprehensive network of cold storage units across the country, he added. This monumental effort is geared towards ensuring efficient storage and distribution of agricultural produce, thereby addressing critical aspects of food security, he said.
""Another groundbreaking initiative, the Namo Drone Didi scheme, was unveiled by the government. Under this programme, sisters from women's self-help societies are being trained as drone pilots and provided with drones. This innovative scheme is poised to emerge as a formidable asset for farmers in the times to come, leveraging technology and empowering women in rural areas, he stated further.
It stated that the Prime Minister underscored the widespread impact of ""Modi's guaranteed vehicle,"" reaching every village and reflecting the commitment to extend the benefits of government schemes to every citizen and said that true secularism and social justice are about delivering the advantages of schemes to the public without discrimination or corruption.
Addressing the historical context, the Prime Minister noted the post-independence era, where slogans and promises often failed to translate into tangible benefits for the common populace. Instead, a few families prospered, leaving the poor, Dalits, and backward classes vulnerable to criminality and social unrest. Highlighting the achievements of the government over the past decade, he proudly stated that 25 crore people have risen above the poverty line during this period, as per the statement.
The Prime Minister affirmed the government's unwavering commitment to the comprehensive empowerment of villages, the impoverished, youth, women, and farmers. This ongoing campaign aims to uplift every section of society, fostering an inclusive and equitable growth trajectory, he said, as per the statement.
On this occasion, Governor of Uttar Pradesh Anandi Ben Patel, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Deputy Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak, Union Minister General VK Singh, Minister Arun Saxena, MP Mahesh Sharma, Bhola Singh, Rajendra Agarwal, Satpal Singh, Surendra Singh Nagar, BJP State President Chaudhary Bhupendra Singh and BJP officials and citizens were present.

THE RECENT controlled demolition of Al-Isra University, the last standing centre for higher learning in Gaza, reminded the globe why South Africa is charging the Netanyahu Government with genocide at The Hague, as it's attempting to annihilate Palestinians, including via the erasure of culture.
Not only has the Israeli occupying force killed over 24,000 mainly civilian Palestinians in the Strip, including 10,000 children, but hospitals have been stormed, healthcare workers targeted and the official witnesses of these new lows in modern warfare, the journalists of Gaza, are being murdered.
Al-Quds Today director Wael Abu Fannouna was killed on Thursday. He was the 119th Palestinian journalist eliminated since 7 October.
Taken out during an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City, Fannouna was erased on the 104th day of the wholesale massacre - one less voice to report inconvenient truths.

International law recognises journalists and war correspondents as civilians, who are protected due to this status. And while the annihilation of reporters in Gaza is unprecedented, it does follow a general growing trend in the targeting of journalists in war over recent decades, and then it bucks it.
The killing of journalists in Gaza appears to be both indiscriminate and targeted, with a tendency towards the latter. And this obvious attempt by Israel to silence coverage of on-the-ground atrocities and the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip has eradicated 10 per cent of local reporters.
Documenting their own destruction
Journalists have been reprimanded and sanctioned across the globe for reporting on the Gaza catastrophe in an all-too-truthful manner.
But the bravery being shown by the correspondents of Gaza is on another level, as they detail the genocide of their people and the destruction of their culture.
Not only are these reporters documenting their own traumatisation, but they're working with a target on their back that reads 'Press'. This was highlighted early on when Palestine TV's Mohammed Abu Hatab tore off his protective vest marked 'Press' live on-air, as it hadn't protected his colleague.

Israel's relationship with the United Nations, international institutions and international law has, at times, bristled with suspicion and blatant hostility.
Protected status
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) details international humanitarian law (IHL) on its How does law protect in war? website. As it notes, IHL is contained within the Four Geneva Conventions established in 1949, along with its two additional protocols of 1977 and the third protocol of 2005.
'The general trend is towards the deterioration of the working conditions of journalists in periods of armed conflict,' the ICRC states, adding that the 'illegality of attacks on journalists and news media' derives from the general protection of civilians under article 50(1) of 1977's Additional Protocol I.
IHL distinguishes between two types of reporters working in war zones: war correspondents linked to armed forces and independent journalists. Both types of reporters are provided the protections against hostilities or arbitrary measures, including against capture, that civilians warrant.
The drafters of the 1977 Additional Protocol I determined that journalists should not be provided a protected status beyond that of civilians, as they considered that 'any increase in the number of persons with a special status... tends to weaken the protective value...'
However, those partaking in the 1974 to 1977 Diplomatic Conference of Geneva determined to add a special provision on measures of protections for journalists in Protocol I, in order to supplement the protection article 4(A)(4) of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 extends to war correspondents.
Contained in article 79 of Protocol I, the measures that protect journalists 'engaged in dangerous professional missions', involve the protection that civilians receive, unless any adverse actions affect this. Journalists can also obtain a card from their government to prove their profession.

Members of the Russian Communist Party (KPRF) gathered at Vladimir Lenin's Mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square on Sunday to commemorate the first leader of the Soviet Union, who died a century ago to the day.
Born Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, the revolutionary was the founder of their party and the main driver of the Bolshevik Revolution. He served as the first head of government of the USSR from 1917 until his death in the town of Gorky, in the Moscow region on January 21, 1924.
The ceremony at the Red Square was attended by long-time KPRF leader Gennady Zyuganov and its presidential hopeful Nikolay Kharitonov, along with other leading party members.
""Lenin has gone to another world but forever remained with humanity, where on planet Earth for the first time he tried to build a new world... in which labor rules, not capital,"" Zyuganov said after laying flowers at the mausoleum.
The structure was built in 1930 alongside the walls of the Kremlin facing Red Square to publicly display the embalmed remains of Lenin. Lenin's tomb is a major tourist destination in Moscow and was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1990.
Since the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, there have been debates, spearheaded by the Russian Orthodox Church, as to whether the mausoleum should be closed and the body buried next to his mother and sister or moved to the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

� Sputnik / Ilya Pitalev
While polls show that the majority of Russians support a proper burial service, Zyuganov believes that the Red Square mausoleum holds ""a sacred meaning"" and represents ""our great era.""

� Sputnik / Ilya Pitalev
The tomb's rooftop viewing platform was used by Soviet leaders to watch military parades. Zyuganov recalled how ""two hundred fascist banners were thrown towards it after the legendary victory"" over Nazi Germany, and noted how many soviet heroes were greeted at the site, including the first person in space, Yuri Gagarin.

The data released by the NGO ""Centre for Holistic Development"" working for the homeless stated that 180 homeless have died due to cold on Delhi roads evidently establishing that people are forced to sleep on roads due to lack of shelter homes or denial of admission.
""It's shocking to note that on an average every day 9 persons have died due to cold on Delhi roads under the open sky in January 2024 due to criminal negligence of Arvind Kejriwal government,"" said the Delhi BJP President.
Delhi BJP President further said, ""Early in December 2023 we had raised the issue of growing numbers of deaths of homeless due to cold and urged the Delhi Government to ensure that the homeless do not have to sleep on roadsides and get proper shelter homes.""Virendra Sachdeva also said that unfortunately Delhi Government's nodal body Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) has totally failed in its objective duty of providing shelter homes and the concerned Minister Atishi remains involved in petty political blame game paying no attention to the humanitarian duty.
""The corruption in Delhi Government is so high that those who somehow get space in Shelter Homes are denied basic amenities like two square mealsmedical check-ups,"" added Sachdeva. (ANI)"

Russian President Vladimir Putin's trip to the country's westernmost region of Kaliningrad is not aimed at sending a message to NATO, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.
Putin arrived in Kaliningrad on Thursday - which is also Students Day in Russia - to meet with students at a local university. According to the Kremlin, he will also meet with local officials to discuss the economic and social welfare agenda.
Kaliningrad (formerly Konigsberg) belonged to Germany until the end of World War II, when it was handed over to the USSR under the Potsdam Agreement. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, it remained part of Russia, but is now bordered by NATO member states (Poland and Lithuania).
Commenting on Putin's trip, Peskov stressed that when he ""visits Russian regions, this is not a message to NATO nations,"" adding that the main focus should be on the president's actions.
However, Peskov said that Russian officials took ""special security measures"" to protect the president on the trip. He also noted that Moscow did not request a direct flight path over Lithuania to reach Kaliningrad. Shortly after the start of the Ukraine conflict, the EU imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia, including a complete ban on Russian planes flying over its territory.
Amid the standoff between Russia and NATO, Poland and Lithuania announced plans earlier this month to conduct military exercises in the Suwalki Gap - a narrow strip of land between Belarus, an ally of Moscow, and Kaliningrad.
Western media outlets have suggested that Russia could target this area in the event of a full-scale conflict with NATO, potentially cutting the Baltic states off from the rest of the US-led military bloc.
Russia has repeatedly denied having any plans to attack the alliance, saying it has no interest in doing so.

Secretary of State Antony J Blinken spoke with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on January 25 to emphasize the necessity of a thorough and swift investigation of this matter, the US State Department said in a statement.
Notably, on October 7, more than 3,000 women, children and men, ranging from the age of 9 months to 80 years in Israel were attacked by the terror group Hamas. Many women were brutally raped and killed. Around 1,405 people lost their lives, and over 200 were taken as hostages.
US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said: ""The United States is extremely troubled by the allegations that twelve UNRWA employees may have been involved in the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel.""He said the State Department has temporarily paused additional funding for UNRWA ""while we review these allegations and the steps the United Nations is taking to address them.""Miller said the US welcomes the UN's decision to investigate the matter.
""We welcome the decision to conduct such an investigation and Secretary General Guterres' pledge to take decisive action to respond, should the allegations prove accurate. We also welcome the UN's announcement of a 'comprehensive and independent' review of UNRWA. There must be complete accountability for anyone who participated in the heinous attacks of October 7,"" the US State Department spokesperson said.
Miller said UNRWA plays a critical role in providing lifesaving assistance to Palestinians, including essential food, medicine, shelter, and other vital humanitarian support. ""Their work has saved lives, and it is important that UNRWA address these allegations and take any appropriate corrective measures, including reviewing its existing policies and procedures.""The US has meanwhile reached out to the Israel government to seek more information about these allegations, and ""we have briefed Members of Congress. We will remain in close contact with the United Nations and Israeli government regarding this matter,"" he added. (ANI)"

Earlier, the court had stayed the trial court order listing the matter for today for a detailed hearing.
Delhi Police had moved the High Court challenging the trial court order in regards to supplying a copy of the FIR to one of the accused, Neelam Azad, in connection with the Parliament security breach case.
The High Court, on the last date of the hearing, after noting the submissions of Delhi Police, ordered that the trial court's directions be stayed. Meanwhile, the court had also issued notices to the accused, Neelam Azad, on his Delhi Police plea.
The Patiala House Court, last month had allowed an application moved by one of the accused Neelam Azad's family seeking a supply of a copy of FIR registration under various sections of IPC and UAPA.
The court also allowed a plea seeking court direction to Delhi Police to allow Neelam's lawyer to meet for legal advice during the custodial remand period.
Additional Sessions Judge Dr Hardeep Kaur had said the concerned Investigation Officer is directed to furnish the copy of the present FIR to the applicant/accused as per law.
The court also said, considering the totality of circumstances, this Court is of the considered view that the applicant/ accused is entitled as a matter right to legal assistance and the right is available to her even when she is in police custody.
Neelam's counsel advocate, Suresh Kumar Chaudhary, appeared before the concerned judge and said family and lawyers should be provided with the FIR; it is a constitutional right. He also allowed us to meet with Neelam.
The case involves a security breach that occurred on December 13, when two youths jumped into the Lok Sabha chamber during Zero Hour, setting off smoke cans and raising slogans.
The probe earlier revealed further that two pairs of shoes were made on a special order in Lucknow, as the accused learned that the shoes of visitors to the new Parliament were not checked and they could hide their smoke cans under their footwear. (ANI)"

Human rights defenders say this measure is not enough to make a difference to civilians caught up in the horrific conflict.
The EU Council said in its statement the six entities were responsible for ""supporting activities undermining the stability and political transition of Sudan"".
""The entities listed are subject to asset freezes. The provision of funds or economic resources, directly or indirectly, to them or for their benefit is prohibited,"" the Council said.
Among those listed are two companies involved in the manufacture of weapons and vehicles for the SAF (Defense Industries System and SMT Engineering); the SAF-controlled Zadna International Company for Investment Limited; and three companies involved in procuring military equipment for the RSF (Al Junaid Multi Activities Co Ltd, Tradive General Trading and GSK Advance Company Ltd).
Human Rights Watch's EU Director Philippe Dam reacted by commenting on X that nine months into the brutal conflict in Sudan, the ""EU finally uses sanctions... But only on 6 companies. This is too slow, too little. Civilians pay heavy price for international inaction.""
Since the war broke out in mid-April 2023, fighting hasn't abated between Mohamed Hamdan Daglo and army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.
More than 7.5 million people have had to flee their homes. Many of them have moved repeatedly after only finding temporary safety.

""The EU remains deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in Sudan and reaffirms its steadfast support for, and solidarity with, the Sudanese people,"" the Council added.
In November, the European Union condemned an escalation of violence in Sudan's Darfur region, warning of the danger of another genocide after conflict there between 2003-2008 killed some 300,000 people and displaced more than 2 million.
The bloodshed has continued to escalate despite international attempts to forge a lasting ceasefire.
Last week, the authorities in Khartoum announced the freezing of their relations with the East African group IGAD, for inviting paramilitary chief Daglo.
On Sunday, they suspended their membership from the regional bloc over 'sovereignty violation'.

Jean Carroll's defamation case against former U.S. President Donald Trump in New York.
Trump, the likely 2024 Republican nominee to run against Democratic President Joe Biden in the November presidential election, has denied even knowing Carroll, now 80.
Trump took the witness stand Thursday to defend himself against allegations that he defamed writer Carroll by disparaging her claim that he sexually assaulted her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s. He testified that he stood by his 2019 comments that he considered her accusations to be false.
The former president briefly left the courtroom during Friday's closing arguments.
Jurors will now decide whether Carroll is entitled to any damages. She is seeking $10 million or more.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan had ruled that Trump would not be allowed to testify that he didn't assault Carroll, a one-time advice columnist for Elle magazine, or that she lied about the assault allegation - since those questions were not before the jury.
Before the civil trial started, Kaplan ruled that a jury in a related case last year had already determined that Trump sexually abused Carroll and that its decision on her abuse allegation carried over to the current case.
That jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million for comments Trump made in 2022, with the current case centered on 2019 comments Trump made while he was president.
Trump has repeatedly denied knowing Carroll and has said she was not 'my type.'
Carroll testified last week, 'It means I'm too ugly to assault.'
Trump, 77, has attended much of the trial, even though he was not required to be present in the courtroom. He has treated the case like a campaign stop, holding news conferences at the end of the day to attack Carroll's claims and Kaplan as being biased against him.
'They are weaponizing law enforcement at a level like never before,' Trump said Sunday night at a New Hampshire rally ahead of the Republican primary election he won in the northeastern state Tuesday.
He said he was intent on being in the courtroom for the conclusion of the case.
'You know where I'm going to be,' he told supporters at the rally. 'I don't have to be there, but I want to be there because otherwise, I can't get a fair shake. I'm going to be in court.'
The Carroll defamation claims are in a civil case, and Trump faces no threat of imprisonment. But he does face an unprecedented 91 criminal charges across four indictments in cases that could go to trial this year."

The populations of Western countries have become disillusioned with the Ukraine conflict, the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), Sergey Naryshkin, said on Thursday.
Western capitals are now trying to drum up public support by hyping up the phantom threat of the ""Russian invasion"" of NATO, Naryshkin told Sputnik in an interview.
Polls have made it ""clear that the population of these countries is simply tired of the Ukrainian crisis,"" Naryshkin said. ""Few people believe in the possibility of achieving victory over Russia.""
Those who wish to continue the ""simply colossal"" financial assistance to President Vladimir Zelensky's ""gang"" are fewer still, according to the SVR head. ""And no one understands why the population of Western countries must suffer for this.""
Industries of EU countries have taken a massive hit over the past two years due to the bloc's embargo on Russian energy imports. Recent reports showed millions of UK residents struggling to afford electricity.

The US and its allies have provided more than $203 billion in aid to Ukraine over the past two years, according to Russian estimates. This has included everything from weapons, ammunition and equipment to paying the salaries of government employees.
Faced with their people's growing reluctance to continue doing this, Naryshkin said, Western governments are using the tried and true technique of fear-mongering, talking about ""the possibility of aggression by Russia.""
NATO's belligerent rhetoric is also part of a ""hybrid war"" against Russia, attempting to intimidate Moscow into abandoning the objectives of its military operation in Ukraine, the SVR head said, noting that such a turn of events is unlikely.
Moscow has repeatedly warned the West that continuing to supply Kiev with weapons will make them participants in the conflict with all the attendant consequences. Russia has also given notice that anyone involved in atrocities perpetrated by the Ukrainian military against civilians - including Westerners - will not escape justice.

Russian customs officials have confiscated over 1.2 metric tons of cocaine that had arrived at the Port of St Petersburg, Russia's Federal Customs Service (FTC) reported on Wednesday. The incident marks the second time this month that authorities have thwarted an attempt to ship a large amount of cocaine into the country.
According to the FTC report, the cocaine was discovered in a shipment of coffee, in a container that had arrived from the Belgian port city of Antwerp. Employees of the North-Western Customs Administration as well as the Federal Security Service (FSB) scanned the container and discovered a large number of rectangular briquettes of pressed white powder.
Further examination revealed and confirmed that the white powder was cocaine. The FTC put the black-market value of the narcotics at over 13 billion rubles ($146.9 million).
In its Telegram post announcing the seizure of the drugs, the FTC posted a picture of a cat drinking coffee with the caption ""what an invigorating Belgian coffee.""
Russian authorities have opened a criminal case in response to the drug bust; those found responsible could face life in prison and a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
Two weeks ago, another shipment of cocaine was discovered at the same port; a thousand briquettes of cocaine weighing over a metric ton and worth more than 11 billion rubles ($123.2 million) were discovered in a container that arrived on ship hailing from Nicaragua. Customs officials dedicated another cat meme to the seizure.
A criminal case was opened following the first drug bust; however, there have been no updates as to who may have been responsible.

1Q14D8AHKW_BBRTSE5BIE25TJQ,US Military Says It Fended Off Another Houthi Missile Attack,"Voice of America 25th January 2024, 07:35 GMT+11","Voice of America 25th January 2024, 07:35 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105473/us-military-says-it-fended-off-another-houthi-missile-attack,"Washington - Iran-backed Houthi militants launched new attacks Wednesday on merchant shipping in the Gulf of Aden, just hours after the United States carried out preemptive strikes to stave off what it said was an imminent attack on shipping lanes in the Red Sea.
U.S. Central Command, which overseas U.S. forces in the Middle East, said late Wednesday that a U.S. guided missile destroyer shot down two anti-ship ballistic missiles aimed at the M/V Maersk Detroit, a U.S.-owned and operated container ship transiting the Gulf of Aden.
A third missile fell into the sea.
U.S. officials said that while the latest attack did not cause any injuries or damage to the container ship, it shows the Houthis are not ready to back down.
'It underscores that the Houthis still intend to conduct these attacks, which means we're, obviously, still going to do what we have to do to protect that shipping,' White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters at the White House.
Hours before the latest attack Wednesday, the U.S. launched preemptive strikes in Houthi-controlled Yemen, destroying two anti-ship missiles allegedly set to target international shipping in the Red Sea.
The missiles 'presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and the U.S. Navy ships in the region,' according to a U.S. Central Command statement.
The latest round of U.S. preemptive strikes and Houthi attacks follow Monday's barrage by U.S. and British warplanes, ships and submarines aimed at degrading the ability of the Houthis to maintain their months-long assault on key shipping lanes in the region.
US, UK Launch More Strikes Targeting Weapons in Houthi-Controlled Yemen
U.S. defense officials said Monday's strikes hit multiple targets across eight locations, including an underground storage facility as well as missile launch sites and other locations linked to Houthi surveillance capabilities.
""These precision strikes ... are in response to a series of illegal, dangerous and destabilizing Houthi actions,"" the U.S. and Britain said in a statement at the time, noting the latest strikes were carried out with the support of Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands.
U.S. officials have also signaled that while they do not seek to escalate the conflict, they are prepared to keep making the Houthis pay a price if attacks by the U.S.-designated terror group continue.
US Redesignates Yemen's Houthis as Major Terror Group
""Our hope is that we can restore security and stability to the Red Sea,' Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday.
'If they [the Houthis] stop conducting these attacks, then there'll be no further need to take these kinds of actions,' he added.
But in a sign of continued tensions, the United Nations confirmed Wednesday that the Houthis have given it one month to withdraw all U.S. and British staff from Houthi-controlled areas.
""What needs to be said is that any request or requirement for U.N. staff to leave - based solely on the nationality of that staff - is inconsistent with the legal framework applicable to the U.N.,"" said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric.
""It also, of course, impedes our ability to deliver on the mandate to support all of the people of Yemen,"" he added.
The Red Sea route carries about 15% of the world's maritime traffic. Major shipping companies have responded to the attacks by rerouting vessels on the longer and more expensive route around Africa.
Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched at least 34 attacks on international shipping lanes, justifying them by saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza under attack from Israel.
But U.S. officials say many of the Houthi attacks have targeted ships that are not associated with Israel.
The rising tensions involving the U.S., its allies, other countries and the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen come as the U.S. also seeks to deter other Iran-backed groups in the region.
Early Wednesday, U.S. military aircraft hit Iran-backed proxies in western Iraq in response to a series of attacks against U.S. and coalition forces in recent days.
U.S. officials said the airstrikes targeted three facilities used by Kataib Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy groups in al-Qaim, Jurf al Sakhar, and one other location.
""These strikes targeted KH [Kataib Hezbollah] headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] capabilities,"" according to an initial statement from U.S. Central Command.
The National Security Council's Kirby said later Wednesday that early battle damage assessments have indicated the strikes were successful.
He also further described one of the targets as an intelligence facility.
The U.S. strikes in Iraq came after one by Iran-backed militants on Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq with one-way attack drones.
The base was also targeted Saturday by a barrage of ballistic missiles launched from inside Iraq. While most of the missiles were shot down, the Pentagon said those that landed on the base caused traumatic brain injuries in four U.S. personnel.
There have been more than 150 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the October 7 Hamas terror attack against Israel, injuring at least 83 Americans, a U.S. defense official told VOA. All but two have returned to duty.

Donoghue will read the court order, a release issued by the ICJ said.
""On Friday 26 January 2024, the International Court of Justice will deliver its Order on the Request for the indication of provisional measures submitted by South Africa in the case concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip (South Africa v.

""A public sitting will take place at 1 p.m. at the Peace Palace in The Hague, during which Judge Joan E. Donoghue, the President of the Court, will read the Court's Order,"" the release added.
South Africa has lodged an urgent appeal to the ICJ to force Israel to ""immediately suspend"" its military operations in the Gaza Strip.
South Africa has based its accusation both on actions taken by Israel throughout the war and controversial comments made by Israeli officials regarding Palestinians in Gaza and how they should be treated.
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently declared an unwavering commitment to dismantling Hamas, asserting that ""nobody will stop us"", CNN reported.
In a press briefing, Netanyahu dismissed potential interference from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and other entities, including what he referred to as the ""axis of evil"" led by Iran.
""Nobody will stop us - not The Hague, not the axis of evil, and not anybody else,"" Netanyahu stated emphatically, rebuffing the genocide accusations levelled against Israel at the ICJ.
He characterised the claims as a ""hypocritical onslaught"" orchestrated by those seeking to perpetrate another Holocaust against the Jewish people, as reported by CNN.
Describing the situation as a ""moral low point in the history of nations,"" Netanyahu highlighted alleged instances of antisemitism discovered in Hamas-controlled areas.
He claimed that anti-Semitic materials, including copies of Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kampf,"" were found in Hamas tunnels in Gaza. Additionally, Netanyahu asserted that a child's tablet with a screensaver featuring Hitler was discovered in a home in Gaza.
Despite acknowledging the persistence of antisemitism, Netanyahu underscored the resilience of the Jewish people, vowing to continue the fight ""until the end."" (ANI)"

Iran is now a ""legitimate target"" for Israeli attacks, Economy Minister Nir Barkat has told The Telegraph, raising fears of an armed conflict with Tehran. He also claimed that the war in Gaza is not being fought with enough aggression by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
""Iran is a legitimate target for Israel,"" said Barkat. ""They will not get away with it. The head of the snake is Tehran. ""My recommendation is to adopt the strategy that President Kennedy used in the Cuban Missile Crisis. What he basically said then was, 'A missile from Cuba will be answered with a missile to Moscow,'"" the minister added, referring to the 1962 standoff between the US and the USSR.
Barkat's rhetoric echoed a recent statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who blamed Iran for standing behind the militant groups in Gaza. He claimed that Israel was already carrying out direct attacks on Iran. ""Iran is the head of the octopus and you see its tentacles all around from the Houthis to Hezbollah to Hamas,"" said the prime minister.
Israel claims that Iran was involved in plotting the October 7 attacks, when around 1,200 people were killed and more than 200 taken hostage in the surprise Hamas raid near Gaza.
Israel retaliated by launching an aerial bombardment and ground operation against the Palestinian enclave, which has resulted in the deaths of around 25,000 people, according to local health officials.
Iran has denied having any role in the Hamas assault on Israel, with Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani saying such accusations were ""based on political reasons.""

He also expressed optimism about India's potential to secure a permanent seat on the Security Council, recognising the nation's credibility and influence within the General Assembly.
The UNGA President was addressing a press conference in the national capital on Wednesday when he was questioned on the world's largest democracy's absence from the security council.
Francis expressed concerns about the outdated structure of the Security Council, which he believes fails to reflect the current geopolitical realities.
""The Security Council of the UN as it currently exists harks back to a period in world history that no longer exists. Since then, the world has changed radically,"" remarked Francis, highlighting the council's inability to make crucial decisions for international peace and security, often due to geopolitical influences leading to the use of the veto.
""The fact of the matter is that the council has, in recent years, been progressively unable to take the decisions necessary in order to assist and support the strengthening of international peace and security. Largely for geopolitical reasons. The geopolitics, the global dynamics of the geopolitics, get imported into the council and that results invariably in the use of the veto by one or the other party,"" he added.
On India's inclusion in the UNSC, the UNGA President said, ""India is a mature, highly respected member of the United Nations. It is a leader in many ways. And I'm sure that that fact is not lost on the members of the General Assembly.""""So I wish the government and people of India every success in their quest to assume membership of the council on a permanent basis. Whether that occurs or not will be a matter for the members to determine,"" he also saidIndia has long sought a permanent seat on the Security Council to better represent the interests of the developing world. The nation's quest has gained momentum with support from influential figures like Dennis Francis, who believes in India's capability to contribute positively to global peace and security.
India has been a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for eight terms (16 years). India is a member of the G4, a group of nations that back each other to seek permanent membership in the UNSC. The countries advocate for reform in the UNSC.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his France visit in July 2023, made a strong pitch for India's permanent membership in the UN Security Council, saying the primary UN body cannot claim to be speaking for the world when its most populous country and the largest democracy is not a permanent member.

Bulgaria now faces a two-month window to respond to the notice, or the Commission may proceed to issue a reasoned opinion.
Emissions Trading: Bulgaria, alongside 25 other EU member states, including Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, has failed to fully communicate the transposition of changes in EU emissions trading rules into national law by the December 31, 2023 deadline. The amendments to the EU Emissions Trading System Directive strengthen existing rules, extend the system to maritime transport, and introduce carbon pricing in additional economic sectors.
Legal Economic Migration: Bulgaria and 16 other member states have not communicated the national measures transposing the EU Blue Card Directive to the Commission by the November 18, 2023 deadline. The directive aims to establish entry and residence conditions for highly qualified non-EU nationals seeking to live and work in the EU, introducing more efficient rules for attracting skilled workers.
Motor Insurance: Directive (EU) 2021/2118, amending Directive 2009/103/EC, seeks to enhance the protection of victims of traffic accidents across the EU. Bulgaria, along with 16 other member states, has not communicated the full transposition of this directive by the December 23, 2023 deadline, which clarifies the scope of protection and facilitates checks on compulsory motor insurance.
Consumer Credits: The EU rules on credit servicers and credit purchasers, designed to allow the marketing of non-performing loans cross-border, face non-compliance from Bulgaria and 20 other member states. The National Law Directive (NPL) requires member states to adopt and publish measures transposing it into national law by December 29, 2023, to protect consumers in the handling of non-performing loans.
Bulgaria's response to these infringement procedures will be critical in determining the next steps taken by the European Commission.

The deal is part of a move to boost bilateral relations between the two countries, which have maintained a postcolonial dialogue since Cambodia became independent in 1953.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet met with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace and announced the pact last week. It was the West Point graduate's first official visit to a Western power since succeeding his father, Hun Sen, in August.
""Cambodia will always remember France's role in contributing to national economic recovery and development through the French Development Agency,"" Hun Manet said at a press conference alongside Macron.
""I hope that my visit to France, especially with the president, will enable us to discuss the work that needs to further strengthen Cambodia-France relations,"" Hun Manet said Thursday.
The meeting with Macron came just months after France joined other European Union countries in expressing concern about July's election, in which Cambodia's main opposition party was barred from participating.
Cambodians Brace for One-Sided Election
After July's elections, in which the ruling Cambodian People's Party won all but five seats in parliament, France called for the release of jailed opposition politicians and respect for Cambodia's democratic obligations under international pacts and domestic law.
Former Prime Minister Hun Sen was the ruling party's prime minister candidate in the election but quickly stepped down to make way for his son in a long-planned succession. Hun Sen remains the president of the ruling party and is expected to be the president of the Senate after elections in late February.
Hun Manet's first trip after succeeding his father in August was to Beijing, where he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the Great Hall of the People. Cambodia has long supported China in return for receiving significant investments, loans and grants to build infrastructure, according to analysts.
Analysts: Cambodia's New Government to Maintain Close Ties With China
Cambodia's democratic donors have largely set aside differences over political freedom and human rights to focus on areas of cooperation with the new government in Phnom Penh.
During the visit, Macron reiterated France's appreciation of Cambodia's position at the United Nations regarding Russia's war against Ukraine, according to the joint statement.
Cambodia has repeatedly voted with Ukraine's supporters in condemning Russia's invasion, in a rare break with China on the world stage.
Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who is in exile in France, criticized Macron in a post on Facebook and an opinion article in The Geopolitics for legitimizing Hun Manet's rule.
""Macron has clearly made the calculation that it is better to engage with dictators rather than deny them legitimacy,"" he wrote.
""There is no sign that Macron, along with some other Western leaders, fully understands the unseen impacts of affording high-profile acceptance and credibility to dictators such as Hun Manet,"" Sam Rainsy added. ""An official visit to a venue such as the Elysee is a major propaganda coup for any such regime. It gives an unequivocal message to the Cambodian regime and the Cambodian people that arrests of and violence against opposition supporters can continue.""
Sok Eysan, a spokesman for the ruling Cambodian People's Party, told VOA Khmer on Friday that the visit showed that the Cambodian government and its new prime minister were recognized by the world's leaders and other officials.
Before traveling to France, Manet also attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. While there, he met with Samantha Power, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development.
In a post on X, Power said they discussed ""opportunities to build a more productive relationship.""
Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in Asia, criticized Power's approach:
""How about talking about human rights, Samantha? #Cambodia has descended into a single party dictatorship under the Hun family and you want a 'more productive' relationship? Aiya! How about some sanctions instead?"""

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday participated in a grand inauguration ceremony for a temple in Ayodhya in the northern part of the country, in a major political boost for his government ahead of national elections scheduled for May. Construction of the temple was one of the main pledges of Modi's 2019 election campaign.
Stretching across 7.2 acres, the three-story shrine, constructed for $216 million, is made of pink sandstone and black granite. Modi arrived in Ayodhya by helicopter to take part in the 'pran pratistha' ceremony (which translates as 'the establishment of life force').
During the event, an idol was installed depicting the Hindu god Ram as a child, sculpted by designer Arun Yogiraj. Hindus believe the consecration ritual breathes life into an idol or picture.
Over 8,000 people traveled to Ayodhya to attend the ceremony, including the country's richest man, Reliance Industries chairperson Mukesh Ambani, his wife and chairperson of Reliance Foundation Nita Ambani, and dozens of movie stars and sporting icons. ""Ayodhya's message is the end of every kind of violence - be it internal violence, external violence, or the conflict between the countries,"" Indian Nobel Peace Laureate and activist Kailash Satyarthi told the ANI news agency.
Actor Anupam Kher, who was among many Bollywood celebrities present, described the event as ""bigger than Diwali,"" referring to one of India's main religious festivals, which marks the return of Lord Ram to Ayodhya after vanquishing evil and is celebrated by lighting earthen lamps. Earlier, Modi had urged Indians to celebrate the temple consecration ""like Diwali"". All the states ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shut schools and colleges and declared a full or half-day government holiday to encourage people to watch the ceremony.
Against the backdrop of the temple's construction, the government allotted $3.85 billion for the transformation of the town of Ayodhya, which is receiving a major facelift in the form of swankier hotels, improved roads, and railway facilities, and its own international airport capable of handling a million passengers annually.
Meanwhile, the opposition has shunned the event, accusing Modi of using it for political gains. The leadership of the Congress, India's largest opposition party, said it ""respectfully declined"" an invitation to attend. In southern India's Tamil Nadu state, controversy erupted over the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party-led government allegedly ""banning"" live telecasts of the Ayodhya ceremony in the temples across the state - a claim the local administration has denied.
On Monday, the Supreme Court issued a notice to the Tamil Nadu government on a plea filed against the state's oral order, noting that ""permission"" to telecast the event or conduct religious ceremonies cannot be denied on the grounds that it could upset other religious communities. ""This is a homogenous society,"" the bench noted, according to a Livelaw report.
The Ram temple is built on a site where in 1992 a 16th-century mosque was razed by Hindu nationalists, who believed that the Muslim invaders had erected the building on the ruins of a Hindu temple. After a trial spanning 18 years, centering on whether Hindus or Muslims were the rightful owners of the land, the Supreme Court of India sided with the Hindus in 2019, paving the way for a temple dedicated to the deity.

Twenty-year-old Nick Dunlap became the first amateur to win a PGA Tour event since Phil Mickelson in 1991 by capturing The American Express title on Sunday in La Quinta, Calif.
Dunlap got up and down for par at the 72nd hole at the PGA West Pete Dye Stadium Course to shoot 2-under 70 for the round and 29-under 259 for the week, one ahead of South Africa's Christiaan Bezuidenhout.
The reigning U.S. Amateur champion and sophomore at Alabama opened 64-65-60, having racked up 10 birdies and an eagle to shoot 12 under at La Quinta Country Club in Saturday's third round.
He began Sunday with a three-shot lead over Sam Burns but found the water on the par-4 seventh hole and made double bogey. Dunlap responded with birdies at Nos. 8 and 14, and after chipping to 10 1/2 feet at the par-5 16th, he sank a birdie putt to tie Burns at 29 under.
Dunlap then landed his tee shot at the par-3 17th on the island green and Burns proceeded to find the water.
Dunlap made par but hit his tee shot at No. 18 landed on a mound far right of the fairway. After Burns found the water for the second straight hole, Dunlap's second shot traveled 194 yards and rolled down a mound into a far corner of the fairway, setting up another remarkable chip to 6 feet.
Bezuidenhout eagled the par-4 15th and birdied the 18th to polish off a bogey-free 65 and make Dunlap's final par necessary to avoid a playoff.

The court's nine justices agreed unanimously on Wednesday not to hear an appeal from Smith that would have temporarily kept him from the execution chamber at Alabama's Holman Correctional Facility. Smith took his case to the Supreme Court after a district court ruled earlier this month that the execution could go ahead as planned.
Smith will be put to death using an untested method: nitrogen gas hypoxia. Once in the death chamber, he will be made to breathe the gas through a respirator, depriving his body of oxygen and causing him to slip into unconsciousness before passing away.
Nitrogen hypoxia is ""the most painless and humane method of execution known to man,"" the Alabama attorney general's office argued in court earlier this month. Smith's defense team pointed out that the method has not been tested in the US, and that the American Veterinary Medical Association banned the use of nitrogen in euthanizing most mammals, as being put into an ""anoxic environment ... is distressing for some species.""


Following the Supreme Court's decision, the state of Alabama has 30 hours to execute Smith. For Smith, it will be his second time in the death chamber, after executioners failed to connect intravenous lines to his veins in 2020 in order to administer a lethal injection.Smith was sentenced to death in 1996 for murdering a preacher's wife eight years previously.

The figure accounted for 75.7 percent of the country's total tax refunds, tax-and-fee cuts and tax-and-fee deferrals last year, making private-sector taxpayers the biggest beneficiaries of China's tax policies in 2023.
Official data shows that China's newly implemented tax refunds, as well as its new cuts and deferrals of taxes and fees, neared 2.23 trillion yuan in 2023.
The manufacturing sector and related wholesale and retail industries enjoyed 949.53 billion yuan of support from the tax policies, according to Huang Yun, a spokesperson for the State Taxation Administration.
Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises benefited most, saving about 1.43 trillion yuan, or 64 percent of total savings.
Huang said the country's tax departments will improve the quality and efficiency of tax services, help optimize China's business environment and further stimulate market vitality."
2I4IUDLPPE_I5MAVXSMY6I6P6H,Trump Defends Himself in Sexual Assault Defamation Case,"Voice of America 26th January 2024, 09:35 GMT+11","Voice of America 26th January 2024, 09:35 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106668/trump-defends-himself-in-sexual-assault-defamation-case,"Former U.S. President Donald Trump, the leading 2024 Republican presidential contender, briefly took the witness stand Thursday at a New York trial to defend himself against allegations that he defamed writer E. Jean Carroll by disparaging her claim that he sexually assaulted her in a department store dressing room in the 1990s.
Trump testified that he stood by his 2019 comments that he considered her accusations to be false.
'Yes, I did,' Trump said. 'She said something that I considered a false accusation - totally false.'
But Judge Lewis Kaplan, who had ruled that an earlier court decision had already found Trump liable in the assault in the posh Bergdorf Goodman store, stopped Trump from rehashing the incident, saying: 'Everything after 'yes I did' is stricken.'
When Trump lawyer Alina Habba asked him whether he meant to hurt Carroll by belittling her claims - which Carroll wrote in a book published in 2019 - Trump replied, 'No, I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly, the presidency.'
With Habba declaring the former U.S. leader's defense at an end, Kaplan sent the nine-member jury home for the day. He told the jurors they would hear closing arguments Friday morning before deciding whether Carroll, now 80, is entitled to any damages. She is seeking $10 million or more.
E. Jean Carroll arrives at Manhattan federal court in New York, Jan. 25, 2024.
Before the jury entered the courtroom to hear Trump's abbreviated testimony, Habba sparred with Kaplan over the extent of the questions she could ask Trump.
Kaplan had ruled that Trump would not be allowed to testify that he didn't assault Carroll, a one-time advice columnist for Elle magazine, or that she lied about the rape allegation - because those questions were not before the jury.
Before the civil trial started, Kaplan ruled that a jury in a related case last year had already determined that Trump sexually abused Carroll and that its decision on her abuse allegation carried over to the current case.
That jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million for comments he made in 2022, with the current case centered on 2019 comments he made while he was president.
Habba told Kaplan she wanted to ask Trump several questions, including having him confirm that he stood by all the testimony he gave in a deposition in the case.
Trump interrupted Habba, declaring, 'I never met the woman. I don't know who the woman is. I never met this woman.'
Kaplan admonished Trump. 'I'm sorry Mr. Trump, you're interrupting these proceedings by talking loudly while your attorney is talking, and that is not permitted.'
Kaplan and Habba continued to debate the questions she would be allowed to ask.
'Ms. Habba, I'll decide what he has a right to do. That's my job, not yours,' the judge said.
Trump, the likely 2024 Republican nominee to run against Democratic President Joe Biden in the November presidential election, has repeatedly denied even knowing Carroll and has said she was not 'my type.'
Carroll testified last week, 'It means I'm too ugly to assault.'
As they concluded their case against Trump, Carroll's lawyers showed jurors a clip of his October 2022 deposition in which he mistook Carroll for his second wife, Marla Maples, when he was shown a photograph of Carroll from the 1990s.
Carroll's lawyers intended the picture and Trump's misidentification of her to undermine his repeated assertions that Carroll is not his 'type.'
Trump, 77, has attended much of the trial, even though he was not required to be present in the courtroom. He has treated the case like a campaign stop, holding news conferences at the end of the day to attack Carroll's claims and Kaplan as biased against him.
'They are weaponizing law enforcement at a level like never before,' Trump said Sunday night at a New Hampshire rally ahead of the Republican primary election he won in the northeastern state on Tuesday.
He said he was intent on being in the courtroom for the conclusion of the case.
'You know where I'm going to be,' he told supporters at the rally. 'I don't have to be there, but I want to be there because otherwise, I can't get a fair shake. I'm going to be in court.'
The Carroll defamation claims are in a civil case, and Trump faces no threat of imprisonment. But he does face an unprecedented 91 criminal charges across four indictments in cases that could go to trial this year.
As Carroll testified last week, her attorneys complained to Kaplan that Trump was making disparaging side comments about her to his lawyers that the jury, seated fewer than four meters away, could possibly hear.
The complaints by Carroll's lawyers led to a contentious exchange between Trump and the judge.
Kaplan told Trump that his right to be at the trial would be revoked if he continued to ignore warnings to keep his comments to his lawyers quieter and out of earshot of the jury.
But after an initial warning, Carroll's lawyer said Trump could still be heard making remarks to his lawyers, including, 'It is a witch hunt' and, 'It really is a con job.'
After excusing the jury for lunch, Kaplan told Trump, 'I hope I don't have to consider excluding you from the trial. I understand you're probably eager for me to do that.'
'I would love it,' Trump shot back, shrugging as he sat at the defense table between his lawyers Michael Madaio and Habba.
'I know you would like it. You just can't control yourself in this circumstance, apparently,' Kaplan responded.
'You can't either,' Trump muttered.
As Trump watched, Carroll told the jurors, 'I'm here because Donald Trump assaulted me, and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened. He lied and shattered my reputation.'
Once, Carroll testified, she was a respected advice columnist. 'Now, I'm known as the liar, the fraud and the whack job.'
Trump made repeated disparaging comments about Carroll on his Truth Social platform in the days leading up to the trial.
Carroll testified last week, 'He has continued to lie. He lied last month. He lied on Sunday. He lied yesterday.'"
2I5A7S7KYS_68P8W5KTTOTRZ8T,"US, Iraq governments expected to soon begin talks on troops withdrawal","ANI 25th January 2024, 14:55 GMT+11","ANI 25th January 2024, 14:55 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105686/us-iraq-governments-expected-to-soon-begin-talks-on-troops-withdrawal,"Washington, DC [US], January 25 (ANI): The US and Iraq are expected to soon begin talks on the American military presence in the country following calls from the Iraq government for the US to withdraw its troops, as reported by CNN, citing sources.
Last summer, the US and Iraq agreed to form a higher military commission, according to the Pentagon, as a vehicle for the talks.
The discussions between both countries will focus on the next phase of the US-led anti-ISIS coalition, with the terror group now reduced to a shadow of its former self.
According to officials, US military officials and diplomats will be involved in the discussions.
The talks about the future of the US military presence in Iraq have sparked a greater urgency as regional instability rises, according to CNN.
Calls by the Iraq government for the US have come in response to the US launching airstrikes inside Iraq targeting Iran-backed militants who have been attacking US personnel there.
Reportedly, the US has roughly 2,500 troops currently in Iraq who have been operating there in an advise and assist capacity since December 2021, when the US military announced the end of its combat role in the country.
Moreover, some of the discussions will focus on whether and when it will be feasible to end the US military presence in Iraq, CNN reported.
The US officials said that they would prefer a schedule that would be based on conditions in Iraq, including the ongoing defeat of ISIS and the stability of the government and the Iraqi security forces.
However, some elements within the Iraq government prefer a schedule based on a timeline, setting the date for the American withdrawal regardless of the stability of the security situation within the country.
Recently, on January 10, the office of Iraq Prime Minister Mohammed Shia-al-Sudani said that they would soon begin the process ""to end the presence of the international coalition forces in Iraq permanently.""""The US and Iraq are close to agreement on starting the Higher Military Commission dialogue that was announced back in August,"" a US official said.
""The HMC will be an opportunity to jointly evaluate the conditions required for the future of the D-ISIS fight in Iraq and shape the nature of the bilateral security relationship. We have been discussing this for months. The timing is not related to the recent attacks. The US will maintain its full right to self-defense during the talks, the official added.
Jonathan Lord, the director of the Middle East security programme at the Centre for New American Security, said that the US needs to transition its support for Iraq towards building ""a lasting and sustainable military capacity in the (Iraq Security Forces), to avoid another 2014. That hasn't happened.""""If we leave now with no plan in place, we're sending the patient back out on the street with no plan to stay healthy,"" he added, comparing the initial anti-ISIS intervention to an emergency room hospital stay. ""Chances are, if things go bad, they'll end up right back there. And it's the most expensive, least efficient way to help them.""On Tuesday, following the latest round of US strikes in Iraq, a spokesperson for the prime minister said in a statement that the strikes are ""undermining agreements and various sectors of joint security cooperation"" as the two countries are working to ""reshape the future relationship.""Last year, the US and Iraq agreed to initiate talks on the future of the US military presence before the October 7 Hamas terror attack on Israel, which sparked wider regional tensions and encouraged the Iran-backed groups, particularly Kataib Hezbollah, in Iraq and across the Middle East.
Moreover, the Pentagon emphasised that the Iraq government has not formally asked the US military to withdraw, stressing that the troops are still there at the invitation of the Iraq government, as reported by CNN, adding that there is no deadline for a conclusion to the higher military commission discussions or their ultimate outcome.
Jon Alterman, the director of the Middle East Programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the politics of the US military presence in Iraq have been ""treacherous"" for over a decade, but it's not a binary choice of staying or leaving. Nor is this a process that needs to move quickly.
""This is a choice of where you want to be on a spectrum,"" said Alterman. ""Diplomats can manipulate both the timing and the direction of the talks and arrive at a wide variety of potential outcomes.""Alterman further said that, rumblings of a potential US change in its force posture in Iraq would be a victory for Iran. ""Any sign that this is the beginning of the end would be widely celebrated in Iranian corridors,"" he added.
Earlier on Wednesday, Iraq's foreign minister hinted at the upcoming discussions, and highlighted that he met with the US Ambassador to Baghdad, Elena Romanowski, and ""received from her an important message from the American government to the Iraqi government, which will be studied by the Prime Minister and the relevant concerned authorities. Next steps will be taken regarding it soon.""The US also has a presence in Syria to fight ISIS, but administration officials said that a withdrawal from that country is not under consideration, according to CNN.
""The Biden administration is not considering a withdrawal of forces from Syria,"" a senior US official said. (ANI)"

Russian Ambassador to India Denis Alipov has extended greetings to Indians on Republic Day, wishing them ""prosperity, well-being, and a very bright Amrit Kaal,"" referring to the Indian government's 25-year vision for development and transformation. The term 'Amrit Kaal' was first used by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2021 during the 75th Independence Day celebrations.
In a video shared by the diplomatic mission on Friday, dozens of Russian children and adults perform a blend of Bollywood and Russian traditional dances, adorned in colorful attire.
The South Asian nation celebrates its national day on January 26, commemorating the day in 1950 when the Constitution of India, which was drafted by visionary political leader and social reformer Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, came into effect, marking the nation's transition from British rule to sovereign republic. The celebrations include a colorful parade on Rajpath, the ceremonial boulevard in the center of New Delhi. The procession showcases India's rich cultural heritage, military prowess, and technological advancements.
Over the past five decades, India has welcomed several esteemed dignitaries as chief guests for the Republic Day parade. This year, French President Emmanuel Macron is the chief guest for the parade, following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Paris in July last year as a guest of honor for the French national day.
The invitation was extended to Macron after US President Joe Biden's administration said he would not be able to make it. Modi invited Biden during the G20 leaders summit in New Delhi in September 2023.
Several Russian leaders have been chief guests during the Republic Day parade over the past decades, beginning with Soviet Defense Minister Georgy Zhukov in 1957, followed by Kliment Vorosholiv, the chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1960, and Aleksey Kosygin, the chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers in 1968. Russian President Vladimir Putin was the chief guest in 2007.
A significant portion of the weaponry and military hardware showcased during the Republic Day parades over the years was either from Russia or resulted from collaborative efforts between the two nations, most recently under New Delhi's 'Make in India' initiative, which aims to increase country's self-reliance across sectors, including weapons manufacturing. This year, Russia is also represented at the parade by cadets from the Nakhimov Naval School and the St. Petersburg Cadet Corps Boarding School of the Ministry of Defense.
Despite India actively diversifying its sources of military procurements, Russia still constitutes nearly 50% of the arms imported by New Delhi, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). India was the world's largest arms importer from 2018 to 2022, accounting for 11% of global imports, according to SIPRI.

Former US President Donald Trump has described Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping as ""very intelligent men"" who ""love their country."" Trump frequently praises the two leaders, and insists that he is the only presidential candidate capable of standing toe-to-toe with them.
Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Trump said that Putin and Xi ""whether you like it or not [are] very intelligent men, very powerful men, and very vicious men too.""
""They love their country more"" than US President Joe Biden does, Trump continued, adding that the 81-year-old Democrat is ""not capable"" of negotiating with either.
""We have a man as our president who is grossly incompetent,"" Trump told the conservative network. ""He can't put two sentences together, he can't walk off the stage, he can't find the stairs... he's destroying this country.""
Trump took a hard stance toward China while in office, but spoke warmly of Xi once Washington and Beijing struck a tentative trade deal in 2020. Trump met with Putin in Helsinki in 2018, and again at the following year's G20 summit in Osaka, but his efforts to build what he called a ""very good relationship"" with the Russian president were stymied by the so-called 'Russiagate' investigation, which after two years failed to turn up any evidence of ""Russian meddling"" in the 2016 US presidential election or ""collusion"" between the Trump campaign and Moscow.
If elected president in November, Trump has claimed that he could end the conflict in Ukraine ""within 24 hours"" by sitting Putin and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky down and negotiating a deal. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Moscow had not been in contact with Trump, and ""has no idea"" how his proposal could be accomplished.
Nevertheless, Trump maintains that neither Biden nor his last remaining Republican opponent, Nikki Haley, would have the mettle to negotiate with Putin or Xi. Haley, he said at a campaign rally on Friday, ""is not tough enough, not smart enough, and was not respected enough"" to deal with such ""very fine people.""
""It's good to get along with people like Putin and like others... it's good to get along with people that have massive nuclear weapons,"" Trump told Fox News last week.

A project involving 2 billion U.S. dollars to restore degraded Lake Victoria is expected to start soon, said Hilda Luoga, who is in charge of the project development with the Lake Victoria Basin Commission, a specialized agency of the East African Community, at the meeting.
The project, which will be undertaken by the agency in ten years, entails controlling the solid waste, sanitation and drainage systems that pollute the lake, said Luoga, warning that the lake shared by Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda was facing serious pollution caused by human activities.
A study conducted by the World Bank in 2020 showed that three cities of Mwanza in Tanzania, Entebbe in Uganda and Homabay in Kenya were the main polluters of Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake by area and the world's largest tropical lake, according to him."

Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky on Wednesday disagreed with Moscow's claim that Kiev's air defenses shot down the Russian plane carrying 65 Ukrainian POWs scheduled to be exchanged.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the Il-76 military transport was transporting 65 Ukrainian captives when it was shot down by a Ukrainian missile over Belgorod Region. Six Russian crew members and three officials were also on board. There were no survivors.
""We must determine all the hard facts - as much as possible, given that the plane crashed on Russian territory,"" Zelensky said in a video published on his website.
He added that the Ukrainian authorities are investigating the incident and working to ""determine the fate of all POWs.""
""Our country will be insisting on an international investigation,"" the president said, accusing Moscow of ""playing with the lives of Ukrainian POWs."" He did not name a culprit in the destruction of the IL-76, however.
Several Ukrainian media outlets and journalists initially cited sources as saying that the aircraft was ""transporting missiles"" and was shot down by Ukrainian troops. They quickly deleted their original reports after Russia revealed that the plane was carrying Ukrainian captives.
The Russian MOD insisted that Kiev was ""well aware"" that the captives would have been transported on a military plane to an airfield near the Russian city of Belgorod, from where they would have been taken to an exchange point. Ukrainian military intelligence agency GUR claimed that they had not been informed in advance about the route, or the means, of the prisoners' transportation.
Meanwhile, the Ukrainian General Staff released a statement saying that Russia has been using transport planes to resupply Belgorod with missiles used to strike Kharkov, and that the planes were therefore a legitimate military target. It did not mention any prisoners, though.
Russia requested to convene an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the incident. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that ""Ukrainian propaganda"" has been frantically ""trying to concoct other explanations"" since the information about the passengers of the doomed flight was revealed. France, which chairs the council this month, said it could call for a session on Thursday afternoon.

Coming into force in July, the new law was passed by the state legislature last year with bipartisan support, including from Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin and Attorney-General Jason Miyares.
The law classifies conspiring or acting together with one or more people to steal retail merchandise valued at more than US$5,000 in a 90-day period, with the intent to sell the stolen goods for profit, as a Class 3 felony.
Some Democrats and criminal justice advocates opposed the bill, arguing that it could ensnare people, such as low-income people, the homeless, and those struggling with addiction, who must resort to stealing to survive.
Retail theft has reached crisis levels in recent years have been exaggerated, said Brad Haywood, public defender and founder of Justice Forward Virginia, which advocates for criminal justice reform.
Haywood, who supported the repeal effort, said the bill should have received a full hearing, and he will again campaign for a repeal next year.
""I think we lost an opportunity to essentially demand better from people trying to exploit the fear in criminal justice,"" he said.
In response, Del. Fernando ""Marty"" Martinez, lead sponsor of the bill, said that as the new law has only been in force for six months and its effectiveness is not yet clear, he asked for the repeal bill to be sent to the crime commission.
""I would like more data on whether the bill is working. I would like more data on why it is a class 3 felony,"" Martinez said."

The deal, dubbed ""Coral Bridge,"" was signed between Telecom Egypt, Egypt's first integrated telecommunications operator, and NaiTel, a telecommunications service provider in Jordan and the communication arm of the Aqaba Digital Hub.
The statement said that the cable will serve as a vital communication link between the two countries by establishing a robust digital infrastructure.
The new submarine cable, designed with the highest technical specifications, enjoys unique competitive advantages thanks to the short distance between the two landing points and its containment of a large number of optical fibers to meet the growing demands of artificial intelligence applications, it added.
""It will enhance the geographical competitive advantages of Egypt, as a key international transit point between the east and west, and Jordan as a primary transit point for the Levant, Iraq, and Gulf states, serving as a secondary convergence point between Asia and Europe,"" said the statement.

2YCL7NI819_EFFY9VEMB01LTR6,Role of Media in Nation Building,"Pakistan Press Foundation 26th January 2024, 19:37 GMT+11","Pakistan Press Foundation 26th January 2024, 19:37 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274107009/role-of-media-in-nation-building,"It is rightly said that press (media) and a nation rise and fall together. The media as a fourth pillar of the state and representing the society is supposed to maintain its pluralistic hue wedded to the cause of defending the social values, human liberties and freedoms that are indispensable for the socio-economic development of the society besides playing its educative role on issues of crucial national interest in an independent and impartial manner. The media is also required to promote and defend democracy as its own freedom is reinforced in a democratic set up. This is how it can play an effective role in the rise of a nation.
Judged on the touchstone of the foregoing, the media landscape in Pakistan presents a very dismal picture. While it zealously tends to maintain and protect its freedom, it is not showing the sense of social responsibility that goes with the freedom of expression. The media like the political polarization in the country has also become highly polarized. The conduct of the media during the present political turmoil in the country and run up to the elections clearly manifests that phenomenon. Some channels have been persistently engaged in tarnishing the image of the leadership of a particular party and dishing out unauthentic information about alleged corruption and some have been promoting the narrative of the vested interests. Mutual rivalries between channels and media groups going beyond fair competition in the market of ideas and their descending into the realm of degrading dispositions towards each other are also a contributing factor to the overall irresponsible behavior of the media. The new entrant to the media mix, the social media, has played a very dirty role in spreading falsehood, fabricated news to malign political opponents and even denigrating the state institutions. Reportedly the government has identified 500 social media accounts which were engaged in trolling the judges of the apex court, particularly the CJ. The social media is also being used to mislead the youth in regards to national issues. It has gone on un-checked with all the negative consequences.
The constitutional provision for freedom of expression and media is in consonance with the internationally recognized role of the states to regulate all the entities within its territorial limits in such a way that they contribute to the strengthening of the state, its ideological moorings, national interests and the moral values of the society with a view to promote peace and tranquility in the country. In fact there is no concept of unbridled media freedom in the world and rightly so. The Social Responsibility Theory propounded by Dr. Robert Maynard Hutchison, Vice Chancellor of Chicago University who headed Hutchison Commission formed in US in 1942 to make recommendations on the freedom of expression and media's obligations towards the societyâ in the backdrop of growing calls by the US public for government intervention to check the indiscretions of the media and attempts by the media to avoid incisive government regulationâ remarked ""freedom comes with responsibility:
The report of the Commission submitted in 1947, is regarded as the Magna Carte of the modern concept of freedom of expression and media's responsibilities towards the society. It unequivocally emphasized the need for media to provide accurate, truthful and comprehensive account of events, act as a forum for exchange of comment and criticism, present and clarify goals and values of the society and make sure that it projects a representative picture of the constituent groups of the society. The media can defend its freedom and play its defined role only when it acts with responsibility. Nevertheless it is an irrefutable reality that the government has a constitutional duty to ensure that all the entities operating with the boundaries of the state, including media do not cross the Rubican.
One would like the media to self-regulate itself in a manner that while playing its role as a watch-dog against the government, it also serves the cause of the society and the state by maintaining its pluralistic disposition. In the run-up to elections, post-election scenario it must exhibit greater sense of social responsibility instead of playing a partisan role and being part of propaganda of the vested interests, specific political groups and parties. It needs to present realistic and truthful picture of the unfolding scenario to the public. The media owes it to the nation and itself. The incumbent government will also have to make sure that the media enjoys freedom of expression within the parameters of the internationally recognized ethical and professional codes of conduct and the social media is also regulated properly.

The association forecasts that the country's seafood exports will gradually recover in 2024 and become more positive in the second half of the year.
The shrimp industry aims to achieve the export target of 4 billion dollars, pangasius at about 1.9 billion dollars, and the remaining seafood products are forecast to earn about 3.6 billion to 3.8 billion dollars.
According to the association, demand for seafood tends to recover, but customers still focus on products in the lower price segment such as canned fish, raw fish for processing canned fish, dried fish and dried shrimp.
Vietnam exported seafood worth 9.2 billion dollars in 2023, including 3.5 billion dollars from shrimp, about 1.9 billion dollars from pangasius and 900 million dollars from tuna."
2YTU4FMLQA_O39AXX25ETENN73,Global Health Emergencies Top Agenda of WHO Annual Meeting,"Voice of America 23rd January 2024, 05:36 GMT+11","Voice of America 23rd January 2024, 05:36 GMT+11",20240122,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103169/global-health-emergencies-top-agenda-of-who-annual-meeting,"Geneva - This year's executive board meeting at the World Health Organization opened at a time of multiplying global health emergencies, but also at a moment when the U.N. health agency can point to 'many achievements and milestones' in public health.
'After almost three-and-a-half years in May, I declared an end to both COVID-19 and mpox as global health emergencies, although both remain global threats,' WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told delegates on Monday.
'More than two-thirds of the global population has now received a complete primary series of a COVID-19 vaccine,' he said. 'COVAX, which closed at the end of last year, played a vital role, delivering nearly 2 billion doses and saving an estimated 2.7 million lives in lower-income countries.'
The meeting also opened on a particularly auspicious day - the same day that the first of two WHO-recommended life-saving malaria vaccines were rolled out in Cameroon, the first country in the world to begin routine malaria vaccinations.
WHO reports that more than half a million children under age 5 die from malaria every year, most in Africa.
'Having two vaccines for malaria will help to close the huge gap between demand and supply, and could save tens of thousands of young lives, especially in Africa,' said Tedros.

The WHO chief presented a snapshot of some of last year's other achievements in promoting, providing and protecting health. These include progress in reducing the number of smokers in 150 countries worldwide; in supporting more than 50 countries to build climate-resilient, climate-friendly health systems; and in supporting and increasing countries' access to essential medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products.
Additionally, WHO reports that more than 7.5 million people with tuberculosis received access to diagnosis and treatment in 2022, the most in almost 30 years. Tedros said progress also has been made in HIV treatment, noting that more than 75% of people living with HIV globally now receive antiretroviral therapy.
'We are now beginning to see a path towards the [sustainable development goals] target of ending the HIV epidemic,' he said, adding that 'Australia became the first country to announce that it is close to the virtual elimination of HIV transmission, in inner Sydney.'
He also said good inroads also were being made in helping countries achieve universal health coverage, based on strong primary health care.
New data published by WHO and the World Bank show that half the world's population is not fully covered by essential health services, and that '2 billion people face financial hardship due to out-of-pocket health spending.'
Tedros said that countries who attended a high-level meeting at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in September 'made more than 50 commitments to progressively expand access to essential health services, and to improve financial protection.'
'Indeed, that is what WHO is doing all over the world,' he said. 'Through the Universal Health Coverage Partnership, we are supporting 120 countries to advance towards universal health care,' he said.
The 34-member board meets annually to set the agenda of the World Health Assembly and implement the decisions and policies of that body.
'2024 will be a defining year for global health and for our WHO,' said Tedros. 'This year, you have the opportunity to shape the world's global health strategy for the next four years. This year, you have the opportunity to shape the future of health emergencies.'
Last year, he noted, WHO responded to 65 acute emergencies, from earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, to conflict and insecurity in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, Myanmar, Sudan, Ukraine, and 'of course, the occupied Palestinian territory, especially Gaza.'

'We supported countries to access vaccines and treatments to respond to outbreaks of cholera, diphtheria, meningitis and yellow fever,' he said. 'And emergency medical teams played a vital role in our response to 19 emergencies in 18 countries.'
He flagged the passage of a legally binding pandemic prevention and preparedness agreement at the World Health Assembly in May to be of crucial importance and mentioned that world leaders at the UNGA in September agreed to conclude negotiations on the pandemic agreement and amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) by May.
'I must say I am gravely concerned that member states may not meet that commitment,' he said. 'Time is very short, and there are several outstanding issues that remain to be resolved. In my view, a failure to deliver the pandemic agreement and the IHR amendments will be a missed opportunity for which future generations may not forgive us.'
He appealed to all member states 'to work with urgency and purpose to reach consensus on a strong agreement that will help to protect our children and grandchildren from future pandemics.'"

Russian customs officials have confiscated over 1.2 metric tons of cocaine that had arrived at the Port of St Petersburg, Russia's Federal Customs Service (FTC) reported on Wednesday. The incident marks the second time this month that authorities have thwarted an attempt to ship a large amount of cocaine into the country.
According to the FTC report, the cocaine was discovered in a shipment of coffee, in a container that had arrived from the Belgian port city of Antwerp. Employees of the North-Western Customs Administration as well as the Federal Security Service (FSB) scanned the container and discovered a large number of rectangular briquettes of pressed white powder.
Further examination revealed and confirmed that the white powder was cocaine. The FTC put the black-market value of the narcotics at over 13 billion rubles ($146.9 million).
In its Telegram post announcing the seizure of the drugs, the FTC posted a picture of a cat drinking coffee with the caption ""what an invigorating Belgian coffee.""
Russian authorities have opened a criminal case in response to the drug bust; those found responsible could face life in prison and a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
Two weeks ago, another shipment of cocaine was discovered at the same port; a thousand briquettes of cocaine weighing over a metric ton and worth more than 11 billion rubles ($123.2 million) were discovered in a container that arrived on ship hailing from Nicaragua. Customs officials dedicated another cat meme to the seizure.
A criminal case was opened following the first drug bust; however, there have been no updates as to who may have been responsible.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued its first ruling on South Africa's case against Israel on Friday, ordering the Jewish state to take all necessary actions to prevent genocide in Gaza. The court did not, however, order Israel to cease its military operation against Hamas.
A panel of 17 judges agreed that the court, based in The Hague, has jurisdiction to hear South Africa's case, and passed seven ""emergency measures"" requested by Pretoria. In addition to demanding that Israel refrain from committing genocide, the judges ordered the Jewish state to punish members of its military who commit genocidal acts, as well as officials who publicly call for the genocide of the Palestinians. Israel must also preserve evidence of any genocidal acts already committed, the ruling stated.
The judges also ruled that Israel ""shall take immediate and effective measures to address adverse conditions to life in the Gaza Strip."" West Jerusalem was further ordered to report back to the court in a month with an update on what it is doing to comply with these measures.
The ruling falls short of South Africa's full list of demands, which included a measure ordering Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza.""
However, it also comes as a blow to Israel, which demanded that the court throw out the entire case, describing it as ""spurious and specious.""
While the ICJ's rulings are final and legally binding, the court lacks any method of enforcing them. Nevertheless, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry hailed Friday's verdict as an ""important reminder"" that no state is above the law.
South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor said on Friday that her country's aim was ""to highlight the plight of the innocent in Palestine"" and ""draw attention to the lack of justice and freedom."" Regardless of how the case plays out, Pandor told Ubuntu Radio that Pretoria has already achieved these goals.
South Africa lodged its case in late December, arguing that Israel was breaching the UN Genocide Convention by ""killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing them serious bodily and mental harm, and inflicting on them conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction.""
Hamas fighters attacked Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking nearly 250 to Gaza as hostages. Israel responded by declaring war on the Palestinian militant group and placing Gaza under a near-total siege. After three weeks of aerial bombardment, Israeli ground forces entered the enclave in late October, where they remain engaged in combat with Hamas.
The Israeli operation has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, roughly two-thirds of whom were women and children, according to the latest figures from the Gaza Health Ministry. Around 60% of the enclave's infrastructure has been destroyed and a quarter of its population are starving and unable to access drinking water, according to a UN report published earlier this month.

Washington has begun creating ""a colonial administration"" in Ukraine consisting of local politicians who have sworn allegiance to the US, the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) has said.
The US government has demanded that Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky ""remove"" dozens of high-ranking officials, whom Washington no longer trusts, from their posts under various pretexts, Sergey Naryshkin claimed on Monday.
Washington wants those jobs to be filled by ""Ukrainians trained in the West, who have sworn allegiance to American interests,"" he said in comments cited by the SVR press service.
""As part of the policy of total vassalization of Ukraine, the US has started forming what is essentially a colonial administration in that country,"" the spy chief stated.
According to Naryshkin, the required changes in the Ukrainian government were relayed to Zelensky during his visit to Washington in December.
""The Americans are pushing for Ukrainian ambassador to Washington Oksana Markarova, who received her education at Indiana University Bloomington, to take the post of prime minister. The deputy head of the Finance Ministry, Alexander Kava, who studied at Harvard University, is being suggested for the job of finance minister. The current deputy head of the Economy Ministry, Taras Kachka, a graduate of Poland's National School of Public Administration (KSAP), is recommended for the post of economy minister,"" he said.
The latest high-profile change in the Ukrainian cabinet follows the pattern described by Naryshkin. Ukraine's Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, who replaced Zelensky's ally Aleksey Reznikov in the job last fall, used to participate in the Future Leaders Exchange program, funded by the US State Department.
The Biden administration, which is in possession of a ""killer corruption dossier"" on members of Zelenksy's inner circle, is threatening to make this information public if Ukrainian leader refuses to greenlight the desired personnel decisions, the spy chief claimed.
""Zelensky realizes that the damaging data that the Americans have is capable of destroying him as president. In this situation, he'll continue to dance to the tune of his American masters,"" Naryshkin predicted.
The US, which has provided Zelensky's government with $111 billion in military and economic assistance since the start of the conflict with Russia, already has advisers embedded in all key Ukrainian ministries, but Washington believes this is not enough and is ""steadily increasing Kiev's feudal dependence,"" Naryshkin said.

The 12th seed Zheng is closing in on ending a decade-long title drought in Grand Slam singles for Chinese players after a 6-4, 6-4 semifinal win over qualifier Dayana Yastremska in one hour and 42 minutes.
Her idol Li Na is the only Chinese player to have won a Grand Slam singles title here, having famously triumphed at Roland Garros in 2011 before lifting the trophy at the Australian Open exactly a decade ago.
""It feels unbelievable. I'm super excited to have such a great performance. It's tough to feel my emotions right now,"" said Zheng after her first Grand Slam semifinal.
The 21-year-old Zheng ended the giant-killing run of No.93 Yastremska, who had beaten reigning Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova and two-time former tournament winner Victoria Azarenka.
The Ukrainian was in distress and clutching at her stomach muscle in the middle of the first set after running for a forehand. She fought on and battled bravely, but Zheng had all the answers and clinched victory on serve as she raised her arms aloft and let out a roar in celebration.
Zheng has impressively built on a breakout season last year, but her quest for a first Grand Slam crown will have to go through the formidable presence of Sabalenka, who has not lost a set in the tournament.
Second seed Sabalenka kept her title defence on track with a powerful 7-6 (2), 6-4 victory over fourth seed Coco Gauff in one hour and 42 minutes. It was sweet revenge for Sabalenka after she fell to Gauff in an epic final at last year's U.S. Open.
There was much anticipation over the rivalry being renewed, but a confident Sabalenka continued her remarkable form in Melbourne.
The 25-year-old appeared to be blasting past the American with a 5-2 lead in the first set before she lost concentration and dropped four straight games. But Sabalenka lifted a level to break back and force a tiebreak, which she controlled to draw first blood.
Sabalenka had to fend off a determined challenge from Gauff, but she relentlessly attacked her serve which cracked in the ninth game. The Belarusian calmly closed it out to become the first women's player since Serena Williams in 2016 and 2017 to reach back-to-back finals in Melbourne.
Sabalenka is bidding to clinch a successful title defence at the Australian Open since Azarenka in 2013.
""I was able to focus on myself. I was prepared that she was going to move well and put all the balls back and I was just ready for anything,"" she said. ""She's a great player and I enjoy playing her. I really hope that in the future we are going to play many more finals.""
Earlier, China's Zhang Zhizhen and Tomas Machac's barnstorming run in the men's doubles ended after falling to second seeds Matthew Ebden and Rohan Bopanna.
The unseeded Chinese-Czech pairing had unexpectedly made a strong tilt at the title, but were halted in the semifinals by doubles specialists Ebden and Bopanna 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (10-7).
The Australian-Indian pairing were finalists at last year's US Open, but have yet to win a Grand Slam title together. They will face in the final Italians Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori, who beat German pair Yannick Hanfmann and Dominik Koepfer in a third set deciding tiebreak.
Zhang, who is ranked 625 in doubles, and Machac had enjoyed a spectacular run highlighted by a third round upset over doubles specialists and third seeds Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury.
It ended the Australian Open campaign of Zhang, China's highest ranked men's singles player, who fell in the second round to 21st seed Ugo Humbert in four sets.
The men's semifinals will be held on Friday with 10-time tournament champion Novak Djokovic facing fourth seed Jannik Sinner. In the night session, former US Open champion Daniil Medvedev plays sixth seed Alexander Zverev, who knocked out No.2 Carlos Alcaraz in the last eight."

The government ""notes the complete impossibility of the deal,"" Maiga said, ""and in consequence announces its end, with immediate effect.""
He said it was not possible to continue with the agreement because of other stakeholders not upholding their commitments, as well as ""hostile acts"" by Algeria, which acted as a primary mediator.
That means the Algiers Accord, which the United Nations brokered, is no longer viable, the spokesperson said.
The separatist rebels - organized under the Coordination of Azawad Movements - in July 2022 accused the military junta of abandoning the peace deal.
The junta's announcement came after months of hostilities between rebel groups and the military, the latter of which launched back-to-back coups in 2020 and 2021.
The 2015 peace deal was considered vital to stabilizing Mali, which had endured jihadist violence since 2012.
But the agreement began to fall apart after years of calm when conflict between separatists and the national military was sparked amid the withdrawal of U.N. peacekeepers in December 2023.

Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico has said
Ukraine should concede the loss of some of the territories that were previously under its control in order to end the conflict with Russia, Slovakia's prime minister Robert Fico has said.
Fico made the statement during a weekend interview with broadcaster RTVS dedicated to his upcoming visit to Ukraine. The Slovak PM is scheduled to travel on Wednesday to Uzhgorod, a city near the border between the two countries, for a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Denis Shmygal.
The ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev can't be resolved through military means and should end in compromise that might be ""painful for both sides,"" he said.
""What are [the Ukrainians] waiting for? That the Russians will leave Donbass and Lugansk, or that they will leave Crimea? It's unrealistic,"" Fico insisted.
The People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk were officially incorporated into the Russian state in the fall of 2022, together the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, as a result of referendums held in those areas. Crimea has been a part of Russia since 2014.
The continuation of the fighting that has been underway since February 2022 will only make Moscow stronger, Fico added.
The Slovak premier also said Ukraine was ""not a sovereign, independent country"" due to it being ""under the absolute influence of the US."" He criticized the EU for making ""a huge mistake"" of following Washington's lead when it comes to dealing with Kiev, instead of developing its own ""sovereign"" view on the issue.
As for his talks this week with Shmygal, Fico promised to tell his Ukrainian counterpart that he's against Kiev's membership in NATO, as that would be ""exactly the basis of World War Three,"" and to reiterate that President Vladimir Zelensky's government won't be getting any more weapons from Bratislava.
The prime minister's interview caused angry reaction in Kiev, with the head of the Ukrainian parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee Aleksandr Merezhko demanded that Fico's trip to Ukraine be canceled for his ""disgraceful statements"" that crossed ""the red line.""
""Every country should have at least minimal self-respect. It's absolutely unacceptable to pretend that nothing is happening when the leader of another state makes statements that question the sovereignty of a state"" that he's about to visit, Merezhko wrote on Facebook.
Fico made a comeback as Slovakia's prime minister in October after his party won the snap election in the EU country, campaigning on promises of, among other measures, cutting military aid to Kiev and improving ties with Moscow.

However, JD(U)'s ally RJD has termed BJP's move a ""political gimmick.""Earlier today, the government announced the posthumous award of the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor, to Karpoori Thakur. Following the announcement, family members of the late Bihar CM exchanged sweets in recognition of the forthcoming Bharat Ratna honor.
Soon after the government announced that Karpoori Thakur would be posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, his son and JD(U) MP Ram Nath Thakur said that he didn't see it from the side of politics.
""I want to thank the Central government from my side as well as on behalf of my party and people of Bihar...I don't see it from the side of politics. His (Karpoori Thakur's) 100th birthday is tomorrow so maybe in view of that Central govt took this decision,"" Thakur said.
Meanwhile, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president Chirag Paswan expressed express gratitude to the Government and the Prime Minister.
""I express gratitude to the Government of India and the Prime Minister. Bharat Ratna for Karpoori Thakur had been a long-pending demand of the people of Bihar as well as the entire country...Today, the PM honoured that demand of the people"" Paswan said.
Bihar LoP and BJP MLA Vijay Kumar Sinha said that the PM has honoured all Biharis by honouring 'Jannayak' Karpoori Thakur with the Bharat Ratna.

Entire Bihar is expressing gratitude to the PM because this is an honour for the entire state,"" Sinha said.
Union Minister Pashupati Kumar Paras said that the decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is ""historic.""""PM Narendra Modi has made a historic decision. The people of Bihar and the entire country are thankful to him for this decision...The PM made a historic decision. He will now be considered a messiah of the backward and Dalits,"" Paras said.

""He connected the poor, the deprived and the backward to the mainstream...I express gratitude to the Prime Minister for conferring the Bharat Ratna on him. This is an honour of the poor and their voice, of the backwards...Several of the previous governments used to think about only the people around them.

""First of all, I would like to express gratitude to PM Narendra Modi. Karpoori Thakur's entire life was dedicated to the poor and deprived...Those who do politics in his name never thought for him, they just did politics in his name. Parties formed the government with Congress but Karpoori Thakur did not get the honour,"" Rai said.
BJP MP Sushil Modi said that PM Narendra Modi has done that historic work which no other PM could do to date.
""Narendra Modi has done that historic work which no other PM could do till date. Son of an OBC - Narendra Modi - has honoured a crusader of OBC with the Bharat Ratna. Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav used to demand the Bharat Ratna but why could they not do it when they were Union Ministers? Narendra Modi is fulfilling the dreams of Karpoori Thakur,"" Sushil Modi said.
He further said that no one else could do this, only PM Modi has the strength to do this.
""He has declared to give Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award to the person who fought for poor people. Karpoori Thakur's entire life was dedicated to poor people, the way PM Modi is working for poor people. PM Modi is the only one who is fulfilling the dreams of Karpoori Thakur,"" he added.
Bihar BJP chief Samrat Choudhary called it a historic decision and thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh said that this honour was for the pride of the poor, the deprived - someone who had become an example with his simplicity and honesty - Jannayak Karpoori Thakur.

While Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar praised the Centre, his alliance partner in the state RJD said it was done to get votes.
RJD's Mrityunjay Tiwari said the BJP was verbally abusing Karpoori Thakur when he was alive and did not remember him for 9 years.
""Central Government decided to award Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur. The BJP was verbally abusing him while he was alive and did not remember him for 9 years. Our party and leader Lalu Yadav were demanding Bharat Ratna for him continuously. Now that elections are near, they are remembering Karpoori Thakur and awarded him the Bharat Ratna. They are remembering him for votes,"" Tiwari said.
This prestigious award is a tribute to Karpoori Thakur's lifelong dedication to the upliftment of the underprivileged sections of society and his relentless fight for Social Justice. Known affectionately as 'Jan Nayak' (People's Leader), Thakur's simplicity in his personal conduct was highly inspiring and his contribution to Indian politics has been monumental.
Former Bihar CM was born on January 24, 1924, and passed on February 17, 1988.
Thakur was born in 1924 in one of the most backward sections of society - the Nai Samaj. He was a remarkable leader whose political journey was marked by his unwavering commitment to the marginalised sections of society.
He served as the Chief Minister of Bihar and was a key figure in the struggle against social discrimination and inequality. His commitment to affirmative action gave representation and opportunities to the poor, oppressed, exploited and deprived sections of the country.
Embarking on his political career with the Praja Socialist Party, he later joined forces with the Janata Party during his initial tenure as the chief minister of Bihar from 1977 to 1979. Over time, he established connections with the Janata Dal, marking a significant shift in his political affiliation. (ANI)"

He went on to say he looked forward to working with Taiwan's government on various issues, including the double taxation on American and Taiwanese businesses and individuals.
Taiwan's Ministry of Finance has long been seeking a double taxation relief agreement with the U.S. to protect their mutual interests amid an acceleration of economic exchanges and business activities.
Such endeavours have seen some progress on the U.S. side recently.
On Jan. 19, with bipartisan support, the US House Committee on Ways and Means advanced a bill addressing double taxation for American and Taiwanese businesses and individuals, sending it to the House for a full floor vote.
Bera, meanwhile, stressed that the congressional Taiwan Caucus, the largest caucus on Capitol Hill, represented the ""steadfast support"" of the American people for Taiwan.
The Democrat called out Beijing for its intrusive actions that he said had altered the status quo of the Taiwan Strait while urging democratic nations to stand in solidarity in the face of challenges posed by China.
In her remarks, Tsai, who is set to leave office in May after completing her two four-year terms, thanked both Diaz Balart and Bera for their staunch support for Taiwan.
She added that Taiwan would continue working to broaden its exchanges with the US and expand links with the international community.
The two lawmakers also conveyed the same messages during their earlier meeting with Lai, who is the incumbent vice president and expected to take office on May 20, according to the Presidential Office.
Lai, in return, reiterated his pledges to continue Tsai's policies, which include striving to maintain the status quo of the Taiwan Strait and boosting Taiwan's defense capability.
As per the Central News Agency Taiwan report the Tsai also met with a Lithuanian parliamentarian group led by Parliamentarian Matas Maldeikis at the Presidential Office on Thursday, during which both sides reaffirmed their commitment to further enhance bilateral ties based on their shared values of freedom and democracy.
The 11-member Lithuanian delegation features three deputy speakers, namely, Vytautas Mitalas, Radvile Morkunaite-Mikuleniene and Julius Sabatauskas, and other parliamentarians from different parties.
The delegation also met with Lai separately on Thursday as part of their six-day visit to Taiwan from Jan 21-26. (ANI)"
3M8RM0C04O_OR86YBRBV2GNDQU,Central Asia Seen as Key to Breaking China's Rare Earth Monopoly,"Voice of America 26th January 2024, 10:05 GMT+11","Voice of America 26th January 2024, 10:05 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106673/central-asia-seen-as-key-to-breaking-chinas-rare-earth-monopoly,"WASHINGTON - U.S. officials hoping to break China's near monopoly on the production of rare earth elements needed for many cutting-edge technologies should engage the governments of Central Asia to develop high concentrations of REEs found in the region, says a new report.
The study by the U.S.-based International Tax and Investment Center warns that a failure to act could leave China with a 'decisive advantage' in the sector, which is crucial to green energy, many new weapons systems and other advanced technologies.
'As the uses for these minerals has expanded, so too has global competition for them in a time of sharply increasing geostrategic and geo-economic tension,' the report says.
'Advanced economies with secure, reliable access to REEs enjoy economic advantages in manufacturing, and corresponding economic disadvantages accrue for those without this access.'
China, which accounts for most of the world's rare earth mining within its own borders, has not yet had to seek additional supplies from Central Asia, which enjoys plentiful reserves of minerals ranging from iron and nonferrous metals to uranium.
But, the report says, 'the massive size of the Chinese economy and the Chinese Communist Party's conscious efforts to dominate the REE sector globally mean such increases are a matter of time.'

Oil-rich Kazakhstan, the region's economic giant, holds the world's largest chromium reserves and the second-largest stocks of uranium, while also possessing other critical elements.
Report co-author Ariel Cohen says it is up to the governments of Central Asia to create the investment climate for development of these resources.
'They may be the next big thing in Central Asia as the engine of economic growth,' Cohen said this week during a panel discussion at the Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.
Across Central Asia, experts note, REEs are found in substantial volumes in the Kazakh steppe and uplands as well as in the Tien Shan mountains across Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, and in the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan.
Monazite, zircon, apatite, xenotime, pyrochlore, allanite and columbite are among Central Asia's most abundant rare metals and minerals.
In 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey listed 384 REE occurrences in the region: 160 in Kazakhstan, 87 in Uzbekistan, 75 in Kyrgyzstan, 60 in Tajikistan, and two in Turkmenistan.
US Ambassador to Kazakhstan Outlines US Engagement in Central Asia
Wesley Hill, another expert on Central Asia's mineral reserves, says production of rare earths at present 'is almost wholly monopolized by China.'
'Depending on how you count, between 80 to 90% of REE refining is controlled by China and done directly inside of China,' Hill said.
But, he argued, despite China's heavy involvement in Central Asia, it has yet to fully take over the region's rare earth sector. 'So, this means that Central Asia is very much at a crossroads,"" he said. ""Central Asia has the opportunity to expand its REE production without being wholly dependent on China.'
Central Asia is currently in a position where it can develop its REE refining capacities both for its national development strategies and to break the Chinese monopoly, Hill said.
'But this is only going to happen with good policy, both from the American side and the Central Asian side.'
Ambassador John Herbst, Washington's former top diplomat in Uzbekistan and Ukraine, says the region's REE assets are 'simply another reason for enhanced engagement by the West.'
He said he is not sure that Central Asian governments appreciate how important rare earths can be to their development. 'But I do know that the countries of Central Asia want a closer relationship with the United States, and that is one important part of their maintaining their hard-won independence.'
Herbst added that the United States and Central Asia have a common interest in working together to develop the region's rare earths 'for the economy of the future.'
'We have an ability to innovate that far exceeds [China's]. Their innovation is based largely on taking our technology.'
Central Asian Trade Corridor Gains Interest Amid Regional Tensions
Suriya Evans-Pritchard Jayanti, who serves as energy transition counsel at the U.S. Department of Commerce, says the region is eager for investment.
'It is a development opportunity. Particularly with the geostrategic energy realignment after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but also, because of the energy transition. Lithium and other REE are necessary for different parts of that transition. So that's primarily an economic incentive,' she said.
She pointed to the Mineral Strategic Partnership Initiative run by the U.S. State Department's Bureau on Energy Resources, which is able to promote foreign direct investment in the region while providing technical assistance in the mining sector.
Cohen said the Central Asian countries cannot wait long to develop their rare earths. 'There is a competition, and the African countries, Latin American countries and others will compete increasingly.'

Wilder Alejandro Sanchez, who heads a consultancy called Second Floor Strategies, says Central Asia needs a rare earth research center that can provide timely information to prospective customers and investors.
Transportation is key, Sanchez said. 'It's not just about finding and mining them. You have to get them to the international market.'
Access from the landlocked region at present is limited to China's Belt and Road infrastructure or routes through Russia. Sanchez and others recommend using the Middle Corridor, also called the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, which can carry goods to Europe across the Caspian and Black seas.
These experts also say progress will depend on regional governments overcoming their traditional secretiveness regarding natural resources. They emphasize the importance of transparency, the rule of law, adherence to best practices and compliance with international norms if they hope to attract Western investment."

This year, India is set to commemorate its 75th Republic Day, marking the adoption of the constitution on January 26, 1950, and the attainment of sovereignty. The constituent assembly held its first session in December 1946 and the last session in November 1949, following which the constitution was enacted a year later with Dr BR Ambedkar as the head of the drafting committee.
Dr Ambedkar came to be known as the 'Father of Constitution'.
The theme of this year's Republic Day will be-- 'Viksit Bharat' and 'Bharat: Loktantra ki Matruka', which symbolise the country's aspirations and its role as the nurturer of democracy.
Earlier, Defence Secretary Giridhar Aramane said women marching contingents will form the major chunk of the parade, with most of the tableaux of States and Union Territories (UTs) and Central Ministries and Organisations showcasing the country's rich cultural diversity, unity and progress.
He reiterated that the themes have been selected in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's views that 'India is truly a mother of democracy'.
The parade, which will commence at 10:30 a.m., will continue for around 90 minutes.
For the first time, the parade will be heralded by 100 women artists playing Indian musical instruments. The parade would commence with the music of Sankh, Naadswaram, Nagada, etc. to be played by women artists.
The parade will also witness an all-women Tri-Service contingent marching down Kartavya Path for the first time. The CAPF contingent will also consist of women personnel.
""The best representation of women will be seen in this year's Republic Day parade,"" the Defence Secretary said.
For the third consecutive year, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Culture will present a cultural extravaganza 'Vande Bharatam' on the theme 'Cultural expression of women power- accomplishment through resolve'. Around 1,500 female dancers will mesmerise the audience with a colourful performance, giving the message of unity in diversity.
The ceremony will start with the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the National War Memorial, where he will lead the nation in paying solemn tributes to the fallen heroes by laying a wreath. Thereafter, the Prime Minister and other dignitaries will head to the saluting dais at Kartavya Path to witness the parade.
French President Emmanuel Macron will be the chief guest at this year's Republic Day Parade. A 95-member marching contingent and a 33-member band contingent from France will also take part in the parade. Along with the aircraft of the Indian Air Force, one Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft and two Rafale aircraft of the French Air Force will participate in the fly-past.
Around 13,000 special guests have also been invited to witness the parade this year, providing an opportunity for people from all walks of life to witness the diverse facets of the country.
A total of 25 tableaux--16 states/UTs and nine ministries/departments--will roll down the Kartavya Path during the parade. The States/UTs are-- Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, Manipur, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Ladakh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana. The ministries are-- Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of External Affairs, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, Ministry of Culture, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Election Commission of India, and Central Public Works Department (CPWD).
Like each year, the tableaux have been selected by an expert committee comprising eminent persons in the fields of art, culture, painting, sculpture, music, architecture, choreography, etc.
The Ministry of Culture will be showcasing the 'Anant Sutra-- The Endless Thread' textile installation at Kartavya Path during the parade.
It will be installed behind the spectators seated in the enclosures. The Anant Sutra is a visually stunning tribute to the saree, India's timeless gift to the world of fashion. This unique installation will showcase nearly 1,900 sarees and drapes from every corner of the country, mounted at a height with wooden frames along the Kartavya Path. It will have QR codes that can be scanned to know the details about the weaving and embroidery arts used in it.
Several beneficiaries of the government schemes and the achievers in the Self-Help groups (SHGs) are being invited to attend the Republic Day celebrations and they will sit opposite to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
""PM Street Vendor's, AtmaNirbhar Nidhi, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana--there are around 30 such programmes benefiting various cross-sections of the people. They are the people at the grassroots level who represent India, who not only have benefited from the government but also come on top of it. Those are the people we are calling, giving them the main enclosure opposite the PM. They will watch the parade by sitting opposite PM,"" the Defence Secretary earlier said.
Republic Day is celebrated with the President unfurling the national flag, followed by spectacular military and cultural pageantry.
The Beating Retreat ceremony, which will be held at Vijay Chowk on January 29, 2024, will witness all Indian tunes to mark the culmination of the 75th Republic Day celebrations.
The tunes will be played by bands of the Indian Army, Indian Navy, Indian Air Force, and CAPFs before a distinguished audience comprising President Droupadi Murmu, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, other Union Ministers, senior officials and the general public.
It is held annually on January 29 at Vijay Chowk and is a centuries-old tradition that dates back to the early 1950s, when Major Roberts of the Indian Army indigenously developed the unique ceremony of display by the massed bands.
It marks a centuries-old military tradition when the troops ceased fighting, sheathed their arms, withdrew from the battlefield, and returned to the camps at sunset at the sound of the retreat.(ANI)"

Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Wu Qian, a spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, made the remarks in response to media queries about the ongoing NATO military exercise, the largest one since the Cold War.
NATO, as a regional military organization, has initiated and taken part in global conflicts since its inception, Wu stated.
Furthermore, he said, in recent years, NATO has constantly expanded toward the Asia-Pacific region, employing the unfounded ""China threat"" narrative as a pretext for bloc confrontation, and posing a threat to regional security.
Wu urged NATO to stop fabricating lies and taking dangerous actions that cause chaos in the Asia-Pacific region, treat China and the development of the Chinese armed forces objectively and rationally, and do something beneficial to world peace, the spokesperson said."

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday lauded Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for advancing the country economically while promoting a foreign policy plan that is driven by its ""strategic interests.""
Speaking at a meeting with students in Kaliningrad on January 25 to mark 'Russian Student Day', the Russian leader noted that India is pursuing ""an independent foreign policy, which is not easy in the modern world."" He added that ""India has the right to do so,"" and, under the leadership of Modi, it has effectively ""exercised"" this right. According to the Russian president, this has helped New Delhi's partners build relationships that are predictable in both the short and long term.

""This is practically important: Can we rely on a country or its leadership, or will it make decisions tomorrow that don't even align with its national interests? India does not engage in such ""games"" - I can confirm this. There is tough, nationally-oriented leadership in the country,"" Putin said.
He also highlighted the robust and growing ties between Russia and India, emphasizing the deep-rooted historical connections that neither country has forgotten.
""It's well known to everyone, and in India, I know, it is remembered: The Soviet Union was the country that supported India's struggle for independence and supported the initial stages of the formation of Indian statehood, economy, industry, and social sphere,"" Putin noted. He also pointed out that, in recent years, Russia has made substantial investments in India, including a deal for the acquisition of an Indian oil refinery and supportive infrastructure by Russia's Rosneft, totaling $23 billion.
Hailing the economic policies of the Modi-led government, including its 'Make in India' initiative - which aims to boost local manufacturing across sectors - the Russian president acknowledged that the South Asian nation was developing at ""astonishing rates."" The latest GDP growth projection for India in the 2023-24 financial year has recently been pegged at 7.3%. ""This is also thanks to the leadership qualities of the current prime minister: It is under his leadership that India has achieved such growth rates,"" Putin said.

The Russian president underscored the significance of the burgeoning Indian diaspora in Russia, as well as collaboration beyond economic spheres, including nuclear energy, scientific research and clean energy solutions, education, and the pharmaceutical industry. Putin also emphasized the importance of cultural exchange between the two countries, highlighting the popularity of Indian films in Russia and the growing interest in the Russian language in India.
It is not the first time the Russian leader has openly praised India's economic achievements and foreign policy decisions. Last month, he complimented Modi for standing up for his people despite pressure from global superpowers. ""I can't imagine Modi can be intimidated, threatened, or forced in favor of taking any action or decision against the national interest of India or its people. And there is such pressure, I know,"" Putin said.

Popular Russian rapper Baby Melo, whose real name is Goga Meladze, was arrested on stage while performing a set in St Petersburg on Saturday.
Police said they detained a total of 23 people between the ages of 15 and 19 during the event, including rapper Badr (Orkhan Akhmedov) who was performing alongside Meladze.
In a video posted from the concert at the Gian Hall club, police officers can be seen walking on stage while Meladze is performing and escorting him out of the venue. Notably, the vocal track continued to play after the officers took away his microphone.
In another video shot outside the concert hall, the 15-year-old rapper is seen being placed into a police van as a group of teenagers chant his name.
According to local news outlets citing police press service reports, officers were initially called to the scene by local residents who had complained of outdoor alcohol consumption and swearing by the club visitors.
After detaining the teenagers, police filed reports on illegal public alcohol consumption and petty hooliganism. However, all of the detainees were later released to their parents except for Meladze, who was taken to a temporary detention center as no one came to collect him.
As reported by the Fontanka news outlet, his mother eventually came for him and he was released on Sunday, writing on his social media account that he is free, and urging his followers not to use curse words.
The rapper's parents, meanwhile, have called their son's detention ""lawlessness,"" insisting that he did not use any expletives during the show. They also complained that they were not informed about his detention by the police, instead learning about it from Meladze's friends.
Previously, Meladze drew the attention of Ekaterina Mizulina, the head of the Safe Internet League non-profit, which promotes ""media literacy."" In August she filed a complaint against the teenager for promoting drugs in his songs, and called on the police to investigate him in September for posting a video, in which he can be seen driving a car on a highway. The legal driving age in Russia is 18, meaning the rapper does not have a driver's license.
Commenting on his latest arrest, Mizulina described ""baby melo and his friends"" as a real ""teenage gang"" who ""promote drugs, incite ethnic hatred, insult Russians and Slavs in general, demonstrate weapons on social media, film themselves shooting guns inside apartment buildings and drive recklessly without a license.""
""Why law enforcement agencies did not pay attention to this for such a long time is unclear,"" Mizulina wrote.

""The Arabic-Persian inscription found inside a room mentions that the mosque was built in the 20th regnal year of Aurangzeb (1676-77 CE). Hence, the pre-existing structure appears to have been destroyed in the 17th century, during the reign of Aurangzeb, and part of it was modified and reused in the existing structure. Based on scientific studies/ survey carried out, study of architectural remains, exposed features and artefacts, inscriptions, art and sculptures, it can be said that there existed a Hindu temple prior to the construction of the existing structure,"" the ASI said in its report.
""Based on the scientific studies and observations on central chamber and main entrance of the pre-existing structure in existing structure, western chamber and western wall, reuse of pillars and pilasters of pre-existing structure in the existing structure, inscriptions on the existing structure, Arabic and Persian inscription on the loose stone, sculptural remains in cellars, etc.,it can be said that there existed a large Hindu temple, prior to the construction of the existing structure,"" the report further said.
The ASI survey was ordered by the district court after the Hindu petitioners claimed the 17th-century mosque was constructed over a pre-existing temple.
""In compliance of the order of the District Court, Varanasi, dated July 21, 2023, affirmed by the High Court of Allahabad by order dated August 3, 2023, and the Supreme Court of India by order dated August 4, 2023, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) carried out a scientific investigation and survey in a 2150.5-square-meter area fenced with steel grills in and around the existing structure (excluding the areas sealed by the orders of the Supreme Court). All the objects which were noticed during the scientific investigation or survey in the complex were duly documented. These objects include inscriptions, sculptures, coins, architectural fragments, pottery, and objects of terracotta, stone, metal, and glass,"" the report said.
Referring to the central chamber and main entrance of the pre-existing structure, the ASI report asserted, ""This temple had a big central chamber and at least one chamber to the north, south, east, and west, respectively. Remains of three chambers to the north, south and west still exist, but the remains of the chamber to the east and any further extension of it could not be ascertained physically, as the area is covered under aplatform with stone flooring.""""Central chamber of the pre-existing structure forms the central hall of the existing structure. This structure with thick and strong walls, along with all architectural components and floral decorations, was used as the main hall of the mosque. Animal figures carved at the lower ends of the decorated arches of the pre-existing structure were mutilated, and the inner part of the dome is decorated with geometric designs. The main entrance to the central chamber of the temple was from the west, which was blocked by stone masonry. This entrance was decorated with carvings of animals and birds and an ornamental torana. This large, arched gateway had another smaller entrance. The figure carved on the lalatbimba of this small entrance has been chopped off. A small part of it is visible, as most of it is covered with bricks, stone, and mortar that were used to block the entrance. Remains of a bird figure carved on the doorsill appears to be of a cock,"" it added.
The report said, ""On the other side of the blocked main entrance quibla was made. It is simple without any decoration as such and pilasters on either side are also damaged unevenly.""Highlighting the western chamber and western wall, the ASI report said, ""The eastern half of the western chamber still exists, whereas the superstructure of the western half has been destroyed. This chamber was also connected with the north and south chambers through a corridor accessible from their north and south entrances, respectively. The remains of this corridor on the northwest side came to light on the removal of garbage and debris. The western wall of the existing structure is the remaining part of a pre-existing Hindu temple.""""This wall, made of stones and decorated with horizontal mouldings, is formed by the remaining parts of the western chamber, the western projections of the central chamber, and the western walls of the two chambers on its north and south. The central chamber attached to the wall still exists unchanged, whereas modifications have been made to both the side chambers. All these chambers had an opening in all the four directions. Decorated arched entrances of central, north and south chambers towards west have been blocked. The arched openings of north and south halls were converted into steps leading to the roof. Steps made in arched entrance of the north hall are still in use. Steps made in arched entrance of the south were blocked by stone masonry at some later date, however, one can still enter them from the roof. A large decorated entrance to the central chamber through the western chamber was blocked by stone masonry,"" it added.
Mentioning the pillar and pilaster, the ASI report said that for the enlargement of the mosque and constructing 'sahan', parts of the pre-existing temple including pillars and pilasters were reused with little modifications.
""The pillars and pilasters used in the existing structure were studied systematically and scientifically. For the enlargement of the mosque and constructing sahan, parts of the pre-existing temple including pillars and pilasters were reused with little modifications. Minute study of the pillars and pilasters in corridor suggest that they were originally part of the pre-existing Hindu temple. For their reuse in the existing structure, vyala figures carved on either side of lotus medallion were mutilated and after removing the stone mass from the corners that space was decorated with floral design. This observation is supported by two similar pilasters still existing on the northern and southern wall of the western chamber in their original place,"" the report said.
The ASI further noted that during the present survey a total of 34 inscriptions were recorded and 32 estampages were taken.
""During the survey, a number of inscriptions were noticed on the existing and pre-existing structures. A total of 34 inscriptions were recorded during the present survey and 32 estampages were taken. These are, in fact, inscriptions on the stones of the pre-existing Hindu temples, which have been re-used during the construction/ repair of the existing structure. They include inscriptions in Devanagari, Grantha, Telugu and Kannada scripts. Reuse of earlier inscriptions in the structure, suggest that the earlier structures were destroyed and their parts were reused in construction/repair of the existing structure. Three names of deities such as Janardhana, Rudra, and Umesvara are found in these inscriptions. Terms such as Maha-muktimandapa mentioned in three inscriptions is of great significance,"" it said.
Referring to the inscriptions on loose stone, the ASI in its survey report said, ""ASI had in its custody record of an inscription engraved on a loose stone which recorded construction of the mosque in the 20th regnal year of Hadrat Alamgir i.e., Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. This inscription also recorded that in the year A.H. 1207 (1792-93 CE), the mosque was repaired with sahan, etc. The photograph of this stone inscription was recorded in ASI records in the year 1965-66. During the recent survey, this stone with inscription was recovered from a room in the mosque. However, the lines relating to construction of the mosque and its expansion have been scratched out.""The ASI in its survey mentioned that pillars from earlier temples were reused while making cellars in eastern part of the platform.
""A series of cellars were also constructed to the east to create additional space and a large platform in front of the mosque for accommodating large number of people for prayers. Pillars from earlier temples were reused while making cellars in eastern part of the platform. A pillar decorated with bells, niches for keeping lamps on all four sides, and bearing an inscription of Samvat 1669 is reused in cellar N2,"" it said.
""Sculptures of Hindu deities and carved architectural members were found buried under the dumped soil in cellar S2,"" it added. (ANI)"

The remarks were made by Michele Taylor during the 45th Session of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) at the United Nations today.
""We recommend that China release all our...detained individuals , many of...who were named by the UN working group, cease harrasments, surveillance, and threats against individuals brought in China, including Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong,"" Taylor said.
The US has also called for the cessation of discrimination against individuals, culture, language, religion, or belief. It also called for putting an end to forcible assimilation policies, including boarding schools in Tibet and Xinjiang.
""...cease discrimination against individuals, cuilture, language, religion or belief and forcible assimilation policies including boarding schools in Tibet and Xinjiang...and torture unjust, residential detention and persecution throughout China, and forced labour, marriage, birth control, sterilisation, abortion and family separation in Xinjiang,"" the American diplomat said.
Michele Taylor is an American diplomat who is the United States ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Council.
She called for the repeal of national security counter-espionage, counter-terrorism and sedition laws, including the national security law in Hong Kong, and ""repressive laws against women LGBTQ and migrants workers in Hong Kong and Macau,"" she went on to say.
""We condemn the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and transnational repressions, to silence individuals abroad,"" she said.
Meanwhile, India gave China three recommendations during the UPR which included, ""Continue taking steps to ensure fullest enjoyment of basic human rights by its people through inclusive and sustainable development.""India told China to ""continue taking measures to promote gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls.""Moreover, India also urged China to ""continue to play a constructive role in the realisation of aspirations of developing countries including through reform of mulitateral institutions.""China's human rights record is facing international scrutiny during the fourth Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Working Group session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, taking place from January 22 to February 2.
This review is a unique opportunity for member states to hold China accountable for its human rights obligations, according to analysts and rights advocates.
The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a peer-review process under the auspices of the UN Human Rights Council, where UN Member States assess each other's human rights records, their fulfilment of human rights obligations and commitments, and provide recommendations to the State under review.
This is China's fourth appearance before this mechanism. The last one was in November 2018. At the time, countries called out the existence of mass detention camps for Uyghurs a few months after they were revealed by a UN committee.
During China's 3rd UPR in November 2018, China received 346 recommendations from 150 countries, and accepted 284 of them, with many questionably noted as 'accepted and already implemented.'Despite a seemingly high acceptance rate, China broadly rejected recommendations on the rights of Uyghurs and Tibetans, cooperation with the UN and unrestricted UN access to all regions of the country, enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention, the death penalty and the ratification of international treaties.
Since 2018, mounting human rights abuses have been largely documented by a range of UN human rights bodies.
After the narrow defeat of a resolution calling for a debate on the situation in Xinjiang at the Human Rights Council, in September 2022, the UPR is one of the few spaces left where China's record can be openly discussed, challenged and scrutinised on the basis of UN information. (ANI)"

French President Emmanuel Macron landed in India on Thursday ahead of the country's Republic Day celebrations on January 26, where he will be the chief guest. Macron started his visit by traveling to the city of Jaipur, a popular tourist attraction in Rajasthan state, where he was received by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The two leaders traveled in an open-top vehicle through a short stretch in the heart of the city, beginning from Jantar Mantar, an 18th-century observatory which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Modi then treated Macron to a cup of masala tea at a local stall.
The two leaders are expected to hold bilateral talks covering economic, defense, space, and cybersecurity, before heading to New Delhi, where they will oversee a Republic Day parade. A 95-member French marching contingent accompanied by a military band will take part in the event. Macron's visit marks France's sixth participation as chief guest in India's national day parade - the most of any other nation. Republic Day marks the adoption of the Indian Constitution in 1950, symbolizing the country's transformation into a republic.
Last year, Modi attended France's Bastille Day Parade as guest of honor at the invitation of Macron. During the visit, the countries drew up a bilateral roadmap for the next 25 years. The document covers the strengthening of economic ties, as well as identifying joint initiatives on areas including renewable energy, green hydrogen, artificial intelligence, and semiconductors.
France is keen to bolster collaboration with India across various sectors, from energy to space and defense, ""despite frictions"" over the two countries' positions on the Ukraine conflict, the AP reported. India has not supported Western sanctions against Russia and has expanded its engagement with Moscow in the past two years.
India's plans to procure 26 French Rafale fighter aircraft for its navy are expected to feature on the agenda for the talks with Macron. The purchase was approved by India's Defense Acquisition Council last year, but the deal is yet to be inked. The council also greenlit the purchase of three Scorpene submarines, jointly developed by France and Spain.
In a statement, Macron's office reaffirmed his commitment to fostering closer dialogue with India, recognizing its significance as a ""key player on the international scene"" in terms of demography and in economic, scientific, and diplomatic areas.

As a crucial border country, Bulgaria stands to benefit from the pact's mandatory solidarity mechanism, reshaping how the EU accepts, assesses, and manages illegal migrants.
In an interview for """" (which will be published on Saturday) MEP Elena Yoncheva, the European Parliament's coordinator for the 11 regulations and directives, sheds light on the advantageous elements of the new rules for countries like Bulgaria. The pact, expected to be voted on in the upcoming European Parliament session, prioritizes criteria such as family ties and completed education over the entry country, placing Bulgaria in a favorable position.
Yoncheva emphasizes that the rules aim to facilitate the screening of illegal migrants before they enter the EU, enabling swift actions like returning potential threats and differentiating between economic migrants and those seeking refugee or humanitarian protection.
The pivotal aspect of the new regulations is the introduction of a mandatory relocation mechanism. In the event of a crisis, countries can seek assistance from others, and the European Commission will oversee the fair distribution of migrants among EU members based on population and GDP.
Yoncheva highlights that in times of border pressure, the EU will be obligated to redistribute a minimum of 30,000 migrants annually. However, in crisis scenarios, there will be no set limit on the number of migrants to be redistributed.
The interview will provide detailed insights into the enhanced checks at the EU's external borders and outline the financial commitments that both the EU and individual member states will make to support border nations. Additionally, Yoncheva will address whether migrants caught within the EU will be returned to border countries and explore the effectiveness of physical barriers like walls and fences around the union.

The charges included disobedience to the legal order of public servants, violation of permission conditions, and obstruction to government servants while discharging their lawful duties.
The Congress had planned a 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra' from Meghalaya towards Kamrup(rural) through Guwahati city, police said. To avoid any inconvenience to the public, permission was given to carry the Yatra through the Khanapara bypass-Koinadhara- Basistha Chariali- Beharbari- Lokhra Chariali- Gorchuk Chariali- Boragaon Chariali- Jalukbari upto Saraighat bridge through National Highway subject to clear-cut condition that they cannot enter the congested areas of the city through any route and that the Yatra will pass through only approved route, they added.
Sufficient security measures were also put in place to ensure that no untoward incident happens as Rahul Gandhi is a Z ASL CRPF Protectee on an all-India basis category and changing the approved route would have jeopardized the security of the protected, police said.
Also, the program was approved by all stakeholders including members of Congress during Advance Security Liaison (ASL) meeting conducted on January 21 with all stakeholders, they added.
However, when the Yatra arrived near Khanapara Traffic point on NH-27, to utter surprise of the administration, the leaders of the Congress headed by Rahul Gandhi, Jitender Singh, KC Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh, Srinivas BV, Kanhaiyya Kumar, Gaurav Gogoi, Debobrata Saikia, Bhupen Bora, Jakir Hussain Sikdar, Ramen Kumar Sarma and others instigated the crowd with a criminal conspiracy and took them towards Guwahati city by deviating from the approved route and thus violating the agreed upon ASL terms and the permission given by Guwhati City Commissionerate, police said.
As a result, the crowd turned violent, and unruly and the unlawful assembly further proceeded towards GS Road (Guwahati City) thereby obstructing the public way, that is, NH 37, the release said.
Despite advisories to adhere to the designated route by senior Police officers present, the crowd instigated, led, and participated by senior Congress leaders forcefully changed the course towards the GS Road by breaking the barricades erected by police and assaulting Police personnel performing lawful duty, police said.
Although the Police tried to persuade the leaders and the crowd to carry out the event as per ASL, the leaders bluntly refused and incited the crowd with inflammatory words to break the barricades and change the route.
As a result, the crowd became violent and four Police personnel including SI Tirtha Deka of Basistha PS got injured and one Police personnel namely LNK45 Babul Hajong of 8th Assam Police Battalion sustained grievous injuries.
An FIR has been registered at Basistha Police Station under Sections 120(B), 143, 147, 188, 283, 353, 332, 333, and 427 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and is being investigated, the release said. (ANI)"

Among the injured in the suburb of Tekstilshchik were two children, said Denis Pushilin, the local leader.
The claims could not be independently verified by The Associated Press. The Ukrainian military made an official statement denying responsibility for the attack.
Both sides in the war have increasingly relied on longer-range attacks this winter amid largely unchanged positions on the 1,500-kilometre (930-mile) front line in the nearly two-year-old war.
The artillery shells that hit the area had been fired from the area of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west, Pushilin said, adding that emergency services responded to the scene.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ""strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today's shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine"", according to a UN spokesperson, adding that all such attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law.
Donetsk is one of four regions in Ukraine that Russia annexed illegally in 2022, months after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.
Russia's foreign ministry also blamed Ukraine and described the strike as a ""terrorist attack"".
Also on Sunday, a fire broke out at a chemical transport terminal at Russia's Ust-Luga port following two explosions, regional officials said. Local media said the Baltic Sea port, 165 kilometres (about 100 miles) southwest of St Petersburg, had been attacked by Ukrainian drones, causing a gas tank to explode.
The blaze was at a site run by Russia's second-largest natural gas producer, Novatek.
In a statement to Russian media outlet RBC, the company blamed the fire on an ""external influence"", saying operations at the port were paused.
Yuri Zapalatsky, the head of the Kingisepp district on the Gulf of Finland where the port is located, said there were no casualties but the area was on high alert.
News outlet Fontanka reported that two drones had been detected flying towards St Petersburg on Sunday morning, but were redirected towards the Kingisepp district. AP could not independently verify the reports.
Russia's defence ministry did not report any drone activity in the Kingisepp area in its daily briefing. It said that four Ukrainian drones had been downed in Russia's Smolensk region, and that two more were shot down in the Oryol and Tula regions.
Russian officials previously confirmed a Ukrainian drone had been downed on the outskirts of St Petersburg on Thursday.
Front-line fighting
In fighting on the front line, Russia's defence ministry said Moscow's forces had taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine's Kharkiv region. Ukrainian forces confirmed the settlement had been occupied, but described its capture as temporary.
Ukrainian Ground Forces Command spokesman Volodymyr Fityo said Kyiv's troops had been pulled back to reserve positions from the village, which had a population of about 45 people before the start of the war.
""That's five houses, probably,"" he was quoted as saying by Ukrainian news outlet Hromadske. ""Our main goal is to save the lives of Ukraine's defenders.""
Recent Russian attacks have tried to find gaps in Ukraine's defences by using large numbers of missiles and drones in an apparent effort to saturate air defence systems.
The massive barrages - more than 500 drones and missiles were fired between December 29 and January 2, according to officials in Kyiv - are also using up Ukraine's weapons stockpiles.

A normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel will only be possible if the issue of Palestinian statehood is resolved, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan has said.
The two regional powerhouses have never established diplomatic ties, with Riyadh refusing to recognize the Jewish state as a country. Last year, Saudi and Israeli officials held talks on a potential normalization of bilateral relations under US mediation. However, the incursion into Israel by the Palestinian armed group Hamas on October 7 and the subsequent IDF operation in Gaza reportedly put the process on hold.
During an interview with CNN, which aired on Sunday, bin Farhan was asked if there could be normalized ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel without a credible and irreversible path towards a Palestinian state.
""That's the only way we're going to get the benefit. So, yes, because we need stability and only stability will come through the resolving the Palestinian issue,"" he replied.
The top Saudi diplomat condemned Israel's attacks on Gaza, saying that Riyadh was focused on making sure the bloodshed ends.
""What we are seeing is the Israelis are crushing Gaza, the civilian population of Gaza. This is completely unnecessary, completely unacceptable and has to stop,"" bin Farhan stated.
According to the latest data from Gaza's health ministry, the death toll from the Israeli military operation in the Palestinian enclave has reached 25,105, with 62,681 others wounded. The UN said last month that 85% of Gaza's population has been internally displaced, while 60% of the enclave's infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed.
The Hamas raid into Israel last year left around 1,200 people dead and 240 others taken hostage. More than a half of them remain in captivity.
CNN recorded its interview with bin Farhan on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. During the event in the Swiss Alps, the Saudi diplomat also said Riyadh would ""certainly"" recognize Israel as part of an agreement that would include a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians.

READ MORE: No Palestinian state ? Netanyahu

On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out the possibility of a sovereign Palestinian state, saying that ""Israel must maintain security control over all the territory west of the Jordan River."" The country won't settle for anything, but ""absolute victory"" in Gaza, he insisted.

The pictures and videos shared by the Indian Embassy in Japan showed Indian community members virtually watching the Pran Pratishtha ceremony at the Ram Temple.
In a post shared on X, the Indian Embassy in Japan stated, ""Indian community in Japan celebrates ""Pran Pratishtha"" ceremony of Shree Ram Janam Bhoomi Temple in Ayodhya by Hon'ble Prime Minister.""The idol of Ram Lalla was unveiled on Monday at Shri Ram Janmaboomi Temple in Ayodhya in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The main entrance to the Mandir is situated on the eastern side, which can be approached by ascending 32 stairs through the Singh Dwar. There are a total of five Mandaps (Halls) in the Mandir - Nritya Mandap, Rang Mandap, Sabha Mandap, Prathana Mandap and Kirtan Mandap.

""This is not just a moment of celebration for us all but also one to reflect the coming of age of the Indian society. This occasion is as much about triumph as it is about humility. The world is replete with instances of countries that faced a lot of difficulties resolving historic wrongs and injustices. However, the way we untied the knots and resolved all outstanding issues gives us hope that our future is going to be more beautiful and fulfilling than our past,"" PM Modi said.
The PM said that the construction of the temple, which some feared would set off a firestorm, now stands as a symbol of peace, patience, harmony and integration.
""There was also a time when some people used to say 'Ram Mandir bana toh aag lag jaegi' (the making of the Ram Temple would set off a firestorm). Such people lacked an understanding of the purity of our society, the spirit that binds us all. This majestic abode of Shri Ram Lalla will now stand as a symbol of peace, patience, mutual harmony andsocial unity. The construction of this temple did not set off a fire but exuded a positive energy that has been infectious for us all,"" he added.

The US Supreme Court has authorized federal agents to remove razor wire barricades installed along the Mexican border by Texas Governor Greg Abbott. Amid record numbers of illegal border crossings, Republicans argue that President Joe Biden is ""actively aiding and abetting"" an ""invasion.""
In a 5-4 decision on Monday, the court granted an emergency appeal by the Biden administration and ruled that Abbott must allow federal authorities access to the border. Though nominally conservative, Justices Amy Coney Barrett and John Roberts sided with their three liberal colleagues to grant the appeal. None of the justices explained their decision in writing.
Abbott moved Texas National Guard troops to the border in 2021 and installed around 30 miles of razor-sharp concertina wire at the popular crossing spot of Eagle Pass. When Biden's Department of Homeland Security ordered Border Patrol agents to begin cutting the wire last year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration, accusing the agents of damaging state property in order to ""assist"" migrants to ""illegally cross"" the border.
The Biden administration argued that an unfavourable decision would allow ""state-law regimes"" to supplant federal immigration law and hamper federal agents' ability to ""quickly respond to emergency situations"" along the border.
Republicans reacted to the Supreme Court's decision with outrage. ""This is beyond inaction,"" South Carolina Senator Tim Scott wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday evening. ""President Biden is actively aiding and abetting the largest southern border invasion our country has ever seen.""
""This is not over,"" Abbott tweeted, adding that he ""will continue to defend Texas' constitutional authority to secure the border and prevent the Biden Admin from destroying our property."" In a series of follow-up posts to social media on Tuesday, Abbott said that more concertina wire would be installed, and that the national guard would remain in place.
More than 300,000 migrants crossed the US-Mexico border in December, CBS News reported earlier this month, citing government data. This figure represents a record monthly high and eclipses the previous record set in September. At least 7.5 million people - more than the population of the state of Arizona - have entered the US illegally since Biden took office in 2021, according to US Customs and Border Protection data.
Under Biden's policy of 'catch and release', illegal immigrants are apprehended, detained, and then released into the US with orders to show up at court hearings at a later date. As of December, there is a backlog of more than 3.2 million such cases, and newly arriving immigrants can sometimes expect to wait a decade for their case to be heard, the Associated Press reported last summer.

Lee retired from the former Coast Guard Command as a commander in the Intelligence Division, while Yeh retired from the Coast Guard Administration as commander in the clerical division.
Tsui opened a business in China in 2004 and returned to Taiwan after closing it in 2013.
During his time in China, he was recruited by a state security organization in Shanghai and collected information for Chinese state security. He also introduced Lee to Chinese officials in 2007, the Supreme Court ruling said.
After being recruited, Lee engaged in activities that included developing networks, spying, and collecting confidential documents, the court found.
Central News Agency Taiwan reported that Tsui handed a four-page document titled ""Coast Guard Intelligence Collection Items"" and other confidential documents provided by Lee to Chinese officials in exchange for financial gains totaling 5,000 renminbi New Taiwan dollars 22000.
Yeh was recruited by Lee in 2013. He returned to the Coast Guard Main Branch to collect secret documents from unsuspecting officers and transmitted them to China via Lee in exchange for New Taiwan dollars 15,000.
Lee received a net total of nearly 14,000 renminbi for his efforts in the cases, according to the ruling, Central News Agency Taiwan reported.
Also on Wednesday, Hsin Peng-sheng, a former air defense artillery colonel chief of staff, was found guilty by the Kaohsiung branch of the Taiwan High Court of attempting to develop a network for China, in violation of the National Security Act.
Hsin was sentenced to six months in prison, which can be commuted to a fine. The case can be appealed. (ANI)"

Human Rights Council, where Beijing faced criticism from Western democratic societies over its treatment of Uyghurs, Tibetans and dissidents in Hong Kong.
Tuesday's meeting marked the fourth time that China's rights record has been examined by the council's Universal Periodic Review procedure and the first time since former High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet issued a blistering report on China's treatment of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in China's western Xinjiang region.
The report, which Bachelet released just minutes before she left her post as high commissioner on September 1, 2022, accuses China of having committed ""serious human rights violations"" against the Uyghurs that might amount to crimes against humanity, allegations that China rejected then and rejects now.
UN Rights Chief: China's Treatment of Uyghurs May Constitute Crimes Against HumanityÂ
""We strive to deliver a better life for all people. China sees peoples' aspirations for a better life as the focus of our efforts,"" said Chen Xu, China's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva and head of its 60-member delegation.
""No one is left out or left behind as China builds a modern socialist country in all respects. The people of all ethnic groups are equal and closely united like the seeds of the pomegranate working together for common prosperity and development and for a better life for all,"" he said.
U.N. experts and human rights organizations accuse China of incarcerating more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in so-called vocational centers and of subjecting them to systematic, widespread abuse.
Charges such as those were categorically denied by a member of China's delegation at the council hearing Tuesday: ""We respect and protect their human rights. We maintain Xinjiang's social stability. We guarantee their right to life.""
Chen Xu, head of the Chinese mission to the United Nations in Geneva, right, gestures prior to the review of China's rights record by the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva on Jan. 23, 2024.
The official said, ""In Xinjiang, we combat terrorism according to the law. For seven years there have been no cases of violence and terror. The society enjoys stability and a good life.""
China's delegation also dismissed international criticism of the government's harsh crackdown on pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong since its takeover of the territory.
""Since the establishment of Hong Kong's special administrative region in 1997, the principle of one country, two systems has been the cornerstone of our prosperity and stability,"" said Chan Kwak-ki Eric, chief secretary for administration, Hong Kong.
He accused pro-democracy forces of violent, chaotic behavior. ""With the implementation of the national security law, the days of social disturbance and fear are over. Stability as well as law and order has been restored and our city is back on track,"" he said.

Since more than 160 countries signed up to speak at the UPR, each representative was limited to 45 seconds. This created a somewhat unsettling form of human rights ""speed-dating"" in which delegates rushed through their questions, concerns and recommendations.
Many countries, among them several Muslim countries, went along with China's glowing account of its achievements and efforts to better promote and protect human rights at home. When it came time for them to speak, those friendly countries gave China an easy ride.
They congratulated China on its accomplishments and offered recommendations on issues such as ways to pursue development prospects, preserve the cultural identities of minorities and promote cultural diversity.
Western democracies, on the other hand, were forthright with their concerns, criticisms and demands that China change its ways.
Simon Manley, the United Kingdom's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, demanded that China ""cease persecution and arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and Tibetans and allow genuine freedom of religion or cultural expression without fear of surveillance, torture, forced labor or sexual violence.""
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Michele Taylor, raced through her intervention to get everything she had to say within the 45 seconds allotted to her. She called for the release of all arbitrarily detained individuals and called on China to ""cease harassment, surveillance and threats against individuals abroad and in China, including Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong.""
She demanded an end to torture, persecution throughout China, forced labor and marriage. She condemned ""the ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang, human rights abuses in Tibet, Inner Mongolia and across China.""
While delegates were verbally sparring with China and one another inside the council chamber, several human rights groups, including the Tibet Advocacy Coalition, the World Uyghur Congress and human rights defenders in Hong Kong were demonstrating against China outside the U.N. building.
Dolkun Isa, president of the World Uyghur Congress who was present at the UPR, reprimanded Muslim countries who applauded China's development efforts ""without a mention of religious and cultural persecution of Uyghurs.""
""The UPR was an opportunity for us to identify those with moral dignity and those who decide to look the other way in the face of genocide,"" he said. ""We know who those are."""

Twenty-one reservists died when a rocket-propelled grenade was fired by Hamas forces on a building. According to the IDF, the grenade triggered explosions of munitions which had been taken into surrounding buildings by the soldiers. All of the buildings, which were adjacent, apparently collapsed causing the deaths of the Israeli soldiers. An IDF statement said the explosives were intended to be used to demolish the buildings of which there were about 10.
In addition, a separate rocket-propelled grenade was fired on an Israeli tank killing two soldiers and injuring 2 others. This grenade was fired just prior to the second one which targeted the buildings to be demolished. There are unconfirmed reports that one of the two soldiers injured has since died.
The two incidents are under investigation. It is not clear whether the rocket-propelled grenade or the follow-on detonation of the explosives was responsible for the deaths of the soldiers in the second incident.
""Yesterday, we experienced one of the most difficult days since the outbreak of the war. The IDF has launched an investigation into the disaster. We must learn the necessary lessons and do everything to preserve the lives of our soldiers. In the name of our heroes, for the sake of our lives, we will not stop fighting until absolute victory,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday.

Rahul, along with Congress general secretary Venugopal and National Students' Union of India All India Congress Committee Incharge Kanhaiya Kumar, were booked along with others after clashes erupted between party supporters and the police after being denied entry to the state capital on Monday.
The FIR, registered at the behest of Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday, accused Rahul and other party leaders, who are part of the Congress's ongoing 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra', of 'wanton acts of violence'.
However, the case was later handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Assam.
Speaking with ANI on Wednesday, Pilot said, ""After the encouraging public response to the 'Bharat Jodo Yatra', the Congress high command requested Rahul-ji to take out a similar (hybrid) march from East to West. The Yatra rolled out from Manipur and reached Assam without any hassles. However, there was a conspiracy to put obstacles and throw a spanner in the works of the Yatra as it reached Assam. Rahul-ji was even stopped from visiting a temple. I had never before seen a sitting chief minister order the registration of an FIR against an Opposition leader in such an undemocratic manner and promote violence. The Assam government, with the help of the police administration, is trying to stop a peaceful Yatra. This is undemocratic and I condemn it.""The Congress leader claimed that the FIR against Rahul and others was a part of CM Sarma's 'revenge politics'.
""The FIR filed against our leaders is a part of the CM's revenge politics. Rahulji said clearly he would conduct a peaceful Yatra. But the Assam chief minister is promoting terror and resorting to pressure politics with the help of the police. However, neither Rahul-ji nor anyone in the Congress is afraid of such intimidatory tactics. If anything, this would strengthen our resolve to push along with this Yatra and take it to its end,"" the former Union minister said.
On the situation in neighbouring Manipur, which has been racked by ethnic strife in the recent past and continues to report violence, Pilot said, ""It is the responsibility of the Manipur government to handle the situation and restore peace. The people of the state have been displaced and are living in fear in the wake of violence over the past few months. However, it is Rahul-ji, and not the government, who is working to provide succour to the people by sharing their grief. This is why we decided to launch the yatra from Manipur.""Taking a swipe at the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, the former Rajasthan deputy chief minister said, ""The youth and the women are being made to feel left out under the current regime. The Centre has only resorted to propaganda and suppressed the voice of the Opposition by misusing agencies.""On Saturday, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said an FIR was registered against Rahul, Venugopal and Kanhaiya Kumar, among others, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.
""With reference to wanton acts of violence, provocation, damage to public property and assault on police personnel today by Cong members, an FIR has been registered against Rahul Gandhi, KC Venugopal, Kanhaiya Kumar and other individuals under section 120(B) 143/147/188/283/353/332/333/427 IPC R/W Sec. 3 of PDPP Act,"" CM Sarma posted from his official X handle on Wednesday.
The FIR was filed after the Assam chief minister, on Tuesday, warned of a criminal case against Rahul, adding that he will have him arrested after the Lok Sabha elections.
Following the clash between police and Congress workers in the Khanapara area, the Assam CM alleged that Rahul tried to force his way into Guwahati with about 3000 supporters and 200 vehicles.
""You can imagine what the situation might have been had 3000 people and 200 vehicles entered Guwahati. For six days, we had been asking him to take an alternative route that would be more acceptable to us. However, he insisted on passing through Guwahati. Despite being advised against it, the Congress workers tried to force their way into Gauhati and clashed with the police,"" the Assam CM told reporters.
Meanwhile, responding to the registration of an FIR against him, Rahul dared the CM to file ""as many cases as he wants"", adding that he wasn't scared or intimidated.
""I don't know what gave him (CM Sarma) the idea that he could scare Rahul Gandhi. File as many cases as you want against me, I am not afraid. I am neither scared of the BJP nor the RSS. If you have filed 25 cases against me, file 25 more. Be happy,"" Rahul said earlier while addressing a public meeting at Barpeta on the sidelines of the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra'. (ANI)"

According to a news release issued by National Defence, these donations include 10 Multirole Boats from Zodiac Hurricane Technologies, valued at approximately 20 million Canadian dollars (14.86 million U.S. dollars).
These multi-engine Rigid Hull Inflatable Boats will assist Ukraine in various maritime operations including search and rescue, troop and cargo transport, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Each boat will come with a sophisticated sensor, navigation, and communications system, the release said, adding that the delivery of these boats with training is expected to be completed by late-spring 2024.
Blair further announced that starting next month, in support of Canada's membership in the F-16 Training Coalition for the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Canada will provide civilian instructors, planes, and support staff contracted from Montreal-based Top Aces Inc. to contribute to Denmark and France's training efforts.
This support is valued at approximately 15 million Canadian dollars (11.14 million U.S. dollars). Training will begin in February 2024 and will continue into 2025, the minister said in the release.
Since February 2022, Canada has committed over 2.4 billion Canadian dollars (1.78 billion U.S. dollars) in military assistance to Ukraine. This includes Leopard 2 main battle tanks, one armoured recovery vehicle, armoured combat support vehicles, anti-tank weapons, small arms, M777 howitzers and associated ammunition, high-resolution drone cameras, winter clothing, and more."
4YTH0XDUAJ_QC2VGPSGPCRK3IH,Israel: Likud lawmakers present program to ensure defeat of Hamas,"ANI 23rd January 2024, 05:55 GMT+11","ANI 23rd January 2024, 05:55 GMT+11",20240122,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103198/israel-likud-lawmakers-present-program-to-ensure-defeat-of-hamas,"Tel Aviv [Israel], January 22 (ANI/TPS): As Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu comes under increasing pressure to produce a program for ""the day after"" Hamas in the Gaza Strip, several Likud lawmakers have issued a plan to refocus attention on first defeating the Islamist organization.
Titled ""Plan for Victory in the Gaza Strip"" and dated Jan. 16, the 102nd day of the war, the plan calls first for the IDF's continued destruction of Hamas's ""order of battle""--its command structure, fighters, equipment and infrastructure.
The number of Hamas terrorists is estimated at 30,000-40,000, of whom 25% are said to have been killed.
""The achievement is not nothing, certainly if you add the number of wounded and prisoners of the organization, but the campaign is far from over,"" the plan states.
The plan underscores the importance of Israeli territorial control of the Gaza Strip, which it proposes dividing into three sections -- north, central and south -- cut by two security corridors running east to west.
The northern area, where Gaza City is located and which served as Hamas's power center, is to remain unreconstructed. The central and southern sections will combine Israeli security control with the possibility of full local control of civilian affairs.
The plan calls for two ""de-escalation zones"" located on the sea sides of the two security corridors where humanitarian aid will be distributed to the civilian population. It also provides for a security perimeter between the Gaza Strip and Israel along which new IDF outposts will be built.
A ""mortal blow"" to Hamas won't be achieved without ""operational control"" of the Strip that will enable ""IDF freedom of action similar to what it has in Judea and Samaria,"" the program posits.
The authors of the plan are Amichai Chikli, minister of both Diaspora Affairs and Social Equality, and Likud members of Knesset Moshe Saada, Dan Illouz and Boaz Bismuth. They created their plan with the input of security experts.
Israel's wartime government came under pressure from the U.S. early on, with the Americans insisting on looking ahead to the day after Hamas's defeat. The White House has made no secret of its desire to see the Palestinian Authority installed in power in Gaza, uniting Judea, Samaria and the Strip under one authority and eventually becoming the government of a Palestinian state.
Recently, pressure has also mounted on Netanyahu from within his War Cabinet as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and National Unity Party leaders Benny Gantz and Gadi Eizenkot have signaled that formulating a post-Hamas political plan will help the war effort.
Left-wing groups are also hard at work devising strategies to coerce Israel to adopt U.S. proposals.
Netanyahu has been reluctant to lay out a post-Hamas plan. He has limited his comments to rejecting the U.S. solution and calling for Israeli control of the Philadelphi Corridor, Gaza's border with Egypt, to prevent smuggling.
The pressure on the government motivated the Likud MKs to produce the report, as they grew concerned that talk of the day after would distract from the war effort.
""It is no secret that the Israeli government is under heavy international pressure that may divert us from the path of decisive victory,"" Chikli tweeted on Jan. 18. ""This could be due to mismanagement of civil and humanitarian aspects, or as a result of a loose grip on the territory that may allow Hamas to restore its power.
""Let us recall that the main goal of the war as defined by the Israeli government is the destruction of the military capabilities and governmental and organizational infrastructure of Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip, so at the end of the war they will no longer pose a long-term threat to Israel,"" he added.
The plan does devote a page to three ""guiding principles"" for the day after Hamas: 1. No extreme nationalist elements must be allowed to control the Strip; 2. A complete disconnect between Israel and the Gaza Strip; and 3. Rebuilding the Rafah Crossing on the Egypt-Gaza border, giving Israel supervision of goods entering the Strip.
""Workers or goods [from Gaza] will no longer be allowed to enter Israeli territory. Also, Israel must gradually stop the supply of water and electricity until it is completely cut off,"" the program says, calling as an initial step for the ""demolition and permanent closure"" of the Erez Crossing from Israel, located at the northern end of the Gaza Strip.

Speaking to reporters, Sitharaman also stressed the BJP's commitment to taking legal actions in response to any challenges.
The ceremony, symbolising the 'Pran Pratishtha' of Ran Lalla and the grand opening of the Ayodhya temple, made waves not just in the temple town but across the world.
The spiritual council and BJP functionaries were directed to arrange live broadcasts of the Kumbabhishekam in various temples and private wedding halls, enabling a global audience to witness the sacred event.
Sitharaman actively participated in organising the event in the Kanchipuram district, rallying BJP cadres, the public, and devotees to contribute to the event's success.
However, the authorities initially sought to restrict the live broadcast, with the police advising against it in the early hours of the day.
Subsequently, however, the high court intervened as it issued an order clarifying that no police permission was required for such functions at private temples and marriage halls.
""Not only in Tamil Nadu but across the country, no one can keep spirituality away from their thoughts and discourse on a day like today,"" the Union Finance Minister said.
Thanking the media for their support, she added, ""The BJP always deals with any issue legally and never takes a wrong path. I thank the honourable court for ruling in favour of televising the event live.""She stressed that the BJP consistently adheres to legal procedures, allowing thorny issues to be addressed and resolved within the framework of the law.
Sitharaman assured that the BJP would respond to such challenges by adopting the legal recourse.
Underlining the transcendental nature of spirituality and universal appeal, she stated that it cannot be confined to a specific region or state.
The Tamil Nadu Hindu Religious Welfare Department officially communicated on Sunday that a live broadcast of the function was not permissible.
However, there was a shift in its stance on Monday after the rap from the high court.
Sitharaman, meanwhile, urged restraint, as she emphasised the need to avoid controversy even as people across the country engage in spiritual devotion during the Ram Kumbabhishekam ceremony. (ANI)"

The INDIA bloc suffered a huge setback on Wednesday as Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee said that her party declared that the Trinamool Congress would fight Assembly and Lok Sabha polls alone in Bengal.
""I have saying this since Day one that it was merely a photoshoot. Nothing could have happened. They have been playing a drama for the past few months,"" Pralhad Joshi said while speaking to reporters.
The TMC Supremo, earlier today, announced that there would be no alliance in West Bengal.
""I had no discussions with the Congress party. I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we will alone defeat BJP,"" she said.
""I gave many proposals but they rejected them from the beginning. From then, we have decided to fight the elections in Bengal alone,"" Banerjee added.
The breakdown in Trinamool and the Congress came after state unit chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury continued his attack on the Bengal Chief Minister.
In a news conference on Tuesday, Adhir Chowdhury claimed that in the 2011 elections, Mamata Banerjee came to power with the mercy of Congress.
""This time, the elections will not be fought at the mercy of Mamata Banerjee. The Congress defeated the BJP and TMC in the two seats that Mamata Banerjee is leaving. The Congress party knows how to contest the elections. Mamta Banerjee is an opportunist; she came to power in 2011, with the mercy of Congress,"" the Congress MP said.
However, several leaders of the INDIA bloc, including RJD MP Manoj Jha and AAP MP Saurabh Bharadwaj asserted that the issue would be resolved.
Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi who is in Assam as part of his Nyay Yatra tried to quell the damage been done by the state unit chief's repeated attacks by insisting that he had a good relationship with the TMC supremo.
""The negotiations on seat-sharing are underway, I don't want to comment here. But Mamata Banerjee is very close to me and our party. Sometimes our leaders say something, their leaders say something, and it goes on. It's a natural thing. Such comments won't matter and these are not things that are going to disrupt things,"" Rahul Gandhi said on Tuesday.
The Trinamool Congress reportedly was willing to offer the Congress a maximum of three Lok Sabha seats of the 42 seats in Bengal. In the 2019 elections, the Congress had won two Lok Sabha seats while the TMC had won 22 seats. (ANI)"

Protesters have interrupted his recent campaign appearances to express their anger over his support of Israel's military campaign.
On Wednesday, protesters briefly disrupted a labor union event where Biden was speaking. During a Tuesday rally focused on abortion access, 14 protesters shouted through most of Biden's speech in Manassas, Virginia. The interruptions clearly frustrated the president.
'This is going to go on for a while,' Biden said. 'They have got this planned.'
That protest was organized by Die-In For Humanity, a 700-member strong protest group that has made nearly 100 appearances at Biden events, the U.S. Capitol, outside administration members' homes, outside the Israeli Embassy, and at January's protest in Washington.

The American entrepreneur highlighted the problem in the revision of the UN bodies on Sunday and said that the countries with excess power don't want to give it up, adding that the Africa collectively should have a permanent membership in the United Nations.
Taking to X, Musk said, ""At some point, there needs to be a revision of the UN bodies. Problem is that those with excess power don't want to give it up. India not having a permanent seat on the Security Council, despite being the most populous country on Earth, is absurd. Africa collectively should also have a permanent seat imo.""UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had also made an impassioned plea for the UN to reflect today's world. ""How can we accept that Africa still lacks a single Permanent Member in the Security Council? Institutions must reflect today's world, not that of 80 years ago. September's Summit of the Future will be an opportunity to consider global governance reformsre-build trust"" Guterres had said in a post on January 21.
India has been a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for eight terms (16 years).
The country is a member of the G4, a group of nations that back each other to seek permanent membership of the UNSC. The countries advocate for reform in the UNSC.
Earlier, emphasising on growing global support for India's permanent membership at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that sometimes things are not given generously and one has to seize it.
""With each passing year, the feeling in the world is that India should be there, and I can feel that support...The world does not give things easily and generously; sometimes you have to take them,"" the EAM said on a question regarding a permanent seat for India at the UNSC.
In September 2023, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar expressed concern that the United Nations' reluctance to reform its structure would render the organization ""anachronistic,"" prompting people to seek solutions elsewhere. He made an analogy by likening the situation to passengers on a bus, drawing an ""injudicious"" reference to the permanent members of the UN Security Council.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had noted, ""When the UN was established, the world at that time was completely different from today. At that time there were 51 founding members in the UN. Today the number of countries included in the UN is around 200. Despite this, the permanent members in UNSC are still the same."" (ANI)"

Khan Yunis is Gaza's second largest city and is regarded as a personal stronghold of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, whose family lives there.
Over the past day, IDF ground troops engaged in close-quarters combat, directed air strikes, and used intelligence to coordinate fire, resulting in the elimination of dozens of terrorists.
The IDF targeted terrorist cells carrying RPGs near the troops, those launching anti-tank missiles, and terror operatives who had rigged compounds with explosives. Ready-to-launch rockets, military compounds, shafts, and numerous weapons were located during the activity.
Meanwhile, the IDF is probing the death of 21 soldiers on Monday when a blast ripped through a Gaza compound being prepared for demolition. The building collapsed on the soldiers.
The blast was caused when a Palestinian terror squad fired an anti-tank missile at the adjoining homes in the complex. The explosives being used by the Israeli forces to demolish the compound detonated and the two buildings collapsed.
The soldiers were from a reserve battalion tasked with destroying structures allowing Hamas to observe and fire on Israeli forces. The compound was located in the area of Al Moazi, about 600 meters from the Israeli border""As far as we know, at around 4 p.m., an RPG was fired by terrorists at a tank securing the forces, and simultaneously, an explosion occurred at two two-story buildings. The buildings collapsed due to this explosion, while most of the forces were inside and near them,"" said IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari.
Simultaneously, another Palestinian terrorist emerged who emerged from a tunnel shaft undetected fired a rocket propelled grenade at a tank that was securing the compound.
At least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on Oct. 7. The number of men, women, children, soldiers and foreigners held captive in Gaza by Hamas is now believed to be 136. Other people remain unaccounted for as Israeli authorities continue to identify bodies and search for human remains.(ANI/TPS)"

""I had no discussions with the Congress party. I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we will alone defeat BJP."" the TMC supremo said.
In Chandigarh, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann said his party will not enter into an alliance with the Congress in the state, reiterating that the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party(AAP) will win all 13 seats at stake.
""In the 2024 Lok Sabha election...AAP will get 13 seats (in Punjab),"" Mann said at a media briefing.
Soon after the West Bengal CM made the announcement, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate said that Rahul Gandhi gave a very clear answer for this and I would like to repeat the same- there are a lot of talks done for seat sharing.
""I think Rahul Gandhi gave a very clear answer for this and I would like to repeat the same- there are a lot of talks done for seat sharing...But there is no question about the role of Mamata Banerjee in the INDIA bloc. She is a part of this alliance and we will contest this election together,' Supriya Shrinate said.
Congress MP Pradip Bhattacharya said that TMC attended the INDIA meeting, and Mamata Banerjee gave so many proposals.
""When this Nyay Yatra started, Congres had invited all political parties...I would be happy if the TMC decided to join the Yatra...If they decide to fight alone that is their subject, but Congress has always said very clearly that we would like to have clear contact with all the political parties of the INDIA alliance...TMC attended the INDIA meeting, and she (Mamata Banerjee) gave so many proposals,"" Bhattacharya said.
Meanwhile, West Bengal Congress president and MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said that he have nothing to say regarding the alliance.
""I have nothing to say regarding the alliance. I am going to Cooch Behar to receive Rahul Gandhi's Nyay Yatra tomorrow. I do not have any info regarding the alliance. Ask them who made comments on the alliance,"" he added.
On INDIA alliance and recent statements of Mamata Banerjee and Bhagwant Mann, Congress leader Sachin Pilot said, ""...In the end, all INDIA alliance partners will sit across the table and talk, and all matters will be sorted.""Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) working president Supriya Sule said that there is no infighting in the alliance and all the parties of the bloc are in ""frequent conversation"".
Sule said that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is 'didi' and is respected and loved by the members of the opposition alliance.
AAP MP and Punjab Co-incharge, Sandeep Pathak said that Punjab unit had been saying from the beginning that they are capable of contesting alone.
""This is not new. Punjab unit had been saying from the beginning that they are capable of contesting alone. If you look at the local unit of Congress, they too say that they don't want to forge an alliance. So, local units have their own aspirations. The final decision will be taken by the coordination committee, seat-sharing committee and the High Command. Let's wait for it. The sooner it is done, the better it is,"" he added.
Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray on Wednesday said West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was ""fighting like a tigress"", and her fight was important for her state.
""I have come to know from the media, but let me see what Mamata ji has said, Mamata ji is fighting like a tigress in Bengal, her fight in West Bengal is extremely important,"" Thackeray said.
Moreover, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders said that Mamata Banerjee has not surprised anyone by doing this today.
Union Minister Giriraj Singh said, ""Why should Mamata Banerjee consider Rahul Gandhi as PM when she herself is the PM candidate? Why should she vote for Congress? Mamata Banerjee has not surprised anyone by doing this today.""Union Minister Pralhad Joshi said that the INDIA bloc just needed an excuse. They had to do drama for 7-8 months and they did it. Everyone knew this...Ultimately, there will be no INDI.
""We had all been saying from day 1 that this is just photoshoot and nothing is going to come out of it. AAP declared today that they would contest alone. Mamata Banerjee also announced that the party will contest independently...Other parties are also going to same the same. Wait for it,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said that the alliance of INDIA bloc is an arrogant alliance.
""This is not INDIA alliance, this is an arrogant alliance... On one side Ram Lalla's idol was being consecrated, on the other hand, stones were being used in Assam, this is their Bharat Jodo Yatra... The whole reality has come out in front of the public,"" Scindia said.
Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri has taken a jibe at the INDIA bloc that is suffering over seat sharing among the regional parties for the Lok Sabha elections, calling it a 'fragmented' alliance.
Speaking to ANI after the AAP and the TMC declared to go solo in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls and contest the elections alone in Punjab and West Bengal respectively, Puri said that the cementing of the INDIA bloc was never 'very strong'.
""They (Congress) went out on a Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra and I think they're finding it very difficult to get Nyay even amongst the so-called INDIA partners. And I'm not surprised by the statement I heard from the Chief Minister of West Bengal or the chief minister of Punjab that they don't want to join up with their partners. So I think we are looking at a very fragmented INDIA alliance,"" he said.
The INDIA bloc is struggling to resolve key challenges including finalising seat-sharing arrangements most importantly deciding on a PM face while the BJP has started executing strategies it laid off in 2023 to secure victory in General elections.
Earlier in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the NDA won 353 seats, the UPA stood at 91, and Others won 98. The voting was staggered in seven phases between April 11 and May 19, in which around 67 per cent of the nearly 900 million eligible people exercised their franchise to elect 542 members of the Lok Sabha.
The 2024 Lok Sabha elections will be held next year that is likely to be between the Modi government's NDA alliance and the INDIA bloc. (ANI)"

""Somali military forces, supported by international partners, conducted the airstrike in the town of Galhareri, targeting sites the militants used to manufacture improvised firearms, bombs and other explosives,"" Galmudug Regional Security Minister Mohamed Aden Gaboobe told VOA Somali. Galhareri is some 450 kilometers (280 miles) north of Mogadishu.
Gaboobe said the airstrike conducted late Wednesday also targeted Radio Andalus, al-Shabab's mouthpiece in Somalia.
A separate statement from the Somali National Army said more than 25 militants were killed in the strike, which destroyed a house where leaders of the group were meeting and a garage that was used to prepare car bombs.
Neither the military statement nor regional officials provided details on the international partners whose drones were involved the strike, but the U.S. Africa Command has often conducted such strikes in Somalia at the request of Somalia's federal government.
Last week, a U.S. airstrike killed three al-Shabab extremists in a remote area of Somalia, approximately 35 kilometers (22 miles) northeast of Kismayo.
""At the request of the Federal Government of Somalia, U.S. Africa Command conducted a collective self-defense airstrike with two engagements against the al-Shabab terrorist group on Jan. 21,"" said a statement from U.S. Africa Command Thursday. ""The initial assessment is that the U.S. airstrike killed three al-Shabab terrorists and that no civilians were injured or killed.""
In the past, Somali security officials said the United States is not the only country providing air support to government forces.
Security officials who requested that they not be identified because of the sensitivity of the operation told VOA Somali that Turkish drones were also providing air support to Somali forces.
Somali government forces supported by local clan fighters have been conducting operations in the Hirshabelle and Galmudug states since August 2022, freeing dozens of localities from al-Shabab.
Attending the inauguration ceremony for a Somali regional president Thursday, Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud repeated his government's promise of a second phase of the offensive that will go after al-Shabab in southern Somalia, the group's traditional heartland, but he did not say when that would begin."

The United States on January 19, 2021, under the leadership of then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, formally recognised China's systematic atrocities against Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and other Turkic peoples in East Turkistan as genocide and crimes against humanity.
""This historic recognition brought the plight of our people into the global spotlight, yet the genocide relentlessly persists to this very day...As we stand in 2024, the grim reality remains that millions of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Turkic peoples continue to be interned in concentration camps and prisons,"" the East Turkistan Government in Exile stated in a press release.
""Shockingly, millions more are enslaved in forced labour camps and factories across Occupied East Turkistan and throughout China, subjected to inhumane conditions and stripped of their basic human rights. The situation is further exacerbated by the forced separation of nearly a million Uyghur and other Turkic children from their families, interned in state-run camps to be assimilated,"" it added.
ETGE Foreign Minister Salih Hudayar called on the international community, particularly the United States, to confront these continuing atrocities.
""It is imperative to recognise that the genocide in East Turkistan is not a closed chapter in history but an ongoing nightmare in 2024. Recognising East Turkistan as an occupied country is not just a symbolic gesture but a necessary step towards dismantling the root of this crisis and restoring the rights of our people,"" he said.
ETGE further called for the appointment of a Special Coordinator for East Turkistani Affairs within the US State Department, stating that this position would play a pivotal role in coordinating an international response and bringing sustained attention to the crisis in East Turkistan.
The ETGE emphasised the importance of supporting East Turkistan's legal complaint before the International Criminal Court and referring China's ongoing genocide to the International Court of Justice, calling these steps critical in holding the Chinese government accountable and preventing further atrocities.
ETGE President Dr. Mamtimin Ala underscored the need for continued global awareness and action.
""The recognition by the United States of the genocide was a significant milestone. However, the struggle is far from over. We need sustained international pressure and concrete actions to end these atrocities. Our people's resilience is strong, but global support is vital to bring about change,"" he said.
Vice President Sayragul Sauytbay, who has firsthand experience of the horrors faced in the concentration camps, also made a heartfelt plea.
""As a witness to these heinous crimes and as vice president of the East Turkistan Government in Exile, I urge the global community to acknowledge and act against the continuing genocide in East Turkistan. Our plight is not just a regional issue, but a stark warning of the global threat posed by China. World peace and the future of humanity depend on stopping these crimes against humanity,"" he said.
In response to the ongoing crisis, the ETGE and East Turkistani diaspora are conducting events, including demonstrations, worldwide to educate the public and commemorate the victims.
These events not only honour the victims but also aim to keep the international focus on the ongoing genocide in East Turkistan.
""On this East Turkistan Genocide Recognition and Remembrance Day, the ETGE remains committed to its mission for justice, freedom, and the restoration of East Turkistan's independence. We call upon governments, international organisations, and individuals to join us in our fight to end this genocide and restore peace, dignity, and freedom to the people of East Turkistan,"" the release added.

In its order, a two-member bench, headed by SHC Chief Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, ordered the interim federal government and Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to ensure uninterrupted internet services till polling day.
The order came on a petition filed by human rights defender and lawyer Jibran Nasir, who was contesting the polls for PS-110 as an independent candidate, against the frequent ""unconstitutional"" internet outages in the country in recent days.
Internet services were affected thrice since the past month,. The first time was on December 17, the second on January 7 and the latest one on January 20.
The internet suspensions coincided with the PTI's virtual events and the party recently moved the top court against them, asking it to take notice of the disruption of popular social media platforms including X, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
A day earlier, Interim Information Minister Murtaza Solangi blamed ""technical issues"" for the recent internet outages across the country, saying that there was no guarantee that such incidents would not occur in the future.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said the internet was disrupted because of a ""technical fault"".
Netblocks, a global internet monitor, wrote on X that live metrics showed ""a nation-scale disruption to social media platforms across Pakistan.
In his petition, Nasir maintained that the act of shutting down mobile internet and broadband services should be declared as ""unconstitutional, illegal, disproportionate, unreasonable and without lawful authority"".
He sought the suspension of any orders restricting access to social media platforms till the next general polls.
Nasir named the PTA, interior ministry and information technology and telecommunications ministry as respondents in his plea.
The court held an in-chamber hearing on the petition.
Later, the SHC issued an order, directing the issuance of pre-admission notices to the respondents and the deputy advocate general for January 29, seeking their replies on the matter.
""[The] respondents are directed to ensure that unless the provision of Section 8 and Section 54 of the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-Organisation) Act, 1996, read with Rule 5 of Removal and Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight and Safeguards) Rules 2021, are attracted, there shall be no disruption and shutting down of mobile internet and broadband services,"" the order read.
The court further ordered ""smooth and uninterrupted mobile internet and broadband services to have access to social media platforms/websites"".
Nasir, later in a post on social media platform X, confirmed the court's directives.
He wrote that the SHC on his petition as an independent candidate had taken notice of the repeated internet and social media disruptions caused by the PTA that appear to target the PTI but also causes loss to all candidates, businesses and citizens at large.
In a video attached with the post, he said internet services were shut down and social media access was interrupted whenever the PTI held an online event.
He added that this ""pre-poll rigging"" was not just stopping the PTI from contesting free and fair elections but also affecting independent candidates like him.
Nasir pointed out that social media platforms were efficient and cost-effective ways of reaching out to constituents.
He described the internet outages as a ""violation of our fundamental human rights"", highlighting that the entire nation had to suffer and losses worth billions of rupees were incurred because of them.
Nasir continued that the goal of his plea was preventing any act of pre-poll rigging that could be reported on the social media.

5WRMFLOEC8_C7GH4LBSILST8Y7,US: Alabama carries out world's first nitrogen gas execution,"ANI 26th January 2024, 14:55 GMT+11","ANI 26th January 2024, 14:55 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106804/us-alabama-carries-out-world-first-nitrogen-gas-execution,"Alabama [US], January 26 (ANI): In the world's first known execution by nitrogen hypoxia, the US state of Alabama put to death Kenneth Eugene Smith, a prisoner on death row for his role in a contract killing more than three decades ago, The Washington Post reported.
Smith's execution was preceded by months of legal battles over whether it was constitutional to use nitrogen hypoxia in capital punishment, as the method was not known to have ever been used before in a prison setting.
Alabama prison officials kept many of the details about how they would carry out the new method a secret from the public.
Smith, 58, was pronounced dead at 8:25 pm (local time) on Thursday at the William C Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore.
Alabama officials had previously tried and failed to execute Smith by lethal injection in 2022.
Notably, states that still use the death penalty have struggled to obtain lethal injection drugs, with lawmakers and prison officials adopting alternative methods as backup options. Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma have approved nitrogen hypoxia, while other states have brought back the long-disused firing squad, The Post reported.
Despite the historic nature of Smith's execution, only five independent witnesses from the news media were able to observe the process. Smith's family, as well as the family of his victim, Elizabeth Sennett, attended Thursday's execution.
For months, medical professionals and human rights advocates had argued that Alabama's efforts to use an untested execution method on Smith amounted to human experimentation, claims Smith's lawyers took all the way to the US Supreme Court.
The US top court rejected Smith's last-ditch request to intervene late Thursday. The court's three liberal justices - Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson - noted their dissent in the court's order, which did not explain the majority's reasoning, The Washington Post reportedSotomayor called Alabama's method ""untested"" and said ""the world is watching."" ""Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its 'guinea pig' to test a method of execution never attempted before,"" she wrote.
Kagan, joined by Jackson, wrote separately to say that she would have put the execution on hold to give Smith and his lawyers more information about the state's new protocol to allow him to fully challenge the execution method.
A jury voted 11-1 in favor of life in prison at Smith's second trial before a judge overrode its verdict and sentenced Smith to death. The practice, known as judicial override, has since been eliminated in all 50 states; Alabama was the last state to do so, in 2017, The Post reported.
In previous court filings, Smith's attorneys said there was a real risk that Smith would vomit and choke to death during his execution.
Marshall, Alabama's attorney general, said that was unlikely, noting that Smith would have taken his last meal more than eight hours before the execution. Should Smith vomit, the state said, officials would remove and clean the mask and clear Smith's airway before continuing.
In two key changes to Alabama's execution procedure, the Alabama Supreme Court in 2023 extended the typical 24-hour timeline for execution warrants to let the governor set the timeline and eliminated the process of automatically reviewing death penalty cases for ""plain errors"" during the trial phase.
Smith was convicted in Sennett's 1988 death in Colbert County, Ala. Sennett was found beaten and stabbed in her home, which was staged to look like a robbery. Investigators later found that Sennett's husband, the Rev. Charles Sennett, had hired a hit man to kill her and collect on her life insurance policy to cover his debts, The Washington Post reported.
John Forrest Parker and Smith were paid USD 1,000 each by a middleman on Sennett's behalf to carry out the murder. Charles Sennett killed himself when police learned of his role in the plot, while Billy Gray Williams, the middleman, was sentenced to life in prison. Parker was executed in 2010. (ANI)"

Theoretically, the breakthrough is significant. Until now, there have been no alcohol stores in Saudi Arabia, so the opening of the first alcohol store in seventy years has certainly sparked interest and attention.
In practice, however, little will change for Saudis. The store will only serve foreigners living in the country, but not if they are Muslims. It is still unclear whether other non-Muslim immigrants will have access to the store.
In the country, strict laws are in place that prohibit the consumption of alcohol. Violating these laws can result in hundreds of lashes, deportation, fines, or imprisonment. Immigrants are also at risk of deportation. As part of the reforms, corporal punishment, to a large extent, has been replaced with prison sentences.
According to Reuters, the decision of the Saudi authorities is a ""cornerstone"" in Saudi Arabia's efforts, where Prince Mohammed bin Salman is in power, to open this ultra-conservative Muslim country to tourism and business. This is part of the so-called ""Vision 2030"" for building a post-oil economy.
It was announced this week by the state-controlled media that the government of Saudi Arabia is imposing new restrictions on the import of alcohol through diplomatic shipments, which could lead to an increase in demand for alcoholic products, offered in the new store.
Under the new regulations, the import will be restricted to counter the ""improper exchange of special goods and alcoholic beverages received from the embassies of non-Muslim countries in Saudi Arabia"", as reported by Sunday's Arab News.
In recent years, Saudi Arabia has relaxed strict social codes, including allowing public presence of both men and women and the obligation for women to wear black clothing.
The consolidation of power by Prince Mohammed includes opening the country to non-religious tourism and concerts, permitting women to drive, but it is also marked by repression against dissident events and political opponents.

The Texas National Guard and state troopers will continue working to secure the border, based on the state's right to defend itself in lieu of the federal government doing its job, Abbott said. The Texas Military Department, which includes the state's National Guard units, issued a statement on Tuesday pledging to ""hold the line"" to prevent illegal border crossings. ""We remain resolute in our actions to secure our border, preserve the rule of law and protect the sovereignty of our state.""

US Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, applauded Abbott's decision to fight Biden on the border crisis. ""Washington is forcing our hand,"" he said of Monday's Supreme Court ruling. He added, ""Consider that we are a nation so unserious and broken that we are paying Border Patrol to secure the border but will pay them instead to cut razor wire . . . to stop Texas from trying to do what Border Patrol's core mission is.""

The IRNA also reported that Pakistan's Ambassador to Iran Muhammad Mudassir Tipu went back to Tehran earlier on Friday.
Tipu said in a post on the social media platform X that he returned to Tehran with the ""sincere and good wishes"" of Pakistan's leadership, adding it was time to ""turn a new leaf.""
Iran and Pakistan said in a joint statement on Monday that they had agreed to send back their ambassadors by Friday.
The statement said the decision was made following a phone call between Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and his Pakistani counterpart Jalil Abbas Jilani. It noted that Amir-Abdollahian would visit Pakistan on Jan. 29 at Jilani's invitation.
On Jan. 16, Iran carried out a series of missile and drone strikes within Pakistan's Balochistan province, claiming that it had targeted the terrorist group Jaish ul-Adl. Pakistan then denounced Iran's ""violation of its airspace"" and recalled its ambassador from Iran.
On Jan. 18, Pakistan launched a missile strike on a border village in Iran's southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan, prompting Iran's protests."

The INDIA bloc suffered a huge setback on Wednesday as Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee said that her party declared that the Trinamool Congress would fight Assembly and Lok Sabha polls alone in Bengal.
While speaking to ANI, Madhya Pradesh CM Yadav said, ""The decision of Mamata Banerjee to fight the Lok Sabha polls alone conveys that there is no strength in the opposition unity.""""Nobody will be able to stand in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji. He will form the government with a huge majority in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls,"" he added.
The TMC Supremo, earlier today, announced that there would be no alliance in West Bengal.
""I had no discussions with the Congress party. I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we will alone defeat BJP,"" she said.
""I gave many proposals but they rejected them from the beginning. From then, we have decided to fight the elections in Bengal alone,"" Banerjee added.
The breakdown in Trinamool and the Congress came after state unit chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury continued his attack on the Bengal Chief Minister.
In a news conference on Tuesday, Adhir Chowdhury claimed that in the 2011 elections, Mamata Banerjee came to power with the mercy of Congress.
""This time, the elections will not be fought at the mercy of Mamata Banerjee. The Congress defeated the BJP and TMC in the two seats that Mamata Banerjee is leaving. The Congress party knows how to contest the elections. Mamta Banerjee is an opportunist; she came to power in 2011, with the mercy of Congress,"" the Congress MP said.
However, several leaders of the INDIA bloc, including RJD MP Manoj Jha and AAP MP Saurabh Bharadwaj asserted that the issue would be resolved.
Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi who is in Assam as part of his Nyay Yatra tried to quell the damage been done by the state unit chief's repeated attacks by insisting that he had a good relationship with the TMC supremo.
""The negotiations on seat-sharing are underway, I don't want to comment here. But Mamata Banerjee is very close to me and our party. Sometimes our leaders say something, their leaders say something, and it goes on. It's a natural thing. Such comments won't matter and these are not things that are going to disrupt things,"" Rahul Gandhi said on Tuesday.
The Trinamool Congress reportedly was willing to offer the Congress a maximum of three Lok Sabha seats of the 42 seats in Bengal. In the 2019 elections, the Congress had won two Lok Sabha seats while the TMC had won 22 seats. (ANI)"

""This visit is historic, Chad and Russia have very long-standing relations, the last visit of the president of Chad was in 1968, when Mr. Francois [Tombalbaye] was president,"" Deby said.

He said that the violence since the October 7 attacks has further eroded trust between and among nations.
Delivering his address at the 47th Sapru House Lecture earlier today, the UNGA President said, ""One month into my tenure, the international community was rocked yet again by another major conflict in the Middle East.""""The horrific escalation of violence since the October 7 attacks on Israel has further eroded trust between and among nations, triggered a humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip, and heightened security concerns throughout the world,"" he added.
Notably, on June 1, 2023, Dennis Francis was elected to serve as President of the United Nations General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session. He began his term on September 5 last year, a month prior to the Hamas assault on Israel.
The conflict in Gaza escalated after the October 7 attack by Hamas, where about 2,500 terrorists breached the border into Israel from the Gaza Strip, leading to casualties and the seizure of hostages.
Israel has characterized its Gaza offensive as targeting Hamas' infrastructure with the goal of eliminating the entire terror group while making efforts to minimise civilian casualties.
The UNGA President also spoke at length on climate change and added that sea level rise and unsustainable consumption and production patterns continue to create new layers of complexity.
""Meanwhile, ever-present threats linked to climate change, sea level rise and unsustainable consumption and production patterns continue to create new layers of complexity. Taken together, these dynamics are undermining the cohesion we need to uphold international law, including the UN Charter--the backbone of our multilateral system,"" the UNGA President continued.
Lauding India's humanitarian assistance to nations, he said, ""With half the population nearing starvation and a public health catastrophe unfolding, legitimate questions are being raised on what it would take to stop the carnage and to save and sustain human life.""""India's delivery of humanitarian goods and medical supplies to those affected by the circumstances is highly valued,"" as he heaped praise on New Delhi and added by saying that he ""appreciates India's insistent call for peace in the Middle East, Ukraine, and elsewhere across the globe.""As the UNGA President delivered his speech, the Permanent Representative of India to the UN, Ruchira Kamboj, was also present.
In her address at the 47th Sapru House Lecture, she said that India's participation in multilateral frameworks reaffirms the country's dedication to universal goals.
""Our collective efforts at the United Nations symbolise a commitment to not just dialogue but to actionable strategies that transcend borders and unite us in our common humanity. India's participation in multilateral frameworks reaffirms our dedication to these universal goals. By embracing multilateral cooperation, we not only pave the way for a more equitable world but also ensure the sustainability of our planet for future generations,"" Kamboj said.
She stated that India embodies the spirit of multilateralism.
""It isn't enough to talk about peace; one must believe in it. And it isn't enough to believe in it; one must work at it. Today, as we gather under the theme of multilateralism and peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability, we are not just discussing peace; we are committing to it, believing in it and most importantly, working towards it,"" Kamboj said.
""In an era where challenges are global and intertwined, our resolve to act in concert has never been more critical. India, as a land where ancient wisdom coalesces with modern aspirations, embodies the spirit of multilateralism..."" she added.
The UNGA President, Dennis Francis arrived in New Delhi on a five-day visit at the invitation of External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar.

In an article signed by Mirziyoev that appeared in Chinese state media ahead of the trip, the Uzbek leader praised China's model of economic development and said relations between the two countries are experiencing ""new historical heights"" that will allow him to use the January 23-25 trip to ""develop a new long-term agenda"" for the two countries that will last for ""decades.""
'Every time I visit China, I sincerely admire the scale of the reforms taking place here, the accomplishments, creative strength, diligence, and talent of the Chinese people who are confidently pursuing the path of modernization to realize their centuries-old dream,"" the article said.
The state visit comes following the first in-person China-Central Asia leaders' summit in May where China inked several agreements to deepen its economic and security links with the region. In Beijing, Mirziyoev is looking to build upon those deals as well as a comprehensive strategic-partnership agreement signed in 2022.

While meeting with Xi and other top-level Chinese officials, the Uzbek delegation will look to court investment and agree with their counterparts on how to bring many previously signed deals to fruition, from developing green energy projects to cooperation in science and boosting tourism between China and Uzbekistan.
""This is less about concrete outcomes and more about setting a road map for the future,"" Niva Yau, a fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told RFE/RL. ""China has committed to investments and projects and this high-level visit is [about] how to achieve them and to search for new areas to cooperate together.""
Evolving Ties
The visit takes place against the backdrop of several major developments that have changed the political environment at home and abroad for Uzbekistan's relationship with China.
Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine has boosted China's standing as a reliable political and economic force for the countries of Central Asia as Moscow -- the region's traditional dominant partner -- has grappled with financial and geopolitical fallout from the conflict.
After a decade of infrastructure investments around the globe through Beijing's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China wants to use the project to invest in new sectors and become a more strategic lender after facing criticism for a lack of transparency in BRI loans as it now grapples with a slowing domestic economy.
Facing such headwinds, China is looking to make the BRI smaller and greener through more risk-averse loans and investments in renewables, and Yau said this could factor into the results from Mirziyoev's visit.
Chinese President Xi Jinping with five Central Asian leaders at the China-Central Asia summit in May 2023.
China, she notes, has been investing heavily in environmental and scientific research and monitoring, with several notable investments in Central Asia.
Tajikistan, which neighbors Uzbekistan to the southeast and shares a border with China, opened a Chinese observation station on Lake Sarez in 2021, reportedly for environmental research and ""international disaster reduction and prevention,"" according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
In July 2023, Chinese researchers also unveiled a new ""super"" observation post for climate and environmental monitoring in Shahritus, near the meeting point of China's borders with Uzbekistan and Afghanistan.
The stations have scientific and technological applications, but observers note the installations are part of a broad network of similar stations across BRI countries in South and Central Asia that could have dual applications for security and surveillance.

Beijing has also looked to expand the list of countries cooperating with its space program, reaching an agreement with Turkmenistan in 2023.
While traditional Chinese investments in Central Asia are still in play, such as a proposed natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to China and a railway connecting China to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, their futures are uncertain.
Yau said Beijing is looking to bring these new areas of investment and industry that it has expanded elsewhere in the world to Central Asia, and Uzbekistan, with a population of some 35 million, is an attractive partner.
The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project will involve the construction of more than 50 tunnels and 90 bridges in Kyrgyzstan's highest mountains -- some more than 3,000 meters high. (file photo)
One particular sector of interest is renewable energy and opening up new markets for Chinese electric vehicles.
China has been positioning itself as a market leader around the world for years and, in December, China's Henan Suda signed a deal with the Uzbek Energy Ministry to build some 50,000 charging stations for electric vehicles around the country by 2033.
""These are areas where China is becoming a global leader and it wants to bring them to Central Asia,"" Yau said.
New President, New Era
While events like the war in Ukraine have affected the relative appeal of Beijing and Moscow as partners for Central Asia, Mirziyoev's high-profile visit is the product of years of warming ties between China and Uzbekistan, says Temur Umarov, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia-Eurasia Center in Berlin.
""This direction towards China has been Mirziyoev's priority from the beginning,"" he told RFE/RL. ""Mirziyoev is very interested in China and often quotes [former Chinese leader] Deng Xiaoping in his speeches; and he clearly sees the country as an example for how to develop economically.""
China's experience combating top-level corruption under Xi and its efforts to lift millions out of poverty, Umarov says, have been a particular focus for the Uzbek leader since he came to power in 2016 following the death of Islam Karimov, the country's first ruler after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
""China has become a source of knowledge in a way for Mirziyoev,"" Umarov said. ""Given that Uzbekistan is a personalistic regime, how he sees China matters a lot.""
Uzbekistan followed a far more isolationist foreign policy under Karimov that was suspicious of outside influence.
China was still an important partner, with Chinese leader Hu Jintao inviting Karimov to Beijing for a visit in 2005 less than two weeks after the bloody crackdown against protesters in the northeastern Uzbek city of Andijon, though the relationship was limited. Under the hard-line Karimov regime, Chinese companies and capital in many sectors of the economy were restricted.

That changed following Karimov's death, which brought Mirziyoev to power.
As the new Uzbek president has opened up his country's economy, China has been both a reliable source of investment and a valuable ally that has helped Mirziyoev build his legitimacy at home and abroad.
As Umarov notes, China's own model of opening its economy while retaining tight political control is one that looks increasingly appealing to Mirziyoev.
""This is very relevant to him as he tries to build his own political regime based on Karimov's heritage,"" Umarov said. ""He knows that he needs to adapt to the world and learn from similar regimes about how to navigate the complex realities of today.""

Initiating the discussion, Paras committed his party's complete support to the concept of one nation, one election and said this would end a lot of superfluous expenditure incurred not only by the nation but also by the political parties. Since the beginning of the electoral process, elections have always been held simultaneously till a certain time, so there is no reason why they cannot be restored and synchronized now.
It will save a lot of time for the government to devote to governance. Multiple elections also halt the development process because of the imposition of the Model Code of Conduct. Though initially, some sacrifices in terms of curtailment of terms of house/ government etc. might happen this has to be undergone in the best national interest, said Pashupati Nath ParasThe assemblies should have fixed terms, notwithstanding the change of government or leader of the house. This will give security to the elected representatives that they can complete their full term and thus devote themselves to the welfare of the people and the development of their constituencies, said Paras.
To a specific query from the Chairman about whether holding of local bodies elections together with parliament and assembly could result in violence, the leader of the delegation of Rashtriya Lok JanshaktiParty (RLJP) said, that this would not be the case, since deployment of Paramilitary Forces would have a deterring effect and help in conducting smooth polling.
The delegation submitted a written letter to the Chairman of the HLC on the One Nation, One Election, enlisting the support of the party in the One Nation, One Election.
The meeting ended with the delegation assuring the chairman that all support would be extended by the party for the implementation of simultaneous elections.
On Wednesday, the Chairman of HLC on One Nation One Election, Ram Nath Kovind, former President of India, held the fourth round of consultations with eminent jurists Justice Dilip Bhosale, former Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court, and Justice Rajendra Menon, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, who gave their considered opinion on the subject.
Initiating discussions with financial and economic experts, Ram Nath Kovind also held interactions with Ajay Singh, President of ASSOCHAM, and Chairman and Managing Director of Spicejet Airlines, who was also accompanied by the Secretary-General and Assistant Secretary-General of ASSOCHAM. Ajay Singh put forth his views in detail on the economic advantages of holding simultaneous elections for the nation.
Recently, the High-Level Committee relating to the holding of simultaneous elections in the country has initiated a consultation process under the chairmanship of Ram Nath Kovind, former President of India.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said its concern for the northeast comes out of continuing attacks on civilian infrastructure and the safety of civilians while the security situation there deteriorates.
""Over the past week, multiple airstrikes in Al Hasakeh have led to civilian casualties and caused significant damage to several civilian facilities, including power stations and oil production fields, which could negatively impact the availability of gas, fuel and electricity going forward,"" OCHA said.
The office warns that increased flooding in the northwest puts displaced populations at risk.
""More than 1,500 family tents have been damaged by floods over the past two weeks, including shelters provided to survivors of last year's devastating earthquakes,"" OCHA said. ""Humanitarian partners report that tents in Afrin and Salqin were particularly affected by persistent rainfall yesterday (Thursday).""
The humanitarians say additional shelters, food, ground insulation, heating materials, and road repairs are urgently needed. Muddy conditions are disrupting children's access to school and families' ability to reach critical services at displacement camps.
""We and our partners on the ground are carrying out assessments and providing essential relief items, including tents, repair kits, and plastic sheeting for insulation,"" the office said. ""Psychosocial support is also being mobilized for affected families.""
However, OCHA said the humanitarian response is significantly underfunded.
""We have received just one-third of the 160 million U.S. dollars needed for last year and for this year to help provide winter assistance to more than 2 million people in Syria,"" the office said."

Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi a dear friend, Macron took to X to post, ""My dear friend @NarendraModi, Indian people, My warmest wishes on your Republic Day. Happy and proud to be with you. Let's celebrate!""This marks a unique reciprocal exchange following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to France on its National Day in July 2023.
This momentous visit by Macron culminates in the 25th-anniversary celebrations of the Strategic Partnership between India and France.
This is the sixth time (the highest for any country) a French leader is participating in India's biggest ceremonial event.
This tradition began with President Jacques Chirac in 1976, followed by Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1980, Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, and Francois Hollande in 2016.
PM Modi and President Macron have engaged in a series of high-profile meetings throughout 2023, underscoring the strength and depth of the bilateral relationship.
Their interactions have spanned various global platforms, including the COP 28 Summit in Dubai, the G20 Leaders' Summit, and the G7 Summit in Hiroshima. Notably, President Macron was also the Guest of Honour at the Bastille Day Celebrations in France in July 2023.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's last visit to France for Bastille Day in July 2023 was a spectacle of symbolism and substance. The visit showcased the strong bonds between the two nations, with a tri-service Indian armed forces contingent marching at Champs-Elysees and a spectacular flypast by Rafale jets.
During the visit, Prime Minister Modi was honoured with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, a prestigious recognition in France. A State Banquet at the Louvre Museum and a private dinner at Elysee highlighted the grandeur of the occasion. The Prime Minister also addressed the Indian community at La Seine Musicale.

Out of the 346 MPs who voted, 287 were in favour of Sweden's accession and 55 voted to reject it. Four others abstained from voting.
The vote was the second step of Turkey's ratification process after the parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission approved the bid last month.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan can now sign the protocol into law.
Even after a significant hurdle has been cleared for the Nordic country's accession into the military alliance, Hungary remains the only member state that has not yet ratified Sweden's accession, CNN reported.
However, on Tuesday, Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban said he had invited his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, to visit Hungary to negotiate the terms of Sweden's accession.
Notably, Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership in May 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier that year. Finland joined NATO in April 2023, doubling the alliance's border with Russia, but Sweden has faced numerous delays in its path to accession.
Erdogan initially objected to Sweden's membership bid, accusing Swedish officials of being ""too lenient"" on militant groups, including the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Since applying, Sweden has tightened its anti-terror legislation and agreed to work more closely with Turkey on security concerns, as reported by CNN.
Meanwhile, Erdogan's approval of Sweden's accession bid also rides on a commitment by the United States, with the Turkish president signalling that he won't sign the protocol into law unless the US approves the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey.
US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin said on Tuesday that Congress, however, is waiting to see the accession documents completed before moving forward on the matter. (ANI)"

The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Sun's delegation arrived in the capital, Pyongyang, on Thursday after crossing the land border between the countries. The report didn't provide further details about the visit.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been trying to boost the visibility of its partnership with China and Russia as he tries to break out of diplomatic isolation and strengthen his regional footing by joining a united front against the United States.
Kim traveled to Russia's Far East in September for a rare summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Some experts say he is also likely seeking a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
While Kim has prioritized his ties with Russia, something that has raised concerns about an arms cooperation that would help fuel Putin's war on Ukraine, he has also invited senior Chinese officials to major state events and vowed to strengthen bilateral relations.
A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu Guozhong attended the celebrations for North Korea's 75th founding anniversary last September, shortly before Kim's trip to Russia. In July, Kim invited Chinese ruling party official Li Hongzhong and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to a major military parade in Pyongyang, where he rolled out his most powerful, potentially nuclear-capable missiles targeting the United States, South Korea and Japan.
Sun met with North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho last month in Beijing where they discussed strengthening bilateral ties and coordinating over unspecified 'issues of common interest.' Pak then also met Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, as they pledged to expand friendly exchanges and strengthening 'strategic cooperation' in 2024, as the countries mark their 75th anniversary of establishing bilateral ties.
Sun's visit to North Korea comes as U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan was planning talks with Wang in Bangkok this week in the latest high-level talks between Washington and Beijing amid tensions over trade, technology and China's assertive foreign policy in the region.
As North Korea's major ally and economic lifeline, China is a crucial partner for Kim's efforts to revive an economy crippled by decades of mismanagement and U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear weapons and missile program, which he has aggressively expanded in recent years despite limited resources.
As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, both China and Russia have been thwarting U.S.-led efforts to increase sanctions on the North over its intensified weapons testing in recent months, underscoring a divide deepened over Russia's war on Ukraine.
Washington and Seoul have been urging Beijing to use its economic leverage on North Korea to help persuade Kim's government to return to nuclear disarmament negotiations, which have stalled since 2019.
Experts say trade activities between North Korea and China are gradually expanding since North Korea eased its pandemic restrictions and reopened the border last year."

Speaking at India Global Forum's 6th annual UK-India Parliamentary Lunch at the House of Lords on Wednesday, Cleverly said, ""The intellectual horsepower of India is enormous and getting bigger. Whether it is dealing with potential future pandemics or dealing with non-communicable diseases or dealing with the opportunities and risks of AI financial services or sustainable agriculture, I struggle to think of any sector where coordination and cooperation between the UK and India will not be a force for good in the world.""Against the backdrop of major global conflicts, and following the first visit by an Indian Defence Minister to Britain in 22 years, the Home Secretary emphasised the vitality of the partnership in preventing conflict from ""spilling over.""""It was incredibly important that India's Defence Minister visited the UK because in a turbulent world, and a potentially turbulent region, having strong and long-standing partners, as we do with India, closely coordinating on security on the preservation of peace is incredibly important. Of course, the military relationship between India and the UK is very long-standing. I really hope that together, demonstrating the strength of purpose, demonstrating a commitment to democracy, and demonstrating a willingness to defend our values, the UK and India can work together to prevent the conflict from spilling over and engulfing other parts of the world,"" Cleverly stated, according to the release.
The UK-India Parliamentary Lunch co-hosted by the Indian High Commission to the UK and Lord Jitesh Gadhia where key players from the world of politics, business and finance sit-down over a lunch at the House of Lords to celebrate the growing ties between the two democracies.
Referring to British Foreign Secretary David Cameron's comments on the global conflict dashboard flashing red lights, India Global Forum Chairman and CEO Manoj Ladwa said, ""As we have seen, approaches and responses can vary, even between the closest of partners. These divergences are more about nuance and emphasis, rather than the fundamental values of the rule of law, freedom of belief, diversity and inclusion, freer trade, and democracy, that we all so cherish. In such times, democracies must work harder to work together. Because we all know, democracies work best, when democracies work together.""Highlighting the strides the Indian economy has made in recent years, Sujit Ghosh, India's Deputy High Commissioner said, ""India is not just creating opportunities for its people but also for the rest of the globe. The UK is uniquely positioned to benefit from India's rise. The time has come for our friends in the UK to shed their old lenses and see India for what it is.""""Though a significant element of the UK-India bilateral, agenda lies in the hands of political leaders and diplomats, especially the FTA negotiations, a lot of the activity flows from the two-way traffic of people, ideas, commerce and collaboration, which is such a defining characteristic of the UK-India axis"", observedLord Gadhia.
Sponsored by Standard Chartered and Tata, the Parliamentary lunch was followed by peer-to-peer roundtable discussions on reforming governance with technology, pharmaceuticals and pandemic preparedness, the release also said. (ANI)"

""You have set a track record of winning 26 out of 26 seats. I believe that the people of Gujarat will vote PM Modi to power in 26 out of 26 seats again and contribute to creating a ""Vikshit Bharat, Samarth Bharat and Saksham Bharat,"" the BJP chief said.
He was addressing BJP workers and leaders after inaugurating the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha Constituency office in the Thaltej area of Ahmedabad.
The BJP chief said that the party will not only emerge victorious but will also break its previous electoral record by a much larger seat tally.
""I believe we will emerge victorious as well as cross our previous electoral record with a large number of seats in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" Nadda said.
The BJP won in all 26 Lok Sabha constituencies in Gujarat in the 2014 and 2019 elections with 60.1 per cent and 63.1 per cent vote share respectively. The Congress did not manage to win any seats in the last two Lok Sabha elections in the state. However, it was able to bag 33.5 per cent votes in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and 32.6 per cent votes in the 2019 polls.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the distinction of being the longest-serving Chief Minister of Gujarat, with his term spanning from October 2001 to May 2014.
Further, Nadda accused the Congress party and other parties of doing divisive politics for 70 years, based on caste, region, and religion, to divide the country and fill their own pockets.
""For 70 years, the Congress party and other parties have been doing politics on the basis of caste, region, and religion. They have been doing vote bank politics, dividing the country on the basis of caste and religion, and filling their own homes and families,"" Nadda said.
""But since Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of India, the definition of politics in the country has changed. Now, only those who will go to the people with a report card based on their work will be able to do politics in the country. Today, it is the politics of accountability, the politics of credibility,"" he added.
Further, the BJP Chief alleged, ""The Congress and INDI Alliance parties are talking about the caste census. But they do not have any interest in the caste census. They are just doing vote bank politics on the caste census issue.""Nadda claimed that PM Modi has united the country by focusing on common goals rather than dividing it on the basis of caste and religion.
""The BJP has rightly understood the caste census and said that we are with it. But our PM, Modi, has said that there are only four castes in India. And those four castes are: G for Garib (poor), Y for Yuva (youth), A for Annadata Kisan (farmers who provide food) and N for Nari Shakti (women's power).

The summit that takes place on Feb. 8 in Ottawa will serve to identify short-, medium- and long-term actions to combat auto theft, including the shipment of stolen vehicles through borders, said Public Safety Canada in a news release.
Auto theft is a highly lucrative, highly sophisticated transnational crime that not only affects Canadians but empowers criminal organizations through the proceeds of crime, said the release.
Rates of vehicle theft rose by 50 percent in Quebec, 48.3 percent in Ontario, 34.5 percent in Atlantic Canada and 18.35 percent in Alberta in 2022, as compared to the previous year, according to industry estimates.
In 2022, approximately 9,600 vehicles were stolen in the Toronto area alone, representing a 300 percent increase since 2015, according to the Canadian Finance and Leasing Association.
Transnational organized criminal groups are believed to be involved in the export of stolen vehicles from Canada, while most vehicle thefts involve lower-level threat groups, with violent street gangs being the most prevalent, it said.
The majority of stolen vehicles exported are destined for Africa and the Middle East. Some stolen vehicles also remain in Canada enabling other crimes to be committed with the vehicles and are destroyed afterward, it noted."

This year's event, which opens to the public on Thursday, is shaping up to be more international than ever, with three Japanese guests and Canada as the country of honour.
Born in 1945, Simmonds started out as a newspaper cartoonist before going on to publish children's books and graphic novels.
She is best known for her long association with the British newspaper The Guardian, for which she drew the series Gemma Bovery (2000) and Tamara Drewe (2005-06), both later published as books and made into films.
A long-time francophile who studied at the Sorbonne university in Paris, Simmonds chaired the jury at the Angouleme festival in 2017.
She is one of the few women to break through in the British comics world, and she won press cartoonist of the year in 1981.
The French Association of comics critics and journalists gave her its critic's prize in 2009, for Tamara Drewe.
She won international acclaim for True Love, an avant-garde graphic novel that was a sort of precursor to the Bridget Jones novels.
Her third graphic novel, Cassandra Darke, was published in 2018. Loosely based on Charles Dickens' novella A Christmas Carol, it is set in current times with a protagonist likened to a female version of Ebenezer Scrooge.
Simmonds' work is currently the focus of a retrospective at the Pompidou Centre in Paris until 1 April, 2024.
She was in the running for the AngoulÃªme Grand Prix with French writer Catherine Meurisse and American Daniel Clowes.
Mangaka mania
Simmonds will be feted throughout the four-day festival. More than 1,300 authors are expected from all over the world, with Canada as the country of honour.
Three major mangakas - Japanese comic book masters - have been invited for master classes and exhibitions.
Hiroaki Samura's work is being honoured with an exhibition, while a screening and conferences are organised to honour Rintaro.
Shin'ichi Sakamoto's highly-anticipated new manga, #DRCL: Midnight Children, inspired by Bram Stoker's Dracula, will be presented to the public as an immersive experience at the Guez-de-Balzac chapel.
And author Moto Hagio, one of the few women in a very male-dominated field, will have an exhibit of her work at the AngoulÃªme museum that delves into gender issues.
Arab of the Future, and others on display
Franco-Syrian author Riad Sattouf, winner of the 2023 Grand Prix, is president of this year's festival, and the Vaisseau Moebius is hosting an exhibition dedicated to his world-renowned series Arab of the Future.
No fewer than 20 different awards are handed out during the festival in different categories, including a dozen for young talents and school children.
One of the members of the main prize jury is Thomas Bangalter, formerly half of the Daft Punk music duo. The youth grand jury is headed by actress and director AÃ¯ssa MaÃ¯ga.
In a nod to the 2024 Summer Olympics being held in Paris, sport will be honoured, with an exhibition, The Art of Running - Catching the Race, with drawings by Italian artist Lorenzo Mattotti accompanied by texts by Maria Pourchet.

The Morris Archives, recently acquired by the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library (TRPL), will be housed at the Theodore Roosevelt Center at Dickinson State University (DSU).
Over his lifetime, Morris's scholarship transformed the way we think about the 26th president. The archive includes an extensive collection of notes, documents, audio and video tapes, photographs, and various personal ephemera and memorabilia, especially surrounding Morris's well-known works such as Theodore Rex and The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt. This archive opens a window into not only Morris's life but the rich treasures of Theodore Roosevelt's life.
Through the generosity of Marc Brinkmeyer, owner and chairman of the board of the Idaho Forest Group, and his wife, Vicki, we can learn how this great biographer came to be. Marc explains, 'Vicki and I were enthusiastic to be able to serve as the enablers to place this important repository into the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library. It allows the Morris literary achievements to endure and will serve as a foundation for the Library's mission and continuing Roosevelt scholarship.'
While the volume of the collection is quite expansive, the significance is even more impactful. Morris kept exacting records of his work and personal reflections on the men he profiled. The collection also includes the papers of Sylvia Jukes Morris, his wife and literary equal who wrote biographies of First Lady Edith Kermit Roosevelt and Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce.
'A complete analysis of Theodore Roosevelt's life is not possible without consulting Edmund Morris. As such, our presidential library would not be complete without Edmund Morris' archives. With this addition, this project's commitment to scholarship and historical analysis is brought to new heights,' said Edward F. O'Keefe, CEO of TRPL. 'The Morris Archives stand as a testament to the enduring legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, and we are incredibly grateful to Marc and Vicki Brinkmeyer and Dickinson State University for making this possible.'
About TRPL: The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library is being built in Medora, North Dakota, and is expected to open on July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of America. This will be a library and museum truly like no other. Designed by the international architectural firm SnÃ¸hetta, the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library will be the only carbon-neutral presidential library and will function in harmony with the unique ecology that surrounds it, being a model of self-sufficiency.

In a study published on Monday, researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) and Curtin University called for a major rethink of Australia's fire prevention strategies.
Researchers, led by David Lindenmayer from ANU's Fenner School of Environment and Society, reviewed existing analyses of bushfires in Australia as well as Brazil, the United States and Spain, concluding that forests that had been thinned, logged or previously burned faced a higher risk of high-severity fires.
They found that logging and hazard reduction burns -- a common practice across Australia outside of fire seasons to reduce fuel loads -- can create more flammable environments by killing plants that are too tall to catch fire.
When those plants regrow from the ground they add to the fuel load for fires.
""We've understood for a long time now that logging can make bushfires worse, but it's only in the last few years that evidence is showing that prescribed burning could be doing the same thing,"" Lindenmayer said in a media release.
""We need to be thinking about forestry and fire management in a more holistic way and look to limit actions that could be increasing flammability.""
Instead of hazard reduction burns, Lindenmayer said authorities should invest in rapid response fire fighting specialists and use drone technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) to detect and suppress fires faster."

These calves are about to be six months old now and were found by a patrol team near Zonag Lake at the heart of Hoh Xil in the Sanjiangyuan area around half a year ago, said Tsewen Dorje, a ranger at Sonam Dargye Protection Station in Hoh Xil.
Every year, tens of thousands of pregnant Tibetan antelopes, a species under first-class state protection in China, start their migration to Hoh Xil around May for birthing and depart with their offspring in late July. Zonag Lake is known as the ""delivery room"" for the antelopes.
""During the migration journey, young Tibetan antelopes are susceptible to getting separated from the herd due to adverse weather or attacks by predators,"" said Tsewen Dorje. ""When we come across these 'stranded' calves, we bring them back to the protection station.""
To enhance protection efforts, a wildlife rescue center was set up at the station, winning it the name ""the kindergarten of baby Tibetan antelopes."" Covering an area of 550 mu (around 36.7 hectares), the rescue center has aided over 50 baby Tibetan antelopes in returning to their natural habitat.
When the three antelope calves first arrived at the rescue center, they needed to be fed milk four times a day, but now they can consume food on their own.
""They are in good health and will commence wilderness training before they meet the criteria for release,"" Tsewen Dorje said."

7ICNNKNK1E_IRBEKCUHJ3J7Q9L,Saudi Arabia Opens First Liquor Store in More Than 70 Years,"Voice of America 25th January 2024, 19:36 GMT+11","Voice of America 25th January 2024, 19:36 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105889/saudi-arabia-opens-first-liquor-store-in-more-than-70-years,"JERUSALEM - A liquor store has opened in Saudi Arabia for the first time in more than 70 years, a diplomat reported Wednesday, a further socially liberalizing step in the once-ultraconservative kingdom that is home to the holiest sites in Islam.
While restricted to non-Muslim diplomats, the store in Riyadh comes as Saudi Arabia's assertive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman aims to make the kingdom a tourism and business destination as part of ambitious plans to slowly wean its economy away from crude oil.
However, challenges remain both from the prince's international reputation after the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi as well as internally with the conservative Islamic mores that have governed its sandy expanses for decades.
The store sits next to a supermarket in Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a socially sensitive topic in Saudi Arabia. The diplomat walked through the store Wednesday, describing it as similar to an upscale duty-free shop at a major international airport.
The store stocks liquor, wine and two types of beer for the time being, the diplomat said. Workers at the store asked customers for their diplomatic identifications and for them to place their mobile phones inside of pouches while inside. A mobile phone app allows purchases on an allotment system, the diplomat said.
Saudi officials did not respond to a request for comment regarding the store.
However, the opening of the store coincides with a story run by the English-language newspaper Arab News, owned by the state-aligned Saudi Research and Media Group, on new rules governing alcohol sales to diplomats in the kingdom.
It described the rules as meant 'to curb the uncontrolled importing of these special goods and liquors within the diplomatic consignments.' The rules took effect Monday, the newspaper reported.
For years, diplomats have been able to import liquor through a specialty service into the kingdom, for consumption on diplomatic grounds.
Those without access in the past have purchased liquor from bootleggers or brewed their own inside their homes. However, the U.S. State Department warns that those arrested and convicted for consuming alcohol can face 'long jail sentences, heavy fines, public floggings and deportation.'
Drinking alcohol is considered haram, or forbidden, in Islam. Saudi Arabia remains one of the few nations in the world with a ban on alcohol, alongside its neighbor Kuwait and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.
Saudi Arabia has banned alcohol since the early 1950s. Then-King Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia's founding monarch, stopped its sale following a 1951 incident in which one of his sons, Prince Mishari, became intoxicated and used a shotgun to kill British vice consul Cyril Ousman in Jeddah.
Following Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution and a militant attack on the Grand Mosque at Mecca, Saudi Arabia's rulers soon further embraced Wahhabism, an ultraconservative Islamic doctrine born in the kingdom. Strict gender separation, a ban on women driving and other measures were put in place.
Under Crown Prince Mohammed and his father, King Salman, the kingdom has opened movie theaters, allowed women to drive and hosted major music festivals. But political speech and dissent remains strictly criminalized, potentially at the penalty of death.
As Saudi Arabia prepares for a $500 billion futuristic city project called Neom, reports have circulated that alcohol could be served at a beach resort there.
Sensitivities, however, remain. After an official suggested that 'alcohol was not off the table' at Neom in 2022, within days he soon no longer was working at the project."

There have also been calls to reform the way victims are compensated.
""It has become clear that there is a lack of structure to deal with sexual violence in the Protestant Church,"" Kerstin Claus, independent commissioner for child sexual abuse issues of the German government, told Neue Berliner Redaktionsgesellschaft on Friday.
The investigation into sexualized violence in the EKD and its charitable organization Diakonie documented at least 2,225 victims and 1,259 suspected perpetrators over the last few decades. Investigators expect that there are also many unreported cases. They were not able to evaluate all staff files, relying primarily on disciplinary files.
""Personnel files have to be evaluated, the question has to be asked who was or still is responsible,"" Claus told the taz newspaper. ""The system for compensating victims requires independent structures to which victims could turn. This needs ""transparency and clear criteria,"" she added.
""As a Protestant church and Diakonie, we take responsibility for the acts of violence committed by employees and volunteers of our institution,"" said Bishop Kirsten Fehrs, current chairwoman of the council of EKD, on Thursday.
""As an institution, we have also become guilty,"" Fehrs said. ""And I can only wholeheartedly apologize to those of you who have been hurt in this way."""

A large group of Republican governors has issued a joint statement voicing ""solidarity"" with Texas Governor Greg Abbott and his stepped-up border protections, accusing the White House of leaving the country ""completely vulnerable"" amid an influx of illegal migrants.
Published on Thursday, the open letter was signed by 25 GOP governors across the country, with Vermont Governor Phil Scott the sole Republican to leave his signature off the message.
The state leaders were highly critical of President Joe Biden, who they said had ""attacked and sued Texas for stepping up to protect American citizens from historic levels of illegal immigrants, deadly drugs like fentanyl, and terrorists entering our country.""
""We stand in solidarity with our fellow Governor, Greg Abbott, and the State of Texas in utilizing every tool and strategy, including razor wire fences, to secure the border,"" the letter continued. ""We do it in part because the Biden Administration is refusing to enforce immigration laws already on the books and is illegally allowing mass parole across America of migrants who entered our country illegally.""
Abbott has been embroiled in a lengthy legal battle with Biden's Justice Department over Texas' efforts to stem the flow of illegal immigration into the US. The tensions were exacerbated by a Supreme Court ruling earlier this week which authorized federal Border Patrol agents to remove razor wire installed along the US-Mexico border by the Texas authorities. Abbott responded to the ruling by saying that Biden had ""refused to enforce [immigration] laws and has even violated them.""
The Texas governor has likened the record-breaking migration numbers in recent years to an ""invasion,"" and invoked constitutional authorities for a state to defend itself against foreign incursions.
""That authority is the supreme law of the land and supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary. The Texas National Guard, the Texas Department of Public Safety, and other Texas personnel are acting on that authority, as well as state law, to secure the Texas border,"" Abbott previously argued.
The standoff with federal agencies came to a head earlier this month when Texas used state National Guard troops to block federal Border Patrol agents from accessing a 2.5-mile stretch along the border with Mexico. Following that incident, the case was brought before the Supreme Court, which ultimately decided in favor of the federal government.
Last month, Border Patrol reported 300,000 encounters with illegal immigrants, representing an all-time high. While House Republicans have similarly accused Biden of facilitating an ""invasion,"" the Democratic majority has countered that blocking entry to asylum seekers would be ""cruel"" and ""inhumane.""
As part of a border crackdown dubbed 'Operation Lone Star', Abbott has sought to build barriers along the border and detained around 500,000 illegal immigrants. Texas has also bused over 97,000 migrants that the federal authorities had allowed into the country to Democrat-run jurisdictions of New York City, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC.

Almost half of Russians have a high opinion of Bolshevik revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin, according to a poll released on Friday by the country's Public Opinion Research Center (VCIOM).
The survey, conducted ahead of the 100th anniversary of Lenin's death, found that Russians remain sharply divided over the Communist leader's historical legacy. Some see him as a wise 'vozhd' (leader) who paved the way for the 1917 Great October Socialist Revolution which made society fairer, while others consider him a blood-stained tyrant whose actions led to the deaths of millions.
The October Revolution sparked a civil war in Russia, with the Bolsheviks emerging triumphant after several years of brutal fighting and uniting most of the regions of the defunct Russian Empire under their rule. In 1922, these territories were officially combined to form the Soviet Union. Lenin, who played a key role in this tumultuous period, died two years later, on January 21, 1924.
Some 47% of respondents have a ""rather positive"" view of Lenin while another 30% are ambivalent, according to the VCIOM poll. A further 15% have a negative opinion of the Bolshevik leader. Regarding the results of his rule, 36% believe Lenin did more good than harm to Russia, while 30% think the pros and cons balanced each other out. Of those surveyed, 19% said that his actions were mostly harmful.
Of the respondents, 24% believe the Bolshevik leader is mainly remembered as the founder of the Soviet state, while 10% see him as a calculating politician who imposed his will on a large country. Another 9% see him as a political adventurer and 7% as a thinker who saw far into the future. Only 6% think that in 50 years' time Lenin will be seen as a brutal dictator.
Russians are not only divided on Lenin's historical legacy, but also over whether his embalmed body - which is now kept in a mausoleum on Red Square - should be removed and buried. A third of respondents see no reason to do so, while 30% insist on immediate reburial in a cemetery. Another 27% think Lenin should be buried, but only when such a move does not cause controversy.
In 2021, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had no plans to rebury Lenin, arguing there were many more important items on the agenda.

The pre-dawn landslide buried 18 homes and sparked the evacuation of more than 200 people when it struck in Zhenxiong County, Yunnan province, state media said.
Eight people are confirmed dead and rescuers have extracted four, according to a report by state broadcaster CCTV at around 5:30 pm (0930 GMT), though the condition of the four was not immediately clear.
Two hundred rescue workers have been dispatched as well as dozens of fire engines and other equipment, CCTV said.
One local told the state-run Beijing News outlet that she was asleep when the disaster hit and that parts of her ceiling had fallen onto her head.
'At the time I thought it was an earthquake, but later I knew it was the hillslope collapsing,' another resident told the outlet.
Both were quoted under pseudonyms.
Footage shared on social media by a local broadcaster showed emergency workers in orange jumpsuits and helmets forming ranks outside a fire station as snowflakes whirled through the air.
Other images showed rescuers picking through towering piles of collapsed masonry in which a few personal belongings could be seen.
Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered 'all-out' rescue efforts, CCTV reported.
Xi 'demanded that rescue forces are organized quickly... and efforts made to reduce casualties as far as possible,' the broadcaster reported him as saying.
He added that it was 'necessary to properly handle the work of comforting the families of the deceased and resettling affected people.'
CCTV broadcast an image it said showed a firefighter working to pull a trapped villager from inside a home affected by the disaster.
The local village head declined to speak about the landslide when contacted by phone, telling AFP he was 'too busy.'
Landslides common
Landslides are common in Yunnan, a far-flung and largely impoverished region of China where steep mountain ranges butt against the Himalayan plateau.
Monday's disaster occurred in a rural area surrounded by towering peaks dusted with snow, state media footage showed.
Temperatures in Zhenxiong hovered just above freezing on Monday afternoon but were forecast to sink below zero in the evening, weather data showed.
There was no immediate official explanation for what may have caused the landslide.
Efforts to establish what happened are underway, Xinhua reported.
China has experienced a string of natural disasters in recent months, some following extreme weather events such as sudden, heavy downpours.
In September, rainstorms in the southern region of Guangxi triggered a mountain landslide that killed at least seven people, according to media reports.
Heavy rains sparked a similar disaster near the northern city of Xi'an in August, causing the deaths of more than 20 people.
And in June, a landslide in southwestern Sichuan province -- also remote and mountainous - killed 19 people."

The vast majority of countries recognize China's unremitting efforts and historic achievements in promoting and safeguarding human rights, and are willing to strengthen exchanges and mutual learning with China, Chen said.
GENEVA, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- China has won international acclaim for its achievements in the cause of human rights during the regular Universal Periodic Review (UPR) conducted by the United Nations Human Rights Council, China's top diplomat in Geneva Chen Xu told Xinhua on Tuesday.
China's candid, pragmatic attitude and its efficient, orderly organization were appreciated by all parties, said Chen, who heads a Chinese delegation for the review.
Chen, permanent representative of China to the UN office at Geneva and other international organizations in Switzerland, underlined the importance of the UPR mechanism, saying it is a platform for states to conduct candid exchanges on human rights issues on an equal footing within the UN's framework, and to engage in constructive dialogue and cooperation.
In his address to the review, Chen introduced China's remarkable achievements in the cause of human rights, announced 30 new initiatives to safeguard human rights, which cover such fields as enhancing people's well-being, strengthening legal safeguards for human rights, promoting international cooperation in human rights and supporting the work of the UN human rights mechanisms.

The vast majority of countries recognize China's unremitting efforts and historic achievements in promoting and safeguarding human rights, and are willing to strengthen exchanges and mutual learning with China in human rights, the diplomat said.
Chen noted a wide range of constructive recommendations put forward by representatives of various countries, which believe that the development of human rights in China has contributed valuable wisdom from a region with a different civilization.
But several countries, he added, disregarded the truth and made groundless accusations against China based on ideological bias, rumors and lies. China has already stated its solemn position in response, Chen stressed.
Speaking of the significance of China's human rights development to the international community, he said that China has taken a path of human rights development that conforms to the world trend and suits China's national conditions, providing an excellent model for the development of international human rights endeavors.

That has boosted the confidence of countries from the Global South in independently choosing their own path of human rights development, making crucial contribution to the improvement of global human rights governance, he said.
He said many countries supported China's relentless efforts to promote and safeguard human rights, hailed China's advancement in building of a strong country and national rejuvenation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, with human rights better safeguarded, and expressed their wish to learn more about China's experience and practices for the achievements.
Many representatives of developing countries said in their statements that China's path of human rights development was in line with China's national conditions and the aspirations of its people, providing a brand-new option for countries, especially developing countries, to explore the path of human rights development on their own, according to the ambassador.

The key to China's human rights development is the leadership of the Communist Party of China and socialism with Chinese characteristics, which determine the socialist nature of China's human rights endeavors, guarantee that the Chinese people are the masters of the country, and ensure equality in the sharing of human rights and the fundamental interests of the greatest possible majority of the people continue to be safeguarded and developed, Chen said.
Many countries congratulated China on securing and beginning its sixth term as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, and expected China to play a leading role in global human rights governance and to uphold international justice, the diplomat said.
China will firmly stand in solidarity with the Global South, share weal and woe with developing countries, put forward more initiatives and proposals in line with the common interests of developing countries, and promote global human rights governance toward greater fairness, justice, rationality and inclusiveness, Chen said.

Union Minister Smriti Irani tore into the Mamata Banerjee government over the incident, saying, ""The police were nowhere to be seen when Ram Bhakts were pelted with stones. But they were out in big numbers to stop the live screening of PM Modi's interaction with young voters.

A bench of justices Surya Kant and KV Viswanathan also suggested the parties for trying to explore a mechanism which should be fair, transparent and which must achieve the ultimate object of a fair investigation so that no suspect goes scot-free.
The top court directed to present all material collected by the State so far by the next date of hearing.
The hearing witnessed an exchange of heated arguments between the lawyers appearing for the ED and Tamil Nadu government.
Appearing for Tamil Nadu government, Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal raised questions on ED's probe in various matters and commented calling an investigation on the FIRs registered against the minister of BJP-ruled state including the Chief Minister of Assam.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing ED, reacted to Sibal's submission and called it a political statement. SG Mehta also raised various issues that ED is facing in those state rules by opposition parties.
Lawyers representing the southern state also raised why ED is not probing complaints against ministers in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other BJP ruling states. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal commented that the central agency should probe on the other people that they are not proceeding against.
The court intervened and suggested trying to find out the resolution mechanism and investigations by ED or state agencies are not hampered.
The court also suggested ED and state agencies not to proceed with any investigation in the connected FIR.
The court also remarked that it is not saying whether any one is vindictive and commented that ED's officers are in all States and what will happen to the country if there is a tit-for-tat reaction.
The court said that the mechanism can be devised and no guilty should go scot free under the veil of counter allegations. The court remarked that the mechanism can then apply in pan India basis.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta raised that there are state government ministers under the ED's scanner. Reacting to the statement Senior Advocate Sibal said that the federal structure of the country is being destroyed.
The court remarked that some mechanism has to be evolved so that genuine cases don't get hampered merely because it is being handled by the central agency and at the same time mala fide investigation won't take place.
Solicitor General Mehta apprised the court about a state not naming it in public and said that the money is found from a senior official, very closely connected as per the documentary evidence with the sitting Chief Minister. ""We (ED) are unable to manually count it. We have to bring machines,"" SG said adding further that there is an official circular issue that any officer who receives a summon from ED would not go to ED and answer the questions without approval of the State.
""This is what is going on right now,"" he pointed out.
The court suggested some transparent mechanisms where the investigations can commence.
In December last year, the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) arrested an officer of the ED alleging that he had been caught ""red-handed"" while accepting a bribe of Rs 20 lakh from a doctor in Dindigul district.
According to TN officials, Ankit Tiwari, along with his team of ED officers, had been threatening several people and receiving bribes in the name of closing their case in the Enforcement Directorate. (ANI)"

It was not immediately clear what caused the collapse that occurred on Friday and was reported on Tuesday in a Ministry of Mines statement that estimated 'several' miners dead. The collapse occurred in Kangaba district in the southwestern Koulikoro region.
Such accidents are common in Mali, Africa's third-largest gold producer. Artisanal miners - small-scale, informal ones - are often accused of ignoring safety measures, especially in remote areas.

The Russian is 0-2 in Australian Open finals. On Sunday, he'll meet Jannik Sinner ofItaly, who defeated 10-time tournament champion Novak Djokovic in four sets in the other semifinal.
The sixth seed, Zverev was aggressive in the first set, masterful at the net and converted all three of his break chances. He continued the strategy of heading off shots from Medvedev at the net, winning 17 of 19 net points in the second set.
Medvedev, the third seed, won the tight third set, helped by winning 84 percent of the points on his first serve against Zverev. That continued into the fourth set, with Medvedev winning points on 19 of 21 first serves (90 percent), and he struck 14 winners against six unforced errors.
Zverev couldn't maintain his intensity in the deciding set as Medvedev broke his serve twice. The German hit only eight winners in the set compared to 21 unforced errors.
""First set, honestly I think we both didn't play that good,"" Medvedev said post-match. ""The second set I thought I played a bit better than the first set. He played very well, 6-3, two breaks, I didn't have chances on his serve. I was a little bit lost but during the third set I said if I was going to lose this match I was going to be proud of myself. I want to fight until the end, and if I lose I lose, and I managed to win and I am very proud.""
Medvedev moved to 12-7 all-time against Zverev following the four-hour, 18-minute semifinal.
The semi was the third five-set match in Melbourne for Medvedev, who went the distance against No. 9 seed Hubert Hurkacz of Poland in the quarterfinals and against Emil Ruusuvuori of Finland in a second-round match that was played until almost 4 a.m.
Medvedev said fatigue set in against Zverev.
""At one moment in the third set I felt tired physically,"" Medvedev said. ""Looking at him I didn't see it. I thought I couldn't run anymore for 40-plus rallies like we did in the first sets, so I thought to go more aggressive and if it doesn't work out I tried what I thought would work. It started working.
""I made better shots that I didn't before and started to serve better. In the tiebreak I got a little bit lucky at 5-5 on return. The slice was intentional but the drop shot with back spin against the wind was not intentional. Sometimes you have to be lucky and today is my day.""
Medvedev is 6-3 in his career against Sinner, but the Italian has won the past three.
Medvedev said he was impressed by Sinner's victory over Djokovic, who hadn't lost in Melbourne since 2018.
""I need to recover well and be 100 percent on Sunday,"" said Medvedev, whose only Grand Slam title came at the U.S. Open in 2021.

The HAM president said that by seeing the statements of his former ally and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, he had sensed earlier that there would be a change in the state.
""Recently I had said that there would be a change in Bihar after January 20 and the basis of this was Nitish Kumar's statement. He has said many things against RJD...On this basis, we said that the alliance would not work. Their alliance will not last for long. Nitish Kumar's dream of becoming PM has been shattered... Therefore, after breaking the alliance, he may contest the Lok Sabha elections independently or join the other alliance,"" Manjhi said.
The former Bihar Chief Minister said that if Kumar jumped ship again, he would not compromise with the top post.
""For now, we cannot say when that will happen, but normally Nitish Kumar does not compromise on the Chief Ministeral post. Nothing can be said about whether the NDA alliance under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will accept Kumar as the Chief Minister or not,"" he added.
When asked about his stance on the current situation in the state, Manjhi said that he is with the NDA alliance and would follow the instructions of PM Modi.
Earlier, Lalu's daughter Rohini Acharya took a swipe at RJD's ruling ally, JDU, on X posting that while the 'socialist party' (JDU) styles itself as progressive, its ideology shifts with the changing wind patterns, a statement which triggered cracks within the ruling alliance.
However, a few hours later, all three posts by Lalu's daughter were deleted.
Earlier on Wednesday, on the occasion of Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur's birth centenary celebrations, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar launched a scathing attack on dynastic politics saying, ""Karpoori Thakur never promoted his family. Taking inspiration from him, I too have never promoted any member of my family. After the death of Karpoori Thakur, only his son, Ramnath Thakur, was promoted. But today, people are promoting dynastic politics.""However, ruling JD(U) leader KC Tyagi on Thursday affirmed that the party was still with the Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in the state and the opposition bloc--INDIA.
Speaking to ANI, Tyagi said, ""JD(U) remains a part of the INDIA alliance.""Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party national president JP Nadda cancelled his scheduled visit to Kerala. He was scheduled to participate in a Pad Yatra at Kasaragod on January 27.
Further, in an intriguing development, the BJP's Bihar chief Samrat Chaudhary and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi arrived in the national capital on Thursday for a meeting with the party's top brass. (ANI)"

The prime minister's office said the meeting, which was held in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, focused on the elimination of al-Shabab terrorists who have staged several terror attacks in the country and efforts to bolster national defense.
""We discussed our overall security situation, taking on the Kharijites (al-Shabab militants) and boosting our defense. Our government is determined to face these challenges head-on with a comprehensive and proactive approach,"" Barre said in a statement.
During the meeting, Barre emphasized the government's resolute determination to tackle the security challenges faced by Somalia.
""It reflects a comprehensive and proactive approach in addressing both domestic and foreign threats, with particular emphasis on eliminating the Kharijites and strengthening our national defense capabilities,"" he added.
The meeting also discussed the ongoing operations against terrorists, the security situation, and the need for a unified and proactive response to new challenges.
The meeting came amid a diplomatic spat between Somalia and Ethiopia that prompted Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud to nullify an agreement reached between Addis Ababa and Somaliland, a self-declared region of Somalia, that allows Ethiopia access to the Red Sea in return for its recognition of Somaliland as an independent state.
Somalia has termed the deal which was inked on Jan. 1 to give landlocked Ethiopia rights to use the Red Sea port of Berbera as a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity and appealed to the international community to intervene."

According to a statement issued by the Council of the EU and the European Council, the entities are 'responsible for supporting activities undermining the stability and political transition of Sudan.'
Those sanctioned played roles in arming or financing rival warring factions, according to the EU, adding to Sudan's worsening instability.
The conflict has pitted current army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against his former deputy and leader of the paramilitary RSF, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, causing thousands of deaths and displacing millions.
According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), more than 7 million people have been displaced due to the conflict, and at least 13,000 have been killed.
Among the entities targeted by the EU sanctions, three are controlled by Sudanese armed forces which include part of the Defense Industries System conglomerate, while three others were linked to Dagalo and his brothers. In the Council of the EU and European Council's statement, it was specified that two of the firms played a role in manufacturing weapons and vehicles, and that the others had a role in obtaining military equipment to be used in the conflict.
While the EU has condemned the violence in Sudan since the conflict began, these more stringent measures follow similar actions by other states.
The United States imposed sanctions in December on three former Sudanese officials for their role in undermining peace, security and stability in Sudan.
That followed sanctions imposed by both the U.S. and U.K. on businesses connected to military groups in Sudan.

The European Union needs to focus on blocking illegal crossings while making it easier for asylum-seekers and economic migrants to come in, the new head of the bloc's border protection agency Frontex, Hans Leitjens, has said.
On Tuesday, the German outlet Berliner Zeitung reported on the quotes Leitjens gave to another publication, Die Welt, the day before. Rather than simply implementing the EU's migration rules, the Dutch official has advocated for ""more humanity"" and less ""xenophobia and prejudice.""
""Nothing can stop people from crossing a border, no wall, no fence, no sea, no river,"" Leitjens told Die Welt. He described the bloc's immigration policy as ""a lot of wishful thinking and an often exaggerated choice of words.""
Frontex is the fastest-growing EU agency. Its budget went from â¬364 ($395) million in 2020 to â¬859 ($932) million, while its staff has nearly doubled, from 1,200 to 2,200. Its ""standing corps"" is supposed to be the EU's first uniformed and armed police force, to number 10,000 by 2027.
Leitjens, 60, is a former lieutenant-general in the Dutch police who used to command a Dutch security mission in Afghanistan and fight corruption in the Caribbean, among other things. He was appointed director-general of Frontex in December 2022, with the mission of establishing ""secure and well-functioning external borders"" of the EU.
""Sometimes it is pretended that you can simply put a cap back on the bottle and then the migration will be stopped. But that is a misconception,"" he said. Instead of turning back immigrants on the borders and the high seas, or swiftly deporting those whose asylum claims are ruled groundless, Leitjens has proposed a four-step plan for ""good border management.""
Step one is a crackdown on people-smuggling and illegal crossings, while opening up legal immigration. Step two would be ending ""alarmism"" and ""superficial preoccupation"" with migration, which ""is a reality,"" he said. Step three is to ensure the EU knows exactly who is coming in, important from the security standpoint. Step four would be properly processing asylum applicants and deporting those who fail, because ""the rule of law prevails here.""
Last November, the European Parliament passed amendments to the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), seeking to curb illegal immigration. The changes call for processing asylum-seekers at the external border and deporting failed applicants immediately.
More than a million people applied for asylum in the EU last year, most of them in Germany, almost reaching the 1.3 million record from 2015. Though around half of the applicants were rejected, only one in five have been deported, because their countries of origin refuse to take them back. Meanwhile, in 2023 Frontex registered 380,000 ""irregular"" border crossings into the EU, a 17% increase over the previous year.
""This talk of 'stopping people' and 'closing borders' cannot be our narrative all the time. My job is to create a balance between effective border management and compliance with fundamental rights,"" Leitjens told Die Welt.
He is willing to make deals with Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt, because the EU ""depends on the capabilities and will of these countries"" to combat ""irregular migration."" In return, Brussels ""must provide something in return: visa facilitation, more legal routes into the EU, and economic support,"" Leitjens added. He has ruled out negotiations with Libyan militias, however, describing them as human rights violators and potential war criminals.

Moscow bears no responsibility for US-Russia relations reaching an all-time low, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said, insisting that the burden of restoring them lies solely with Washington.
Relations between the US and Russia went into a tailspin after the start of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, with Moscow condemning Washington and other Western countries for introducing unprecedented sanctions and sending weapons to Kiev. The Kremlin argues the deliveries will only prolong the conflict but not change its outcome.
Another major issue in bilateral relations has been NATO's creeping expansion toward Russia's borders, which Moscow views as an existential threat. Russia has said that Ukraine's desire to join the US-led military bloc was one of the main reasons for the current conflict.
In an interview with CBS News on Monday, when asked about the potential for improving relations between Moscow and Washington amid the stand-off over Ukraine, Lavrov stressed that Russia would not take the initiative to repair them because it was not his country that spoiled them in the first place.
The minister stressed that the ties between the two powers were shattered by ""those who invented the Russian threat"" and ""those who ignored huge amount of goodwill shown by President Vladimir Putin during his first two terms."" According to Lavrov, Western policymakers decided that the Russian leader was ""so nice,"" and tried to ""keep him in [their] pocket,"" which was a mistake.
Lavrov went on to regret that the current generation of politicians in Washington had seemingly drawn no lessons from what he described as ""unacceptable policies which the United States started to promote"" in the early 1990s.
The minister's comments come after Putin admitted last month that he was a ""naive"" person early in his political career because he believed that there was no fundamental reason for Russia and the West to be at odds after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, he said that he later realized that Western countries were seeking to bring about the partition of Russia into several entities in order to gain more global influence.

The storm's impact led to significant challenges for flight operations at Ireland's airports.
Dublin Airport, one of the busiest in the country, reported that Storm Isha posed a significant challenge to its flight operations. As of 7 pm on January 21, airlines had canceled 114 flights, with 58 incoming flights and 56 departing flights affected. Additionally, due to adverse weather conditions, 36 flights had to be diverted to other airports.
Some specific flight incidents included a plane arriving at Cork Airport from Amsterdam being diverted to Shannon, and a flight to Bristol being canceled. Passengers traveling with Ryanair were warned of potential disruptions to their flights departing from Ireland and were advised to check for updates before heading to the airport.
The storm prompted a red weather alert for counties Donegal, Galway, and Mayo, urging residents to take precautions. Met Eireann, the Irish meteorological service, had forecast ""extremely strong"" winds and ""destructive gusts"" in these areas, especially along coastal and exposed regions, on January 21.
Paul Rock, who chaired a meeting of the National Emergency Coordination to coordinate the government's response, described Storm Isha as a ""particularly nasty"" storm. He cautioned road users about hazardous driving conditions caused by debris and urged people to avoid fallen electricity wires.
While delays were expected at ports, airports, and potentially some public transport systems, Rock advised travelers to check online for service disruptions. He also mentioned that schools opened as usual on January 22 since the weather warnings were set to expire in the early hours of the day.
The red warnings were in effect from 5 pm to 9 pm on January 21 in Galway and Mayo, and from 9 pm on January 21 until 1 am on January 22 in Donegal. A status orange wind warning covered the entire country from 4 pm or 5 pm on Sunday until 2 am or 3 am on January 22. During these periods, conditions included large coastal waves, challenging travel conditions, fallen trees, and potential damage to power lines."
8AE7H2N5ML_2WBID57HC49LKY4,Can the US Do More to Help Ukraine,"Voice of America 25th January 2024, 09:35 GMT+11","Voice of America 25th January 2024, 09:35 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105555/can-the-us-do-more-to-help-ukraine,"washington - As Ukrainian forces struggle to fend off Russia's invasion with dwindling supplies of rockets and other munitions, some supporters are arguing that there is more the Biden administration could do to re-arm them without waiting for long-delayed congressional approval.
The administration's request for $61.4 billion in new military assistance is tied up in a partisan battle in Congress, where Republicans have linked it to demands for a package of tough new restrictions on migrants and asylum-seekers at America's southern border.
But some Ukraine advocates point out that the administration still has previously approved authority to ship $4.2 billion worth of weapons to Ukraine from its own stockpiles.
The catch: Without a new bill passing Congress, there is no money to replenish the American stockpile, leaving questions about U.S. military readiness and the country's ability to respond to a crisis somewhere else, such as Taiwan.
'There is no statutory requirement to replace equipment sent to allies' under the Presidential Drawdown Authority approved by Congress in December 2022, Mark Cancian, a former Office of Management and Budget defense specialist, told Bloomberg.
He suggested that in theory, the Department of Defense can send weapons and munitions to Ukraine without replenishment funds.
Money better spent in US, say critics
Pentagon spokesman Pat Ryder said the U.S. military understands the severity of Ukraine's needs, and that's why it is working with Congress to win approval for the supplemental funding.
'While we do have that $4.2 billion in authority, we don't have the funds available to replenish those stocks should we expend that,' he explained at a briefing this month. 'And with no timeline in sight, we have to make those hard decisions.'
Critics of President Joe Biden's $61.4 billion supplemental funding request, which would also include aid for Israel and Taiwan, have argued that the money could be better spent at home and that the administration's first priority should be securing the border with Mexico, where record numbers of asylum-seekers have been crossing illegally into the United States.
They have also called for greater transparency and accountability concerning the $111 billion in weapons, equipment, humanitarian assistance and other aid that has already been sent to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion almost two years ago.
Reducing US supply worth it, say some
Some Ukraine supporters, however, argue that the risks of allowing Russia to gain ground on the battlefield because of Ukrainian supply shortages outweigh the risks of allowing the U.S. stockpile to be temporarily reduced.
'Certainly at the moment, it would seem to be that the greatest risk is one of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin gaining some battlefield successes, certainly killing more Ukrainian civilians, if not gaining advantage on the front lines,' said Scott Cullinane, director of government relations at Razom, a U.S.-based Ukrainian diaspora organization.
Cullinane told VOA Ukrainian he believes withholding military aid sends a message of American weakness.
'It creates doubts in the minds of our Ukrainian partners that the U.S. is willing to stand with them and makes an opening for Putin to think he can outweigh us by simply extending the war,' he said.
Alexander Vindman, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who was the director for European affairs at the National Security Council, also believes the risk of reducing the U.S. weapons stockpile is overstated.
'The reality ... is that the traditional Republican hawks will continue investing in the U.S. defense,' the Ukrainian-born Vindman said in an interview.
'They're not going to take risks to the U.S. defense, especially when it undermines this almost antiquated perception that the Republican Party is good for defense, is good for the defense industry and is supportive of the military.'
Vindman added that even if the administration did send the $4.2 billion of weapons to Ukraine immediately, it would cover that country's battlefield needs for no more than several weeks.
Michael Allen, a former special assistant to the president and senior director at the National Security Council, argued that by not using its remaining authority to help Ukraine, the Biden administration is maintaining pressure on Congress to approve the full $61.4 billion request.
'We want them to look at the funds that have been appropriated and conclude that the Department of Defense is correct,' he told VOA Ukrainian. 'We need this urgently, so it's good that the administration is very clear about where they are.'

This marks a unique reciprocal exchange following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to France on its National Day in July 2023.
This momentous visit by President Macron culminates the 25th-anniversary celebrations of the Strategic Partnership between India and France.
The two leaders have engaged in a series of high-profile meetings throughout 2023, underscoring the strength and depth of the bilateral relationship.
Their interactions have spanned various global platforms, including the COP 28 Summit in Dubai, the G20 Leaders' Summit, and the G7 Summit in Hiroshima. Notably, President Macron was also the Guest of Honour at the Bastille Day Celebrations in France in July 2023.
This visit by President Macron marks the sixth time a French leader has been invited as the Chief Guest at India's Republic Day. This tradition began with President Jacques Chirac in 1976, followed by Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1980, Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, and Francois Hollande in 2016.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's last visit to France for Bastille Day in July 2023 was a spectacle of symbolism and substance. The visit showcased the strong bonds between the two nations, with a tri-service Indian armed forces contingent marching at Champs-Elysees and a spectacular flypast by Rafale jets.
During the visit, Prime Minister Modi was honoured with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, a prestigious recognition in France. A State Banquet at the Louvre Museum and a private dinner at Elysee highlighted the grandeur of the occasion. The Prime Minister also addressed the Indian community at La Seine Musicale.
On the substantive front, two key roadmaps, namely the India-France Horizon 2047 Roadmap and the Indo-Pacific Roadmap, were adopted. A total of 12 crucial documents were signed, covering areas such as UPI on Eiffel, museum cooperation, digital technologies, civil aviation, space (Trishna IA), and MDA (STP).
Furthermore, 11 announcements were made, including the establishment of the French Bureau in Hyderabad, cooperation in sports, increased CEFIPRA funding, a 5-year Schengen visa for Indian degree holders from French universities, visa exemption on official passports, and collaboration in launch services between NSIL and Arianespace.
Upon his arrival at the Jaipur International Airport on Thursday, the French President was received by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra and Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma.
In Jaipur, the French President and Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed bilateral ties and exchanged perspectives on a wide-range of bilateral and global issues.
""Taking India-France Strategic Partnership to greater heights! Productive discussions held between PM @narendramodi and President @EmmanuelMacron of France in Jaipur. The two leaders took stock of bilateral tiesexchanged perspectives on a wide-range of bilateral and global issues,"" Ministry of External Affiars (MEA) Official Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal wrote on X.
PM Modi said that it is a matter of great pride that the French President will be taking part in the 75th Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi on Friday.
He said that Macron's presence not only strengthens the ties between the two nations but also adds a significant chapter to ""our shared history of friendship and collaboration.""PM Modi added that he is elated about the fact that Macron began his India visit from Jaipur.
In a post on X, PM Modi wrote, ""Welcome to India, my friend President @EmmanuelMacron. I am happy that President Macron begins his India visit from Jaipur in Rajasthan, a land with rich culture, heritage and talented people.""""It is a matter of great pride that he will be taking part in our Republic Day celebrations tomorrow, 26th January, in Delhi. His presence not only strengthens the ties between our nations but also adds a significant chapter to our shared history of friendship and collaboration,"" PM Modi added.

Colombia has extinguished hundreds of fires this month, but 25 continue to burn, according to data from the National Disaster Risk Management Unit (UNGRD) on Wednesday.
In the departments of Santander and Cundinamarca, where the capital, Bogota, is located, the fires have consumed about 600 hectares of forest and states of emergency were declared.
The emergency measures free up funds to 'quickly address the negative impact on the department's natural resources,' said Cundinamarca Governor Jorge Emilio Rey.
More than half of the country's municipalities are on red alert over the fire threat, with the areas around the capital hit hard.
Columns of white smoke billowed from the mountains surrounding Bogota on Wednesday, with people in the commercial district seen masking up against the thick haze and ash.
'Because of the burning of the hills, all the smoke is coming to this side, and it is affecting us a lot,' said 62-year-old driver Hector Rafael Escudero.
President Gustavo Petro said global warming was aggravating the El Nino weather, a phenomenon typically associated with increased temperatures worldwide, drought in some parts of the world and heavy rains elsewhere.
'This may be the hottest year in the history of mankind,' he said, calling on 'every mayor, every governor and the national government' to prioritize water supplies.
Nine towns in the north, center and east of Colombia posted record temperatures Tuesday of up to 40.4 degrees Celsius.
In Bogota, a voracious blaze has engulfed the mountains to the west of the city since Monday and wild animals have been spotted sheltering in built-up areas. These creatures include coatis, porcupines, birds and frogs, authorities said.
Members of the Colombian Army and volunteers were deployed with hoes, rakes and machetes to clear unburned brush from the sloping hills surrounding the capital as water-ferrying helicopters buzzed overhead.
'Some areas have already been affected by the fire and some vegetation has not yet been consumed. What we are doing is trying to divide the burned areas from the unburned ones to prevent the fire from continuing to spread,' said Daniel Trujillo, a 23-year-old Colombian Civil Defense volunteer.
Gustavo Andres Betancourt, a member of the Colombian army, described challenging conditions.
'Some hotspots are still active. They are being contained, but at night, due to the high altitude and the winds, they start up again, creating new fires,' he said.
Authorities have warned of a 'significant deterioration' in air quality in the city of about 8 million people.
One of the world's most biodiverse countries, Colombia has for months been suffering from record-high temperatures and drought conditions in the southern hemisphere winter, as climate change wreaks havoc.
These conditions are expected to last through June, forecasters have said."

According to an analysis of Irish job postings conducted by job site Indeed, instrumentation engineers, ad reviewers, and mechanical and electrical project managers are topping the list of the ""Hardest to Fill Jobs.""
The analysis, which covered job postings from January 1, 2023, to the end of November 2023, aimed to identify positions that remained open for over 60 days, indicating a significant challenge in recruitment.
Instrumentation engineers claimed the first position, with nearly 63 percent of advertised roles remaining unfilled for 60-plus days. These engineers are responsible for planning, installing, monitoring, and maintaining control systems and machinery within manufacturing environments.
Various other engineering roles, primarily related to construction, also featured in the top 20. With a shortage of construction workers, posts for mechanical and electrical project managers, civil supervisors, civil technicians, mechanical, electrical, plumbing managers, and ecologists, were among the challenging positions to fill.
Legal roles, such as lawyers, ranked fourth on the list, with 57 percent of job postings remaining open for more than 60 days, while tax consultants secured the fifth spot, with 49 percent of positions unfilled within this time frame.
The rise of online advertising and the prominence of social media were evident in the analysis, as jobs for ad reviewers claimed the second position at 61 percent, and positions for online moderators were in the 13th spot, with just under 50 percent of openings remaining unfilled.
Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Indeed, noted, ""Given the increased cost of living, employees in some hard-to-fill roles may have a degree of leverage when it comes to seeking pay rises and the option of potentially moving roles if the available ones offer better pay and conditions.""
He also highlighted that this data could inform policymakers and those in education and training sectors seeking ways to bolster the talent supply in crucial sectors, whether through expanding third-level opportunities or creating more apprenticeship programs."

The 88-member assembly, founded in 1982, supervises the most powerful authority but has rarely intervened directly in policymaking.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is 84, so the new assembly is expected to play a significant role in choosing his successor since its members are only elected every eight years.
In a statement, Rouhani criticized the Guardian Council's ruling as 'politically biased ... [one] that will undermine the nation's confidence in the system.'
Close to moderates, Rouhani was elected president in a landslide in 2013 and 2017 on a promise to reduce Iran's diplomatic isolation.
But the mid-ranking cleric angered political hardliners who opposed any rapprochement with the U.S. 'Great Satan' after reaching a 2015 nuclear pact with six major powers.
The deal unraveled in 2018 when then-U.S. President Donald Trump ditched the agreement and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. Efforts to revive the pact have failed.
'There was no reason given for the Guardian Council's decision,' a source close to Rouhani told Reuters, adding that 'no decision has been made yet for an appeal' as Rouhani has three days to object against the ruling.
'Rouhani has been a member of the assembly since 1999 for three terms. ... It will be interesting to see what the reason for his disqualification was.'
The 12-member Guardian Council, which oversees elections and legislation, disqualified 80% of candidates running for the assembly in its last election in 2016.
Moderate politicians have accused the Guardian Council of disqualifying rivals and said that excluding candidates from the race undermines the vote's legitimacy.
A low turnout for the upcoming elections is expected, with Rouhani saying the majority of people do not want to vote and that this will favor the ruling minority, which relies on low turnout.
'Undoubtedly, the ruling minority overtly seeks to reduce public participation in elections ... intending to dictate the people's fate through their decisions,' he said in the statement published on Rouhani's website.
With Rouhani's disqualification, the Guardian Council had made it clear that hardliners intended to keep moderates away from the assembly, a pro-reform insider said.
The Guardian Council has also disqualified hundreds of hopefuls running for the parliamentary election also to be held on March 1.
State media reported that only 30 mid-ranking moderate candidates have been qualified to stand for the 290-seat parliament. Around 12,000 hopefuls will run for parliament.

Jordan Martinook scored a breakaway goal with 2:27 left in regulation as the visiting Carolina Hurricanes snapped the Boston Bruins' nine-game point streak with a 3-2 win on Wednesday night.
The Hurricanes, who had a 33-28 shots-on-goal advantage, are 9-2-1 in their last 12 games.
Martin Necas and Teuvo Teravainen each scored for Carolina, which led 2-0 at the second intermission thanks to a 2-for-3 effort on the power play.
Sebastian Aho had two assists.
Spencer Martin, who was claimed off waivers from Columbus last Friday, made 26 saves in his Hurricanes debut.
Brad Marchand scored back-to-back goals in the third period to tie the score. He and Ray Bourque are now tied for fifth on the franchise's all-time goals list with 395 apiece.
Trent Frederic assisted on both of Marchand's goals.
Linus Ullmark made 30 saves in the loss, which was Boston's first in regulation since Jan. 4.
Martin's bid at becoming the first goaltender to shut out the Bruins this season ended as Marchand slammed home a Frederic rebound just 90 seconds into the third.
The Bruins needed just a few minutes more to make it 2-2, equalizing at the 7:20 mark when Marchand crashed the net to backhand a rebound that Martin left in the crease after making a stop on Charlie Coyle.
On the deciding goal, Martinook took the break-in pass from Necas and sent a dribbling puck past Ullmark.
The Hurricanes took the lead when Necas scored with 1:56 left in the first period, slipping a wrist shot from the top of the left circle through traffic and past Ullmark's blocker.
Carolina maintained control in the middle frame with eight straight shots on goal before Boston recorded one, but Ullmark held strong -- and got some help from his post for the second time on Brent Burns' point shot -- to keep Boston's deficit at 1-0 halfway through.
On another power-play opportunity, Teravainen doubled the visitors' lead at 11:50 of the second. Aho's pass to the slot pinballed around, but Teravainen knocked the puck home despite Coyle's strong stick check in front.

Speaking to ANI, Venugopal said that it is not the duty of the CM to ask the police to file an FIR against an individual.
""This is like old Maharaja rule. If there is a law-and-order situation, it is the duty of the police to register an FIR. It is not the duty of the CM to ask the police to file an FIR against an individual. This is clearly a political conspiracy.

France has halted the publication of a book by its former ambassador to Niger Sylvain Itte, claiming that the benefits of its release are outweighed by risks, French media reported on Wednesday.
Itte was expelled from the West African nation by its military government, which took power following a coup last year.
The Paris-based weekly Le Canard Enchaine claimed in an investigative report that the French Foreign Ministry had written to Itte in mid-January, advising him that the memoir contained several pieces of sensitive information about France's ""crisis management system.""
The ministry also reportedly expressed concerns about the envoy documenting exchanges between him, the French government, and Niger's military authorities in the book, which was scheduled for publication in March.
A spokesman for Les Editions du Rocher, the publisher of Itte's work, told AFP that ""everything was planned and almost ready,"" but they are ""not quite sure what happened.""
""I imagine some passages were not to the ministry's liking,"" he added.
Ambassador Itte left Niamey at the end of September after being declared persona non grata following the overthrow of President Mohamed Bazoum on July 26. The coup leaders terminated military agreements with France and secured the withdrawal of French troops, accusing them of failing in the fight against Islamist terrorists in the Sahel region.
The French government announced earlier this month that it had closed its embassy in Niger until further notice as relations deteriorated with the new leadership, which Paris refers to as ""illegitimate authorities.""
On Wednesday, Les Editions du Rocher said the envoy's book, titled 'At the Heart of French Diplomacy in Africa', is about more than just last year's standoff between France and its former colony's military government. The publishing house described it as a ""geopolitical book about a country and a region in upheaval,"" according to AFP.
The outlet also quoted a diplomatic source as saying that books written by French diplomats must comply with ""precise ethical rules"" and go through a ""completely standard"" vetting process.

ISLAMABAD, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- As the mercury falls to single digits in Pakistan's federal capital, Islamabad, making the weather chilly and foggy on Sunday, a hotel hall decorated with traditional Chinese red lanterns was a source of warmth and coziness for people gathered to celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year.
Buzzing with slogans of ""Long Live Pakistan-China Friendship,"" the hall was filled with people from both Pakistan and China, including teachers, students, and volunteers.
During the event, a dazzling array of performances, including traditional dances, sitcoms, and Kung Fu, by Pakistani and Chinese children, filled the hearts of the audience with joy, peace, and harmony.
The gala was kicked off by a classical dance, ""Flying Swallow,"" performed by Chinese girl Liu Huijun. ""The flying swallows symbolize the return of spring to the earth. I hope to bring New Year blessings to Pakistani friends through this dance,"" she said.
Donning a glittery golden gown, Sidra Sajjad, an 8-year-old student and dance performer, was all smiles when she was inquired about her dress and performance during the event.

There can be no better symbol of the depth of our friendship and the strength of our partnership than 14 July 2023 and 26 January.""She said the two nations have enriched each other through philosophy, literature, art, scriptures, languages, jewellery and textile art. She called Paris a ""beloved destination"" for Indian tourists.
She stated, ""If our troops marching on Champs-Elysees and Kartvaya Path are symbols of our solidarity, the International Day of Yoga at Eiffel Tower or a Dior Fashion show at Gateway of India equally reflect our deep connections. Paris is a beloved destination for Indian tourists. France, in turn, is among the top contributors to tourism earnings in India from abroad. Last year, four major Paris museums hosted Indian exhibitions.""Speaking about the importance of India's Republic Day, She said, ""Today is the 75th Republic Day of India. On this very day, India got into force the longest-written constitution of the world, just over two years after gaining independence, making India a Republic. For us Indians, this was not a new system of governance as we had known this concept since millennia ago.""She stressed that the Constitution has shaped India's journey as an independent nation. She stressed that the Constitution has been a guiding beacon of India's social and economic progress.
""This constitution has shaped our journey as an independent nation. It has united the world's largest and most diverse societies. It has knitted together the world's largest democracy and most diverse society. It has been a guiding beacon of our social and economic progress. Liberty, equality, fraternity, justice are at its very foundation.
In a post on X, Rashtrapati Bhavan stated, ""President Droupadi Murmu hosted a banquet in honour of His Excellency Mr Emmanuel Macron, President of the French Republic at Rashtrapati Bhavan. President Murmu expressed satisfaction that both sides have outlined an ambitious vision of our partnership for India's Amrit Kaal and added that this visit has strengthened our resolve to realise this vision.""Earlier in the day, French President Macron participated as the Chief Guest in the 75th Republic Day parade.

According to the MND, one of the 18 People's Liberation Army (PLA) fighter jets breached the Taiwan Strait median line in the northeast sector of the country's air defence identification zone.
Meanwhile, three PLA aircraft flew into the southwest corner of Taiwan's ADIZ.
Taiwan responded by sending aircraft and navy ships, as well as deploying air defence missile systems, to monitor PLA action.
The defence ministry of Taiwan, meanwhile, also tracked three Chinese balloons on Wednesday.
According to Taiwan News, the first crossed the median line at 5:57 a.m. 133 km (72 NM) west of Keelung, the second at 3:11 p.m. 230 km (124 NM) west of Pingtung, and the third at 3:30 p.m. 244 km (132 NM) west of Pingtung.
The balloons travelled east and later disappeared at 6:32 a.m., 3:57 p.m., and 4:14 p.m, respectively.
Since September 2020, China has intensified its use of grey zone tactics by gradually increasing the number of military aircraft and navy ships operating near Taiwan.
Gray zone tactics are defined as ""an effort or series of efforts beyond steady-state deterrence and assurance that attempts to achieve one's security objectives without resort to direct and sizable use of force,"" reported Taiwan News.
This month, Taiwan detected 223 Chinese military planes and 106 navy vessels. (ANI)"

""HR and CE ministry didn't ban anything. There are no restrictions on providing Annadhanam (offering food to those in need) or placing LED screens (for watching the telecast of the 'Pran Pratishtha') inside or outside the temple,"" Sekar Babu told reporters.
The minister's response came in the wake of BJP leaders, including Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, allegations that LED screens put up to watch the live telecast were removed by the state police from several temple premises.
They said that even the LED screens put up at Kamakshi Amman Temple in Kancheepuram district, where Sitharaman was scheduled to watch the Pran Pratishtha, were ""plucked"" by the police.
However, Sekar Babu said that the state government acted as per the law. ""As per the law, one should get permission. If there is proper permission, we will allow that. But if one mixes spiritualism with politics or uses spiritualism as a political tool, then the government will take action in compliance with the law,"" the minister said.
Earlier, the BJP approached the Supreme Court and the Madras High Court against the alleged oral order of the state government banning live telecast of the ""Pran Prathishta"" of Ram Lalla in temples across the state.
The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Tamil Nadu government on its alleged oral order to ban live telecasts of the 'Pran Prathishta' of Ram Lalla at Ayodhya in temples across Tamil Nadu. The apex court said that the state government can't ban such events on the grounds that Hindus are a ""minority"" in certain areas.
""This is a homogenous society... Do not prevent only on the ground that the A or B community is there,"" a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta told counsel appearing for the Tamil Nadu government.
The bench pulled up the Tamil Nadu government for allegedly ordering such a general order and said permission cannot be denied on the sole ground that other communities are living in the location.
The apex court called these orders ""atrocious"" and directed the state not to summarily deny such permissions.
However, Tamil Nadu told the Supreme Court that there are no such restrictions and there is no ban on the live telecast, performance of poojas, archanas, annadhanasm, bhajans on the occasion of ""Pran Prathishta"" of Lord Ram at Ayodhya today and the plea is just politically motivated. (ANI)"

The High Court passed a judgement allowing the Income Tax Department to appeal against the order of CIC.
Justice Subramonium Prasad said that the CIC does not have the jurisdiction to direct furnishing of information, provided in Section 138 of the IT Act.
""In any case, even if they had the jurisdiction, the failure to give PM CARES, a notice of hearing, would in itself have vitiated the impugned,"" Justice Prasad said in the judgement.
The bench observed, ""The information, as sought for by the respondent herein, has been sought from the CPIO of the Income Tax Department and not from the PM CARES Fund. The Petitioner herein does not treat PM CARES Fund as an authority. Since the information sought for by the respondent relates to a third party, PM CARES Fund ought to have been heard.""The court noted that in the present case, the question which arose was whether Section 138(2) of the IT Act which also contains a non-obstante clause would override Section 22 of the RTI Act or not.
The high court held, ""In view of the fact that Section 138(1)(b) of the IT Act mandates that information relating to an assessee can only be supplied subject to the satisfaction ofPrincipal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner or Principal Commissioner or Commissioner, as the case may be, it can be said that Section 138(2) of the IT Act would prevail over Section 22 of the RTI Act.""The high court was dealing with a petition filed by the CPIO/Dy. Commissioner of Income Tax challenging the Order of 27.04.2022, passed by the Central Information Commission (CIC), directing the CPIO to provide the copies of all the documents submitted in the exemption application and copies of the file notings granting the approval relating to PM CARES Fund under the Right to Information (RTI) application filed by the Respondent Girish Mittal.
Advocate Zoheb Hossain, special counsel for the IT Department, submitted that the information sought by the Petitioner would be hit by Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act as the same relates to the disclosure of personal information.
It was further stated that the CIC has not ruled or adjudicated on the question as to what is the public interest involved in the case which would outweigh the protected interest and without adjudicating the said issue, the CIC could not have directed the Petitioner to give the information sought for, more so when the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO), the DCIT (Exemption) and the Appellate Authority have rejected the application of the respondent on the ground that the information sought is personal in nature.
On the other hand, counsel for respondent Mittal contended that there is an overwhelming public interest in directing the authority to supply the information sought for.
He stated that the PM CARES Fund has been created to serve the public. The PM CARES Fund is a charitable fund which has been established to provide relief to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic or any similar emergencies.
He also contended that the Income Tax Department approved the applications given by the PM CARES Fund for the grant of exemption on Income Tax under Section 80G of the IT Act on 27.03.2020.
He argued that the respondent wants to know the exact procedure followed by the Income Tax Department in granting such a swift approval and to see whether any rules or procedures were bypassed by the Income Tax Department in granting such approvals. He further states that the information sought by the respondent does not include any personal information. (ANI)"

Biden, a Democrat, is pushing to sway blue-collar workers his way in critical automaking swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, hoping to cut into the advantage that Republican former President Donald Trump has enjoyed with white voters who don't have a college degree.
Labor experts said that the UAW usually endorses candidates later as it has a mix of Democratic, Republican and unaffiliated voters.
""This November we can stand up and elect someone who stands with us and supports our cause, or we can elect someone who will divide us and fight us every step of the way. That's what this choice is about,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said in announcing Biden's endorsement.
Biden will speak as the union closes out a three-day gathering in Washington to chart its political priorities. It will be his first political event since Tuesday's primary vote in New Hampshire, where Trump cemented his hold on core Republican voters with a victory and Biden scored a write-in win.
Biden frequently bills himself as the most labor-friendly leader in American history, and he went so far as to turn up on a picket line with union workers at a GM parts warehouse in the Detroit area during a strike last fall.
FILE - U.S. President Joe Biden speaks to striking United Auto Workers on the picket line outside the Willow Run Redistribution Center, UAW Local 174, Sept. 26, 2023, in Van Buren Township, Michigan.
""He heard the call, and he stood up and he showed up,"" Fain said of Biden's historic picket line appearance. He drew a contrast between Biden's pro-union efforts and Trump, who he said was anti-union.
As recently as Monday, Fain was restrained in his comments, saying as the conference opened, 'We have to make our political leaders stand up with us. Support our cause, or you will not get our endorsement.""
At this week's conference, support for Biden among union members has varied from enthusiastic to uncertainty about whether to even vote come Election Day.
Caroline Loveless, a Waterloo, Iowa, resident and retired UAW member, said she would enthusiastically vote for Biden, recalling his appearance on a picket line during last fall's strike. She said his appearance should remind union members that Biden is on their side.
""I hope they don't get amnesia,"" Loveless said, ""come Election Day.""
William Louis, of Groton, Connecticut, another member, said that while he is ""fed up with politicians,"" he will reluctantly vote for Biden, although he said the president had not fully earned members' vote given the current state of the economy.
Louis said Biden would get his vote because Trump, the likely Republican nominee, 'was a terrible president.""
United Auto Workers union member Leo Carrillo, poses for a photograph on Jan. 23, 2024, in Washington. Carrillo, a member from Kansas City, said Biden's appearance on the picket line helped him to decide to vote for Biden in November.
Leo Carrillo, a member from Kansas City, said Biden's appearance on the picket line showed that ""he was there for us,"" and helped him to decide to vote for Biden in November.
""For me it meant a lot"" that a sitting president would show that level of solidarity to autoworkers, Carrillo said. ""But there's more work to be done,"" he said, pointing to the PRO Act - proposed legislation that would make it easier to unionize on a federal level. The legislation advanced to the U.S. Senate but does not have enough support to survive in case of a filibuster.
Biden could run into dissent, however, over his support for Israel in its war on Hamas in Gaza. Some younger members of the union were less enthusiastic about the president for that reason.
Johannah King-Slutzky, a Columbia University graduate student and member of the student workers union within the UAW, was one of several attendees who chanted ""cease fire now"" during Fain's afternoon speech Monday. The union called for a cease fire in Gaza in December.
""Right now, he's done nothing to earn my vote,"" King-Slutzky said, because ""he has not acted with urgency to stop the genocide in Gaza.""
The UAW has roughly 380,000 members."

Ukraine's murder of its own citizens in an attack on a Russian military Il-76 plane, was ""a monstrous act,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.
A Russian military transport aircraft carrying 65 Ukrainian POWs went down in a field in Russia's Belgorod Region on Wednesday morning; there were no survivors.
Russia's Defense Ministry has insisted that the plane was brought down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft missiles, noting that Kiev had been informed of the flight, its passengers and destination ahead of time. The POWs were meant to take part in a prisoner swap later that day, according to Russian and Ukrainian sources.
Kiev, however, has disputed Moscow's claim that the Il-76 was shot down by a Ukrainian missile; President Vladimir Zelensky has called for an international investigation into the incident that would ""determine all the hard facts.""
Peskov noted that Kiev's actions ""defy understanding"" and that it's hard to explain the logic behind the attack, suggesting that the Zelensky Administration should explain their actions.
He also stated that it is currently unclear how Kiev's attack will affect any future prisoner exchange negotiations, but noted that it's too early to say anything definitively on that matter.
As for Zelensky's proposal to launch an international investigation, Peskov stated that ""if he means an international investigation of the crimes committed by the Kiev regime, then it is undoubtedly necessary.""
Shortly after the plane crashed on Wednesday morning, the Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainskaya Pravda initially reported, citing sources within the military, that the aircraft had indeed been brought down by Kiev's forces as it was believed to have been carrying S-300 missiles. That report was later deleted after Russia revealed that the plane was carrying Ukrainian POWs.
The Ukrainian General Staff, meanwhile, has stated that it has and will continue to use ""measures of destruction"" against Russian transport aircraft in the Belgorod Region, adding that they pose a ""terrorist threat.""
Russia has requested an emergency UN Security Council meeting to discuss the downing of the military aircraft, with Russia's Foreign Ministry accusing Kiev of committing a ""terrorist act"" and blatantly disregarding the lives of its own citizens.

He thanked the Election Commission of India for ensuring the smooth conduct of elections.
""I would also specifically thank our team @ECISVEEP for their invaluable hard work in strengthening our democratic fabric and ensuring smooth conduct of elections. Let us all work towards increasing voter awareness and turnout, that makes our democracy stronger,"" Kishan Reddy posted on X.
Since 2011, National Voters' Day has been celebrated on January 25 every year across the country to mark the foundation day of the Election Commission of India, i.e., January 25, 1950.
Meanwhile, emphasising that technology has been leveraged to bring in transparency and efficiency in all aspects of elections, Chief Election Commissioner of India Rajiv Kumar said on Thursday that misinformation, deep fakes and the use of artificial intelligence are being used increasingly to undercut the ""faith and trust"" of the people in the electoral process.
He further said that any attempts to compromise this fundamental tenet through false narratives will be met with swift and robust measures to uphold the integrity of our elections.
The Chief Election Commissioner extended warm greetings to all voters on the momentous occasion of the 14th National Voters' Day and said that any attempts to compromise this fundamental tenet through false narratives will be met with swift and robust measures to uphold the integrity of our elections""While technology has made possible many enabling features to enrich the electoral process, it has also posed various challenges to the democratic exercise. We, however, stand firm in our resolve to maintain a level playing field and foster an informed electorate.

He further urged first-time voters to exercise their franchise with full enthusiasm, adding that the youth will make a resounding and emphatic statement by voting and motivating their peers to do the same.

Foreign ministers of the European Union have reached a tentative agreement to start a naval mission in the Red Sea, EU foreign policy head Josep Borrell announced on Monday, after a ministerial meeting in Brussels.
Germany, France, and Italy have proposed the step in response to requests from the Netherlands, whose merchant shipping has been impacted by the months-long Houthi attacks on vessels linked to Israel.
""We have agreed, in principle, to start the EU mission in the Red Sea,"" Borrell said after the meeting, according to the Italian news agency ANSA. ""Now we have to work on unanimity as to when (it will start).""
The European External Action Service aims to have the mission established by February 19 and start operations soon afterward, Reuters has reported, citing anonymous diplomatic sources in Brussels.
According to an internal document leaked to several media outlets, the mission would involve ""at least three"" naval vessels. A diplomatic source told the German outlet Deutsche Welle (DW) on Sunday that the preferred option would be to expand Operation Agenor, the French-led monitoring mission in the Strait of Hormuz.
Spain has made it clear it will not participate in the mission, but Madrid is unwilling to veto it altogether.
The Houthis, which run the western part of Yemen, declared in October that they would interdict any Israeli-linked vessels in the Red Sea, in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza.
After the US and UK launched air and missile strikes against the Houthis earlier this month, as part of 'Operation Prosperity Guardian', the group declared that any British or American vessels would be legitimate targets as well.
On Monday, the Houthis announced they had attacked merchant vessel Ocean Jazz, a cargo ship often used by the US military to move supplies. The US Central Command has called the claim ""patently false,"" however.
The EU is acting because it wants to be seen doing something, but doesn't seem to have thought the operation through, according to Nathalie Tocci, the director of Italy's Institute for International Affairs (IAI).
""Let's put this in perspective. The Saudis have been bombing the hell out of Yemen for ten years. Did they actually succeed in weakening the Houthis' military capacities? No they didn't,"" Tocci told DW on Sunday. Riyadh had been against fighting the Houthis since 2015, without much success, before agreeing to a ceasefire last year.
""So what makes us think some sort of maritime operation, which presumably would have a defensive rather than an offensive purpose, would actually deter in any shape or form?"" added Tocci.

Murray Watt, the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, on Monday announced that federal, state and territory governments have committed 592.8 million Australian dollars (389.4 million U.S. dollars) to the National Fire Ant Eradication Program 2023-2027 Response Plan.
Native to South America, the RIFA can cause structural problems for infrastructure assets by building nests under structures and devastate agriculture industries by damaging crops and machinery. In rare cases their venomous sting can cause a life-threatening allergic reaction in humans.
According to the 2023-2027 plan, the RIFA is capable of establishing colonies in 99 percent of mainland Australia and if it is not eradicated in the country the species will cause in excess of 1.25 billion AUD (821.3 million USD) worth of damage every year.
In Australia the ants have mostly been contained to the north-eastern state of Queensland -- where they were first detected in 2001 -- but Watt said on Monday that a national biosecurity response was critical to stop their spread.
""Eradicating fire ants is not an easy task -- many countries have tried and failed, but we have been largely successful in containing their spread,"" he said in a statement.
""The plan uses the best available science, technology, and innovative approaches to deliver efficiencies and maximise resource allocation.""
Of the total funding commitment, 296 million AUD (194.4 million USD) will come from the federal government, with the governments of Australia's seven mainland states and territories to provide the rest."
8Z2AHSK3Z4_3YRIOEMA93O672P,High Stakes For China Amid Simmering Iran-Pakistan Tensions,"RFE 23rd January 2024, 07:15 GMT+11","RFE 23rd January 2024, 07:15 GMT+11",20240122,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103272/high-stakes-for-china-amid-simmering-iran-pakistan-tensions,"Air strikes and diplomatic sparring between Iran and Pakistan have raised difficult questions for China and its influence in the region amid growing fears the upheaval sweeping across the Middle East could spread.
Since the tit-for-tat strikes on January 16 and 18 against militant and separatist groups, Islamabad and Tehran have signaled they want to de-escalate the situation and that their foreign ministers will hold talks in Pakistan on January 29.
But the attacks have exposed the fine line between peace and conflict in the region and put the spotlight on China, a close partner of both countries, to see if it can use its sway to ramp down tensions and avoid a conflict that would jeopardize Beijing's economic and geopolitical interests in the region.
'For China, the stakes are high and they really can't afford for things to get any worse between Iran and Pakistan,' Abdul Basit, an associate research fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told RFE/RL.
China has tens of billions of dollars of investments in Iran and Pakistan and both countries are high-level partners that benefit from Chinese political and economic support.
Following the missile-strike exchange, China's Foreign Ministry called for calm and said it would 'play a constructive role in cooling down the situation,' without giving details.
Beijing is now expected to step up its engagement to head off another crisis in the region, in what analysts say is yet another test for China's influence after recently hitting its limit with the war in Gaza, shipping attacks in the Red Sea by Iranian-backed Huthi militants, and the growing instability across the Middle East these events have caused.
SEE ALSO: Is China Benefiting From Instability In The Middle East?
'We're yet to see anything really concrete where China has stepped in to solve an international crisis,' Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at London's Royal United Services Institute, told RFE/RL. '[But] China has a reputational image at stake where it's presenting itself as the alternative to the United States, even though assumptions about how powerful it really is in the Middle East are now being scrutinized.'
What's Going On Between Iran And Pakistan?
The Iranian strikes in Pakistan were part of a series of similar attacks launched by Iran that also hit targets in Iraq and Syria.
In Pakistan, Tehran said it was targeting the Sunni separatist group Jaish al-Adl with drones and missiles in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan Province. Jaish al-Adl operates mostly in Iran's southeastern Sistan-Baluchistan Province but is also suspected to be in neighboring Pakistan. The group claimed responsibility for a December 15 attack on a police station in southeastern Iran that killed 11 officers.
SEE ALSO: Cross-Border Strikes A Major Escalation In Long-Running Iran-Pakistan Dispute
In response, Islamabad said its military conducted air strikes in Sistan-Baluchistan targeting the Baloch Liberation Front and the Baloch Liberation Army, two separatist groups believed to be hiding in Iran.
The exchange of strikes was followed by Pakistan recalling its ambassador from Iran and blocking Tehran's ambassador to Islamabad from returning to his post.
On January 21, the Counterterrorism Department in Pakistan's southwestern Sindh Province announced it had arrested a suspect in a 2019 assassination attempt on a top Pakistani cleric who is a member of the Zainebiyoun Brigade, a militant group allegedly backed by Iran.
But since the strikes on each other's territory, Iran and Pakistan have cooled their rhetoric and signaled that they intend to de-escalate, echoing sentiment through official statements that the neighbors are 'brotherly countries' that should pursue dialogue and cooperation.
People gather near rubble in the aftermath of Pakistan's military strike on an Iranian village in Sistan-Baluchistan Province on January 18.
Basit says this stems largely from the fact that the countries see themselves spread too thin in dealing with a host of pressing foreign and domestic issues.
Tehran has grappled with a series of attacks across the country, including a January 3 twin bombing that killed more than 90 people, and is engaged across the region directly or through groups that it backed such as Yemen's Huthis and Lebanon's Hizballah.
The tit-for-tat attacks, meanwhile, come as Pakistan is embroiled in an economic crisis and prepares to hold high-stakes elections on February 8, the first since former Prime Minister Imran Khan was removed in a vote of no confidence in April 2021, setting off years of escalating political turmoil.
'Between the economy, elections, and always-present tensions with India that could grow, Pakistan simply can't afford another front,' Basit said.
Islamabad and Tehran are now pushing to cool down the situation, though Basit adds that the situation remains tense. 'There is peace and calm now, but the animosity is ongoing,' he said.
How Much Leverage Does China Have?
Following a week of tensions, China has leverage to push for a diplomatic settlement to the dispute, although experts say Beijing may be reluctant to intervene too publicly.
'China looks to be quite measured here in its response and that raises some questions about where China stands in using its influence,' Basit said. 'China knows it can influence the situation, but Beijing also usually shies away from situations like this because they worry that if they try and fail, then the West will look at it differently.'
Beijing raised expectations in March 2023 it would play a larger political role in the Middle East when it brokered a historic deal between regional rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Wang Yi holds up a March 2023 deal in Beijing with Iranian Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani (right) and Saudi State Minister Musaad bin Muhammad al-Aiban (left).
Michael Kugelman, the director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute, says China's willingness to be a mediator shouldn't be underplayed. 'It looks like the Pakistanis and the Iranians had enough in their relationship to ease tensions themselves,' he told RFE/RL. 'But China was willing to do the Iran-Saudi deal, which is a more fraught relationship to get involved in. So, they might be relieved now, but that doesn't mean they won't step up if needed.'
China also holds other cards if it needs to calm the situation between Iran and Pakistan.
As China's 'iron brother,' Islamabad has a close partnership with Beijing, with cooperation ranging from economic investment to defense. Pakistan is the largest buyer of Chinese weapons and is also home to the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship series of infrastructure projects within China's Belt and Road Initiative.
CPEC is part of Beijing's efforts to connect itself to the Arabian Sea and build stronger trade networks with the Middle East.
A centerpiece of the venture is developing the port of Gwadar in Balochistan, which would strengthen shipping lanes to the region, particularly for energy shipments from Iran.
For Tehran, China is a top buyer of sanctioned Iranian oil, and Beijing signed a sprawling 25-year economic and security agreement with Iran in 2021.
Arho Havren says that given both Iran and Pakistan's economic dependence on China, Beijing will do all it can, should tensions rise, but will likely do so behind the scenes. 'China [is unlikely] to take a stronger public stake in the conflict, but will instead use its back-channels,' Arho Havren said.
What Comes Next?
While the situation between Iran and Pakistan is moving towards de-escalation, the recent tensions highlight the often tenuous footing of regional rivalries that China's ambitions to lead the Global South rest upon.
Both Pakistan and Iran are members of the Beijing-led Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which also includes India, Russia, and Central Asia (minus Turkmenistan). The SCO has been an important part of Beijing's bid for leadership across parts of Asia and the Middle East while looking to bring together countries to work together on economic and security issues.
China has invested in growing the bloc and is in discussion to add more countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Belarus, but further conflict between its members could derail those moves and damage the SCO's credibility.
Arho Havren says Beijing will still have to grapple with the lack of trust between Islamabad and Tehran and is facing similar issues elsewhere in the Middle East as it walks a tightrope between simultaneously raising its international influence and limiting any diplomatic exposure that could hurt its reputation.
'Cooperation may be easy, but the relations between the countries in the region are complex, and China's journey [in the Middle East] is still in its beginning,' she said.

News of the latest strikes, which marked the eighth round of military action by the United States against the Houthis since Jan. 12, were reported by U.S. outlets, citing U.S. defense officials.
Neither the Pentagon nor the White House has publicly confirmed the strikes at the time this story is released.
CNN reported earlier that the United States named the strikes ""Operation Poseidon Archer,"" suggesting that they might become ""more organized"" and last for a longer period of time.
Earlier in the day, U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak over phone.
According to a readout of the call by the White House, the two leaders discussed Houthi attacks against merchant and naval vessels transiting the Red Sea.
""They reiterated their commitment to freedom of navigation, international commerce, and defending mariners from illegal and unjustifiable attacks,"" the readout said."

The political, security and humanitarian crises in Haiti continue to worsen and are eroding the foundations of the state and society, said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations.
Efforts must be made to continue to advance the political process, he told the Security Council.
The international community and regional countries have repeatedly called for ending the political stalemate. The Caribbean Community and the UN Integrated Office in Haiti have worked tirelessly to that end. However, without a legitimate, effective, and accountable government, it is difficult for any external effort to fundamentally reverse the impasse, he said.
""We hope that the Haitian authorities and the various parties and factions will put the interests of the Haitian people first and take the voices of the international community seriously, adopt a genuine, responsible, and long-term approach, maintain momentum, and create favorable conditions for the advancement of the political process, with a view to reaching consensus on transitional arrangements at an early date and moving toward the goal of free, fair, transparent, and credible elections,"" said Zhang.
He stressed the need to contain the rampant gang activities.
The atrocities committed by the gangs are horrendous. The security situation in the capital and elsewhere is deteriorating. China supports the international community in taking multiple measures to help the Haitian National Police. China hopes that the Security Council's sanctions regime will play its due role so as to generate real deterrence to the gangs. China urges the United States to effectively strengthen the control of firearms and ammunition and to enhance information sharing and operational coordination with countries in the region, so as to cut off the source of weapons and ammunition for Haitian gangs. China hopes that the UN-authorized multinational police force will be deployed as soon as possible, he said.
Zhang called on the international community to step up efforts to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Haiti.
The economic downturn, the cholera epidemic, food insecurity, unsustainable living conditions, the concerning situation for refugees and migrants, and the disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups such as women and children make the Haitian people see no future or hope. China supports the United Nations and regional partners in increasing humanitarian and development support for Haiti, he said.
The key to solving the issue of Haiti ultimately lies in the hands of the Haitian people. China is ready to work with the international community to support the Haitian people in finding a comprehensive solution that is Haitian-led and Haitian-owned, so that hope can be restored among Haitians and the international community about the future of Haiti, said Zhang."

At least 25 people have been killed and 20 others injured after a market on the outskirts of the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk was shelled, local authorities said.
Denis Pushilin, head of the Russian authorities in Donetsk, alleged that the blast occurred after shelling by the Ukrainian military in the suburb of Tekstilshchik.
Pushilin said that the area had been hit by 155mm calibre and 152mm calibre artillery and that the shells had been fired from the direction of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west.
""These terrorist attacks by the Kyiv regime clearly demonstrate its lack of political will towards achieving peace and the settlement of this conflict by diplomatic means,"" Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
However, there was no immediate comment from Ukraine, as reported by Al Jazeera.
Notably, Moscow-backed groups have controlled the south-eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, known collectively as the Donbas, for almost 10 years, according to Al Jazeera.
But Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised them in 2022, after the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. This received sharp condemnation by many countries at the UN General Assembly who called the ""annexation"" as ""illegal"".
Separately on Sunday, Russia's Ministry of Defence said the country's forces had taken control of the village of Krokhmalne in Ukraine's north-eastern Kharkiv region.
Volodymyr Fityo, spokesperson for Ukrainian Ground Forces Command, told reporters that Kyiv's forces had withdrawn from the area.
Fityo said that Krokhmalne had a population of roughly 45 people before the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Meanwhile, as Russia's war in Ukraine nears its two-year mark, both Moscow and Kyiv's forces have continued to fight from largely static positions along the roughly 1,500km (930-mile) front line throughout the winter, Al Jazeera reported.
Recent Russian attacks have also tried to find gaps in Ukraine's defences by using large numbers of various types of missiles in an apparent effort to saturate air defence systems. (ANI)"

The clearing and settlement of the Chinese yuan (CNY) will be incorporated in the RTGS system from Feb. 4, the official from the central bank requiring anonymity said, citing a document of the bank issued Thursday.
The decision came after a rapidly increased Bangladesh-China trade, fueled by Belt and Road Initiative investments from China, which is the biggest trading partner of Bangladesh now.
Apart from this, the official said yuan proved itself remarkably stable and resilient amid adverse and uncertain economic conditions, like the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the global financial crisis in 2008.
""With China's growing centrality in international trade, commerce and investment, we've decided to include the Chinese yuan in the country's RTGS system,"" said the official.
Bangladesh in April last year announced to settle its pending payments to Russia in Chinese yuan instead of U.S. dollar.
The central bank of Bangladesh in September 2022 paved the way for banks in the country to maintain correspondent accounts in yuan to facilitate cross-border trade based on the Chinese currency."

The supplementary chargesheet named Mohammed Azarudeen alias Azar and Mohammed Idris both residents of Coimbatore, in the terror attack case. They have been charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Explosive Substances Act.
With this, 13 accused have so far been chargesheeted in the case. NIA had earlier chargesheeted a total of 11 persons on April 20 and June 2 last year.
The case relates to an explosion in front of the ancient Arulmigu Kottai Sangameshwarar Thirukovil Temple at Eswaran Kovil Street in Ukkadam, Coimbatore. The blast got triggered on October 23, 2022 through a Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED), driven by one Jamesha Mubeen who was inspired by hardcore ISIS ideology to commit this horrendous act of terror.
The NIA, which had taken up investigations of the case on October 27, 2022, had found that that Jamesha Mubeen, along with Mohammed Azarudeen, Umar Faaruq, Sheikh Hidayathullah and Sanofer Ali, had conspired to carry out a series of suicidal terror attacks in Coimbatore city following a conspiracy hatched in the forested area of Sathyamangalam region in Erode district of Tamil Nadu.
The attack was intended to wreak vengeance on the Kafirs (non-believers), as stated in one of the self-made confessional videos made by the accused a few days before the attack.
Azarudeen, who acted as a pedagogue to the module involved in the attack, was earlier arrested for indoctrination of his followers in ISIS ideology and in connection with NTJ module of Sri Lanka, which was responsible for the 2019 Easter Blast attacks, said the NIA in a statement.
""Investigations had further revealed that Azarudeen had motivated three other accused who met him in Viyyur HSP while he was in prison. This led to the subsequent Sathyamangalam conspiracy meeting, resulting in the planning and preparation of the instant terror attack. Accused Umar Faaruq was elected as the Amir to lead the execution,"" said the anti-terror agency.
""Mohammed Idris, who was part of the module of Azarudeen and was radicalized in ISIS and by 'bayans' of accused Zahran Hashim, was tasked with purchasing a used vehicle for the blast and to assist the main accused in the attack.""The larger aim of the conspiracy was to create terror in the minds of a section of society by targeting its various branches such as general administration, police and judiciary, it added.

HRW highlighted numerous concerns in its report, mostly concerning the lack of press freedom, repression against the opposition and arbitrary detention, including on politically motivated grounds.
""President Macky Sall's promise to hold free and fair elections is at odds with the reality that the authorities have been filling prisons for the last three years with hundreds of political opponents,"" the report said.
""The authorities should effectively investigate all security force violence, release people arbitrarily detained, and guarantee the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly.""
The report comes just a few days after Senegal's Constitutional Council published a final list of 20 candidates for the presidential election, which excluded jailed opposition leader Ousmane Sonko and Karim Wade, the son of former president Abdoulaye Wade.
Sonko and Wade excluded from Senegal's list of 20 presidential candidatesThree years of increased repression
""The crackdown has been ongoing since 2021,"" Ilaria Allegrozzi, senior Sahel researcher at Human Rights Watch, told RFI.
Court cases involved prominent opposition leader Ousmane Sonko and there has been a spate of arrests of political opposition figures and dissidents in recent months, she adds.
According to civil society groups and opposition parties, up to 1,000 opposition members and activists have been arrested across the country since March 2021.
""The authorities should ensure that all Senegalese are able to freely express their views and exercise their vote fairly and peacefully,"" the report states.
Sall said the 25 February elections would be organised ""in peace and stability and respect for republican and democratic principles"".
He announced in July that he would not seek a third term, choosing his Prime Minister, Amadou Ba, as his successor.
Senegal's Macky Sall rules out run for third term as president
""Even though President Sall is not running again, authorities have continued with the crackdown, and the crisis only seems to be accelerating as the election nears,"" HRW wrote.
Allegrozzi recognises that the fact that Sall is not running, and that 20 candidates are in the race is reassuring. But for opponents and journalists, the crackdown is real.
""Democracy in Senegal hasn't been destroyed, but it's been challenged,"" she insists.
""We're calling for the release of all the political activists and candidates that have been arrested, including Sonko,"" Allegrozzi told RFI.
""The authorities should not use justice cases to disqualify a candidate or another,"" she says.
Excessive force and impunity
HRW also accused the security forces of resorting to ""excessive force"", including use of live ammunition and improper use of tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters across the country in March 2021 and June 2023.
It said at least 37 people had been killed during violent clashes since March 2021 with no accountability.
HRW compiled its report after interviewing 34 people, including opposition party members and members of civil society groups, journalists, lawyers and university professors, between November 2023 and January 2024.
It also reviewed reports by national and international media, including photographs of a protester's injuries in June 2023 and a video showing gendarmes torturing a protester the same month.
""Young people died, and their families are yet to see any justice done,"" according to Alioune Tine, a prominent Senegalese human rights activist and founder of the research organisation AfrikaJom, who contributed to HRW's research.
Government's denial
HRW demands that the Senegalese government guarantee fundamental freedoms and end arbitrary detentions and prosecutions.
The group added it had sent its findings to the justice ministry and requested a response, but had not received one.
As HRW released its report, Senegalese Justice Minister Aissata Tall Sall was in Geneva, insisting that ""all political freedoms and freedoms of expression are recognised"" in her country.
""It is a source of concern that the government denies the crackdown and the impunity,"" Allegrozzi concludes, ""people died in these acts of crackdown and there's no justice.""

The Western military alliance has said some 90,000 troops will take part in the months-long Steadfast Defender 24 exercise designed to test its defenses in the face of Russia's war on Ukraine.
'The alliance will demonstrate its ability to reinforce the Euro-Atlantic area via trans-Atlantic movement of forces from North America,' said General Christopher Cavoli, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe.
'Steadfast Defender 2024 will be a clear demonstration of our unity, strength and determination to protect each other, our values and the rules-based international order.'
The exercise is designed to simulate the 31-nation alliance's response to an attack from a rival like Russia.
It will be composed of a series of smaller individual drills and will span from North America to NATO's eastern flank, close to the Russian border.
Some 50 naval vessels, 80 aircraft and over 1,100 combat vehicles will take part.
The exercise - the biggest since the 1988 Reforger drill during the Cold War - comes as NATO has overhauled its defenses since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
The alliance has dispatched thousands of troops to its eastern flank and drawn up its most extensive plans since the collapse of the Soviet Union to protect itself from a Russian attack."

Exports of Russian coal to countries in Southeast Asia surged last year after supplies to the EU stopped amid Western sanctions on Moscow, Vedomosti business daily reported on Monday, citing data from energy analytics firm Kpler.
South East Asia-bound deliveries of Russian coal, excluding China, jumped by 47% in 2023 and reached 13.1 million tons, the outlet said.
Countries that ramped up Russian coal imports included Sri Lanka, which boosted purchases by 4.5 times to 1.6 million tons. Vietnam nearly doubled imports to 3.9 million tons, Malaysia, by 18% to 3.8 million tons, and Indonesia, by 1.7 times to 3.4 million tons. Deliveries to Myanmar increased by 10%, reaching 41,000 tons last year, while Bangladesh bought 48,000 tons of coal from Russia, data shows.
Meanwhile, Beijing, currently Moscow's largest Asian trade partner, has imported 40% of all Russian coal exports since 2022, followed by India (20%) and South Korea (13%), data shows.
According to Chinese customs data, coal imports in December hit a record high of 47.3 million tons following the third-highest volume seen in November, sending total imports in 2023 to an all-time high.
According to Kpler's preliminary estimates, exports of Russian coal to China totaled 104 million tons last year, representing a nearly 43% increase year-on-year as the two countries deepen energy cooperation.
The boost in Russian coal exports to Asian markets comes as Moscow has diverted its trade flow following the EU's import ban on the country's coal imposed in December 2022.

The courts will not ""blindly convict"" anyone and will respect fundamental rights in national security cases, Cheung said at the official ceremony, adding that the justice system will also not bow to pressure.
'Threats of sanction or reprisal against judges for simply discharging their judicial duties are, therefore, repugnant to the rule of law and fundamentally objectionable,"" said Cheung.
The chief justice's comments come as U.N. experts have added their voices to those calling on Hong Kong to drop all charges against pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai.
Lai is one month into his trial on charges of sedition and collusion with foreign forces, under Hong Kong's national security law. The 76-year-old publisher denies the charges, but if convicted could face life in prison.
In a statement released Monday, four United Nations experts called for Hong Kong to drop the case against Lai.
The British national, who founded the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, has been in custody since his arrest in 2020. His news outlet later shuttered after the arrests of senior executives and freezing of assets.
Prosecutors in the case have described Lai as a ""radical"" whom they say was at the center of conspiracies to collude with foreign forces and publish seditious material in Apple Daily.
FILE - Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai pauses during an interview in Hong Kong on July 1, 2020.
The prosecutors alleged that Lai used 'the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy' to request that foreign countries, including the U.S., impose sanctions and other hostile activities against Hong Kong and China.
Cited as evidence was a meeting between Lai and then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington in July 2019.
The meeting included a discussion of an extradition bill that would have allowed people in Hong Kong to be sent to China to face trial. After mass protests, the proposed extradition bill was withdrawn.
Prosecutors also cited 161 articles in Apple Daily as evidence of sedition and said Lai instructed Apple Daily to introduce English content to bolster support for Western governments sanctioning China and Hong Kong.
Lai denies all charges.
Hong Kong Prosecutors Allege Pro-Democracy Publisher Jimmy Lai Encouraged Protests
The case against Lai appears ""directly related to his criticism of the Chinese government and his support for democracy in Hong Kong,"" said the U.N. experts, who are part of the U.N. Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.
The experts include Irene Khan, the special rapporteur on freedom of expression; Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, special rapporteur on the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly; Alice Jill Edwards, special rapporteur on torture; and Margaret Satterthwaite, special rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers.
The council reiterated its concerns about Hong Kong's national security law, which they said is not in line with international obligations.
Lai's trial is the second under the national security law after a case involving 47 pro-democracy activists who are awaiting a verdict, the U.N. said.
""We reiterate that national security legislation with criminal sanctions should never be misused against those exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association and of peaceful assembly, nor to deprive such persons of their personal liberty through arrest and detention,"" the U.N. experts said.
Hong Kong has pushed back against criticism that the law is affecting press freedom; Hong Kong's former chief executive Carrie Lam previously said the Apple Daily case was about 'a suspicious act of endangering national security,' not media freedom.
Lai's case is seen by media freedom advocates as a test of Hong Kong's commitment to a free press.
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, has identified China as a leading jailer of journalists, with 44 behind bars, and said Beijing's influence is being seen in Hong Kong.
""What we've seen in recent years is that Hong Kong has followed Beijing's very harsh national security law, to crack down on those seen as pro-democracy, including journalists speaking truth to power,"" said CPJ chief executive Jodie Ginsberg.
""Lai's case is an incredibly powerful and important test of Hong Kong's commitment to a free press,"" Ginsberg said. ""It's really, really important that we see the international community speak out in support of Jimmy Lai, in support of a free press.""
U.S. and British officials have condemned the case against Lai. At least 15 witnesses are expected to be called at the trial, which is scheduled to last between eight and 10 weeks.

He has also taken credit publicly for preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state 'over the years.'
In a statement issued Sunday, the Israeli prime minister ruled out any possibility of a ceasefire, and says he told U.S. President Biden the war would not end until all the objectives were achieved, including the elimination of Hamas.
He described in his statement the return of the hostages as 'one of the goals of the war,' and takes credit for the return of 110 of the hostages despite the fact that he opposed publicly the diplomatic efforts that secured their release, efforts undertaken mainly by Qatar, Egypt, and the U.S.
The war which Mr Netanyahu describes as 'a necessary condition,' for achieving the return of the hostages has so far, in four months, failed to achieve a single rescue. Instead, a number of hostages have been killed as a result of the military offensive.
Coinciding with Mr Netanyahu's statement on Sunday, Hamas issued a 16-page report in Arabic and English, saying the 7 October attacks were ""a necessary step,"" but admitting ""some faults happened... due to the rapid collapse of the Israeli security and military system, and the chaos caused along the border areas with Gaza"".
""Many Israelis were killed by the Israeli army and police due to their confusion,"" the report alleged.
Mr Netanyahu's failure to instigate an inquiry into the events of 7 October, on the basis this will not happen until after the war is ended, has prompted speculation the Israeli PM is extending the military offensive, possibly into 2025, to delay the inquiry and keep him in place as prime minister.
Mr Netanyahu indicated Israel will continue assassinating 'terrorist' leaders in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria.
In his statement on Sunday he acknowledged his positions and actions have been taken ""in the face of great international and domestic pressure.""
""We are continuing the war on all fronts and in all sectors. We are not giving immunity to any terrorist: Not in Gaza, not in Lebanon, not in Syria and not anywhere. Whoever tries to harm us, we will harm him,"" he said.
""Regarding our hostages, we have returned home, as of today, 110 of our hostages and we are obligated to returning all of them. This is one of the goals of the war and the military pressure is a necessary condition to achieving it.""
""I am working on this around the clock. But let it be clear: I utterly reject the Hamas monsters' capitulation terms,"" the Israeli PM said.
""Hamas is demanding, in exchange for the release of our hostages, the end of the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of the murders and rapists of the Nukhba and leaving Hamas in place.""
""Were we to agree to this, our soldiers would have fallen in vain. Were we to agree to this, we would not be able to ensure the security of our citizens. We would be unable to safely restore the evacuees to their homes and the next October 7 would be only a question of time. I am not prepared to accept such a mortal blow to the security of Israel; therefore, we will not agree to this,"" Mr Netanyahu said.
""The conditions being proposed by Hamas underscore a simple point, there is no substitute for victory. Only total victory will ensure the elimination of Hamas and the return of all our hostages.""
""I told President Biden this in our conversation over the weekend. I greatly appreciate the U.S. support for Israel and I also expressed this to the president. However, I will strongly insist on our vital interests. I emphasized to President Biden our determination to achieve all of the goals of the war, and to ensure that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel.""
""Therefore, I insist that after we achieve total victory, after we eliminate Hamas, there will no entity in Gaza that finances terrorism, educates for terrorism or sends terrorists,"" said the Israeli prime minister.
""Gaza must be demilitarized, under Israel's full security control.""
""I will not compromise on full Israeli security control of all territory west of the Jordan River,"" Mr Netanyahu said.
""As prime minister of Israel, I have strongly upheld this position in the face of great international and domestic pressure.""
""My insistence is what has prevented over the years the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have constituted an existential danger to Israel. As long as I am Prime Minister, I will continue to strongly insist on this. If someone has a different position, they should show leadership and candidly state their position to the citizens of Israel,"" Mr Netanyahu said.
On Monday the prime minister told members of the families of the remaining hostages in captivity that there was no deal on the table to secure their release, and denied emphatically that Hamas had made an offer.
""Contrary to what is being said, there is no genuine proposal by Hamas, this is not true. I will say this as clearly as I can because there are so many incorrect items that are certainly causing you pain,"" he told the hostages families representatives at a meeting with them in Jerusalem on Monday.""On the other hand, there is our initiative, which I will not detail,"" he said."

FRISCO, Texas - The Dallas Cowboys will have 16 players from the 2023 roster hit free agency this offseason, and one of the headliners is certainly veteran defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins whose first deal with the Cowboys has expired after just under two seasons.
Hankins released a video on his YouTube account on Saturday night that ran 21 minutes in length and discussed his impending free agency and his desire to be back in Dallas next season.
""I think I brought some good value to this team,"" Hankins said. ""I think being on a team, in an organization like this, I still got something left in the tank. To have the year that I had in year 11, I'm still playing at a high level and still getting the job done.""
""I still feel like I got unfinished business, still have goals I want to achieve. The goal of mine is to get to the Super Bowl, and I would love for it to be here [in Dallas].""
Hankins said that he contemplated retirement last offseason, citing wanting to be around his family more with his daughter turning two-years-old, but the opportunity in Dallas gave him another charge on the back half of his career.
""Going into that offseason last year, to be honest I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue playing,"" he said. ""My daughter was turning two at the time and I was feeling like I really needed to be around my family. It was challenging...Bringing in the young guys like Mazi, being with Law, Micah, DA, Osa...to me, it really lit another fire under me.""
The retirement thoughts still linger this offseason, but Hankins sounds confident in his ability to play at a high level and in his passion towards getting to his ultimate goal.
""Is this the last time you're gonna see Big Hank? I don't think so,"" Hankins said. ""After speaking with the Cowboys, speaking with Mike [McCarthy] and the staff, obviously I'm still playing at a high level and I want to continue to play.""
While his desire to be back in Dallas is there, free agency will have to work both ways for Hankins to be back on the Cowboys' roster in 2024.
""We'll see how everything goes, the talks and everything,"" he said. ""The journey doesn't stop here."""

Haley dismissed Trump's influence over her decisions, stating, ""I don't do what he tells me to do. I've never done what he tells me to do,"" in an interview with CNN.
When pressed about her expectations for the first-in-the-nation primary, Haley refrained from specifying benchmarks for success, indicating she would assess a strong finish based on incoming numbers. ""What I've always had in my mind is I want to be stronger than Iowa. And then South Carolina, I want to be stronger. Let's see what that looks like,"" she remarked.
Challenged on the viability of her campaign if trailing Trump by double digits in New Hampshire, Haley emphasised her journey to this point, stating, ""I didn't get here because of luck. I guess I got here because I outworked and outsmarted all the rest of those fellas."" Undeterred, she declared her intention to compete against Donald Trump, refusing to entertain discussions about her campaign's potential downfall.
""I'm running against Donald Trump. And I'm not going to talk about an obituary. Just because y'all think we have to talk about it. I'm going to talk about running the tape and saving this country,"" Haley said vowing to ""go and fight until the very last poll closes. And then we're headed to my sweet state of South Carolina,"" according to CNN.
Both Trump and Haley are contending for the GOP nomination, aiming to challenge President Joe Biden in the November 2024 election. Trump, having launched his bid in November 2022, seeks to secure a nonconsecutive term, persistently denying the 2020 election outcome and facing multiple criminal charges. His potential second term promises a substantial overhaul of federal government factions and aggressive actions against political opponents.
Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, entered the presidential race in February 2023, advocating for a fresh wave of Republican leadership. Her campaign emphasizes economic responsibility, national security, and border strengthening. If successful in the primary, Haley could become the first woman and the first Asian American nominated by the GOP for president. Her political journey includes serving in the South Carolina House and making history as the state's first female governor.
Haley, born Nimarata Nikki Randhawa to Indian immigrants, brings a unique perspective to the race. Her husband's deployment to Afghanistan in 2013 marked her as the first governor in US history to have a spouse on a military mission. Undoubtedly, Haley's bid for the presidency adds diversity to the Republican field and underscores her commitment to a new era of leadership within the party, CNN reported. (ANI)"

The Lobby for Victims of Sexual and Gender Violence, a caucus of Israeli Knesset members, opened Tuesday's meeting with a trigger warning, accompanied by continuous weeping among the participants.
""I myself don't want to believe what happened,"" says Haim Otmazgin, a ZAKA volunteer who was in charge of a team rescuing bodies from the scene of the massacre at the Nova music festival after the October 7 massacre. ""When I hear someone questioning what happened there, I stand up and say, my eyes have seen it, and it's all on my cell phone.""His harsh descriptions of the massacre scene are paramount to the goal of the caucus -- to spread the awareness of Hamas' brutal sexual violence that day.
""My eyes saw the women stripped of their clothes; you can see someone struggled with them to undress them the way we found them in,"" he recalled.
Otmazgin described the way his team was working like a machine, in order to rescue as many bodies as fast as possible while the army was still fighting terrorists close to them and there was a threat of bodies being kidnapped to Gaza.
""Another woman is cuffed, another one is stripped, another one has her body parts cut off. It's like a series of pictures being repeated again and again. We saw the same things at Reim and later in kibbutzim.""""In a house at a kibbutz we found a mother with the handcuffs on her hands and next to her daughter in a safe room. In another room next to it, we found a young girl, on the bed, clothes rolled up, shot in the head and her throat split. Her pants rolled down, without underwear on her. Instances like these are too many, and no, we don't have the video footage to see what was done to these women, but the pictures we saw tell a story that cannot be interpreted in any other way.""One released hostage, Chen Goldstein Almog expressed her concern for the girls in captivity.
""There are girls there who have not had their periods for some time, perhaps because of the conditions of captivity, and this is the thought that crosses our minds, that maybe at least this way they will not get pregnant while they might be raped in captivity.""Aviva Siegal, who was released during a temporary ceasefire in November, told lawmakers it wasn't easy for her to attend, but felt an obligation.
""The terrorists bring doll clothes, inappropriate attire for those girls, as they turn them into dolls on a string, they do whatever they want whenever they want to them. And it must be said that the boys also go through what the girls go through. They don't get pregnant but they are also a puppet on a string. There was not a minute that we were not abused in every possible way and those girls are still there in survival,"" she recalled as people in the audience sobbed.
""My heart is still there, and it explodes,"" she added. "" I can't understand that the world is silent.""As time passed and international women's organizations ignored or denied the sexual abuse Israeli women suffered, the government formed an independent civil commission tasked with documenting the sexual violence, raising awareness and pursuing justice for the victims.
Dr. Cochav Elkayam-Levy, a law professor chairing the commission told lawmakers, ""In light of the international silence, we understand that we have a historic task. The failure of the international organizations, their silence that causes our demonization in the world, if international community is not willing to speak up, we will do it for ourselves.""The true scope of the rapes may never be known, because most of the victims and witnesses were killed. At least 1,200 people were massacred in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on Oct. 7. Several female hostages released during a November ceasefire have already described being sexually abused while in captivity.
""As we sit here, there is a girl who is stuck in a tunnel and being raped, and it should be said!"" said Shir Siegel, sitting besides her mother, Aviva. ""Enough talking about it politely while drinking water. Everyone in the world should think about it. You should go to bed like it is your daughter and ask yourself if you did enough for them today.""MK Tsega Melaku, described some of the propaganda that prompted her to become a co-founder of the caucus.
""There is a clip of a man protesting in Britain, claiming there could be no sexual violence on behalf of Hamas terrorists as they are Muslims and Islam prohibits sex outside of marriage. That's how much propaganda we see,"" the Likud lawmaker said. ""But is there anyone to counter that? Even some world leaders' wives who deny it happened. Where are the women organizations?""

""I want to thank the Central Government on behalf of poor and socially backward people. Karpoori Thakur was a socialist. I have known him closely. Lalu Prasad Yadav ignored him after coming to power. PM Narendra Modi's government honoured him and that is the difference between the BJP and the Congress government,"" Singh said.
Congress leader Tariq Anwar also welcomed the Centre's decision to award former Bihar CM Karpoori Thakur with the Bharat Ratna.
""I welcome this move. He deserves the Bharat Ratna and there is no doubt about it. He did a lot for social justice. But the BJP is giving him the Bharat Ratna. One thing is clear from this, that the BJP has done this keeping the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in mind. The contribution given by Karpoori Thakur for social justice cannot be forgotten,"" Anwar said.
Meanwhile, Union Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey said that it's a matter of joy that former Bihar CM Karpoori Thakur is being awarded the Bharat Ratna.
""It is a matter of joy that he has been honoured with Bharat Ratna today. I thank the Prime Minister for this historic decision. I express my gratitude to PM Modi,"" Choubey said.
This prestigious award is a tribute to Karpoori Thakur's lifelong dedication to the upliftment of the underprivileged sections of society and his relentless fight for Social Justice. Known affectionately as 'Jan Nayak' (People's Leader), Thakur's simplicity in his personal conduct was highly inspiring and his contribution to Indian politics has been monumental.
Former Bihar CM was born on January 24, 1924, and passed away on February 17, 1988.
Thakur was born in 1924 in one of the most backward sections of society - the Nai Samaj. He was a remarkable leader whose political journey was marked by his unwavering commitment to the marginalised sections of society.
He served as the Chief Minister of Bihar and was a key figure in the struggle against social discrimination and inequality. His commitment to affirmative action gave representation and opportunities to the poor, oppressed, exploited and deprived sections of the country.
Embarking on his political career with the Praja Socialist Party, he later joined forces with the Janata Party during his initial tenure as the chief minister of Bihar from 1977 to 1979. Over time, he established connections with the Janata Dal, marking a significant shift in his political affiliation. (ANI)"

""Yesterday, tears were expressing their stories. With the reestablishment of Lord Ram's reign, the curse of 500 years came to an end,"" the VHP chief said speaking to ANI on Tuesday.
Kumar said that with the establishment of the temple in Ayodhya, the society will move forward with no ill intent and will bring glory to the nation.
""Hindus will now be able to practice their faith with confidence with no malice, no sense of defeat. The living society will move forward, nourish, bring glory to the nation and will set the direction for the world. This was in my mind and the speeches of the Prime Minister and that of the Sarsanghchalak,"" he said.
The VHP chief stressed that the Ram Janmabhoomi temple was not built to antagonise or oppress any community but it is a temple of ""love"" and a resolution of the historic mistake of its demolition.
""It is true that in eight to ten places in the country, some disturbances were created. We will deal with them. Everyone should understand that the temple was not built against anyone, by oppressing anyone. This is a mandir of love. This is a resolution of the historic mistake of its demolition. Everyone should work together. No one should think it to be their defeat,"" Kumar said.
In reaction to Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee raising questions on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the party never mentioning Sita, the VHP chief said, ""When we say Jai Shree Ram, Shree stands for Laxmi and women power. What will be built and completed on the first floor of the temple will have Sita and Ram, it will be Lord Ram's court. Without Sita, India is incomplete and Ram is incomplete as well.""Hitting back at Rahul Gandhi's allegation that he was not allowed to enter Batadrava Than, the birthplace of revered Vaishnavite saint Srimanta Sankardeva, in Assam, the VHP chief said that the former is welcome at the Ram Janmabhoomi Temple in Ayodhya.
""Rahul Gandhi can come. The temple is open. He should understand that the rule of the king is over. We had invited Sonia Gandhi but she declined after so much arrogance. But Rahul Gandhi is welcome. Yesterday it was only for the invited, today it is open to all,"" Kumar said.

Data from PowerOutage.us showed that Oregon was the hardest-hit state with around 110,000 power outages.
In its latest update on January 19 morning, Portland General said, ""After significant progress restoring all but about 5,000 customers from this week's weather, a third round of weather, including high gusty winds and freezing rain, caused about 50,000 new outages.""
""We understand the disruption these outages can cause and will not stop until the lights are on for everyone,"" added the utility, which has some 1,700 workers involved in its restoration work.
A day after homes and businesses consumed a record amount of natural gas for heating and power, a cold snap caused peak power demand in parts of the U.S on January 17.
A day earlier, the severe winter storm also closed a U.S. Gulf Coast refinery in Texas, halving North Dakota's oil production.
State officials said North Dakota's oil output could take about a month to recover after production was cut by more than half this week by extreme cold."

""I renew my appeal for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire. This will ensure sufficient aid gets to where it is needed, facilitate the release of hostages, and help lower tensions around the Middle East,"" he told a high-level open debate of the Security Council on the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.
No effective humanitarian aid operation can function under the conditions that have been forced on Palestinians in Gaza and on the humanitarian workers, he said.
Humanitarian delivery is not an exercise of counting trucks. It is about ensuring the right volume and quality of assistance reaches people in need. To be able to do its work, the United Nations needs to see a set of operational requirements met, said Guterres.
""We need safety. We are operating in a war zone. The current humanitarian notification mechanisms do not offer any real confidence for operations and planning humanitarian responses. A number of serious incidents have shown how these essential mechanisms need to be substantially improved. Safety also entails reliable and cleared roads inside Gaza, and unimpeded crossings at checkpoints.
""We need to be equipped to do our job. This includes telecommunications equipment, so convoys can communicate with each other; armored vehicles and protective gear, given the ongoing hostilities and the widespread contamination with explosive remnants of war; far greater logistical capacity; spare parts for infrastructure such as desalination plants, and other critical humanitarian items,"" he said.
There is also a need for more crossing points into Gaza to reduce congestion and avoid chokepoints. Humanitarian access to northern Gaza is lacking. In the first two weeks of January, out of 29 planned humanitarian missions to deliver life-saving supplies north of Wadi Gaza, only seven were accomplished, fully or partially. The majority of missions were denied access by Israel. After over 100 days of operations in the north, insecurity and fighting has continued, he said.
""I call for rapid, safe, unhindered, expanded and sustained humanitarian access throughout Gaza. I repeat my call for an end to all violations of international humanitarian law,"" said Guterres. ""I renew my appeal for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire.""
The humanitarian situation in Gaza is appalling, he said.
With winter bearing down, 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza face inhumane, squalid conditions, struggling to simply make it through another day without proper shelter, heating, sanitary facilities, food, and drinking water. Everyone in Gaza is hungry. A quarter of Gaza's population -- more than half a million people -- are grappling with catastrophic levels of food insecurity, he said.
Meanwhile, nearly 1.5 million people are now crammed inside Rafah governorate. Disease is spreading as the health system collapses. Only 16 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are even partly functional. That means the people of Gaza not only risk being killed or injured by relentless bombardments, they also run a growing chance of contracting infectious diseases, he said."

Jaishankar commenced by highlighting India's ""proud"" G20 presidency, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the initiative for the African Union's historic permanent membership. Nigeria's active participation in both the G20 and the Voice of the Global South Summit underscored the collaborative approach in shaping the global conversation.
""I'm coming from a G20 presidency that India was proud to chair, where we saw the expansion and the first ever membership admission of the African Union on a permanent basis. And I'm very proud to say that this was an initiative that was personally led by my Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. We were very honored during the G20 to have the participation of Nigeria, not just in the G20, but also in the Voice of the Global South Summit, that both preceded and succeeded the main Summit,"" he said.
The minister emphasised the ongoing global conversation focused on the ""advancement of the Global South, because without the advancement of the Global South, we are not going to see planetary progress.""Acknowledging the distractions in this discourse, Jaishankar commended India's G20 presidency for successfully refocusing attention on critical issues such as sustainable development goals, clean and green growth, woman-led development, health, energy, food security, and digital public infrastructure.
""So one of the big achievements of our G20 presidency was, that after some experience with a very polarised, divided world, which was very much, I would say, focused on one particular region, we were able to bring back the attention of the G20.
Jaishankar delved into the core principles defining the Global South, highlighting non-intervention, non-interference, non-judgmental, and non-alliance as key facets.
""So, I would say Global South, most of all, is a mindset. But it is a mindset which has some core principles. These are principles from our habits, from our political culture, from the way we have practiced international relations over the last 60, 70, 80 years. For example, non-intervention, for example, non-interference or being non-judgmental or non-alliance,"" said the EAM.
However, he underscored a positive definition, asserting that the Global South is fundamentally about solidarity, ""having a heart, and being willing to share.""The minister provided a vivid example of India's commitment to the Global South through its vaccine diplomacy.
""I give them an example from our own experience. I tell people, look, in my country we were still vaccinating people when we started supplying vaccines to 100 countries in the world. And I compare it to Global North where there were countries sitting on vaccines eight times the number of their population and they wouldn't give it to a small island next to them. That is the difference to me between Global South and Global North,"" headded.
While still vaccinating its citizens, India supplied vaccines to 100 countries globally, contrasting with countries in the Global North stockpiling vaccines disproportionately. This, according to Jaishankar, exemplifies the difference between the Global South and Global North.
Addressing the question of how the Global South deals with the Global North and the global agenda, Jaishankar stressed empathy, understanding, respect, and recognition of each country's sovereignty, culture, and tradition. He emphasized that solutions should be organically owned by the society implementing them, highlighting the importance of considering culture, traditions, and heritage in addition to politics, economics, and technology.
Jaishankar shared practical examples of India's contributions, including digital public infrastructure, space exploration, and the execution of 600 projects in 78 countries as part of Global South solidarity. He positioned India as a first responder in times of crisis, illustrating the tangible application of Global South commitments.
The External Affairs Minister expressed his hope for continued collaboration and the reinforcement of capabilities within the Global South. He emphasized the need to share experiences, complement capabilities, and work towards common objectives through existing bodies, mechanisms like the G20, the Voice of the Global South Summit, South-South cooperation, and bilateral relationships.
""So to me, Global South is actually a movement whose spirit, whose sentiment, whose commitment needs to be harnessed for the betterment of the world in very, very practical ways,"" the EAM said.
Jaishankar concluded by expressing gratitude for the opportunity to share these sentiments and affirmed his commitment to taking practical initiatives forward during his visit to Abuja for discussions with his counterpart through the Joint Commission. (ANI)"

Authorities say some suspects also have been arrested and that operatives are responding to a surge in violence in the region known for clashes between farmers and herders.
Nigerian defense authorities in Abuja told journalists during a media briefing Thursday that the killing of a local man by herders and an attempted cattle rustling triggered the latest violence.
The attackers invaded villages along the borders of the Mangu and Barkin Ladi districts, shooting indiscriminately and setting fire to houses and property.
Women and children were among the casualties.
Nigerian defense spokesperson Major General Edward Buba told reporters that security forces had been deployed and that some suspects had been arrested.
'As we speak, arrests are still being made,' he said. 'It is a developing situation, it's an ongoing situation; more troops have been deployed to the location. The situation is not above us to handle. We're handling it.'
The latest violence came weeks after deadly attacks in the same area on Christmas Eve. About 140 people were killed, and many others were injured. Residents blamed the attack on Fulani militias.
Communal clashes between farmers and herders are common in Nigeria's Plateau state, resulting in thousands of casualties in the last few years.
Nigerian authorities have struggled to address the insecurity problems spreading across the country.
On Tuesday, Plateau state authorities imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew as tensions over the attacks heightened.
But Mangu resident Joseph Bot said it was all talk with little action.
'They'll always tell you they're on top of the matter, but even among the security, we have bad eggs that connive with those attackers,' he told VOA by phone Friday. 'Sometimes killings will be taking place ... the security will not go and when you confront them, they'll tell you they're waiting for [an] order.'
Nigerian defense authorities denied the allegations, stating that the military responds according to its rules of engagement.
This week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during his four-nation Africa trip, discussed the security situation with Nigerian President Bola Tinubu in Abuja.
Blinken voiced the United States' support for Nigeria. 'The United States is determined to be and remain a strong security partner for Nigeria,' he said. 'I want to extend the condolences of the American people to all Nigerians who were affected by the horrific attacks over the Christmas weekend, and all killed in recent attacks.'"

Coco Gauff advanced to her first career Australian Open semifinal on Tuesday, but it was far from a smooth journey.
The fourth-seeded Florida native defeated Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk 7-6 (6), 6-7 (3), 6-2 in a twist-filled quarterfinal that lasted 3 hours, 8 minutes.
""I'm really proud of the fight I showed today,"" Gauff said in her postmatch interview on court. ""Marta's a tough opponent. Every time we play it's a tough match. Really fought and left it all on the court today.""
Gauff, a 19-year-old who is the reigning U.S. Open champion, will oppose either second-seeded Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus or ninth-seeded Barbora Krejcikova of the Czech Republic on Thursday.
Kostyuk raced out to a 5-1 lead in the first set, but Gauff broke serve three consecutive times and saved a set point at 5-3. Gauff then failed to serve out the set at 6-5, forcing a tiebreaker.
Gauff jumped ahead 4-2 in the opening-set tiebreaker and had two service points coming when she led 5-3, but she lost both points. Kostyuk then failed on another set point on her serve, and Gauff eventually prevailed 8-6.
The second set featured six service breaks before Kostyuk won the first four points of the tiebreaker and sailed to a 7-3 win.
The third set was one-sided, with Gauff cruising to a 5-0 lead before closing out the match.
""I was just trying to get one more game in the first set and at least make it competitive,"" Gauff said. ""And then one game turned to another and I was able to win that set. And then in the second, I put myself in an opportunity (to win). I think I got a little bit passive.
""When I came out in the third, I was just trying to play aggressive and hit through the court because I knew if I left something standing, she was going to take advantage.""

""This is the second station in the country. INS Kattabomman Radar Station at Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu, was the first of its kind. It has been serving the Navy since 1990.

Campa funds Rs 133.54 crores for handing over forest land and the Navy has paid Rs 18.56 crores for the work undertaken for land conservation measures, the CMO's statement informed.
As per the statement, Damagudem Forest Protection has filed a petition in court seeking to cancel this project. The court has issued orders to take all precautions following the conditions decided by the government.
Along with the Navy station, the township would have schools, hospitals, banks and markets. This naval unit consists of around 600 naval personnel and other civilians.
""About 2500 to 3000 people live in this township. Adequate measures would be taken to preserve biodiversity and ecological balance in the region through extensive planting.

Those reports were quickly deleted when Moscow revealed the flight had carried prisoners instead. Kiev officials have since said that they were never notified about the prisoner flight, that planes over Belgorod are a legitimate military target, and that Russia is ultimately responsible for anything that happens to the POWs anyway.
A French military source has told FranceInfo that the missiles that brought down the Il-76 were US-made Patriots, operated by the Ukrainian army. One of the Russian investigators on site also said the ""pattern of destruction and damage to the fuselage"" pointed to the Patriot, according to Russian reporter Alexander Kots.
The Kremlin has condemned the incident as a ""monstrous act"" by the Ukrainian government against its own citizens. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has called for an ""international investigation"" to ""determine the hard facts"" about what happened, insisting that the plane went down in Russian territory.

AGH4ANBF9S_9VXGL55AHM2TT21,Xinhua Commentary: Lies about China reveal Western hypocrisy,"Xinhua 25th January 2024, 17:49 GMT+11","Xinhua 25th January 2024, 17:49 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105801/xinhua-commentary-lies-about-china-reveal-western-hypocrisy,"BEIJING, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The fact that some Western politicians and media outlets are practicing double standards on human rights and using it as a weapon in an information war against China is becoming the consensus of more and more people.
Examples of Western hypocrisy include allegations concerning boarding schools in southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region and so-called ""forced labor"" in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China.
Boarding schools are common in China and the world. In sparsely-populated Xizang, it ensures fair education. These schools, which are totally voluntary, provide traditional culture courses, such as Tibetan language and literature and folk dance and traditional food. Students are free to wear traditional dresses at school.
It must be pointed out that boarding schools in Xizang are totally different from those aimed at ""forced assimilation"" in history in some Western powers. For example, in the 19th and 20 centuries, Indian children in the United States were forced to attend boarding schools and banned from speaking their native language, wearing their traditional clothes, or carrying out traditional activities, thus erasing their language, culture and identity in an act of cultural genocide.
The attacks and smear campaigns against boarding schools in Xizang amount to attempts to destroy the children's right to education and depriving the region of its right to development and progress.
Lies are lies. The ""forced labor"" in Xinjiang, which some Western countries have alleged, is the same kind of lies with the same despicable purposes. An audit commissioned by Volkswagen has been a slap in the face for rumormongers. No indication of forced labor was found at the company's plant in Xinjiang, the German carmaker said in December last year.
The myth of ""forced labor"" in Xinjiang has also been debunked by other firms. Responding to reports alleging forced labor at a shoe factory in south China it sources products from, Skechers said in a March 2021 statement that none of its multiple audits of the factory -- in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 -- had revealed any indication of the use of forced labor or other concerning labor conditions.
As a matter of fact, the United States is fraught with serious forced labor. The University of Denver's website disclosed that there are currently at least 500,000 people living under modern slavery and forced labor in the United States. Forced labor is a particularly prominent and prevalent issue across 23 industries, such as domestic service, agriculture, planting, tourism sales, catering, medical care and beauty.
Both Xizang and Xinjiang have achieved unprecedented progress in human rights. The two autonomous regions are the epitome of China's human rights development and progress. With a people-centered human rights philosophy, China has found a path toward better human rights that follows the trend of the times and fits its national realities, and made historic progress in its human rights cause, with people from all ethnic groups enjoying a greater sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security.
China's human rights progress has gained prevailing recognition internationally. Western lies will never cover up the truth and the facts, only to expose more about the true hypocrisy and double standards of the rumormongers."
AJ9BPUUP9W_FC7D6O30GIXS6K0,No business as usual for Boeing US air regulator,"RT.com 25th January 2024, 19:13 GMT+11","RT.com 25th January 2024, 19:13 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105865/no-business-as-usual-for-boeing-us-air-regulator,"The FAA has imposed a series of restrictions on the company's 737 MAX jets after a mid-air blowout incident this month
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has temporarily prohibited Boeing from expanding the production of its 737 MAX planes citing passenger safety concerns. The decision comes on the heels of a blowout incident in January, in which one of the company's jets lost a chunk of its fuselage mid-air.
On January 5, Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 traveling from Portland, Oregon to California, was forced to turn back and make an emergency landing shortly after takeoff after a door panel was ripped off, exposing passengers to the outside environment. While the incident caused no serious injuries, the FAA grounded 171 Boeing 737-9 MAX airplanes to conduct rigorous inspections. Boeing itself has admitted to a ""mistake.""
In a statement on Wednesday, the US aviation regulator stressed that the Portland incident ""must never happen again."" The FAA added that it had informed Boeing that ""it will not grant any production expansion of the MAX, including the 737-9 MAX,"" adding that all grounded jets would undergo a thorough oversight process, promising that the plane would be able to return to service once it is completed.
""Let me be clear: This won't be back to business as usual for Boeing. We will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 MAX until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved,"" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said.
The agency noted that the enhanced maintenance process would require inspection of specific bolts, correcting any abnormal conditions and detailed visual checks of several specific aircraft parts. Earlier, the FAA also announced that it would have ""more boots on the ground"" to scrutinize Boeing's production and manufacturing operations.
Loose bolts in particular have been a safety concern for both Boeing, the FAA, and operating air companies, with at least two airlines finding this defect following the Portland incident.
The new wave of groundings and safety checks on Boeing aircraft comes after the US air manufacturer already found itself in hot water several years ago when two of its planes crashed in Ethiopia (2019) and Indonesia (2018), killing a total of 346 people. The two tragedies resulted in a 20-month-long grounding of 737 MAX aircraft.

Despite repeated discussions on the matter, Washington has encountered limited cooperation from Beijing, as reported by the Financial Times, citing US officials.
Sources reveal that White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Deputy National Security Adviser John Finner addressed the issue in a meeting last month with Liu Jianchao, the head of the Chinese Communist Party's International Relations Department. Additionally, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has raised concerns with his Chinese counterpart. However, there are no clear indications that China has exerted substantial pressure on Iran to restrain the Houthi rebels beyond their recent lukewarm stance.
In a recent development, the US conducted strikes in Yemen, targeting and neutralizing two anti-ship missiles that were being prepared for launch towards the Red Sea. This move underscores the escalating tensions in the region. Notably, British and US forces joined efforts on Monday, launching attacks on Houthi positions in Yemen, including an underground warehouse.

AKEIB2OFH9_A4TUC0BXCI1VOWZ,Former Taiwan Ally Nauru Renews Diplomatic Ties With China,"Voice of America 24th January 2024, 19:05 GMT+11","Voice of America 24th January 2024, 19:05 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274104717/former-taiwan-ally-nauru-re-diplomatic-ties-with-china,"BEIJING - China and Nauru re-established diplomatic ties on Wednesday, after the tiny Pacific island nation unexpectedly severed relations with its now former ally Taiwan in a move the United States described as 'unfortunate.'
The Pacific has become a source of intense competition for influence between Washington and Beijing.
During a ceremony in Beijing, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Nauru counterpart, Lionel Aingimea, formally signed a document to restore bilateral relations, with ties at the ambassadorial level resuming with immediate effect.
According to the document, Nauru recognizes that there is 'only one China in the world' governed by the People's Republic of China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.
Taiwan rejects China's sovereignty claim and accused it of trying to pressure Taiwan immediately after its recent presidential election with news of Nauru's switch.
Severing ties with Taiwan was 'an independent political decision made by the Nauruan government,' Wang told reporters after the signing ceremony.
'We are willing to share with Nauru the development opportunities brought by Chinese-style modernization,' he said.
Aingimea said his country looked forward to their new relationship.
'It'll be built on strength, built on development strategy. It will have a synergy of policies. It will have good collaboration and shared governmental principles that both our countries enjoy,' he said. 'The prospect is bright.'
Taiwan's foreign ministry said it was 'deeply grieved.'
'The Nauru government is ignorant to the lure of financial aid and is a retainer to China's manipulation, ignoring the development assistance and friendship provided by our country for many years,' it said in a statement.
Democratically governed Taiwan lost Nauru, one of its few remaining diplomatic allies, to China on Jan. 15, just two days after a new Taiwanese president was elected.
China claims Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties, a position Taiwan strongly disputes.
Nauru's government said it was seeking full resumption of diplomatic relations with China 'in the best interests' of the country and its people.
Nauru had recognized China before, between 2002 and 2005.
The United States, which only recognizes China but is Taiwan's most important international backer, said last week that Nauru's decision was 'unfortunate' and 'disappointing,' warning Beijing's promises often go unfulfilled.
Taiwan's 12 remaining diplomatic allies include the Vatican, Guatemala and Paraguay, plus Palau, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.
Wang said having diplomatic ties with Taiwan ran counter to those nation's own interests, infringes on China's sovereignty and 'should be corrected sooner or later.'
'We urge these countries to recognize the trend of the times, seize historical opportunities, fulfil their obligations under international law, stand with the international community, and correctly align with history,' he said.
Tuvalu expects to review its diplomatic ties with Taiwan after an election on Friday, Finance Minister Seve Paeniu told Reuters, adding voters wanted more financial support from the international community for climate change and development.
Taiwan's presidential office said president-elect Lai Ching-te, currently vice president, spoke on Wednesday with Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine and invited her to attend his inauguration on May 20.

He further said that he is the son of Sharad Pawar and under his leadership his party will emerge stronger.
The statement came after the NCP leader faced a day-long questioning by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case.
""We always fight against this government and agencies. I have submitted all necessary documents to ED and I have been summoned on 1st Feb by them. I will go again,"" said Pawar while speaking to the reporters.
""Political leaders like Sanjay Shirsat and others questioning on me and I want to tell them that they are speaking lies and making false allegations on me and my party, if you do not stop then we will take action against you legally and constitutionally"", he added.
""Some leaders think that I'm a child in this politics but I want to tell them our father is Sharad Pawar and under his leadership, we will fight against you in elections and I'm not a child we will come back stronger,"" he said while slamming Eknath Shinde government.
Meanwhile, the NCP workers held celebrations outside the ED office in Mumbai after the conclusion of the questioning by the central agency.
The Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank scam case relates to the alleged fraudulent disbursal of loans amounting to 25,000 crores. The case triggered the filing of a PIL Petition in the Bombay High Court by four persons.
The PIL shed light on the alleged modus operandi of the fraud. In the petition, it was alleged that some sugar mills defaulted on the loans, which were given without due diligence. Those sugar mills were attached by the MSC banks and auctioned to various office bearers of the bank and politicians.
Acting on the PIL the Bombay High Court ordered the registration of a case. The Economic Offences Wing(EOW), which is under the Maharashtra government, investigated the case. When EOW filed a closure report in 2020 in the Bombay Session Court, ED filed an intervention petition against the closure report and started an investigation. (ANI)"

In the southwestern part of the Mandir complex, at Kuber Tila, the ancient Mandir of Bhagwan Shiv has been restored, along with the installation of a statue of Jatayu.
The foundation of the Mandir has been constructed with a 14-meter- thick layer of roller-compacted concrete (RCC), giving it the appearance of artificial rock. No iron is used anywhere in the Mandir. For protection against ground moisture, a 21-foot-high plinth has been constructed using granite.
The Mandir complex has a sewage treatment plant, water treatment plant, water supply for fire safety and an independent power station. The Mandir has been constructed employing the country's traditional and indigenous technology. (ANI)"

ANIVT3G1BT_O9ZQB17ZQPB83OD,"Black Book's '2024 State of Global Healthcare Technology' Research Reveals Adoption Trends, Market Dynamics and Top-Rated Vendors Across 58 Countries","ACCESSWIRE 25th January 2024, 07:17 GMT+11","ACCESSWIRE 25th January 2024, 07:17 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105465/black-books-2024-state-of-global-healthcare-technology-research-reveals-adoption-trends-market-dynamics-and-top-rated-vendors-across-58-countries,"In total, 109 electronic medical record and healthcare information technology vendors were graded on meeting buyer expectations, achieving ROI, solving country-specific connectivity issues and accomplishing patient data improvement goals.
LONDON, ENGLAND / ACCESSWIRE / January 24, 2024 / Black Book Research, globally recognized for transparent surveying of stakeholders and users of electronic health records and health IT support systems, released the 2024 'State of the Global Healthcare Information Technology Industry' report that assesses the international expansion efforts and user-scored performances of domestic core-EHR vendors and foreign tech corporations.
Black Book's European office coordinated this year's sweeping survey process of 12 regions of the world, resulting in nearly 19,000 qualified responses from current HIT customers. Responses provide insight into 18 comprehensive key performance indicators evidencing progress and outcomes on technology effectiveness and usability in their respective countries of operations.
The extensive 655-page Black Bookâ¢ research report is available at no charge to constituents by registering at the research firm's website. Extensive data points from user-revealed findings are detailed within the country profiles as well as trends and projections.
Polling was conducted from Q4 2022 through Q1 2024 and includes in particular the qualitative satisfaction data from system users in Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, France, Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Estonia, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, South Africa, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Australia, New Zealand, India, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Japan, South Korea, England, Ireland, Scotland, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Turkey.
Two key points regarding the status of global electronic health records:
Interoperability Challenges: Ninety-six percent of the aggregated respondents insist that connectivity and integrations remain a significant challenge globally. Even within countries with established EHR systems, ensuring seamless data exchange between different systems and healthcare organizations was an ongoing and largely untackled issue. Standardization efforts, such as the development of health data exchange standards, were under way to address interoperability challenges. International organizations and standards bodies worked to create frameworks for the exchange of health information.
Resource Constraints: Most developing countries face resource constraints in implementing comprehensive EHR systems. Factors such as infrastructure, funding, and technical expertise played a role in the slower adoption of electronic health records in over half the countries surveyed. Also noted, the cost of implementing and maintaining American EHR systems is a barrier in many regions, especially in countries with limited healthcare budgets, and this affects the affordability and sustainability of using these systems on a broader scale.
'We've seen American EHR vendors forming partnerships with healthcare providers, governments, and organizations in foreign countries to implement EHR solutions but these collaborations that involved adapting EHR systems to meet the specific needs and regulatory requirements of the local healthcare environment have met with very limited success,' said Doug Brown, Managing Partner of Black Book.
'EHR systems often need to be culturally and linguistically sensitive to be effective and American EHR systems are rarely tailored to local languages, cultural practices or healthcare norms, which can impact their usability and acceptance,' said Brown. 'Healthcare workflows and practices can vary significantly from one country to another and American EHR systems require extensive customization to accommodate the specific needs and workflows of healthcare providers in other parts of the world.'
According to Black Book's sweeping research, the most advanced EHR systems outside the U.S. include:
Denmark: Denmark has been praised for its comprehensive and integrated electronic health record system. The system allows healthcare professionals to access patient information seamlessly, and Denmark has a long history of investing in healthcare IT.
Estonia: Estonia is known for its advanced e-Government initiatives, including a national electronic health record system. Patients in Estonia have access to their digital health records, and the country has made significant strides in digitalizing healthcare services.
Singapore: Singapore has implemented a national electronic health record system called 'National Electronic Health Record' (NEHR). It aims to provide a comprehensive view of patient health information across different healthcare providers for improved care coordination.
Sweden: Sweden has made substantial investments in digital health infrastructure, and it has a well-integrated electronic health record system. Patients in Sweden can access their health information, and there is a focus on interoperability among healthcare providers.
The Netherlands: The Netherlands has been working on enhancing its electronic health record systems to improve interoperability. Efforts have been made to standardize health data, and patients have access to their electronic health records.
Survey respondents rating their usability and outcomes from vendors include both public health and private providers, clinical staff, administrators, IT directors, financial managers, operations personnel, and physicians who ranked vendors as the leaders in client satisfaction on 18 EHR-focused qualitative key performance indicators in their respective regions. In total, 18,793 validated healthcare IT users from around the world participated in the scoring of their customer experience and satisfaction with EHR vendors in the extensive 14-month polling period.

Lashing out at the Congress State unit President, O'Brien alleged that Chowdhury is speaking the language of the BJP.
Speaking with ANI on the Congress-TMC rift over seat sharing in the State, the Rajya Sabha leader said, ""INDIA alliance has two main detractors: BJP and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. He speaks the language of the BJP. The three reasons for the alliance not working in Bengal: 1. Adhir Chowdhury 2. Adhir Chowdhury 3. Adhir Chowdhury.""This comes after Mamata Banerje's announcement that her Trinamool Congress (TMC) party will fight Lok Sabha polls alone in the state.
""I had no discussions with the Congress party. I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we alone will defeat the BJP,"" the TMC supremo had said.
Mamata's decision to contest the elections alone dealt a blow to the prospects of the India National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, which was formed seven months ago to take on the BJP-led NDA in the Lok Sabha elections.
Meanwhile, the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra entered Bengal today.
Congress MP Rahul Gandhi adopted a conciliatory tone saying that the INDIA bloc will fight 'Anyay' together. The comments come a day after senior opposition leader Mamata Banerjee vowed that she would fight the Lok Sabha polls alone in her state.
The Wayanad MP said that he is happy to have come to West Bengal.
""I am happy to have come to West Bengal. We have come here to listen to you and stand with you...BJP-RSS are spreading hatred, violence and injustice. So, INDIA formation is going to fight 'Anyay' together"" he said.
The conciliatory tone was also sounded by Jairam Ramesh who reiterated that Mamata was an important part of the INDIA bloc.
""I have said that TMC is an important pillar of INDIA bloc which comprises 28 parties. Mamata Banerjee is an experienced and energetic leader of the country, a tall leader. We respect her...Everyone knows that she holds a special place and identity in the politics of our country. I am very confident that she too wants to defeat the BJP, we also want the same. We will fight together. We will make INDIA Alliance successful. That is our duty"", Jairam Ramesh said.
The Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra crisscrossed West Bengal from Assam this morning. Assam Congress chief Angika Dutta handed over the 'tricolour' to the party's Bengal unit president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. (ANI)"

Britain was ""dead right"" to leave the European Union and Germany could end up following suit, Alternative for Germany (AfD) leader Alice Weidel has said. Weidel's right-wing faction has become the country's second-most popular party, according to polls, despite left-wing protests and rumors of an impending ban.
In an interview with the Financial Times published on Monday, Weidel said that an AfD-led government would seek to reform the EU to wrest back national sovereignty from the ""unelected executive"" that is the European Commission. Should this fail, she said that she would ""let the people decide"" whether or not the country would stay in the union, ""just as Britain did.""
The UK's 2016 Brexit referendum is ""a model for Germany, that one can make a sovereign decision like that,"" she added.
The AfD has long called for the ""orderly dissolution of the EU,"" but dropped this language from its latest policy document, published last summer. The new paper describes the EU as a ""failed project,"" and calls for the bloc to be reformed as a ""federation of European nations,"" with all EU laws that supersede national law to be scrapped.
The AfD opposes the EU's migrant resettlement quotas, its environmental policies, its military reliance on the US, and its embargo on Russian fossil fuel imports.
Since its inception in 2013, the AfD has become best known for its hardline stance on immigration. If elected, Weidel told the Financial Times that her party would ""introduce effective border controls ... and immediately deport foreign criminals.""
This position saw the AfD surge in support after former Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the country to more than one million non-European migrants in 2015. The party is now polling at around 23%, eight points ahead of Chancellor Olaf Scholz' Social Democrats (SPD) and second only to Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).
Scholz' party has reacted with panic. After it emerged last week that some AfD lawmakers met with Austrian right-wing activist Martin Sellner last year to discuss the potential ""remigration"" of criminal and ""non-assimilated"" immigrants from Germany, more than two dozen Social Democrat parliamentarians urged the government to ban the AfD over its allegedly ""extremist"" positions.
A parliament-funded watchdog group called for such a ban last year, while a court in Cologne ruled in 2022 that Germany's domestic intelligence agency could legally place the party under surveillance.
Over the weekend, left-wing groups marshaled hundreds of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets of Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg, and other major cities to protest against the party.
These protests will not stop the ""inevitable"" participation of the AfD in government, Weidel told the Financial Times. However, while the party may score some wins in upcoming state elections this year, she said that the refusal of Germany's major parties to work with the AfD will likely prevent it from coming to power in Berlin until the federal election in 2029.
The center-right CDU will be the first party to abandon its boycott, Weidel predicted. Elections in the state of Hesse last year proved ""that we can form a clear right-wing majority. And the CDU can't refuse to accept that in the long term,"" she said.

She will next lock horns with No.75-ranked Anna Kalinskaya, who defeated No.26 seed Jasmine Paolini 6-4, 6-2.
Zheng's better serve and control won a match between two heavy hitters.
The second game began with a backhand winner down the line that broke Dodin; ultimately, Zheng found 19 winners to the Frenchwoman's five, and she limited her unforced error total to 16 against Dodin's 19.
Except for a bad serve halfway through the second set, Zheng managed to maintain control of the majority of her service games despite landing just 44 per cent of her first serves. She only lost three of those points.
On the other hand, even though Dodin, ranked No. 95, had quicker average speeds on her first and second deliveries, she was unable to shield her serve from Zheng's aggressive strategies.
On return, Zheng regularly used a one-two punch that crushed her first blow deep and freed her up to block her subsequent forehand. Merely 50 per cent of Dodin's points came from her first serve, while only 33 per cent came from her second serve.

The Taliban-controlled Ministry of Agriculture has expressed gratitude for this assistance, highlighting its significance in protecting crops and ensuring food security in Afghanistan.
Malathion, known for its efficacy in arid regions and minimal water usage, is considered a crucial tool in locust control. The aid not only addresses the immediate threat in Afghanistan but also serves to prevent the spread of locusts to neighbouring Central Asian countries.
""Ministry of Agriculture, IrrigationLivestock of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is grateful of the Government of the Republic of India and its people for supplying 40,000 liters of chemical material (Malathion) in the agriculture sector, to prevent the locusts menace, that the mentioned assistance arrived today through Chabahar port,"" the Afghanistan Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock said.
The assistance not only helps in preventing locusts in Afghanistan, but also prevents locusts from Central Asian countries, especially Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, and is effective on crops in the region.
The 40,000 litres of malathion pesticide was supplied in two trucks and officially handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock of the Taliban-controlled Afghanistan government.
The ministry statement read, ""Agriculture and livestock are inclusive sectors of humanity, which their benefits and harms are same for everyone, Afghanistan is a war-torn and backward country, and any country that assists with us in the field of disease prevention, research, promotion of mechanization and marketing of agriculture and livestock sectors, is considered as cooperation with humanity.
Locusts are voracious in nature and are known for their vegetation-destroying abilities and their large-scale presence may potentially threaten food security.
The locust menace was at its worst in neighbouring Pakistan in early 2020, when the country declared a national emergency.
At the same time, India too witnessed a large-scale locust incursion in several states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, some parts of Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra. (ANI)"

""There is no confirmation regarding the reports that are floating in the media. The claims being made by the media reports are baseless. I condemn this behaviour. I would appeal the media not to promulgate the matter,"" Ahmad said in a video message.
The unity of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) appeared in jeopardy amid growing speculation that Nitish Kumar, a key figure in the bloc may exit the 28-party opposition bloc formed to take on the BJP-led central government.
Earlier, former Bihar Chief Minister and RJD President Lalu's daughter, Rohini Acharya, took a swipe at RJD's ruling ally, JDU, on X, posting that while the 'socialist party' (JDU) styles itself as progressive, its ideology shifts with the changing wind patterns, a statement that triggered cracks within the ruling alliance.
However, a few hours later, all three posts by Lalu's daughter were deleted.
If Nitish Kumar crosses over to the NDA, this would be the fourth time he would be switching sides.

Matt King, head of the government-funded Australian Centre for Excellence in Antarctic Science (ACEAS), said little is known about how the accelerating ice melt in Antarctica will affect Australia's climate and the long-term viability of some agriculture industries.
In a Sunday story on the Guardian Australia, the local online edition of Britain-based daily newspaper, King said that much of the funding that Australia currently allocates to work on Antarctica is spent on building and maintaining ships and stations rather than research, calling for the federal government to develop a multi-decadal agenda for the continent.
""Perhaps one of the weaknesses is that Antarctica is seen as an environmental problem, but it is an all-of-government problem,"" King said.
""The Australian economy, and the global economy, is set up on Antarctica being as it has been. We're moving to a phase where Antarctica won't be like that any more.""
The ACEAS is a consortium of eight Australian universities that is funded through the federal government's Australian Research Council (ARC) to conduct research into the effects of climate change in the East Antarctic and Southern Ocean.
A study published by ACEAS researchers in March 2023 found that deep ocean currents around Antarctica could slow down by up to 40 percent within the next 30 years, potentially altering weather patterns, starving marine life of vital nutrients and pushing up sea levels."

In an official release on Wednesday, the US Embassy in the UK stated, ""Today's media reports of an American professor's recipe for the ""perfect"" cup of tea has landed our special bond with the United Kingdom in hot water.""""Tea is the elixir of camaraderie, a sacred bond that unites our nations,"" the US embassy clarified, adding that tea is the elixir of camaraderie.
Calling it an 'outrageous' proposal, the US embassy asserted that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain's national drink is not official United States policy.
""We cannot stand idly by as such an outrageous proposal threatens the very foundation of our special relationship. Therefore, we want to ensure the good people of the UK that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain's national drink is not official United States policy. And never will be,"" the official release by the US embassy read.
""Let us unite in our steeped solidarity and show the world that when it comes to tea, we stand as one,"" it added.
""The US Embassy will continue to make tea in the proper way--by microwaving it,"" the embassy noted further in its release.
Significantly, Michelle Francl, a chemistry professor at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, stirred up a hot debate after she came out with her recommendations on how to make the perfect cup of tea in a book called 'Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea', according to Politico.eu.
Some of her suggestions, however, were more palatable, as she recommended picking up a ""short, thick cup since it has less surface area and keeps the tea hotter"", adding ""pre-heat your mug or teapot; and only use a teabag once"".
However, some other recommendations left the tea-loving Britons wide-eyed in disbelief.
""Warming the milk (to lessen the possibility of curdling); adding a squeeze of lemon (to eliminate the ""scum"" that occasionally develops on the surface of the drink); and, most unusually, adding a sprinkle of salt (to make the tea taste less bitter),"" the Politico.eu quoted the scientist as recommending.
The advice on whether to put the milk in first or not, while brewing a hot cuppa, added to the controversy as it is considered to be one of the most polarising topics in Britain. (ANI)"

He further urged member countries to ""honour their commitments in the interest of peace and stability in the international system.""In response to a question about India being a victim of terrorism and cross-border activities, during a presser in the national capital, Francis stated, ""Terrorism is a global phenomenon. It is everywhere. Radicalisation exists in places where you would think it does not exist. And its effect on society is damaging and destabilising. It's not acceptable.""Acknowledging India's struggles with terrorism, Francis said, ""I'm aware that India has been a victim of terrorism.""Stressing the need for countries to cooperate and collectively combat this menace, he referred to the UN's programme of action on anti-terrorism and urged all countries to honour their commitments under the programme.
""The anti-terrorism mechanisms are working,"" assured Francis, underscoring the importance of international cooperation and the exchange of information to minimise the possibility of terrorism.
Recalling the tragic incident at a Mumbai hotel during the 26/11 attacks, where several lives were lost, Francis called on the international community to redouble efforts to eliminate global terrorism.
""I remember well the incident at the hotel in Mumbai in which several people lost their lives. We must, as an international community, redouble our efforts to rid the world of international terrorism,"" Francis said.
""No one can deny that terrorism is disruptive. It undermines everything we try to do in the United Nations,"" stated the UNGA President. He highlighted the Security Council's adoption of resolutions on anti-terrorism, emphasising their binding nature as countries have an obligation to implement these resolutions.
In conclusion, Francis urged all countries worldwide to honour their commitments in the interest of global peace and stability, saying, ""So all countries have an obligation. The UNSC has adopted a number of resolutions on anti-terrorism and those resolutions have the force of law. I would hope that all countries in all parts of the world will honour their commitments in the interest of peace and stability in the international system.""During his India visit, Francis will pay floral tributes at the 26/11 memorial.

Armed gunmen hijacked a bus in the capital on January 19, taking eight hostages, including the nuns from the order of the Sisters of Saint Anne.
The statement from Archbishop Max Leroy Mesidor following the hostage release did not clarify whether a ransom was paid or who was responsible for the kidnapping, but it did say, 'This traumatizing event has, once more, tested our faith, but it remains unbreakable.""
The kidnapping prompted religious leaders to issue a letter criticizing the Haitian government for its lack of response to an increase in gang-related violence. Separately, Pope Francis on Sunday called for the nuns and other hostages to be released.
The United Nations estimates that the violence in the Caribbean nation has led to more than 4,700 killings and nearly 2,500 kidnappings in the past year. A U.N. report in October said the gangs run schools, clinics and foundations in place of an increasingly absent government, even as their criminal rackets help gang leaders amass funds and afford luxury homes with swimming pools in the hemisphere's poorest country.
The U.N. secretary-general's special representative for Haiti Thursday discussed the security situation during a meeting of the Security Council.
Maria Isabel Salvador said the Caribbean nation remains plagued by the ""mounting scale of violence due to an unprecedented surge in kidnappings, rapes and other crimes committed by armed gangs that increasingly affect the livelihoods of people and undermine humanitarian activities."" She urged the council to support efforts to stabilize the country.
Meanwhile, a court hearing was scheduled for Thursday in Kenya to determine the legality of the African nation heading a U.N.-approved mission to Haiti to assist the country's struggling police force in combating gangs. Agence France-Presse reports a decision is expected by Friday.

A majority of European Central Bank (ECB) staff participating in a survey gave a negative assessment of President Christine Lagarde's job so far, Politico reported on Monday, citing a poll carried out among the bank's employees.
Lagarde's overall performance in the first half of her eight-year term was deemed ""poor"" or ""very poor"" by 50.6% of respondents. Meanwhile, only 20.3% of those polled assessed her performance as ""good"" or ""very good.""
Nearly a third of those surveyed believe that the ECB president wades too deeply into politics and uses the institution to boost her personal agenda, adding that this hasn't helped the central bank's reputation.
The mid-mandate survey, which was conducted over December 12-22 of last year, included responses from 1,089 of the ECB's roughly 4,500 staff.
A similar poll carried out about Lagarde's predecessor, Mario Draghi, at the end of his term showed an approval rating of 64%.
""Mario Draghi was there for the ECB while the ECB seems to be there for Christine Lagarde,"" one staff member wrote as a comment for the latest survey.
Furthermore, several respondents suggested that the former French finance minister wanted to use the bank as a springboard back into politics.
However, an ECB spokeswoman called the survey flawed.
""The President and the Board are fully focused on their mandate and have implemented policies to respond to unprecedented events in recent years such as the pandemic and wars,"" she told Politico.

Ukrainian forces used a US-supplied Patriot missile to shoot down a Russian cargo plane carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, French state broadcaster Radio France reported on Wednesday, citing a source in the country's military.
The Il-76 military transport plane was shot down over Russia's Belgorod Region on Wednesday morning. Everyone on board - 65 prisoners, six flight crew, and three Russian soldiers - died; Russia's Defense Ministry claims that the plane was brought down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft missiles.
The prisoners were being transported to the city of Belgorod to be exchanged for Russian servicemen in Ukrainian captivity, the ministry stated, adding that the Ukrainian side had been made aware of the incoming flight.
Radio France's source did not provide any additional information, but the claim backs up an earlier assertion by a senior Russian MP that ""Patriot or Iris-T air defense missiles"" were used to bring the aircraft down.
The defense ministry stated that the missiles were launched from the Liptsy suburb of Kharkov, around 100km from the site of the crash. Both the American Patriot and German Iris-T systems are capable of engaging targets from this range, and the General Staff of Ukraine's armed forces said on Wednesday that it regularly uses such systems to target Russian military flights in the area, without explicitly admitting that it shot down the Il-76.
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has not admitted that his forces were responsible for the downing of the plane. In a statement on Wednesday, he called for an ""international investigation"" to determine ""all the hard facts"" surrounding the incident.
The closest step to an admission of guilt came from Ukraine's military intelligence agency, the GUR. In a statement on Wednesday night, the agency claimed that it ""was not informed about the need to ensure the safety of the airspace"" over the border, and that it did not know how the prisoners would be transported.
The White House has not commented on the alleged use of Patriot missiles in the incident. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Wednesday that the US was ""not in a position to confirm"" any reports on the attack, and was working to ""get more clarity and more information on it.""

They are ""involved in conspiracies by planning criminal and terrorist actions to attack the legitimately constituted system of government,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Stripping them of their military status is in keeping with ""the traditions and moral ethical codes that characterize the FANB ... since the aforementioned subjects are not worthy of belonging to our ranks,"" it said.
Those expelled were involved in a plot to bring about ""the assassination of the top national leader,"" said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
The statement, signed by Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, lists the highest-ranking military personnel expelled, including a major general, two colonels and six lieutenant colonels.
Padrino Lopez announced the initial expulsion of 18 people on Tuesday, a day after the Venezuelan Prosecutor's Office said authorities have uncovered five plans to destabilize the country, including the plot to assassinate Maduro."

However, the overall impact on the multi-billion-dollar cruise industry is not expected to be significant.
Since they began in November, the Houthi attacks have raised concerns about escalating the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas militants, as well as slowed trade between Asia and Europe.
In a statement this week, Royal Caribbean said it had canceled one voyage from Muscat to Dubai and another from Dubai to Mumbai, as well as modified, last week, the itinerary of a cruise between Aqaba and Muscat to disembark guests in a port city near Athens.
""Our global security team continues to closely monitor the situation in the region, and we will make additional changes if required,"" Royal Caribbean said.
On January 17, Swiss-Italian operator MSC Cruises said that due to the Red Sea crisis, it canceled three voyages in April from South Africa and the UAE to Europe.
""The safety of passengers and crew is the number one priority and as there was no viable alternative itinerary, the company has regrettably had to cancel the voyages. The three ships will transfer directly to Europe without any passengers on board and avoid transiting through the Red Sea,"" MSC Cruises said.
However, Todd Elliott, CEO of Florida-based travel agency Cruise Vacation Outlet, said that while thousands of passengers are being affected, the impact on cruise operators is not expected to be significant at an international level.
""This is a small part of their overall fleet and multi-year itineraries so they will be able to overcome this easily,"" Elliott said."

The meeting in Baghdad with Ambassador Alina Romanowski comes amid soaring regional tensions, the fallout from more than three months of war between U.S. ally Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas, supported by Tehran.
Ballistic missiles were launched Saturday at a base hosting U.S. forces in western Iraq, in an attack claimed by 'Islamic Resistance in Iraq,' a loose alliance of Iran-linked militants that oppose U.S. support for Israel in the Gaza conflict.
Since mid-October, shortly after the Israel-Hamas war erupted, there have been dozens of attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria, deployed there to fight jihadis of the Islamic State group.
Maliki, an influential figure in Iraqi politics and one of the top leaders of a pro-Iranian bloc, discussed with Romanowski 'the future of bilateral relations' with the United States and 'the escalation in regional tensions,' a statement from his office said.
He stressed 'the importance of strengthening the ties of friendship and cooperation' between Baghdad and Washington, the statement added.
Maliki also warned against 'the expansion of the war' with 'multiple crises the region faces' in the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, the Red Sea, Syria and Iraq.
He called for 'swift action to reduce tensions and put an end to mutual attacks.'
Romanowski has not commented on the meeting. She regularly meets Iraqi officials and leaders across the political spectrum.
Maliki's faction is part of the Coordination Framework, Iraq's main pro-Iran coalition which has a majority in parliament.
The current Iraqi prime minister, Mohamed Shia al-Sudani, was nominated by the Coordination Framework and relies on the support of Iran-aligned parties.
The Coordination Framework unites veteran politicians and former paramilitaries.
It includes opponents of Saddam Hussein's regime who have taken the helm since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled the former dictator, alongside the Hashed al-Shaabi - a collection of mainly pro-Iranian former paramilitary units now integrated into the Iraqi armed forces.
One of the Hashed's factions, Kataeb Hezbollah, expressed Sunday their support for 'Islamic Resistance in Iraq.'
A spokesperson for the group, Abu Ali al-Askari, said 'the brothers of the resistance keep striking enemy strongholds,' calling in a statement to 'continue the escalation of operations.'
The United States has about 2,500 soldiers in Iraq and nearly 900 in Syria.
Sudani has repeatedly said in recent weeks he would like to see foreign troops leave Iraq."

The campaign aims to reaffirm the nation's collective commitment to the principles enshrined in the Constitution of India and celebrate the shared values that bind our nation.
""Prakaram Diwas was celebrated yesterday.

Paris is copying London and abusing its powers at the UN to protect Kiev, Moscow's deputy envoy to the global body said on Wednesday. He was speaking after the French ambassador refused Russia's request for an urgent session of the Security Council in the wake of the disaster.
An IL-76 carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners scheduled to be exchanged was shot down on Wednesday morning over Russia's Belgorod Region. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who is currently in New York, told reporters that he had requested an emergency UNSC session over the incident.
Lavrov urged the French ambassador - who currently chairs the council - to avoid repeating the British presidency's tactics in April 2022 when it took three days to approve Russia's request to discuss the alleged massacre in Bucha.
""We have a shocking development in the Security Council today,"" Ambassador Dmitry Polyansky said on X (formerly Twitter) several hours later, noting that France ""declined our request for an urgent Council meeting.""
The French ambassador said he would schedule the meeting for 5pm on Thursday, ""in a clear attempt to shield their Kiev regime clients"" and buy President Vladimir Zelensky's government ""more time to come to its senses and invent some at least distantly plausible explanation of what it has committed,"" the Russian diplomat added.
Not only is France abusing its council presidency, Polyansky argued, it is also ""cosplaying the lowest standards of their British neighbors"" from April 2022. The once glorious French diplomacy has ""shrunk to miserable swindling and pathetic manipulations!"" he added.
Ukrainian media outlets initially claimed the plane had been transporting missiles, but scrubbed their stories when it emerged that their own POWs were among the 74 dead. The Ukrainian General Staff eventually released a statement saying that Russia had been flying in missiles used to attack Kharkov so the flights were a legitimate target.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Ukraine had been notified in advance that its prisoners, due to be exchanged later in the day, would be on board the flights headed for Belgorod. The second plane, with 80 POWs on board, turned around and landed safely after the first IL-76 was shot down.
Moscow has accused Kiev of ""terrorism"" and callous disregard for the lives of its own citizens. Commenting on a screenshot showing both the initial and revised Ukrainian reporting on the incident, Polyansky said that Kiev was once again ""inflating the bubble of lies"" to avoid blame, no matter how ridiculous its narrative may sound.

Ukraine's military intelligence agency, the GUR, knew there were prisoners of war aboard a Russian military transport plane shot down by Kiev's forces, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday. The full story of the shootdown will ""become clear in a couple of days,"" he added.
The IL-76 military transport plane was shot down over Russia's Belgorod Region on Wednesday morning. Everyone on board - 65 prisoners, six crew members, and three Russian soldiers - died. The Russian Defense Ministry claims that the plane was brought down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft missiles while en route to a prisoner exchange in the city of Belgorod, located near the Russia-Ukraine border.
The GUR was aware that Ukrainian prisoners were traveling on the plane, Putin said on Friday, according to RIA Novosti.
""The entire current Kiev regime is based on crimes committed daily, including against its own citizens,"" Putin said. ""The [GUR] knew that we were transporting 65 military personnel there ... and knowing this, they struck the plane.""
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, the GUR did not deny that the jet was taken out by Ukrainian forces. Instead, the agency said that it was unsure whether the prisoners would be taken to the exchange point by air or other means, and that it ""was not informed about the need to ensure the safety of the airspace"" over the border region.
Putin said that material seized from the crash site suggests that an American or French air-defense missile was used to bring down the plane, and that exactly how the aircraft was shot down ""will become clear in a couple of days.""
""The results of the investigation into the IL-76 case will be published so that the Ukrainian people know"" what happened to their soldiers, he stated.
Russian State Duma Defense Committee chief Andrey Kartapolov has also alleged that Western weapons were used to target the flight, claiming that American Patriot or German Iris-T missiles were fired at the jet. A French military source told Radio France on Wednesday that a Patriot missile had struck the fatal blow.
""All currently available data points to a deliberate, premeditated crime,"" Russia's deputy representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, told a meeting of the UN Security Council on Thursday.

- World news -
At least 26,083 people have been killed and 64,487 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7.
At least 183 people have been killed and 377 wounded throughout the enclave in the past 24 hours, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.
Gaza's Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra said that Israeli forces are ""deliberately paralyzing"" the capabilities of the Nasser Medical Complex and Al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis.
Al-Qudra said the two hospitals are subjected to Israeli targeting and besiegement, in addition to Israeli forces preventing ambulance movement.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said the spread of hepatitis A is increasing at a rapid pace in informal camps for internally displaced people (IDPs) in Gaza due to overcrowding and a lack of clean water and sanitation.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has warned that the Israeli army tanks are targeting the eastern gate of al-Amal Hospital, causing fragments to scatter inside the building.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan has told his British counterpart, David Cameron, during a meeting in Istanbul that an immediate ceasefire is needed in Gaza.
Fidan has reportedly told Cameron that a full and immediate ceasefire and a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are needed in Gaza for lasting peace.
The representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OCHA) in the occupied Palestinian territories said that the situation in the Gaza Strip is ""nothing less than catastrophic"", Al Jazeera reported.
""Displaced people in Rafah have no place to stay and are actually living on the streets,"" said Ajith Songhai. ""The people we interviewed fear that severe violence will spread to Rafah, which will have catastrophic effects on more than 1.3 million people there.""
Songhai added that there is no access to northern Gaza, which remains under Israeli shelling and bombardment, even to provide basic humanitarian assistance.
""Failure to deliver aid violates Israel's obligations under international law,"" Songhai said, adding that continuous attacks continue on medical and UN facilities in Khan Younis, as well as on schools and residential areas."

Simon Manley, the UK's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, has delivered a set of four strong recommendations to China targeting various aspects of human rights violations, urging China to address key concerns.
Manley called to ""cease the persecution, arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and Tibetans.""He also urged China to ""allow genuine freedom of religion or belief and cultural expression, without fear of surveillance, torture, forced labour or sexual violence and implement OHCHR recommendations on Xinjiang.""The UK strongly called for the repeal of China's national security law in Hong Kong, aligning with UN suggestions. Manley specifically called for the cessation of prosecutions, including that of media tycoon Jimmy Lai.
""Repeal the law on safeguarding national security in Hong Kong as recommended by the UN and cease prosecutions including of Jimmy Lai,"" he said, giving recommendations to China.
The UK representative also called for a ""guarantee of an impartial judiciary,"" demanding an end to ""harassment of lawyers, the use of the death penalty, and residential surveillance in designated locations.""UK's Manley urged China to lift ""restrictions on civil society and independent media,"" while also calling for an immediate halt to forced repatriations and the cessation of targeting human rights defenders.
""Cease the restrictions of civil society and independent media and forced repatriations and stop targetting human rights defenders,"" he also said.
A recent report from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has shed light on a troubling pattern in China, where nearly half of the journalists imprisoned in 2023 were identified as Uyghurs.
As many as 44 journalists are in jail and about half of them are Uyghurs. This shows Beijing's poor press freedom record and its human rights abuses against the majority-Muslim ethnic group, report added.
The data, offering a global overview of journalists incarcerated for their work as of December 1, paints a concerning picture of press freedom in China, especially concerning its treatment of the majority-Muslim ethnic group.
Notably, China's human rights record is facing international scrutiny during the fourth Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Working Group session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, taking place from January 22 to February 2.
The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a peer-review process under the auspices of the UN Human Rights Council, where UN Member States assess each other's human rights records, their fulfilment of human rights obligations and commitments, and provide recommendations to the State under review.
This is China's fourth appearance before this mechanism. The last one was in November 2018. At the time, countries called out the existence of mass detention camps for Uyghurs a few months after they were revealed by a UN committee.
During China's 3rd UPR in November 2018, China received 346 recommendations from 150 countries, and accepted 284 of them, with many questionably noted as 'accepted and already implemented.'Despite a seemingly high acceptance rate, China broadly rejected recommendations on the rights of Uyghurs and Tibetans, cooperation with the UN and unrestricted UN access to all regions of the country, enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention, the death penalty and the ratification of international treaties.
Since 2018, mounting human rights abuses have been largely documented by a range of UN human rights bodies.
In the absence of a UN Human Rights Council debate on the human rights situation in China, the UPR is a rare moment of global scrutiny of the country's human rights crisis. (ANI)"

Director Siddharth Anand, who is currently awaiting the release of his film 'Fighter' and is busy promoting it, spoke to the media about how he convinced Hrithik and Deepika to show their chiselled physique. Refering to earlier reports stating Shah Rukh Khan was reluctant to flaunt his abs in the song 'Jhoome Jo Pathaan', he was asked if it was same with Deepika and Hrithik.
He responded saying, ""It's not easy to convince them, first of all. Honestly, it stems from the confidence that they have. They have confidence in themselves, in their appearance, about how good-looking they are. Just look at them. Inko kuch bolne ki zaroorat nhi padti hai""""As I have said in other interviews, just see how gorgeous they are looking. Honestly, I don't need to do anything. Just roll it at 48 frames and make them walk and put good music."" Replying to this, Hrithik said, ""You can trust Sid,"" to which Siddharth replied that they had worked very hard. ""Jokes apart, it's not easy to look like this. I think they put in a lot of effort, and the one word that I use is sacrifice. There's a lot of sacrifice that goes into looking like this, and they are relentless. They know what to wear to the beach or while dancing. Imagine us dancing shirtless. Every part is going to be jumping. They are like rock; they are sculpted, and it's a lot of effort that goes into it,"" he added.
Deepika said the most important factor is having faith that the filmmaker will convey the material with the appropriate sensibility and style. Actors then try to have the conversation or maybe just let it happen, she said, adding, ""You have faith in the director. She went on, ""You know it will be presented properly; you trust his sense of style.""With the discourse majorly around fitness, Siddharth added that Anil Kapoor also put a lot of effort into looking fit. ""Does he look like 42? Can anyone say he's 42?"" To this, Anil responded, ""Why are you underlining age?""He added that he received a humorous response when he questioned Anil Kapoor about his plans for the New Year and his destination. ""He (Anil Kapoor) says if he stays in the city, he will have to go attend parties, eat and drink, so he goes into a health farm or a health resort and does yoga there,"" Siddharth Anand shared.
'Fighter' is directed by Siddharth Anand and also stars Anil Kapoor, Karan Singh Grover and Akshay Oberoi.
It is produced by Viacom18 Studios in collaboration with Marflix Pictures. It is billed as a tribute to the valour, sacrifice and patriotism of the Indian armed forces.
Speaking about the film, Siddharth said earlier, ""Mamta (Siddharth's wife) and I started our film company MARFLIX with FIGHTER. A film that is ambitious in more ways than one. It's more than just a film for us. And we have given it all to this one. 2024 starts with the same feeling again of nervousness and anxiety. Here's hoping that you guys give the same love to FIGHTER that you showered on PATHAAN. Happy new year guys! See at the movies!! On 25th January."" (ANI)"

The attack took place on Wednesday. An Israeli tank fired two missiles at the shelter. Aside from those killed another 75 were wounded, according to a UN relief official.
""Another horrific day in Gaza. The number of those killed is likely higher. Khan Younis vocational training centre is one of the largest UNRWA facilities sheltering nearly 30,000 displaced people,"" UNRWA leader Philippe Lazzarini posted on social media.
""The compound is a clearly marked UN facility and its coordinates were shared with Israeli Authorities as we do for all our facilities. Once again a blatant disregard of basic rules of war,"" he said,
In response to questions about the shelling, the Israeli army said in a statement the wider area was being used as a base for Hamas militants.
""Dismantling Hamas' military framework in western Khan Younis is the heart of the logic behind the operation,"" the statement said.
Khan Younis is currently being swamped by Israeli forces backed up by tanks with refugee centers and hospitals being a main target.
Only 16 out of 36 hospitals ""are even partly functional,"" UN Chief Antonio Guterres said Wednesday.

The city ranked third in 2023 on the ""top 20 European cities for solo travelers list"" released by the Hungarian-based airline company Wizz Air in January based on Tripadvisor reviews.
""Istanbul boasts a stellar 67 percent approval rating from tourists, earning it a five-star rating. Restaurants, in particular, received an outstanding 71 percent excellence rating,"" said the report.
Culture Trip, an online travel guide, commented in an article that Istanbul has a strong tradition of hospitality and that solo travelers do not need to feel alone.
Another travel platform, Istanbul Tips, stated that the city takes the security of its visitors seriously, which ensures that tourists can explore the city with peace of mind.
Naim Naim, a traveler from Sudan, came to Istanbul in early January for an eye operation. He was surprised to see how caring the Turkish people were, including the hospital staff who looked after him.
""The way Turkish people treat you is very nice, and I feel as if I am in my own country,"" Naim told Xinhua.
According to Nalan Yesilyurt, owner of Demco, a tourism and travel company, such hospitality is certainly one of the reasons driving the increase in foreign tourists coming to TÃ¼rkiye.
""Hospitality is one of our outstanding characteristics,"" Hamit Kuk, chief adviser to the president of the Turkish Travel Agencies Association, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
""Turks do not care about the identity, race, or religion of visitors, but always welcome them as guests of God,"" he said, noting such hospitality has created a unique understanding of service in the tourism sector.
Omer Turan has owned a Turkish delight (a traditional Turkish dessert) shop in the historical peninsula of Sultanahmet in Istanbul for 40 years.
In his view, Turkish hospitality is already embedded in the DNA of Turks.
""My customers are like my family,"" Turan told Xinhua.
""I have many regulars who visit me whenever they come to town, and new travelers say they would come back and thank me for making them feel so welcome,"" he said.
Stretching across Europe and Asia, Istanbul is the most visited city in the country by foreigners, hosting 16 million tourists during January-November in 2023, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute data."

Raisi made the remarks in an address to reporters before leaving Tehran for Ankara on a visit at the invitation of his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to a statement published on the presidential office's website.
He described TÃ¼rkiye as Iran's important trade and economic partner, saying the two countries would sign important documents during his trip, which indicated their determination to expand bilateral trade and economic relations.
Raisi said among the other objectives of his visit was to negotiate regional issues, with Palestine being among the most important ones.
He noted that supporting ""the resistance of the oppressed and strong Palestinians"" was the common position of Iran and TÃ¼rkiye.
The Iranian president blamed the U.S.-Western support for Israel for the failure to stop the bombardments of Gaza.
He said among the issues that should be addressed during his visit was the need to sever Israel's ""vital arteries, which can help stop its crimes against Palestinians.""
Raisi expressed hope that the trip would lead to the expansion of the Iran-TÃ¼rkiye cooperation at the bilateral, regional, and international levels.
According to Iran's official news agency IRNA, a high-ranking political and economic delegation is accompanying Raisi during his first trip to TÃ¼rkiye.
The two presidents are scheduled to hold a private meeting after Raisi arrives in Ankara, before they co-chair the eighth meeting of the TÃ¼rkiye-Iran High Level Cooperation Council and hold a joint press conference."

SAN FRANCISCO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / January 26, 2024 / MightyFly unveiled yesterday the third generation of the Cento aircraft, an autonomous hybrid eVTOL cargo aircraft designed to carry one hundred pounds of cargo for six hundred miles. MightyFly also announced that the 2024 Cento received the FAA's Special Airworthiness Certificate and Certificate of Authorization (COA) for an air corridor between Byron and New Jerusalem airports.
The new eVTOL incorporates several novel features, including a sleek design that enables operational efficiency, the ability to accommodate a wide range of payload center of gravity, autonomous center of gravity determination, and a larger cargo bay.
At the event, MightyFly revealed several technical characteristics of its 2024 Cento, including:
The new eVTOL will also present improved operational efficiency through MightyFly's Autonomous Load Mastering System (ALMS), which will enable the aircraft to autonomously open and close its cargo bay door, receive and eject packages, move and secure packages, and sense and compute weight and balance.
'We are very excited to show everyone the tremendous work and ingenuity performed by the MightyFly team throughout the last year and to unveil the 2024 Cento that couples innovation with efficiency in design, maintenance, and operation, bringing to the world the key to transform the expedited logistics market,' said Manal Habib, founder and CEO of MightyFly.
The announcement of MightyFly's latest FAA approval, which includes a new corridor between Byron and New Jerusalem airports of up to 5000 ft in altitude, represents a large achievement for the company as it allows MightyFly to start testing A to B flights and to incorporate its autonomous eVTOL within general aviation. This approval also showcases the maturity of MightyFly's autonomous aircraft and operations and signals a strong relationship between MightyFly and the FAA.
'How exciting to see the 2024 Cento come to life! A few months ago I saw the team working on its design and starting to manufacture its first parts. The vehicle you see today is a testimony of MightyFly's talent, creativity, innovation, and decades of industry expertise,' said Tim Draper, MightyFly's investor and Founding Partner of Draper Associates.
In the fall of 2024, MightyFly will publicly debut its autonomous cargo aircraft delivery flights in Michigan, demonstrating point-to-point autonomous delivery use cases to partners and customers.
The company is also scheduled to demonstrate its autonomous loading, unloading, and balancing of packages to the U.S. Air Force in early 2025 and to perform additional Proof of Concept (POC) programs.

The minister made the statement after he launched the e-bus service in Jammu and distributed more than one thousand appointment letters for the Jammu and Kashmir Combined Examination-2024 and compassionate appointment through video conferencing from the national capital.
Since the abrogation of Article 370 from the Union Territory, the minister also said there has been an 81 per cent reduction in civilian deaths and a 48 per cent in the death of security forces.
Shah said there were 2654 incidents of organised stone pelting in 2010, which were reduced to Zero in 2023. ""There were 132 incidents of organized strikes in 2010, while not a single incident took place in 2023.""He said similarly, in 2010, 112 civilians died in stone pelting, in 2023 not a single civilian died and in 2010 the number of civilians injured in stone pelting was 6235, which is zero today.
Shah added that the central government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi was strictly cracking down on terror financing, sealing and freezing assets of terrorists, and has also outlawed several terrorist organizations to crack down on them.
He added that under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi and Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha, a new era of peace and security has dawned in Jammu and Kashmir.
Shah said in the coming days, Jammu and Kashmir will continue to move ahead on the path of development at the same pace because now the youth here are taking computers in their hands instead of stones and are connecting with the development of the country and the Union Territory.
He said investments worth Rs 297 crore came to Jammu and Kashmir in 2019-20 and increased significantly to Rs 2,153 crore in 2022-23.
Along with this, an investment of Rs 6,000 crore is in the pipeline, Shah said, adding that GSDP was Rs one lakh crore in 2014-15, which increased more than two times to Rs 2,27,927 crore in 2022-23.

Shah said earlier, only 60 services were online in Jammu and Kashmir, which has now increased to 1,102, due to which corruption has been curbed.
""Earlier the number of players in Jammu and Kashmir was less than 2 lakhs, which has now increased to more than 60 lakhs,"" he said.
100 fully air-conditioned e-buses have been dedicated to the people of Jammu and Kashmir in the event. The project started with the operation and maintenance of these buses for 12 years at a cost of Rs 561 crore.
Of these 100 buses, 25 are 12 meters long and 75 buses are nine meters long. These buses will also ply from Jammu to Katra, Kathua, Udhampur and on the internal routes of Jammu. These buses will not only remove the commuting problems of the people in the coming days but will also be very useful from an environmental point of view.
Further, at the event, the Home Minister said today, 209 successful candidates of the Jammu and Kashmir Combined Examination-2024 batch have also received their appointment letters. These include 96 officers of the Jammu and Kashmir Administrative Service, 63 officers of the Account Gazette Service and 50 officers of the Police Service. (ANI)"

The US State Department on Monday urged Israel to investigate the death of a 17-year-old American citizen in the West Bank last week.
Tawfiq Ajaq, 17, was fatally shot on Friday near the village of al-Mazraa Al-Sharqiya, northeast of Ramallah.
""We have called for an urgent investigation to determine the circumstance of his death,"" State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters at a briefing in Washington on Monday.
The US is ""devastated about the killing"" and is continuing to ""engage closely with the government of Israel to ascertain as much information as possible,"" Patel said. He added that the head of the US Office of Palestinian Affairs has visited Ajaq's family to offer condolences and the embassy in Jerusalem will ""continue assisting"" them.
Tawfiq was born and raised near New Orleans, Louisiana. He moved to the West Bank last year with his parents and four siblings, to reconnect with their Palestinian heritage, according to Al Jazeera.
His cousin Joe Abdel Qaki told AJ that Tawfiq was grilling in the field outside the village when he was shot, once in the head and once in the chest. He died on the way to the hospital. According to Abdel Qaki, Israeli soldiers asked him and other Palestinians who tried to reach Tawfiq to show them their papers, delaying the rescue.
""Tawfiq is an American child who was chased and shot at by an Israeli settler, then Israeli forces pulled up and continued shooting,"" Miranda Cleland from the nonprofit Defense for Children Palestine, said on X (formerly Twitter).
Israeli police said they had received a report of a ""firearm discharge, ostensibly involving an off-duty law enforcement officer, a soldier and a civilian."" They did not identify the shooter, but note that the individuals targeted ""purportedly engaged in rock-throwing activities along Highway 60.""
At his son's funeral on Saturday, Hafez Ajaq was furious that he as an American taxpayer was footing the bill for Israeli ""killer machines"" to ""kill our own children.""
Some 369 Palestinians - 95 of them minors - have been killed in the West Bank since October last year, when Israel declared an all-out war against Hamas. The Gaza-based armed group had killed around 1,200 Israelis in nearby settlements in a series of raids on October 7. Since then, almost 25,000 Palestinians in the enclave have been killed, according to the local health authorities.
While South Africa has accused Israel of genocide before the International Court of Justice, White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters last week that the US did not have ""any indications that there's deliberate efforts to commit war crimes"" by the Israeli military.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's trip to the western exclave of Kaliningrad is not aimed at sending a message to NATO countries amid the standoff over Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said.
On Thursday - which is also Students Day in Russia - Putin arrived in Kaliningrad to meet with students at a local university. According to the Kremlin, he will also meet with local officials to discuss the economic and social welfare agenda.
Kaliningrad (formerly Konigsberg) belonged to Germany until the end of World War II, when it was handed over to the USSR under the Potsdam Agreement. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, it remained part of Russia, but is now bordered by NATO member states (Poland and Lithuania).
Commenting on Putin's trip, Peskov stressed that when he ""visits Russian regions, this is not a message to NATO nations,"" adding that the main focus should be on the president's actions.
However, Peskov said that Russian officials took ""special security measures"" to protect the president on the trip. He also noted that Moscow did not request a direct flight path over Lithuania to reach Kaliningrad. Shortly after the start of the Ukraine conflict, the EU imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia, including a complete ban on Russian planes flying over its territory.
Amid the standoff between Russia and NATO, Poland and Lithuania announced plans earlier this month to conduct military exercises in the Suwalki Gap - a narrow strip of land between Belarus, an ally of Moscow, and Kaliningrad.
Western media outlets have suggested that Russia could target this area in the event of a full-scale conflict with NATO, potentially cutting the Baltic states off from the rest of the US-led military bloc.
Russia has repeatedly denied having any plans to attack the alliance, saying it has no interest in doing so.

C6XPU4C0RL_LLZXXAMUWYCIESH,Annual Count of Homeless Residents Begins in Los Angeles,"Voice of America 24th January 2024, 21:05 GMT+11","Voice of America 24th January 2024, 21:05 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274104811/annual-count-of-homeless-residents-begins-in-los-angeles,"LOS ANGELES - Los Angeles County's annual count of homeless residents began Tuesday night - a crucial part of the region's efforts to confront the crisis of tens of thousands of people living on the streets.
Up to 6,000 volunteers with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority fanned out for the effort's main component, the unsheltered street tally.
The so-called ""point-in-time"" count will take place over three days and aims to estimate how many people are unhoused and what services they may require, such as mental health or drug addiction treatment.
LA County's undertaking is the largest among similar tallies in major cities nationwide. The tally, which also makes use of demographic surveys and shelter counts, is mandated by the federal government for cities to receive certain kinds of funding.
The count this year comes amid increasing public outrage over the perceived failure - despite costly efforts - to reduce the surging population of people living in cars, tents and makeshift street shelters.
The 2023 effort reported more than 75,500 people were homeless on any given night in LA County, a 9% rise from a year earlier. About 46,200 were within the city of Los Angeles, where public frustration has grown as tents have proliferated on sidewalks and in parks and other locations.
Since 2015, homelessness has increased by 70% in the county and 80% in the city.
Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, joined city and county officials to kick off the count Tuesday night in the North Hollywood neighborhood of LA's San Fernando Valley.
The count ""is an important tool to confront the homelessness crisis,"" Bass said in a statement. ""Homelessness is an emergency, and it will take all of us working together to confront this emergency.""
On her first day in office in December 2022, Bass declared a state of emergency on homelessness. One year into her term, the mayor, a Democrat, announced that over 21,000 unhoused people were moved into leased hotels or other temporary shelter during 2023, a 28% increase from the prior year. Dozens of drug-plagued street encampments were cleared, and housing projects are in the pipeline, she said last month.
City Hall, the City Council and the LA County Board of Supervisors have said they intend to work together to tackle the crisis. Progress hasn't always been apparent despite billions spent on programs to curb homelessness.
Homelessness remains hugely visible throughout California with people living in tents and cars and sleeping outdoors on sidewalks and under highway overpasses.
The results of the LA County homeless count are expected to be released in late spring or early summer."

Not only is France abusing its council presidency, Polyansky argued, it is also ""cosplaying the lowest standards of their British neighbors"" from April 2022. The once glorious French diplomacy has ""shrunk to miserable swindling and pathetic manipulations!"" he added.Â Ukrainian media outlets initially claimed the plane had been transporting missiles, but scrubbed their stories when it emerged that their own POWs were among the 74 dead. The Ukrainian General Staff eventually released a statement saying that Russia had been flying in missiles used to attack Kharkov so the flights were a legitimate target.Â According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Ukraine had been notified in advance that its prisoners, due to be exchanged later in the day, would be on board the flights headed for Belgorod. The second plane, with 80 POWs on board, turned around and landed safely after the first IL-76 was shot down.Â Moscow has accused Kiev of ""terrorism"" and callous disregard for the lives of its own citizens. Commenting on a screenshot showing both the initial and revised Ukrainian reporting on the incident, Polyansky said that Kiev was once again ""inflating the bubble of lies"" to avoid blame, no matter how ridiculous its narrative may sound.

The French ambassador said he would schedule the meeting for 5pm on Thursday, ""in a clear attempt to shield their Kiev regime clients"" and buy President Vladimir Zelensky's government ""more time to come to its senses and invent some at least distantly plausible explanation of what it has committed,"" the Russian diplomat added.


Not only is France abusing its council presidency, Polyansky argued, it is also ""cosplaying the lowest standards of their British neighbors"" from April 2022. The once glorious French diplomacy has ""shrunk to miserable swindling and pathetic manipulations!"" he added.Â Ukrainian media outlets initially claimed the plane had been transporting missiles, but scrubbed their stories when it emerged that their own POWs were among the 74 dead. The Ukrainian General Staff eventually released a statement saying that Russia had been flying in missiles used to attack Kharkov so the flights were a legitimate target.Â According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Ukraine had been notified in advance that its prisoners, due to be exchanged later in the day, would be on board the flights headed for Belgorod. The second plane, with 80 POWs on board, turned around and landed safely after the first IL-76 was shot down.Â Moscow has accused Kiev of ""terrorism"" and callous disregard for the lives of its own citizens. Commenting on a screenshot showing both the initial and revised Ukrainian reporting on the incident, Polyansky said that Kiev was once again ""inflating the bubble of lies"" to avoid blame, no matter how ridiculous its narrative may sound.

New Delhi has made no secret of its misgivings on being a permanent member of the UNSC, calling on the world body to bring in urgent reforms that are more in tune with the contemporary world.
Noting the 'positive sentiments' expressed by Francis with regard to India's G20 Presidency and the impactful 'Voice of Global South Summit', Jaishankar took to his official X handle to post, ""So glad to welcome @un_pga Dennis Francis this afternoon in New Delhi.

Germany should be ready to respond to a possible Russian attack, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has warned. He said that to prepare for such a scenario, Germany and its NATO allies must commit to strengthening their military capabilities.
In an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF on Monday, the defense chief pointed out that while Germany is not currently under a direct threat of attack, the country should do its best to be prepared for it.
If Germany wants to be ready for an attack ""that you don't know if and when it will occur, then that means you have to arm yourself - and that's what we're currently doing together with allies in NATO,"" he explained.
Pistorius went on to say that ""deterrence is the only effective means of positioning oneself against an aggressor from the outset"" as it signals to a potential adversary that the target is capable of striking back. To achieve such a posture, however, Germany must have ""a credible deterrent"" and be able to ""wage a war that is forced upon us,"" he noted.
Commenting on a potential scenario in which Russia attacked the Baltics, Pistorius remarked that Berlin was setting up its ""Lithuania Brigade"" specifically to address those concerns. The unit, composed of about 4,800 soldiers is expected to be ready by 2027 and will be the first German force to be permanently stationed abroad since World War II.
Pistorius suggested that amid the Ukraine conflict it would take Russia at least several years to be ready for a full-scale offensive, and that Western countries should use the time to intensively arm themselves.
The German tabloid Bild reported earlier this month, citing a classified document, that Germany is preparing for a scenario in which Russia launches an ""open attack"" on NATO in mid-2025, following major victories in Ukraine. Moscow mocked the prediction as a ""zodiac forecast.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed claims that Russia could attack NATO as ""complete nonsense,"" arguing that Moscow has ""no geopolitical, economic... or military interest"" in doing so. Still, the Kremlin has for decades voiced concerns about the US-led military bloc's expansion towards Russian borders, viewing it as an existential threat.

According to SP Global Commodity Insights, milder temperatures, especially in Europe and the United States, contributed to a weakened outlook for LNG prices, while attention remained on the situation in the Red Sea, adding an element of uncertainty to market dynamics.
Platts, part of SP Global Commodity Insights, reported that the March Japan Korea Marker (JKM) was assessed at USD 9.206/MMBtu on January 22.
The West India market for March was assessed at USD 9/MMBtu. However, global LNG prices were expected to remain weak in the near term due to the return of milder temperatures.
European LNG prices experienced a downward trend, influenced by mild weather conditions and robust gas inventories.
Despite sporadic cold spells and geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea, prices in Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean did not witness a substantial uptick.
The DES Northwest Europe Marker for March was assessed at USD 8.357/MMBtu on January 19, showing a daily increase but a significant weekly decline.
Gas storage levels in the European Union (EU) fell slightly, but LNG inventories remained healthy. Traders approached the market cautiously, testing it opportunistically rather than engaging in significant trading activities.
The bearish sentiment was expected to persist due to milder temperatures and weak industrial and economic activity.
The FOB Gulf Coast Marker was assessed at USD 7.12/MMBtu on January 19, reflecting an increase on the day but a notable decrease on the week.
The market in the United States faced bearish headwinds, with high inventories and milder temperatures dampening demand. US LNG exports increased in January, with a significant portion directed to Europe.
Analysts at SP Global highlighted the impact of the Cape of Good Hope route, emphasizing its low risk and predictability in loading and discharging times.
However, the longer travel distance increased overall transportation costs. LNG swaps faced a bearish sentiment as milder temperatures persisted, and buying interest remained lower than expected in both Europe and Asia.
On the Northwest European forward curve, full-month March was assessed at USD 8.298/MMBtu, with April 2024 and May 2024 at USD 8.218/MMBtu and USD 8.235/MMBtu, respectively.
Traders anticipated March and April for potential buying interest, closely monitoring weather forecasts. The impact of events in the Red Sea and alternative shipping routes added complexity to market dynamics, with potential consequences for shipping rates and gas prices.
The global LNG market continued to navigate a challenging landscape, influenced by weather conditions, geopolitical events, and shipping dynamics.
The bearish sentiment prevailed in the short term, but market participants remained vigilant for potential shifts in demand and supply dynamics. (ANI)"
CDHVLWL4JU_SA96B58MDE2Y6JH,Borrell Says Humanitarian Situation Could Not Be Worse in Gaza,"Voice of America 22nd January 2024, 20:05 GMT+11","Voice of America 22nd January 2024, 20:05 GMT+11",20240122,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274102616/borrell-says-humanitarian-situation-could-not-be-worse-in-gaza,"European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Monday that the way Israel is carrying out its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip is ""seeding hate for generations.""
Borrell spoke ahead of separate talks EU ministers are holding Monday with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and the Palestinian Authority's top diplomat, Riyad al-Maliki.
""We have in mind what Hamas is, what Hamas has done, and certainly we reject and we condemn,"" Borell told reporters. ""But the peace and stability cannot be built only by military means, and not in this particular way of using military means.""
Borrell has been among the Western officials who have criticized the number of civilian casualties in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says at least 25,105 Palestinians have been killed, many of them women and children. The ministry does not specify the number of civilians and Hamas fighters among the dead.
""The humanitarian situation could not be worse,"" Borrell said. ""There [are] no words to explain how the situation is, with hundreds of thousands without anything, without shelter, without food, without medicine and under the bombs. And every day, there is a high toll of civilian people being killed.""
Israel has blamed Hamas for putting civilians in danger, saying the militant group intentionally operates in residential areas and in a network of tunnels underneath.
The fighting in Gaza continued Monday with Israeli airstrikes targeting Hamas militants in the northern, central and southern regions.
Airstrikes and fierce fighting were reported in the southern city of Khan Younis, the second-largest city in the Gaza Strip.
A Palestinian holds a child wounded in an Israeli strike at Nasser Hospital, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip Jan. 22, 2024.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said its ambulances were unable to reach the wounded in Khan Younis due to Israeli troops besieging the group's ambulance center.
Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza, after the militant group sent fighters rampaging into Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli tallies. Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. U.K, EU and others, also took about 240 people hostage.
Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday rejected a proposal by Hamas to end the war.
""In exchange for the release of our hostages,"" the Israeli leader said in a statement, ""Hamas demands the end of the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of all the murderers and rapists. And leaving Hamas intact.'
'I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,' Netanyahu said.
Hamas on Sunday defended its terror attack on Israel but admitted to 'faults' and called for an end to 'Israeli aggression' in Gaza.
In its first public report on the attack that began the war, the militant group said it was a ""necessary step' against Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.
In late November, in a deal brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, more than 100 of the estimated 240 hostages who were taken captive to Gaza were freed in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
Since that deal ended, Netanyahu has faced mounting pressure from within Israel and from some world leaders to secure the release of the 136 hostages who remain in captivity, perhaps two dozen of whom have died or been killed.
Some world leaders, but not U.S. President Joe Biden, have called for an immediate cease-fire in the fighting.
Netanyahu in recent days has also taken a strong position against Palestinian statehood as a way to stabilize the volatile Mideast and prevent the spread of the Israel-Hamas war throughout the region. Biden and other American officials have called for Palestinian statehood.
'I will not compromise on full Israeli security control of all territory west of the Jordan River,' he said.
Biden on Friday said he spoke with Netanyahu about possible solutions for the creation of an independent Palestinian state that could include a nonmilitarized government.
Netanyahu said that he has faced down 'international and internal pressures' to change his position on Palestinian statehood.
'My insistence is what prevented for years the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have posed an existential danger to Israel,' Netanyahu said.
British Defense Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News Sunday that it is ""disappointing"" to hear of Netanyahu's opposition to a Palestinian state at the end of the Israel-Hamas war.
""Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution,"" Shapps said.
Discussing his administration's position Friday, Biden said, ""There are a number of types of two-state solutions."" Asked if a two-state solution was impossible with Netanyahu in office, Biden replied, ""No, it's not.""

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has welcomed the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) ruling ordering Israel to prevent the genocide of the Palestinian people. TÃ¼rkiye, he said, will work to make sure that Israeli ""war crimes"" do not go unpunished.
""I find the interim injunction decision taken by the International Court of Justice regarding the inhumane attacks in Gaza valuable and welcome it,"" Erdogan wrote on X on Friday evening.
The Turkish leader noted that the court's decision is ""binding on the countries party to the [UN] Genocide Convention,"" and expressed hope that ""Israel's attacks against women, children and the elderly will come to an end.""
The Hague-based court ruled on Friday that ""the state of Israel shall take all measures to prevent the commission of genocide to Gaza,"" punish any members of its military who commit genocidal acts, punish all public calls by officials for genocide, and immediately allow more humanitarian aid into the Palestinian enclave.
The court did not, however, demand that Israel cease its military operation in Gaza. South Africa, which brought the genocide case before the ICJ, had requested that the court order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza.""
Erdogan has publicly called for a ceasefire on multiple occasions since Israel declared war on Hamas in October, following a surprise attack on the Jewish state by the militants that killed around 1,200 people.
In a speech last Friday, the Turkish leader compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, accusing Israel's Western supporters of ""idly watching acts of genocide and barbarism committed against the people of Palestine by the 'modern fuehrer' Netanyahu.""
""We will continue to follow the process to ensure that war crimes committed against innocent Palestinian civilians do not go unpunished,"" Erdogan said on Friday. ""As TÃ¼rkiye, we will continue to work with all our strength and stand by our Palestinian brothers to establish a ceasefire and ensure the path to permanent peace.""
In his response to the ruling, Netanyahu praised the court for not demanding a ceasefire, but declared that ""the mere claim that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians is not only false, it's outrageous."" Allowing the case to proceed ""is a disgrace that will not be erased for generations,"" he added.
Israel's war on Hamas has left more than 26,000 Palestinians dead, roughly two-thirds of whom were women and children, according to the latest figures from the Gaza Health Ministry. Despite the massive civilian death toll, US intelligence agencies believe that Israeli forces have only managed to kill around a fifth of Hamas' 25,000-30,000 fighters.

NATO sees no threat from Russia toward any of its territories, the US-led bloc's Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Tuesday during a press conference in Brussels. That's as several alliance members, including Germany and the Baltic states, have raised concerns of a potential future Russian attack.
Answering questions from journalists following the signing of major new investments in artillery ammunition productions, Stoltenberg stated that, ""We don't see any direct or imminent threat against any NATO ally.""
At the same time, he stressed that the bloc nevertheless ""closely monitors what Russia does"" and has increased its ""vigilance and presence in the eastern part of the alliance,"" in order to prevent any attacks on allied nations.
Meanwhile, German news outlets have reported in recent weeks that Berlin was preparing for a scenario in which Russia launches an ""open attack"" on NATO as early as the summer of 2025 after securing a major victory in Ukraine.
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius also warned on Monday that his country should be ready to respond to a possible Russian attack even though there is no real threat as of now.
""Deterrence is the only effective means of positioning oneself against an aggressor from the outset,"" Pistorius told ZDF, calling on Germany and its NATO allies to commit to strengthening their military capabilities.
Similar concerns have been voiced by other NATO members, such as Estonia, whose Prime Minister Kaja Kallas suggested last week that the bloc has three to five years to prepare for a possible direct confrontation with Russia.
Moscow has dismissed any claims that it intends to attack any NATO members as ""complete nonsense,"" with President Vladimir Putin arguing that Russia has ""no geopolitical, economic ... or military interest"" in doing so.
At the same time, the Kremlin has for decades voiced concerns that it was the US and its NATO allies' continuous expansion to the east that posed an existential threat to Russia. Moscow has cited this expansion, which it believes threatens its national security, as well as the refusal to rule out Ukrainian NATO membership in the future, as some of the key reasons for launching its offensive against Kiev in February 2022.

Macron also addressed the French community at the Resident of France here in the national capital, according to the Embassy of France in India.
The French President is in India at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and was the Chief Guest at India's 75th Republic Day celebrations today.
The momentous visit by President Macron culminates the 25th-anniversary celebrations of the Strategic Partnership between India and France.
His visit marks a unique reciprocal exchange following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to France on its National Day in July 2023.
The two leaders have engaged in a series of high-profile meetings throughout 2023, underscoring the strength and depth of the bilateral relationship.
Their interactions have spanned various global platforms, including the COP 28 Summit in Dubai, the G20 Leaders' Summit, and the G7 Summit in Hiroshima. Notably, President Macron was also the Guest of Honour at the Bastille Day Celebrations in France in July 2023.
This visit by President Macron marks the sixth time a French leader has been invited as the Chief Guest at India's Republic Day. This tradition began with President Jacques Chirac in 1976, followed by Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1980, Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, and Francois Hollande in 2016.
PM Modi's last visit to France for Bastille Day in July 2023 was a spectacle of symbolism and substance. The visit showcased the strong bonds between the two nations, with a tri-service Indian armed forces contingent marching at Champs-Elysees and a spectacular flypast by Rafale jets.
During the visit, PM Modi was honoured with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, a prestigious recognition in France. A State Banquet at the Louvre Museum and a private dinner at Elysee highlighted the grandeur of the occasion. The Prime Minister also addressed the Indian community at La Seine Musicale.
Upon his arrival at the Jaipur International Airport earlier on Thursday, the French President was received by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra and Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma.
In Jaipur, the French President and PM Modi discussed bilateral ties and exchanged perspectives on a wide-range of bilateral and global issues. (ANI)"

Russia moved past Saudi Arabia in 2023 to become the largest exporter of oil to China, Chinese customs data released on Saturday showed.
Just over 107 million metric tons of Russian oil were shipped to China in 2023, a figure that comes out to 2.14 million barrels per day, thus marking a year-on-year increase of 24%. The record high crude shipments came despite Ukraine-related sanctions imposed on Russian oil exports by the West.
Saudi Arabia shipped some 86 million metric tons in 2023, while Iraq, the third biggest oil supplier to China, delivered 59 million tons. In December alone, Russia's oil exports to China amounted to 9.5 million tons, which is 6.2% higher than the volume of supplies in November.
Moscow began diversifying its energy supplies in 2022 after the EU, G7, and allies imposed an embargo on seaborne Russian oil along with a $60-per-barrel price cap on other types of crude in an effort to curb Russian energy revenues. Similar restrictions were subsequently introduced for exports of petroleum products. The agreed ceiling for diesel is $100 per barrel, and $45 for discounted products such as fuel oil.
As a result, Russian oil producers have rerouted supplies of East Siberian crude to Asia, and resumed transportation of crude by rail.
Last month, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that oil sales to the EU, once Russia's biggest market, had dropped by 90%. Meanwhile, a number of Western officials have noted that oil from Russia is still entering the EU market via intermediaries at an elevated price.

At the same time, there are undeniable signs of diplomatic strains with at least four neighbors, including two that recently recalled their ambassadors from Nairobi.
Kenya's effort to assert itself as a regional political force and economic hub in eastern Africa is not going over well with some of its neighbors.
The Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan recalled their ambassadors after their governments accused Kenya of hosting and dealing with their countries' opposition groups in Nairobi.
Uganda, meanwhile, recently took Kenya to an East African court in Tanzania over an oil distribution dispute. The case is about Kenya not allowing Ugandan government oil marketers to operate within its borders. This comes after Uganda discontinued the previous open tender system for purchasing petroleum products from Kenya.
Also, Tanzania banned Kenya Airways flights from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam last week because Kenya allegedly denied permission for Tanzania's national carrier to operate cargo flights to Nairobi. The ban was lifted after discussions between the foreign affairs ministers of the two countries.
Kenyan Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said Sunday that his country is ""not at war"" with its neighbors and wants to bring peace to the region.
""Some states are vulnerable, others are in conflict, and our president, William Samoei Ruto, is on the front line, making sure peace returns in these countries,"" said Mudavadi. ""He says the wars in those countries will affect our country too.'
Kenya has come under criticism from some Africans and its own citizens on how the government is handling engagement with other states.
International relations expert Kizito Sabala says the diplomatic spats are growing out of countries trying to counter Kenya's influence.
'There is always going to be a tug-of-war with what Kenya tries to do from the neighbors,"" Sabala said. ""But from my point of view, I don't think there is really something very serious to worry about. These are things that will continue to come as Kenya tries to assert itself as a regional power. And the other countries will try to find any leverage to use it in order to bring that down.'
Kenyan President Ruto, who came to power more than a year ago, has met several heads of state in Africa, including his neighbors, promising to help solve Africa's chronic problems of conflict and hunger, and to bring economic development.
Sabala says such assertiveness from a new leader will get pushback.
'They are reacting the way they are reacting because I think in Nairobi we have a new president who is very assertive and who seems to be projecting this to the region and therefore I think that in itself seems to be telling them, 'no, no, no, no, let's stop here,'"" Sabala said. ""But I think with the time they'll just get used to the way our president is doing things and that's fine. I don't think it's a big, big issue to worry about.'
Experts urge Kenya to handle the conflict in the Congo cautiously, especially regarding rebel groups that have contributed to the country's instability. They also want Kenya to refrain from taking sides in the Sudan conflict, which has pitted the country's armed forces and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces against each other."

The EU has called on its members to warn Israel of ""consequences"" if it refuses to recognize a Palestinian state, a move many in the bloc say is necessary to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East, the Financial Times reported on Monday.
According to a document prepared ahead of talks between EU foreign ministers and senior Israeli and Arab officials, Brussels has reportedly proposed that member states ""set out the consequences they envisage to attach to engagement or non-engagement"" by Israel with the plan.
Previous reports suggested that the EU has called for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state as a prerequisite for sustainable peace and the normalization of ties between Israel and the Arab world. Publicly, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell declared on Monday that ""from now on I will not talk about the peace process, but I want a two-state-solution process.""
Commenting on the document seen by the FT, one EU official told the outlet that the bloc had both ""incentives and disincentives"" to convince Israel to heed the call. He specifically mentioned the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which removed numerous trade barriers between the two sides. The EU is Israel's largest trading partner and accounts for more than 30% of its imports.
An FT source also noted that the plan reflected anger among some EU members at Israel's reluctance to embrace a two-state solution, while cautioning that ""it is hard to impose on [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu."" The official added, however, that the Israeli leader ""may not be around forever.""
Netanyahu reiterated his opposition to Palestinian statehood on Sunday, insisting that he ""will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of the Jordan [River]."" He has also repeatedly said that Israel will not end its war against Hamas until the Palestinian armed group is destroyed.
Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, with the ensuing conflict killing more than 1,200 Israelis and 25,000 Palestinians, and bringing unprecedented destruction to Gaza. Despite numerous calls to end hostilities, Israel has been reluctant to do so. The only brief pause in the fighting was in late November, when Hamas released around 100 Israeli hostages in exchange for Israel freeing some 240 Palestinian prisoners.

Three days after its Republican chairman announced the deal with his Democratic Senate counterpart, the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee approved the measure in a 40-3 vote.
Effective through 2025, the bill will increase the level of child tax credits and restore the full value of declining business tax deductions for investments in research and development (R&D) and plant and equipment.
While Republicans have sought to restore the immediate expensing of R&D and capital expenditures that were part of tax cuts in 2017 but began to be phased out in 2022, Democrats are seeking to restore the full annual amount of a COVID-era expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child, which expired in 2021.
Republican Jason Smith, Chairman of the Republican Ways and Means Committee, said the bill contains ""common-sense fixes to the tax code that will rebuild our communities, support better jobs and wages, and grow our economy.""
However, whether the bill will move to the House floor as a stand-alone bill or attached to other ""must-pass"" fiscal legislation is still uncertain despite having widespread support, including from Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer.
Late on January 18, Congress prevented a shutdown of some government agencies by agreeing on a stopgap measure that extended the time required to reach a deal on government funding for the fiscal year starting on October 1 by one month."

The Indian Ambassador referring to President Murmu's address stated that India in the next 25 years aims to be amongst the developed nations; while doing so, the neighbours also would be given priority, the Indian Chief of Mission reiterated.
""We will not be becoming a developed nation or achieve our tasks unless we take our neighbours along and that is reflected in our neighbourhood first policy that Prime Minister Modi has been following for the last ten years. We see the fruits of that policy in our relations with Nepal. Last year was especially important- the visit of Prime Minister Prachanda in May-June of last year and earlier this month, the visit of the External Affairs Minister of India. These visits have embarked a new momentum and direction to our ties,"" Ambassador Srivastava said addressing the event.

The spectacle was nothing short of amazing, supernatural, and unforgettable--an unimaginable beauty that captivated all who beheld it.
Residents of Ramnagari Ayodhya, along with devotees from remote corners of India, lit Ram Jyoti. The echoes of ""Ram-Ram"" resonated throughout homes, creating an atmosphere of devotional jubilation.
Even in front of Hanumangarhi temple, a grand celebration took place. This Deepotsav in Avadhpuri was truly unique, with a distinct excitement, enthusiasm, and joy in everyone's hearts, marking the end of a 500-year struggle.
The Deepotsav celebration in Ayodhya infused the city with unprecedented fervour. Joy and intimacy were palpable as countless lamps illuminated the banks of Saryu, Ram Ki Paidi, Maths, Temples, and other public places.
The entire Avadhpuri was adorned for the grand festival of Shri Ram, featuring elaborate lighting on temples, small streets, and main roads, as well as all government and religious buildings. City residents celebrated the presence of their beloved Ram by illuminating lamps in their homes.
Saryu Aarti was performed with heightened enthusiasm, involving many dignitaries, sages, and saints at the ghats.
Since Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath took office in 2017, the concept of a grand Deepotsav celebration has been envisioned, growing in grandeur each year. The second Deepotsav of the Yogi government's second term in 2023 set unprecedented records, with 22.23 lakh lamps illuminating Ayodhya.
In 2024, exactly three months later, Ayodhya celebrated Diwali once again after the 'Pran Pratishtha' of Shri Ram, resonating with the government's vision of 'Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat.' People of diverse languages, styles, and castes gathered to light the lamp of faith with the Ram Jyoti, guided by the double-engine government.
Ayodhya exuded a supernatural aura, reminiscent of Tretayug. The lighting of lamps in reverence for their idol was accompanied by wishes for prosperity, as Rangoli adorned intersections. Visitors from outside also joined in, lighting lamps in reverence.
Post the consecration on January 22, a mesmerising projection show took place at Ram Ki Paedi until 7 p.m. This was followed by a captivating laser show and an eco-friendly fireworks display at Ram Ki Paedi. (ANI)"

The ceremony was held at Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi.
The award recipients included a group of scientists from the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) for their project on laser-based rain-triggering demonstrators with remote sensing technology, as well as a team from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for their project regarding the identification of clouds' microphysical seedability in an actionable manner. Lastly, a group of researchers from Michigan Technological University, US, also received the award for their work on laboratory and modelling studies of cloud susceptibility to hygroscopic seeding.
Sheikh Mansour highlighted the UAE's long-standing commitment to promoting collaboration in the face of global challenges. His Highness also referred to the establishment of the UAE Research Programme for Rain Enhancement Science as an international research initiative that aims to attract prominent scientists and researchers from diverse scientific fields to develop new innovations and technologies in rain enhancement science.
In a speech delivered on his behalf by Mariam bint Mohammed Almheiri, Head of International Affairs Office at the Presidential Court, His Highness said, ""This programme serves as an authentic example of the UAE's dedication to investing in scientific research and advanced technology to achieve water and food security, as well as environmental sustainability, on local, regional, and global scales. It has ushered in new beginnings for a technology that received limited attention in the latter half of the twentieth century. Furthermore, the programme has expanded horizons for researchers in this field and offered them greater opportunities to contribute to alleviating water scarcity worldwide.""Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan extended his sincere congratulations and wishes of success to the three awarded Fifth Cycle teams.
Each winner will receive grants of up to USD1.5 million, distributed over a period of three years barring an initial two-month implementation, to facilitate the projects' transition from theory to practice.
Dr. Abdulla Al Mandous, Director-General of NCM and President of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), said, ""This awards cycle is a testament to the UAE's commitment to bolstering water security both regionally and globally, particularly in the broader context of addressing climate change issues, as highlighted by its recent successful hosting of COP28.""Al Mandous added, ""I would like to congratulate the winning teams, and confirm NCM's commitment in supporting them to continue their progressive research on cloud and rainfall enhancement technology on a global scale, paving the way for a more sustainable future.""Alya Al Mazroui, Director of UAEREP, said, ""The growing challenges we face regarding water scarcity require a collective effort that knows no borders. By providing a platform and funding for a global research community in rain enhancement, UAEREP continues to serve as a hub for the international interchange of scientific growth and innovation. This stems from our shared understanding of the importance of science in building bridges of cooperation, encouraging the exchange of knowledge and innovation, and finding innovative solutions to pressing climate challenges, especially water scarcity.""The ceremony follows a rigorous 2023 grant cycle, in which a designated committee reviewed eight proposals submitted by 64 scientific professionals affiliated with 35 institutions across ten countries, including the UAE.

Francis emphasised that the current structure, dating back to the post-1945 era, does not align with the present geopolitical realities.
""Security Council of United Nations as it currently exists harks back to a period in world history which no longer exists. It was formed, in the immediate post-1945. Since then, the world has changed radically. The geopolitical realities of today are not reflected in the council,"" he said.
Addressing claims of the urgent need for democratisation within the council, Francis pointed out that geopolitical dynamics have progressively impeded the council from making crucial decisions, often leading to the use of the veto by certain parties.
""And there are those who claim that the council is in urgent need of democratisation. The fact of the matter is that the council has in recent years been progressively unable to take the decisions necessary in order to system support, strengthening of international peace, and largely for geopolitical reason. The geopolitics, the global dynamics of the geopolitics gets imported into the council and that results invariably in the use of the veto by one or the other party,"" he added.
He highlighted the resultant frustration not only in the General Assembly but also among the global population, emphasising the importance of reforms for the benefit of the 8 billion people watching.
""Often this causes immense frustration in the General Assembly, but also beyond, in a key, in a key area of concern for the UN as a whole. And that is the key constituency of the 8 billion people who are looking on. So reform of the council is absolutely necessary,"" said the UNGA President.
Acknowledging that some nations may be hesitant to engage substantively in the reform process due to privilege, Francis underscored the woeful inadequacy of the existing formula.
""I don't think that there is any member of the UN that would deny a need for reform of the council. Of course, there are those who are less anxious to engage substantively in the process of reform because if you are in a privileged position, you are not necessarily in a hurry to lose privilege,"" he also said.
He asserted that reforms are inescapable for the multilateral system's overall interest and the United Nations' ability to fulfill its mandate. ""But I think it is well appreciated that the old formula, the existing formula, is woefully inadequate and in the interest of the system as a whole, of the multilateral system, and of the ability of the United Nations to discharge its mandate, reform is inescapable.""While expressing a lack of ""exciting news"" regarding the commencement of formal negotiations for reforms, Francis informed that ongoing discussions among members are focusing on potential elements of the reforms.
He pointed out the absence of consensus on when these formal negotiations should start, posing a challenge for UN member states to reach an agreement.
""Unhappily, I don't have exciting news for you... for reforms of the council, the commencement of formal negotiations has not taken place. That is something on which members need to come to consensus and there is no consensus as of now as to when that process should begin,"" added Francis.
The UNGA President concluded by noting that various models for the Security Council's constitution, including ""enlargement"" or increased representation of non-permanent members, are under consideration.
Francis arrived in New Delhi on a five-day visit at the invitation of External Affairs Minister (EAM) S Jaishankar.
On Monday, the UNGA president paid a 'solemn tribute' to the 'Father of the Nation' at his final resting place, Rajghat, in the national capital. India's permanent representative to the UN, Ruchira Kamboj, was also present as the UNGA president laid floral tributes at the Mahatma's memorial. (ANI)"

""I've been coming to the council on a regular basis for almost two years now, painting you a picture that gets sadder and bleaker each time I come, given that the security and humanitarian situation is deteriorating,"" Jean Victor Geneus told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council. ""The Haitian people can't take it anymore.""
Geneus said Haiti's future is at a crossroads, and he hoped it would be the last time he addresses the council before the deployment of the multinational support force it authorized in October.
Kenya has volunteered to lead the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti and has committed about 1,000 police officers. Ambassador Martin Kimani said a pledging conference is being planned to meet gaps in funding, equipment and logistical support for the mission.
""We hope that this initiative will enable deployment without delay,"" he said.
The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Antigua and Barbuda have also expressed willingness to contribute personnel to the force. The United States has committed about $200 million in support, including logistics and equipment for the mission, but is not sending any personnel.
The multinational force, which was authorized by the Security Council but is not a U.N. mission, has been slow to deploy. First, it took months for the council to approve it. And now it has been going through the final domestic hurdles in Kenya before they can assume command. Kenya's high court is expected to rule Friday on a private lawsuit questioning the constitutionality of the deployment to Haiti.
FILE - National police officers patrol an intersection in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Aug. 5, 2023.
In the meantime, the situation in Haiti has worsened.
Violent armed gangs control much of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and have spread to other parts of the country. They have carried out massacres and kidnappings, human trafficking and sexual violence.
The deteriorating security situation has also created a humanitarian crisis, with almost half the population, around 5 million people, experiencing acute hunger and 200,000 displaced from their homes.
""It beggars belief that in 2023 alone, we've seen over 5,000 people murdered - that's roughly 12 a day,"" Geneus said. ""That means in 2023, someone was murdered every two hours in Haiti.""
He said more than 1,400 people were injured, nearly 3,000 kidnapped and 37 police assassinated in gang-related violence last year, noting that the real numbers are probably much higher.
Illicit arms from the US
The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) says in its latest report released Wednesday that guns and ammunition trafficked from the United States are ending up in the hands of the criminals. Shipped primarily from the state of Florida, they are flowing to Haiti by ships and small aircraft.
""UNODC has found that there are 11 recorded informal or clandestine airstrips in Haiti, spread out across the country,"" said UNODC Director-General Ghada Waly. ""They represent a blind spot that is possibly being used by traffickers and smugglers, bearing in mind that smaller aircraft flying directly between the United States and Haiti are difficult to monitor.""
She said a small number of Haitian gangs, including the 5 Segond and 400 Mawozo groups, have become highly specialized in the procurement, storage and distribution of weapons and ammunition.
""They move firearms from points of entry to their strongholds before distributing or selling them to other armed groups,"" Waly told the council.
U.S. envoy Robert Wood told reporters that Washington is concerned about the trafficking of arms into Haiti.
""The situation is dire, and we are taking this very seriously and doing what we can,"" he said.
The United Nations has stressed that Haiti needs a combination of a strengthened national police force, the rapid deployment of the multinational force, and credible elections to put Haiti on the path back to security and stability."

NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / January 26, 2024 / Promoting equitable education is a top priority as students return to school. Riley's Way has opened its annual Call For Kindness with education equity in mind, calling on young people themselves (13-23 years old) to come up with ideas and solutions to address this growing issue. The Call For Kindness is a nationwide contest that asks young people to submit their ideas for projects rooted in kindness, empathy, youth leadership, and community to win seed funding up to $5,000 and a year-long professional development Fellowship.
'Education equity is not only about breaking down systemic barriers and accommodating various circumstances,' explained Call For Kindness alumni Everest Maya-Tudor. 'It's also about creating an environment where learning is seen as a fundamental right rather than a privilege.'
'Young people themselves picked Education Equity as our special category this year,' stated Dr. Christine O'Connell, Riley's Way Executive Director. 'They want to dismantle barriers to education and create opportunities so every student can thrive.'
Students across the nation experience vastly different school environments. In many cases, students from diverse backgrounds, including but not limited to students of color, students who identify as LGBTQIA+, low-income students, and students with disabilities, face inequitable access to resources, support services and enriching opportunities. Young leaders are standing up against these inequities and envisioning inclusive solutions grounded in kindness and empathy to increase access to high-quality education regardless of one's background or circumstance.
'Young people leading with kindness are creating a dynamic and positive force for good that our world desperately needs,' shared Ian Sandler, co-founder and Board Chair of Riley's Way. 'They are paving the way for a more vibrant leadership landscape that fosters innovation, inclusivity, and a commitment to a kinder world.'
The Call For Kindness boasts an innovative model for youth development, combining start-up funding ($5,000) with leadership programming - all grounded in kindness and empathy. Past projects have addressed mental health and well-being, promoted racial justice, bridged the tech industry's demographic gap, supported those experiencing homelessness, and much more. Up to 40 youth-led projects will be awarded, with 10 focused on Education Equity, three awards in the A Kinder World For Animals special category, and one in each of the other special categories: Interfaith Connections and Dance and the Arts.
The Yuriko Kikuchi Arigato Award ('Arigato' means 'thank you' in Japanese) supports projects in dance and the performing arts in honor of Yuriko, the pioneering dancer, choreographer, and keeper of Martha Graham's flame. The purpose of the Interfaith Connections Award is to foster education, connection making, and acts of kindness across different religious or cultural communities. The A Kinder World for Animals Award addresses the well-being of animals and the important role that animals play in human lives.

""We find [the actions] incredibly dangerous,"" State Department Deputy Spokesperson Vedant Patel told VOA during a briefing on Wednesday, while declining to provide the U.S. assessment of North Korea's intentions.
This latest missile launch occurred just days after Pyongyang tested a solid-fuel intermediate-range missile, equipped with a hypersonic warhead, into waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.
""We harbor no hostile intent toward the DPRK and continue to be open to diplomacy without preconditions,"" Patel added. He was referring to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is North Korea's official name.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sharply criticized South Korea, describing inter-Korean relations as a relationship between 'two states hostile to each other.""
A major monument in Pyongyang symbolizing the goal of reconciliation with South Korea has been demolished, according to news reports citing satellite imagery.
FILE - This photo shows the Arch of Reunification, a monument to symbolize hope for reunification of the two Koreas, in Pyongyang, North Korea, on Sept. 11, 2018. The monument appeared gone in satellite images taken by Planet Labs on Jan. 23, 2024.
Earlier this month, Kim labeled South Korea as a ""primary foe and invariable principal enemy,"" stating that unification with South Korea was no longer possible.
This stance is viewed by some analysts as a departure from North Korea's longstanding objective of reunifying the Korean Peninsula under its control.
Pyongyang also continues to ignore Washington's offers for dialogue and remains averse to negotiating with Seoul.
U.S. officials have said they are disappointed by North Korea's continued rejection of dialogue and the escalation of its hostile rhetoric toward South Korea. The United States said inter-Korean cooperation is vital to achieving lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.
""We are eager to engage in substantive discussions on identifying ways to not just manage military risk but create lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, as well as our continued stated goal of the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" Patel said Wednesday.
At the Pentagon, Press Secretary Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters on Tuesday that Washington has been very public in its commitment to working with allies and partners ""to deter and help stabilize the security of the region.""
The U.S., Japan and South Korea have reaffirmed their commitment to the complete denuclearization of the DPRK, in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. The three countries also urge the DPRK to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
North Korea last launched cruise missiles in September 2023. Two cruise missiles carrying mock nuclear warheads were fired toward the Yellow Sea at that time.
The two Koreas have been divided since the Korean War ended in 1953. They remain technically at war as the Korean War ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.

Mark Suzman made the call in his annual letter released Thursday that led with the story of Chuck Feeney, a billionaire whose philanthropy inspired Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Melinda French-Gates. Feeney, who died in October, made a fortune through duty free stores and gave away $8 billion during his life, much of it anonymously.
'He showed us all how the actions of one generous person can set the wheels in motion for generations of progress,' Suzman wrote of Feeney.
The message is a familiar one from the Gates Foundation, one of the largest global health funders in the world. The foundation recently announced it would spend $8.6 billion in 2024, its largest budget to date, aided by a $20 billion donation by Gates in 2022.
The record-setting budget coincides with the erosion of progress nonprofits made toward ending poverty, fighting treatable diseases and eradicating hunger. Experts say the backsliding is caused by the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and high debt levels in many low- and middle-income countries.
'We are doing exactly what my call to action is,' Suzman said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'At a time of great need, if there is an opportunity to expand our giving, we should be modeling what that looks like.'
Bill Gates takes part in a panel at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 17, 2024.
The foundation's appeal builds on the Giving Pledge, launched by the Gateses and Buffett in 2010 as a commitment for billionaires to donate the majority of their wealth. Donors may give while they are alive or at the time of their death and to any cause.
Suzman noted that Feeney joined the pledge in 2011, adding, 'I know that very few people are willing or able to give away all their wealth. But there's a lot of ground between Feeney's blockbuster generosity and the current state of giving among the ultra-wealthy - and so many opportunities to make an impact.'
At least one person who took the pledge, billionaire investor Leon Cooperman, would like to see it go further. In an interview in December, Cooperman told Ari Melber, MSNBC's chief legal correspondent, that 'the Giving Pledge is a notable idea, it makes sense but it's not asking for enough.'
The foundation and Suzman lean toward optimism, pointing toward research and programs they've helped develop, such as low-cost interventions that could decrease maternal and infant mortality and a global agricultural information system that would serve the world's poorest farmers.
The Gates Foundation itself plans to increase its annual budget to $9 billion next year, and then hold at that level. The foundation board approved this year's budget but asked the foundation to consider how to sustainably fund its work when the budget stops expanding, Suzman said.
'They're pushing us to say, 'Would you actually potentially sunset or shift some programs and what does it look like to keep more powder dry against potential opportunities?'' he said.
The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
Groups aligned with the effective altruism movement, like Longview Philanthropy, also regularly call for even those with a small amount of wealth to give 10% to charities. In September, they issued a report on what could be accomplished if the top 1% of earners gave away 10% of their income.
Suzman said he personally supports requiring U.S. philanthropic foundations to donate more than the currently mandated equivalent of 5% of their endowment. The Gates Foundation annually donates closer to 10% of its endowment, Suzman said.
Complicating the billionaires' goal of easing inequality is the fact that many keep getting richer. A report from Oxfam International, released during the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, this month found that the fortunes of the world's five richest men have doubled since 2020 and that the increasing concentration of wealth could yield the first trillionaire in the next decade.
Beyond that, a growing portion of charitable dollars in the U.S. go to donor-advised funds, which allow donors to immediately claim a tax advantage. However, there is no deadline for when the funds in a DAF must be given to charitable causes.
Chuck Collins, a director at the Institute for Policy Studies who has studied the giving of billionaires, said giving to intermediaries like DAFs is one way the wealthiest donors keep control of charitable funds, instead of giving the money to nonprofits.
'These are our tax dollars at work and the donors are getting substantial tax reductions in the year they give,' Collins said. 'So we should know how these funds are being deployed and if they are being deployed in a timely way.'"

Key elements of the budget are expected to centre around capital expenditure, the 'Make in India' initiative, and a strong push for green energy.
While projecting a commitment to growth, the budget is likely to introduce targeted measures to stimulate demand, especially in rural and urban areas.
One area of potential attention is tax slabs, with the government possibly considering incentives to revitalize economic activity, particularly in the rural economy.
Despite potential moderation in disinvestment targets due to upcoming elections, fiscal discipline is expected to remain a priority.
The fiscal deficit for FY24 is projected to be lower than the previous year's target of 5.9 per cent of GDP, and estimates for FY25 range between 5.4-5.5 per cent of GDP, contingent on increased revenue and controlled subsidy provisions.
With an anticipated economic growth surge, the Interim Budget may forecast higher direct tax collections in FY25, targeting overall tax collection growth at 12-13 per cent, compared to 14 per cent in FY24.
Sectors across the spectrum are eagerly awaiting announcements in the Interim Budget. From agriculture and infrastructure to healthcare, education, and manufacturing, each sector is vocal about its expectations for allocations and reforms that foster growth, innovation, and societal well-being.
Varun Aggarwal, founder and managing director, Profit Idea, said, ""In the IT sector, expectations hinge on digital infrastructure investments, incentives for research, skill enhancement, and innovation hubs. The industry hopes for increased funding for cybersecurity, support for cutting-edge technologies like AI, IoT, and 5G, and revisions in tax policies to stimulate IT exports. The healthcare sector anticipates revolutionary measures, including incentives for healthcare training, special GST categories for healthcare education, and enhanced allocations for digital health infrastructure and telemedicine"".
Fintechs, particularly digital lending platforms, are looking for changes such as flexible Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios to create personalized financial solutions. Tax breaks for fintech companies are considered crucial for innovation, while participation in the Account Aggregator framework is sought to enable more effective use of financial data with customer consent.
In the hospitality and tourism sector, expectations revolve around policies supporting resilience, infrastructure development, and increased room supply to meet growing demand.
Overall, the Interim Budget is poised to address diverse sectoral expectations, emphasizing growth, innovation, and inclusive development in the Indian economy. (ANI)"

It is exemplified by joint initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance.
Lastly, the third pillar signified partnership for the people.

Business ties and cross-investments will also be promoted during the visit under the banner of France's ""Make It Iconic"" nation-branding campaign, which has targeted India as a priority country. (ANI)"

Western speculation about a potential Russian attack on NATO is aimed only at frightening Moscow and forcing it to abandon its goals in the Ukraine conflict, Sergey Naryshkin, the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) has said.
In an interview with RIA Novosti on Thursday, Naryshkin described the warnings of numerous Western officials as part of an ""information war"" being waged against both Russia and the populations of their own countries. This type of warfare seeks ""to justify... the West's existing aggression against Russia,"" he said.
According to the intel chief, by conducting ""hybrid"" actions, the West is trying to intimidate Moscow by raising the possibility of a full-scale direct conflict between Russia and NATO. ""The Westerners emphasize their belligerence, their mobilization readiness, hoping to influence Russia so that it... abandons its plans... and goals of the special military operation,"" he explained, adding that he considered the attempts futile.
Naryshkin's remarks come after Admiral Rob Bauer, the chair of the NATO Military Committee, warned the US-led military bloc that it must brace for a major clash with Russia within the next 20 years - one which would require the mass mobilization of civilians.
Earlier this month, the German tabloid Bild also reported, citing a classified document, that Berlin was preparing for Russia to launch an ""open attack"" on NATO in mid-2025 following battlefield victories against Ukraine. Moscow has scorned the prediction as a ""zodiac forecast.""
While NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said that the bloc sees no direct threat from Russia at the moment, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has warned that his country should be ready to repel a possible Russian offensive, and urged NATO members to arm themselves for such an eventuality.
Russian officials have repeatedly dismissed purported plans to attack the alliance as ""nonsense,"" with President Vladimir Putin insisting that Moscow has no interest whatsoever in doing so. Still, Moscow has voiced concerns for decades about NATO's expansion towards its borders, particularly the bloc's push to integrate Ukraine.

""We want to visit the temple (Batadrava Than). What crime have I committed that I cannot visit the temple?..."" Rahul Gandhi said.
""I want to go to the temple, what is wrong with this? Earlier we were invited but now the administration is saying that we cannot go. ""Aaj sirf ek vyakti mandir mein ja sakta hain...""(Perhaps today only one person can go to the temple),"" the Congress leader said in an apparent dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the 'Pran Pratishta' ceremony at Ayodhya Ram Temple.

""Tomorrow is the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Temple and many devotees will come to the Than.

""Rahul was permitted to go to Batradava Than. This is a historical place. It is the birthplace of great religious person Shankar Dev Ji.

But yesterday, we were suddenly told that we couldn't come there until 3 p.m. We will try to go there but going there after 3 pm is very difficult as we would have to cover an additional distance,"" the Congress leader said.
Amid a war of words with the Assam Chief Minister over 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra', Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi, Jairam Ramesh, Gaurav Gogoi and KC Venugopal were stopped from going to Batadrava Than, a religious place in Satra village on Monday.
Yesterday, Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma appealed to Rahul Gandhi to visit Bordowa Than after the completion of the Pran Pratishtha programme at Ram Mandir, going to be held today.""I want to appeal to Rahul Gandhi to visit Batadrava Than after the completion of the Pran Pratishtha ceremony at Ram Temple,"" he said.
Congress MP from Assam, Gaurav Gogoi asserted that the action of the state government will not reduce devotion of Rahul Gandhi nor it will impact the power of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.""It is a matter of great misfortune for Assam that right from the first day of the yatra, Rahul ji has been repeatedly expressing his devotion towards Shankar Dev ji and he has been stopped today. The present BJP government is stopping us from our devotion. This will not reduce Rahul ji's devotion and the power of Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra will also remain complete. Ever since Assam CM has said that Rahul Gandhi can go to the Bordowa Than only after 3 pm, the attitude of the administration has changed,"" Gogoi said.
Meanwhile, Assam CM Himanta yesterday said that Satra Samitee hasn't invited Rahul Gandhi. In the evening, you can go but don't bring Assam into a bad light.
""He can go to Batadrava after 2 pm or in the morning hours. I feel if he does not go to Batadrava during those 2-3 hours during the Pran Pratishtha event will be good"", said Sarma. (ANI)"

Poland will loan Ukraine cash make ""larger-scale arms purchases,"" Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky said after meeting Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Kiev on Monday. ""There is nothing more important"" than giving Kiev more weapons, Tusk said.
""We appreciate Poland's unwavering support and the new military aid package for Ukraine, as well as a new form of cooperation aimed at larger-scale arms purchases for Ukrainian needs: a Polish loan for Ukraine,"" Zelensky wrote on X (formerly Twitter).
Speaking in Kiev, Tusk also said that Warsaw was ready to finalize talks on the joint Polish-Ukrainian production of weapons and ammunition on Ukrainian territory, and that he had signed Poland on to a G7 pledge to continue arming Ukraine until it retakes its lost territory.
Neither Tusk nor Zelensky revealed how much money Poland would lend Ukraine, or when this cash would be transferred.
Warsaw has already given Kiev more than â¬3 billion ($3.27 billion) in military aid since the beginning of Russia's military operation, according to figures from the Kiel Institute for World Economy.
However, the future of Polish military aid was thrown into jeopardy in September when Tusk's predecessor, Mateusz Morawiecki, announced that his country was ""no longer transferring any weapons to Ukraine,"" and would instead focus on building up its own forces. Morawiecki's declaration came amid a trade dispute that saw Kiev file a now-suspended complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) over Poland and some other EU states banning Ukrainian grain deliveries, which they argued undercut their own producers.
With Morawiecki's nationalist government replaced by Tusk's pro-EU cabinet, the new PM has promised that disagreements between Warsaw and Kiev will not stop the flow of arms.
""There is nothing more important than supporting Ukraine in its war effort against the Russian attack. This is absolutely number one,"" he said, the Polsat news agency reported.

- Politics news -
In a post on his X account, the top Iranian diplomat said he is attending the UNSC meeting in pursuit of international peace and security.
Amirabdollahian also took a swipe at the Zionist regime and its allies for the genocidal crimes that have resulted in the loss of over 25,000 lives in the Gaza Strip, injured and displaced thousands of others, and escalated instability in the region.
In a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in New York, Amirabdollahian called on Russia, as a permanent member of the UNSC, to play a more active role in the efforts to end the war on Gaza.
He also described the Israeli regime's recent attacks on Syria and Lebanon as an attempt to divert the international community's attention away from its humiliating defeat in the war against Palestine and as a sinister plan to foment instability and insecurity in the region.
In another meeting, with Foreign Minister of Lebanon Abdallah Bou Habib, the Iranian foreign minister denounced the Zionist regime's atrocities as a clear example of war crimes, genocide, and crime against humanity.
He also expressed Iran's support for Lebanon's stability and security, which he said will affect the security of the entire region.
Amirabdollahian also held talks with the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy for Syria Geir O. Pedersen.
Stressing the need for the international community's serious efforts to cease the Israeli regime's violation of Syria's territorial integrity, Amirabdollahian called for concerted efforts in the fight against terrorism.
Pedersen, for his part, hailed Iran's constructive role in the war on terrorism and its contribution to the settlement of the crisis in Syria.
He also bemoaned the fact that the lingering crisis in Palestine and Gaza has had adverse and destructive effects on regional peace processes.
At least 25,295 people have been killed and 63,000 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7."

The constituent assembly held its first session in December 1946 and the last session in November 1949, following which the constitution was enacted a year later with Dr. BR Ambedkar as the head of the drafting committee.
The beating retreat ceremony, a military ceremony dating to the 17th century, will culminate in the Republic Day celebrations at Vijay Chowk in the national capital on January 29.
Visuals showed army personnel marching at the border, joined by the dog squad.
Earlier, the Union Defence Ministry said, ""This year, the 'Beating Retreat' ceremony at Vijay Chowk on Raisina Hill in New Delhi will witness all Indian tunes to mark the culmination of the 75th Republic Day celebrations on January 29. The tunes will be played by bands of the Indian Army, Indian Navy, and Indian Air Force before President Droupadi Murmu and other dignitaries.""It is held annually on January 29 at Vijay Chowk and is a centuries-old tradition that dates back to the early 1950s, when Major Roberts of the Indian Army indigenously developed the unique ceremony of display by the massed bands.
It marks a centuries-old military tradition when the troops ceased fighting, sheathed their arms, withdrew from the battlefield, and returned to the camps at sunset at the sound of the retreat.
Colours and standards are cased and flags are lowered. The ceremony creates nostalgia for the times gone by.
Meanwhile, this year, the focal points of the Republic Day parade will be 'Viksit Bharat' and 'Bharat-Loktantra ki Matraka', symbolising the country's aspirations and its role as a nurturer of democracy.
Republic Day celebrations are marked by great hustle and bustle, with the President unfurling the flag, followed by spectacular military and cultural pageantry. (ANI)"

The West needs to review its own values, democracies, human rights policies, and its institutions, Adamu Garba, a former Nigerian senator, has told RT in an exclusive interview. That Germany follows double standards is shocking, he said.
Garba, who served in Nigeria's Senate between 2007 and 2011, said he believed that Germany had lived since the end of world war in 1945 on the premise that ""they will never repeat the story of Holocaust.""
Germany committed a lot of genocide in Africa, including in Namibia between 1904 and 1908 when 150,000 innocent civilians died, Garba pointed out. However, Berlin ""did not acknowledge this,"" the politician noted.
He said that he has been shocked to see ""Germany is there once again, backing a genocidal action against innocent civilians,"" with its support for Israel in the conflict with Hamas.
Addressing Berlin's stance on events in Gaza, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow is not surprised that Germany has decided to defend Israel in a case being made at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that alleges genocide.
""We were not surprised by the German government's decision to oppose the Republic of South Africa, which filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide against the population of the Gaza strip. This comes against the backdrop of Berlin's unconditional support for Israel, regardless of the consequences,"" she said.
According to Zakharova, Berlin was attempting to become an ""expert"" on issues related to the mass extermination of an ethnic group.
Former senator Garba said he supports the position set out by Zakharova.
South Africa filed a complaint against Israel at the International Court of Justice in late December, accusing it of violating the United Nations' Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide convention. Officials have also asked the Netherlands-based court to order Israel to ""immediately suspend its military operations in and against Gaza.""
On January 5, a spokesperson for Germany's Federal Foreign Office said that Israel ""targeted action against armed attackers; that is, [they are] fighters in an armed conflict, it's not an action with the intention of destroying an ethnic group.""
""We have made it very clear that, in our opinion, the claim that Israel is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip is false and not covered by the Convention,"" the official added.
Germany announced last Friday that it would take action on behalf of Israel as a third party in the case.

DMDOY6GN2K_WOT5H40Y0GJY5PN,UN: China being grilled on human rights during Universal Periodic Review,"ANI 23rd January 2024, 22:03 GMT+11","ANI 23rd January 2024, 22:03 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103800/un-china-being-grilled-on-human-rights-during-universal-periodic-review,"Geneva [Switzerland], January 23 (ANI): China's human rights record is facing international scrutiny during the fourth Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Working Group session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, taking place from January 22 to February 2.
This review is a unique opportunity for member states to hold China accountable for its human rights obligations, according to analysts and rights advocates.
The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a peer-review process under the auspices of the UN Human Rights Council, where UN Member States assess each other's human rights records, their fulfilment of human rights obligations and commitments, and provide recommendations to the State under review.
This is China's fourth appearance before this mechanism. The last one was in November 2018. At the time, countries called out the existence of mass detention camps for Uyghurs a few months after they were revealed by a UN committee.
During China's 3rd UPR in November 2018, China received 346 recommendations from 150 countries, and accepted 284 of them, with many questionably noted as 'accepted and already implemented.'Despite a seemingly high acceptance rate, China broadly rejected recommendations on the rights of Uyghurs and Tibetans, cooperation with the UN and unrestricted UN access to all regions of the country, enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention, the death penalty and the ratification of international treaties.
Since 2018, mounting human rights abuses have been largely documented by a range of UN human rights bodies.
After the narrow defeat of a resolution calling for a debate on the situation in Xinjiang at the Human Rights Council, in September 2022, the UPR is one of the few spaces left where China's record can be openly discussed, challenged and scrutinised on the basis of UN information.
This is also the first UPR session since the publication in 2022 of the UN 'Xinjiang Report', which found that Beijing's actions against Uyghurs and other minorities could amount to 'crimes against humanity', and which Chinese diplomacy has worked hard to suppress.
In the absence of a UN Human Rights Council debate on the human rights situation in China, the UPR is a rare moment of global scrutiny of the country's human rights crisis.
After the review, the government will review the recommendations it received, and decide which ones it commits to implement or not. During the June 2024 session of the Human Rights Council, China will have the opportunity to provide further information, and a limited number of governments and NGOs will be able to make comments. The Council will then adopt China's UPR report.
The Chinese government is expected to implement accepted recommendations until its next UPR in 2029. The government is also encouraged by the UN to report on the status of implementation halfway through, by publishing a 'mid-term report'; yet, China has never done it for past reviews. (ANI)"

The meeting held on Thursday discussed the demands of the delegation, which according to the members would help them to lead a respectable life.
The Chief Minister upon receiving the demands said that a mechanism of rehabilitation would be formulated for expeditiously meeting their demands.
He said that the government will proactively address all the issues to ensure that the ex-cadres and their family members can lead a decent life.
Chief Minister Sarma also said that he will work with all for the expeditious implementation of Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) that was signed in a tripartite agreement between Central government, State government and the pro-talks faction of ULFA on 29 December in the national capital.
The delegation was led by its president Rajib Rajkowar and general secretary Golap Barua.
DGP GP Singh, Additional Chief Secretary Home and Political Avinash Puroshattam Das Joshi, ADGP Hiren Nath and other senior officers of Home department were present at the meeting.
The pact signed in December was significant as the banned ULFA-Independent is the only major insurgent outfit in the state after the ULFA pro-talks faction signed the agreement with the Centre and Assam government.
The separatist ULFA was formed in April 1979 in the aftermath of an agitation against undocumented immigrants from Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan).
It split into two groups in February 2011 with the Arabinda Rajkhowa-led faction giving up violence and agreeing to unconditional talks with the government. Paresh Baruah, who leads the other rebranded ULFA-Independent faction, is against the talks.
A series of talks with officials concerned in the Central government has taken place since the delegation arrived in Delhi for signing the settlement pact.
The Union government has signed peace deals with rebel Bodo, Dimasa, Karbi, and Adivasi outfits in Assam over the last three years, bringing an end to the decades-long instability. (ANI)"

Imran Khan, who is presently in the Adiala Jail, said that if the election campaigns did not begin soon, the tickets would be replaced with others.
He made these comments while talking to the media informally in the Adiala jail courtroom.
The party's founder was jailed in May last year, and its electoral 'bat' symbol, a major voter driving force was taken away this month. Furthermore, the party, PTI-Nazriati, with which it sought an alliance also backtracked from its commitment.
However, the PTI has vowed not to boycott the polls and run without its iconic electoral symbol. Since the 'bat' symbol has been taken away, all its candidates will be running with different signs.
Geo News reported that Khan further said that the former ambassador of Pakistan to the United States and a witness in the cypher case, Asad Majeed, had recommended sending a demarche to an official meeting after the diplomatic cable was received.
""Shah Mahmood Qureshi found the cypher by chance. It was for General (retd.) Bajwa. Every effort was made to suppress the cypher. My government was overthrown three weeks after it. If there was no such thing in the cypher, why was the demarche sent? Does anyone send it to America?"" he added.
He claimed that in October 2021, General (retd.) Bajwa had hired Husain Haqqani, former Pakistan's ambassador to the US, without his knowledge. He alleged, ""Haqqani was given USD 35,000. He tweeted that Imran is against America while Bajwa is in its favour.""The former premier said his party members were not being allowed to hold election campaigns. ""Elections should be held on February 8 anyway,"" he added, Geo News reported.
Meanwhile, PTI senior leader Qureshi said that he wanted to thank senior politician Javed Hashmi for speaking the truth.
Hashmi announced stepping out of the election race and withdrawing in favour of PTI-backed Aamir Dogar, who will contest the February 8 polls from the NA-149 constituency.
""I am throwing my political weight behind the Tehreek-e-Insaf and Imran Khan and withdrawing from the elections,"" Hashmi, who has been a part of the PTI and its arch-rival Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.
Qureshi said that the cypher was only for the secretary to see, and the National Security Committee (NSC) accepted political interference. (ANI)"

The group included three children and an adult who were found unconscious and had to be taken to hospital where they were treated for dehydration and hypothermia, the Cypriot authorities said.
All other people on board, including three who had leg fractures, were also taken to hospital in a massive operation that lasted from early morning until the afternoon.
The JRCC sent out patrol boats and helicopters after a merchant ship reported spotting a crammed wooden boat at 4:30 a.m. (local time), some 30 nautical miles (55.6 km) off the southeastern coast of Cyprus.
Cypriot authorities said that according to information obtained from some of the migrants, the boat had been at sea for seven days.
The incident ""is proof of what we have repeatedly said about the dangers faced by people falling victim to human traffickers,"" Cyprus' Interior Minister Constantinos Ioannou said in a written statement.
He also said he will raise the issue on Thursday at an informal meeting of European Union (EU) interior ministers in Brussels.

Household net disposable income increased 0.5 percent to 59.2 billion NZ dollars (36.17 billion dollars) in the September quarter, while household spending increased 0.5 percent to 58.3 billion NZ dollars (35.62 billion dollars), statistics showed.
The increase in household spending was driven by price increases, as the volume of goods and services consumed by households fell 0.6 percent in the September quarter, according to Stats NZ.
The household saving ratio, which compares household saving to net disposable income, remained at 1.4 percent in the September quarter.
Household net worth increased 0.2 percent, or 5.3 billion NZ dollars (3.24 billion dollars), in the September quarter following a period of decline from the March 2022 quarter, according to Stats NZ.
""The September 2023 quarter increase in household net worth reflects a rise in property values for both homeowners and landlords,"" Ratnayake said, adding the result compares to an average quarterly decline in household net worth of 1.4 percent over the previous six quarters."
DSCJIXTG81_8QZ3TVZHLUUQLN4,Israel proposes new hostage deal to Hamas Axios,"RT.com 23rd January 2024, 11:13 GMT+11","RT.com 23rd January 2024, 11:13 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103381/israel-proposes-new-hostage-deal-to-hamas-axios,"The militants were reportedly offered to gradually release the captives in exchange for a two-month ceasefire
The Israeli government has offered Hamas a ""pause"" in the fighting of up to 60 days so all the remaining captives could be released, Axios reported on Monday, citing two unnamed officials.
Hamas seized around 240 Israelis during its October 7 raid from Gaza. While some have been released during the week-long ""humanitarian pause"" at the end of November, Israel estimates that 130 are still being held in the Palestinian enclave.
According to two Israeli officials who spoke to Axios reporter Barak Ravid, the War Cabinet approved the parameters of the proposal ""ten days ago"" and sent it to Hamas via Qatar and Egypt. Israel is now waiting for the militant group's response and is reportedly ""cautiously optimistic"" about it.
US envoy Brett McGurk was in Egypt on Sunday and is supposed to proceed to Qatar, for talks aimed at negotiating the release of captives held by Hamas.
Under the terms of the Israeli proposal, the first phase would see Hamas releasing women, men over 60, and hostages who are in critical medical condition, Axios wrote. The second phase would involve releasing female soldiers, male civilians under 60, male soldiers, and finally the bodies of hostages that have been killed.
Israel is prepared to stop operations for ""up to two months,"" the longest truce it has offered since PM Benjamin Netanyahu declared war on Hamas. However, the government is not prepared to end the war or release all 6,000 Palestinian prisoners, according to Axios. Hamas and Israel would have to agree in advance how many Palestinian prisoners would be released for each Israeli in every category, and negotiate on their names separately.
The proposal also includes a ""redeployment"" of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from parts of Gaza and allowing a ""gradual return"" of Palestinians to Gaza City. If Hamas accepts the deal, IDF operations in Gaza will continue after 60 days but would be ""significantly smaller in scope and intensity,"" the officials who spoke to Axios have said.
Israel has estimated Hamas casualties at 10,000 killed and 16,000 wounded, while the recently published US estimates were somewhat lower. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has said over 25,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict, two thirds of them women and children. Citing the high rate of reported civilian casualties, South Africa recently filed a genocide case against Israel before the International Court of Justice. The IDF denies indiscriminately targeting civilians and accuses Hamas of using locals as human shields.

Ltd. to monitor and promptly suspend or remove hate speech and harmful content that originates in India from its platform and is directed towards the Rohingya community, both in India and elsewhere.
The plea stated that the presence of Rohingya refugees in India is a highly politicized matter, and as such they are disproportionately targeted with harmful content on Facebook painting the group as a threat to India, often referring to the group as ""terrorists"", ""infiltrators"" and exaggerating the numbers of Rohingya that have fled to India.
The plea has been moved through Advocate Kawalpreet Kaur stated that the Rohingyas in India live in squalid camps without access to schools, medical facilities, or regular work. There is neither potable water nor a constant supply of water.
The plots do not have any proper washrooms for defecation. The Rohingyas do are living under the construction of bamboo and tarpaulin.
Besides this, the Rohingyas are under constant threat sometimes physical threats where their slums are set on fire and they become subject to physical violence, plea stated.
Therefore, this type of harmful content, painting the Rohingya as a threat that needs to be removed from India, is strikingly similar to the type of content that proliferated on Facebook prior to the 2017 clearance operations against the Rohingya causing grave concerns for the safety of Rohingyas in India.
In fact, after this false political propaganda was disseminated there were numerous attacks on Rohingyas in different parts of India. Rohingya slum settlements were burnt in many places and the Rohingyas were rendered destitute, stated the plea.
The stateless Muslim Rohingya minority, having fled ethnic cleansing operations in Myanmar in 2017, is particularly vulnerable in India and Bangladesh. Bangladesh currently hosts 1 million Rohingya refugees in congested refugee camps located in Cox's Bazar on the border with Myanmar.
The UNHCR reported that India was sheltering approximately 74,600 Rohingya refugees. The ""Rohingya issue"" is frequently used as a political tool in both countries and as a result, is subject to large amounts of harmful content on Facebook, the plea read. (ANI)"

To mark the sacred celebrations, Shilpa visited Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai and sought blessings.
In the visuals captured by the shutterbugs in Mumbai, Shilpa can be seen chanting Jai Shree Ram. She also waved a saffron flag with Lord Ram's image on it.
She looked exquisite in a vibrant orange saree that she paired with a golden blouse.
Notably, on Monday, the grand Ram Temple in Ayodhya was inaugurated, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending the rituals.
PM Modi also showered petals on workers, who were a part of the construction team that shaped the grand Ramn Temple.He was also seen sprinkling flowers on the idol of Jatayu at the Ram Temple premises and also offered prayers to Lord Shiva in Ayodhya Dham.
While addressing the dignitaries invited to the Pran Pratishtha ceremony, PM Modi said the unveiling of the Ram Lalla idol is not only a moment of triumph after a prolonged struggle but also one of humility.""This is not just a moment of celebration for us all but also one to reflect the coming of age of the Indian society. This occasion is as much about triumph as it is about humility. The world is replete with instances of countries that faced a lot of difficulties resolving historic wrongs and injustices. However, the way we untied the knots and resolved all outstanding issues gives us hope that our future is going to be more beautiful and fulfilling than our past,"" PM Modi said.
The PM said that the construction of the temple, which some feared would set off a firestorm, now stands as a symbol of peace, patience, harmony and integration.""There was also a time when some people used to say 'Ram Mandir bana toh aag lag jaegi' (the making of the Ram Temple would set off a firestorm). Such people lacked an understanding of the purity of our society, the spirit that binds us all. This majestic abode of Shri Ram Lalla will now stand as a symbol of peace, patience, mutual harmony and social unity. The construction of this temple did not set off a fire but exuded a positive energy that has been infectious for us all,"" he added.
He added that the Ayodhya temple also testifies to a renewed national consciousness of Lord Ram and his place in our everyday lives. The Ram Lalla idol was unveiled during the grand 'Pran Pratishtha', which involved hour-long rituals led by Prime Minister Modi. (ANI)"

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The coalition forces of the United States and Britain launched new strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen on Monday, multiple U.S. media reported.
News of the latest strikes, which marked the eighth round of military action by the United States against the Houthis since Jan. 12, were reported by U.S. outlets, citing U.S. defense officials.
Neither the Pentagon nor the White House has publicly confirmed the strikes at the time this story is released.
CNN reported earlier that the United States named the strikes ""Operation Poseidon Archer,"" suggesting that they might become ""more organized"" and last for a longer period of time.
Earlier in the day, U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak over phone.
According to a readout of the call by the White House, the two leaders discussed Houthi attacks against merchant and naval vessels transiting the Red Sea.

Trump, during his speech, said that the former South Carolina governor did very poorly.
""She did very poorly, actually,"" he said. ""The governor said she's going to win, she's going to win, she's going to win. Then she failed badly.""In a speech to supporters in the Granite State, he pointed out Haley's performance in last week Iowa's caucuses, where she came in third behind the former president and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has since dropped out of the race, according to CNN.
Boasting his victory, Trump said, ""We win it every time. We win the primary. We win the generals.""Furthermore, he also railed against Nikki Haley in social media posts, boosting pressure on his rival to drop out of the Republican presidential primary.
However, Haley congratulated Trump after his projected win, and earlier during an election night speech, she vowed to stay in the race regardless of New Hampshire results.
Some of the comments made by Trump on his 'Truth' social media platform included, ""Haley said she had to WIN in New Hampshire. SHE DIDN'T!!!"" one post read.
In another post, Trump called her ""delusional,"" moments after Haley began her remarks, according to CNN.
The third post read, ""SHE CAME IN THIRD LAST WEEK!"" However, Haley has not said that she needed to win New Hampshire in order to continue her presidential campaign but instead argued that she needed to perform better than she did in the Iowa caucuses, where she finished a distant third behind Trump.
Meanwhile, the Trump campaign sent a fundraising text to supporters on Tuesday, declaring ""THIS RACE IS OVER!"" shortly after he was projected to win the New Hampshire primary.
Moreover, Nikki Haley's allies are casting Donald Trump's attacks on her in his speech tonight as bolstering her case and likely to generate more support for her decision to stay in the nomination fight.
However, a Haley aide called Trump's speech ""weird, nasty and angry,"" and an outside ally called it ""a huge gift to us.""Reportedly, Trump started her victory speech by venting his anger at Haley. ""She's doing a speech like she won. She didn't win. She lost,"" he said.
Earlier today, Haley said that the GOP contest was ""far from over"" with many states left to vote, as she looked forward to her home state of South Carolina, which hosts its Republican primary on February 24, according to CNN.
Moreover, Nikki Haley stressed that Trump will have ""a harder time"" in the Republican primary in her home state of South Carolina next month after the former president was projected to win Tuesday's contest in New Hampshire.
""South Carolina voters don't want a coronation. They want an election, and we're going to give them one because we are just getting started,"" Haley, a former Palmetto State governor, said. (ANI)"

In an interview with Zonglan news, a state-backed media outlet from Hebei province, a teacher at Yingcai School in rural Fangcheng district, central Henan, said that all the dead were grade three students.
China's state broadcaster CCTV said that one person rescued from the scene was being treated in the hospital.
The school had metal grilles covering its windows, which is typical for buildings in China.
Xinhua said that the dormitory room housed some 30 students, and the remaining 16 students were safely evacuated.
The fire began on the evening of January 19 and was put out just before midnight.
CCTV reported that the school's owner was detained, and state media stated that public records showed the owner is a man named Li Jizhong.
Local authorities said they were investigating the cause of the fire.
China's central Emergency Management Ministry also dispatched a team to the scene to investigate.
Fire safety remains a concern across China. In April 2023, a fire in a hospital in Beijing killed 29 people."

The latest sign of de-escalation comes almost a week after Iran struck alleged terror targets inside Pakistan and Islamabad responded with counterstrikes against purported terror hideouts across the border. The strikes killed at least 11 civilians, 9 in Iran and 2 in Pakistan.
Amid unprecedented tensions Islamabad recalled its ambassador from Tehran last Wednesday and told the Iranian envoy, who was on a trip to his home country, to not return. Islamabad also suspended all high-level visits between the two countries.
Monday's press release, issued jointly by the foreign ministries of both the countries, said Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian will visit Pakistan on January 29 at his Pakistani counterpart Jalil Abbas Jilani's invitation.
In a phone call Friday, the top diplomats of both countries agreed to defuse tensions and reestablish full diplomatic ties.
Analysts VOA spoke to say that while smoothing over ruffled ties is necessary and welcome, Iran's unprovoked attack on Pakistan may have opened a Pandora's box in the region.
Messaging tool
Iran has said it was targeting Sunni separatist group Jaish al-Adl's hideouts on Pakistani soil.
Anti-state insurgents targeting Pakistan and Iran have been active along the 900-kilometer border between the two countries for years. They frequently mount deadly attacks against security forces.
The terrorist threat in the region has also expanded with hardline Sunni terrorist group Islamic State or IS targeting Shiite Muslims in both countries. The group claimed responsibility for twin blasts at an event near the tomb of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps General Qassem Soleimani on January 3. The blasts in southeastern Iranian city of Kerman killed more than 100 people.
While Pakistan acknowledges the IS presence in the country, the group has a bigger, highly organized structure in Afghanistan.
Washington-based security affairs expert Kamran Bokhari told VOA Iran's strikes were not necessarily a response to rising terrorism but meant to send a message to Washington in the context of the bloody Israel-Hamas war that has killed thousands in Gaza.
Since the war started last October, Washington has targeted Iranian proxies in the Middle East and the Red Sea while Tehran has struck U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria several times.
""They [militant hideouts in Pakistan] provided an excuse for Iran to do something different, which is basically to telegraph to the United States that look, we know that you are talking about a direct confrontation with us.... But, if you do that, then we have the capability to further expand this war,"" said Bokhari who serves as a senior director of Eurasian security and prosperity at the Newlines Institute.
Bokhari believes Tehran picked Pakistan, as it's a U.S. ally but mired in economic, political and security crises, and therefore, less likely to engage in a massive confrontation.
Pakistan's counterstrike marked the first time Iran faced a direct attack since the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988.
While the Biden administration condemned the Iranian action, Bokhari thinks those in Washington who favor a direct confrontation with Tehran may say, ""We've never struck on Iranian soil. Now that the Pakistanis have done it, it sets a precedent.""
Islamabad-based security affairs expert Syed Muhammad Ali told VOA that while Pakistan and Iran managed to de-escalate quickly, any other country contemplating to attack Iran should not expect the same outcome.
""Even if it gives some ideas to some other countries, I think, they will have to factor in Iranian possible response options based on their own bilateral history and geostrategic convergences or divergences,"" Ali said.
Pressure tool
While Tehran and Islamabad work to normalize ties, some are concerned sectarian groups may be exploited as a pressure tool.
Pakistan has a history of sectarian violence as Saudi-funded Sunni and Iran-funded Shiite armed groups came head-to-head in the 90s. Targeted killings on sectarian basis still occur.
On Sunday Pakistani officials claimed apprehending a ""terrorist trained by a foreign country."" Authorities said he was getting support from a ""neighboring country"" and linked him to Zainabiyoun Brigade, an Iranian-backed militia.
""Pakistan is, both, being cautious not naming Iran, but also talking about perpetrators that may be linked with Iran,"" said Ayesha Siddiqa, a military affairs expert and senior fellow at King's College London.
Siddiqa said Pakistan and Iran have no choice but to continue to de-escalate tensions to avoid possible sectarian strife.
Shrinking space for militants
On Monday Pakistan armed forces' media wing announced the military killed seven ""terrorists"" in an operation near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Baluchistan. The statement did not specify which outfit the slain militants were from.
In Pakistan's counterstrike across the Iranian border, Islamabad claimed killing Baloch insurgents.
Ali told VOA he believes the space for anti-state actors that target Iran and Pakistan might shrink after last week's events.
However, he said military operations are only a part of Pakistan's multi-layered counterinsurgency strategy - that also relies on other incentives to encourage separatists to lay down arms."

""Good to see we have allies in the struggle against locusts in Afghanistan; thanks to the support of @IndianEmbKabul,"" the Food and Agriculture Organization of UN in Afghanistan stated on X.
The 40,000 litres of malathion pesticide were supplied in two trucks and officially handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock of the Taliban-controlled Afghanistan government.
Malathion, known for its efficacy in arid regions and minimal water usage, is considered a crucial tool in locust control. The aid not only addresses the immediate threat in Afghanistan but also serves to prevent the spread of locusts to neighbouring Central Asian countries.
Earlier, the Taliban-controlled Ministry of Agriculture also expressed gratitude for this assistance made through the Chabahar port.
The assistance not only helps in preventing locusts in Afghanistan, but also prevents locusts from Central Asian countries, especially Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, and is effective on crops in the region.
Locusts are voracious in nature and are known for their vegetation-destroying abilities and their large-scale presence may potentially threaten food security.
The locust menace was at its worst in neighbouring Pakistan in early 2020, when the country declared a national emergency.
At the same time, India too witnessed a large-scale locust incursion in several states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, some parts of Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra. (ANI)"

'We have more than half a million people in Gaza facing catastrophic food insecurity levels. The risk of famine increases each day as the conflict limits the delivery of life-saving aid to people in need,' said Abeer Etefa, World Food Program senior communications officer and spokesperson for the Middle East and North Africa.
Speaking to journalists in Geneva on Tuesday from Cairo, Etefa said WFP has procured 21,000 tons of food supplies from across the region - enough for around 2 million people inside Gaza for one month.
'The problem is that all the food is on the border outside in Egypt, but not yet inside Gaza.'
FILE - Palestinians line up for a free meal in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Dec. 21, 2023.
Once this issue is resolved, she said, 'The biggest challenge is how to move supplies inside Gaza to get it to areas that are out of reach.' She said access and distributions were only possible in the south of Gaza, not in the north.
For the first time in six weeks, since a humanitarian pause allowed aid to get into Gaza, she said WFP recently was able to deliver 200 metric tons of food supplies for around 15,000 people in Gaza City.
Unfortunately, she said, 'All areas north of Wadi Gaza [wetlands] have been extremely difficult to reach because of the restricted access to the area.'
Israel has repeatedly said that humanitarian aid is entering Gaza but is being stolen by Hamas or is not being efficiently distributed. Israeli government spokesman Elon Levy said Tuesday there were 'no limitations on the admission of humanitarian aid.'
'International actors interested in seeing more aid in Gaza should send more,' he said. 'We still have a problem that U.N. agencies are unable to distribute the aid as quickly as Israel is processing it.'
Etefa maintained that the threat of famine is a big fear, noting that a report by the Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification has found devastating levels of food insecurity in Gaza.
'All the 2 million people in Gaza are in crisis ... and almost a fourth of these people, or more than half a million people, are in the worst stage of hunger, which is IPC five, which means that people are starving.'
FILE - Trucks carrying aid arrive, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, Jan. 17, 2024.
She said virtually all Palestinians in Gaza are skipping meals every day while many adults go hungry so children can eat.
'We are seeing a very worrisome situation in terms of children's malnutrition. Of course, the shortage of water is making things worse because children get weaker with diarrhea. Pregnant women are not getting enough to eat, and this will impact the health of their babies when they are born,' she said.
She noted that the shortage of food, clean water, and medical assistance is particularly severe in the northern areas, a situation confirmed by humanitarian workers in the area.
After several days of aborted missions, the World Health Organization reports that a convoy of much needed humanitarian supplies managed to enter northern Gaza on Monday.
WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said one of the convoys, mainly carrying fuel, was prevented from reaching Al-Shifa hospital by a desperate mob of hungry people.
'The people were holding it up as multiple times it was trying to move forward and trying to leave and trying to get onto the road because they were so desperate looking for food,' he said.
'The team on the ground had to convince them that there was only fuel. They had to show them that there was nothing to eat for them, nor food for anyone else.'
FILE - Displaced Palestinians gather in the yard of Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital, Dec. 10, 2023.
He said the desperation seen on the ground also is apparent inside the hospital.
'We had grave reports of people who as they were waiting for surgeries were begging for water, begging for food,' he said.
WFP spokeswoman Etefa said Gaza has 'the largest concentration of people in what looks like famine-like conditions anywhere in the world,' adding that it was alarming to see how quickly this has happened.
She said, 'What is so concerning is to see how many months of conflict, of chaos' it has taken other countries 'to get to this point.'
She said places like Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, or Sudan have gone through years of conflict before reaching the high level of hunger that Gaza has reached in fewer than 100 days.
'The risks and stakes are very high,' she said. 'This is probably one of the conflicts that has the fastest deterioration rates in terms of food security.'"

""This is not just a moment of celebration for us all but also one to reflect the coming of age of the Indian society. This occasion is as much about triumph as it is about humility. The world is replete with instances of countries that faced a lot of difficulties resolving historic wrongs and injustices. However, the way we untied the knots and resolved all outstanding issues gives us hope that our future is going to be more beautiful and fulfilling than our past,"" PM Modi said.

""There was also a time when some people used to say 'Ram Mandir bana toh aag lag jaegi' (the making of the Ram Temple would set off a firestorm). Such people lacked an understanding of the purity of our society, the spirit that binds us all.

PM Modi led rituals at the Pran Pratishtha ceremony in the sanctum sanctorum of the grand temple.
The ceremony is being held in an atmosphere of a deep sense of devotion.
Indian Air Force (IAF) choppers showered flower petals over Shri Ram Janmaboomi Temple premises in Ayodhya as the idol of Ram Lalla was unveiled.
Devotees and guests chanted 'Jai Sri Ram' as the ceremony was held.
RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat, Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath are present at the ceremony.
Over 8,000 guests have been invited for the ceremony at the grand temple.
The historic Pran Pratishtha ceremony is being attended by representatives of all major spiritual and religious sects of the country. People from all walks of life including representatives of various tribal communities will also attend the ceremony. Prime Minister will address this distinguished gathering on the occasion.
Prime Minister will interact with shramjeevis associated with the construction of Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir. He will also visit the Kuber Tila, where the ancient Mandir of Bhagwan Shiv has been restored.
The magnificent Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir is constructed in traditional Nagara style. Its length (east-west) is 380 feet; width 250 feet and height is 161 feet; and is supported by a total of 392 pillars and 44 doors. The pillars and walls of the temple showcase intricately sculpted depictions of Hindu deities, gods, and goddesses. In the main sanctum sanctorum at ground floor, the childhood form of Bhagwan Shri Ram (the idol of Shri Ramlalla) has been placed.
The main entrance to the Mandir is situated on the eastern side, which can be approached by ascending 32 stairs through the Singh Dwar. There are a total of five Mandaps (Halls) in the Mandir - Nritya Mandap, Rang Mandap, Sabha Mandap, Prathana Mandap and Kirtan Mandap. Near the Mandir is a historic Well (Sita koop), dating back to the ancient era. In the southwestern part of the Mandir complex, at Kuber Tila, the ancient Mandir of Bhagwan Shiv has been restored, along with the installation of a statue of Jatayu.
The foundation of the Mandir has been constructed with a 14-meter- thick layer of roller-compacted concrete (RCC), giving it the appearance of artificial rock. No iron is used anywhere in the Mandir.

Recent statements made by Washington suggest that the US regards Ukraine as nothing but a ""lucrative business project,"" one that it is profiting from, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the UN Security Council on Monday.
The minister was referring to some earlier statements made by US State Secretary Antony Blinken. Last month, the top diplomat claimed that 90% of the money allocated for Ukrainian aid ends up getting funneled back to the US ""to the benefit of American business, local communities, and strengthening the US defense industrial base.""
In November 2023, the Washington Post also reported that the majority of these funds were spent on manufacturing new weapons or replacing the equipment sent to Ukraine out of American stockpiles.
The US is essentially ""developing its military industrial"" complex while ""dumping the old junk in Ukraine,"" Lavrov said. Russia's top diplomat also claimed that most major Ukrainian companies, including lithium producers, are being sold to Americans and US companies have been able to get their hands on Ukraine's fertile lands ""on the cheap.""
Lavrov denounced the statements made by US officials as ""cynical"" and said that Washington has been treating the ongoing conflict ""not as a war that has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives ... but as a profitable business project.""
Moscow is waging a military campaign not against Ukraine but against ""a criminal regime, presumptuous in its impunity,"" he declared. Kiev has not forgone on the ""war against its own citizens in the east and south"" despite years-long efforts by Moscow to find a peaceful solution to this crisis, he explained, adding that over 7 million Ukrainians had found refuge in Russia since the 2014 Maidan coup.
Kiev's Western backers have never tried to stop the government from persecuting Russian-speaking Ukrainians, the minister said, accusing the US and its allies of using the past few years to ""arm Ukraine and prepare it for war against Russia,"" while using the Minsk Agreements as a cover.
Russia is ready for talks on Ukraine but it is not willing to discuss ways to keep Kiev's current government in power, Moscow's top diplomat concluded.

""Amit Shah is likely to meet Bihar BJP chief Samrat Chaudhary and Sushil Modi,"" a source said.
Further, according to sources, former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Renu Devi has also arrived in Delhi and could likely join the discussions with the top BJP leadership.
The talks come amid a war of words between the BJP and the ruling JDU, RJD and Congress combine in Bihar over the Centre's decision to posthumously confer the country's highest civilian honour, Bharat Ratna, on former chief minister and champion of social justice, Karpoori Thakur.
The JDU, while hailing the Centre's decision, claimed that CM Nitish Kumar had long been demanding the country's highest honour for Thakur. The RJD, meanwhile, took a swipe at the BJP claiming that the decision to bestow the country's highest recognition on the two-time Bihar CM was taken with an eye on the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.
However, the BJP asserted that it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who decided to bestow the deserving honour on the late crusader for social justice.
Weighing in on the Centre's decision, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said at a rally, ""These days, many people are more focussed on promoting their own family in politics, but Karpoori-ji never did that in his lifetime.""Responding to the CM's dig at dynastic politics without taking any names, RJD leader Shakti Yadav said his remarks were likely meant for BJP leaders.
""Nitish Kumar's statement on dynastic politics was likely aimed at BJP leaders. Pankaj Singh, the son of Rajnath Singh, and Anurag Thakur (son of former Himachal CM and BJP leader Prem Kumar Dhumal) are all in active politics and hold important offices. Hence, the remarks might well have been directed at them. In a democracy, the people decide their representatives. The father doesn't decide if his son will rule. I think this is what Nitish-ji was hinting at,"" the RJD leader said.
Karpoori Thakur was a socialist leader and freedom fighter, who was twice chief minister of Bihar and prior to that, the state's education minister and deputy chief minister.
Embarking on his political career with the Praja Socialist Party, he later joined forces with the Janata Party during his initial tenure as the chief minister of Bihar from 1977 to 1979.
Over time, he established connections with the Janata Dal, marking a significant shift in his political affiliation. (ANI)"

We have the opportunity to talk about Ram after 500 years. We should only talk about him and not about Ravan.""Earlier, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said that his party is not scared of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, adding that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is daydreaming if they think that the grand old party is scared of the BJP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).
Meanwhile, the Pran Pratishtha ceremony, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for the new idol of Lord Ram was completed in Ayodhya today.
The Prime Minister, while attending the grand event in the temple town of Uttar Pradesh, said that the moment of the unveiling of the Ram Lalla idol is an occasion not merely of triumph but of humility too.
""This is a moment of celebration as well as a reflection of Indian society's maturity. It is an occasion of not merely triumph but humility too. The history of the world is itself proof that many countries get strangled in their own history and such countries faced difficulties when they tried to solve their problems, but the way our country untied the knots of history is proof that our future is going to be more beautiful than our past,"" he said.

Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, confirmed that the United Nations has received communications from the Houthis, which gave the world body one month for all U.S. and British nationals to leave the areas under the control of the de facto authorities.
""What needs to be said is that any request or requirement for UN staff to leave based solely on the nationality of that staff is inconsistent with the legal framework applicable to the UN,"" said Dujarric. ""It also, of course, impedes our ability to deliver on the mandate to support all of the people in Yemen. And we call on all the authorities in Yemen to ensure that our staff can continue to perform their functions on behalf of the UN.""
He said UN staff serve impartially and serve the flag of the United Nations and none other.
The spokesman refused to say how many U.S. and British nationals are working for the United Nations in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.
""I can find out the number of international staff. We do not give breakdowns of our staff's own nationality,"" said Dujarric.
The order of the Houthi militia came amid rising tensions between the U.S. and British forces stationed in the Red Sea and the Houthis who have been attacking ""Israeli-linked ships"" in the region since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict on Oct. 7, 2023.
The U.S.-Britain maritime coalition in the Red Sea has carried out multiple airstrikes on Houthi camps in various northern provinces of Yemen. It said these actions are aimed at preventing further Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea shipping lane.
The Houthi group vowed to continue targeting ships linked to Israel in the Red Sea until Israel ends its attacks and blockade on the Gaza Strip."

It is increasingly becoming a significant cause of premature death and disability in countries like India. This rise is primarily driven by demographic changes and exacerbated by the growing prevalence of key modifiable risk factors. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel, responsible for carrying oxygen and nutrients to the brain, is either blocked by a clot or ruptures.The Department of Neuroscience at Jehangir Hospital offers efficient, round-the-clock services and is renowned for its exceptional care during the critical ""Golden Hour"" for stroke patients. This initial 4.5-hour period is considered the most crucial because, following the artery blockage, approximately 2 million neurons are lost every minute.

PNNPune (Maharashtra) [India], January 24: Stroke is a disease that affects the arteries leading to and within the brain. It is increasingly becoming a significant cause of premature death and disability in countries like India. This rise is primarily driven by demographic changes and exacerbated by the growing prevalence of key modifiable risk factors. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel, responsible for carrying oxygen and nutrients to the brain, is either blocked by a clot or ruptures.The Department of Neuroscience at Jehangir Hospital offers efficient, round-the-clock services and is renowned for its exceptional care during the critical ""Golden Hour"" for stroke patients. This initial 4.5-hour period is considered the most crucial because, following the artery blockage, approximately 2 million neurons are lost every minute. Patients who receive clot-dissolving injections within this timeframe have a significantly higher chance of survival and are more likely to avoid long-term brain damage. In the case of acute ischemic stroke, the ""door-to-needle"" time is set at 60 minutes or less after the patient's arrival at the hospital, ensuring swift and effective treatment.""Our team of skilled neurosurgeons is equipped with vast experience and knowledge to offer the best possible care to patients through techniques ranging from open surgeries to minimally invasive treatments,"" says Dr. Prashant Khandelwal, Neurosurgeon at Jehangir Hospital.Code Stroke ProgrammeA ""Code Stroke"" is activated through the public announcement system, and this alert summons the stroke team, including the emergency physician, emergency department nurse, intensivist, neurologist, radiologist, interventional neurologist, and on-call neurosurgeon.

The soldier, who had been on duty guarding his unit, entered the barracks' dormitory, where his comrades were resting, and opened fire on them, said Amir Gholamalian, commander of the Iranian army's southeast headquarters.
The incident took place in Baghin city in the southeastern Iranian province of Kerman at 16:35 local time (1305 GMT), said the commander, noting that interrogations were underway to determine the motive.
According to the semi-official Fars news agency, the shooter was arrested on Monday morning in Zarand County in the same province while he was carrying six magazines, 180 bullets, and two Kalashnikov rifles.
The 20-year-old individual had stolen two vehicles while attempting to flee, it said."

Belgium is reportedly set to become the first EU nation to use Russia's money to provide assistance to Ukraine. Brussels plans to spend the interest earned on frozen Russian assets on military aid for Kiev worth $666 million, Belga News Agency reported on Tuesday, citing the Belgian defense minister's office.
Defense Minister Ludivine Dedonder had a phone call with her Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov, on Monday. ""Belgium will provide â¬611 million ($666 million) in military aid this year and has a long-term commitment to supporting the modernization of our defense forces,"" Umerov said on X (formerly Twitter) following the conversation. Dedonder reposted the message.
The Belgian minister's office then confirmed to Belga on Tuesday that the phone call had taken place, adding that the money for the promised aid would come from interest generated by frozen Russian assets stored in Belgium. The defense ministry did not issue any separate statement on the issue.
A total of $300 billion worth of Russian forex reserves have been frozen by G7 countries, the EU, and Australia since the start of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022. Most of those reserves ($232 billion) are reportedly held in the EU, with $208 billion located in Belgium.
According to Belga, the vast majority of frozen Russian reserves are held by the Belgium-based Euroclear financial company, which continues to make ""record profits.""
The US and its allies in Europe and elsewhere have so far been reluctant to consider confiscating frozen Russian assets, despite otherwise slapping Russia with unprecedented sanctions over its ongoing military campaign. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency reported this week that the West could stand to lose almost just as much money as it would seize from Russia if it proceeds with its confiscation plan.
Calls for the seizure of assets have grown louder in recent months, according to the media. In December, the Financial Times reported that Washington had proposed that working groups from the G7 explore ways to confiscate the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets on February 24, 2024. Bloomberg also reported that the idea had received support from the White House.
On Tuesday, Reuters reported that EU member states had so far failed to reach an agreement on the risky move, and such a possibility remained ""unlikely."" Last month, Brussels proposed seizing interest generated by the frozen Russian funds instead while leaving the principal intact.

Liuzhou exported more than 3,167 tonnes of Luosifen, with a total value of 87.27 million yuan (about 12.16 million U.S. dollars) in 2023, up 19.4 percent and 28.5 percent year on year, respectively, according to Liuzhou Customs.
Liuzhou, an industrial city best known for steel and automobile manufacturing, has been promoting Luosifen for years.
In recent times, the local customs department has enhanced source management and strengthened research on the legal standards and technical trade barriers which apply in importing countries to help enterprises actively explore international markets, said Wu Chunlan, an official of Liuzhou Customs.
Guangxi Luobawang Brand Management Co., Ltd. is one of the main exporters of these pungent-smelling rice noodles. Since Jan. 1, the value of the company's noodle exports has reached nearly 1 million U.S. dollars, and the noodles have been sold primarily to regions such as North America, Oceania, and Europe.
""Luosifen noodles are gaining more recognition among overseas consumers,"" said Ou Haoxuan, general manager of the overseas business department of the company.
Last year, the total number of enterprises in Liuzhou with Luosifen export qualifications grew to 59.
Luosifen, or river snail rice noodles, is a signature street food in Liuzhou. It features rice vermicelli soaked in a spicy broth flavored by river snails and is topped with ingredients such as pickled bamboo shoots, string beans, peanuts and fried tofu skin.
This specialty, which is on the national intangible cultural heritage list, has become one of China's most sought-after dishes since it was featured in the hit documentary ""A Bite of China"" in 2012."

The case linked to the incident was registered at the Vasant Vihar police station in 2015 on the complaint of Xavier Gradeler, who was a diplomat at the embassy of France at the relevant time.
Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri allowed the petition of Samay Sanjay seeking to quash the FIR after considering the submissions and facts.
""Considering the aforesaid facts, including the factum of compromise deed and that the settlement amount has already been received by Xavier Gradeler, in my view, no fruitful purpose would be served in continuation of the present FIR,"" Justice Ohri said in the order of January 19, 2024.
""Accordingly, the above-mentioned FIR and the consequent proceedings emanating therefrom are quashed,"" the bench ordered.
Petitioner Samay Sanjay has moved a petition through advocate Risha Mittal.
It was submitted by advocate Risha Mittal that during the proceedings before the Trial Court, the petitioner had paid a sum of Rs 69,238 through a cheque dated 30.09.2016 and that a Compromise Deed was also executed between the parties on October 1, 2016, wherein the complainant had agreed to cooperate in the quashing of the present FIR.
The bench noted that on February 16, 2023, while noting the aforesaid facts, a notice of the petition was directed to be issued and the complainant was permitted to appear either through the Embassy of France or through a video conference.
The counsel for the petitioner submits that the complainant has since returned.to France.
The said fact has also been stated by the Additional public prosecutor (APP) for the State,on instructions from the concerned I.O.
Again on May 4, 2023, a statement of the petitioner's counsel was also recorded to the effect that several emails as well as reminders were sent to the France Embassy; however, no response was received.
On April 11, 2015, at about 1.30 am, when the petitioner was driving his car, he mistakenly collided with Gradeler's car, which was parked below the house.
The cars of the complainant and the petitioner were both damaged, the petition stated.
It was also stated that on the same day, April 11, 2015, the complainant lodged a First Information Report under Section 279 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 with the Police Station, Vasant Vihar.
A final report under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, was filed before the Patiala House Court.
It was also stated that meanwhile, through emails dated May 19, May 20, 2015, and May 21, 2015, the complainant informed the petitioner that an amount of Rs 69,238 has to be paid for the repair of the damaged vehicle, which may be reimbursed to him by the petitioner.
Accordingly, on October 1, 2016, a compromise was entered into between respondent no. 3 and the petitioner and a full and final settlement was reached. The petitioner made a payment amounting to Rs 69,238 to respondent no. 3 by way of a cheque dated September 30, 2016.
The complainant (who was a French diplomat at the time of the accident) made a statement before the magistrate at Patiala House Court on September 29, 2016, that he would cooperate in the quashing of the FIR lodged against the petitioner, the plea stated. (ANI)"

The tech giant said that the hackers accessed ""a very small percentage"" of its corporate email accounts, including those of its senior leadership team and employees in its cybersecurity, legal and other functions.
Microsoft added that its probe into the breach indicated the hackers first targeted Microsoft to learn what the technology giant knew about their operations.
From November 2023, the hackers used a ""password spray attack,"" a technique used to infiltrate a company's systems by using the same compromised password against multiple related accounts, to breach a Microsoft platform.
Microsoft stated that it investigated the incident and disrupted the malicious activity, blocking the group's access to its systems.
""This attack does highlight the continued risk posed to all organizations from well-resourced nation-state threat actors like Midnight Blizzard. To date, there is no evidence that the threat actor had any access to customer environments, production systems, source code or AI systems,"" the company said.
In December, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandated publicly owned companies to immediately disclose cyber incidents.
U.S. officials said that Midnight Blizzard is also known as APT29, Nobelium or Cozy Bear by cybersecurity researchers and linked to Russia's SVR spy agency, and it is best known for its intrusions of the Democratic National Committee surrounding the 2016 U.S. election."

NCP MP Supriya Sule along with other party leaders accompanied Rohit Pawar to the office of the central investigation agency this morning where the latter was summoned for questioning in the case.
""Satyamev Jayate. The truth will triumph...Investigations must be transparent and fair. I have full faith in ED. I am sure they will hear Rohit's side. He has come. We are going to completely cooperate with all the agencies because we have nothing to hide,"" Sule said speaking to reporters on Wednesday.
Sule said that government data has shown that 95 per cent of the cases being probed by the central investigation agencies are against Opposition party leaders.
""I am going by data and data always speaks for itself. In the Parliament, there was a reply given by the Government of India, that 95 per cent of cases of ICE meaning Income Tax, CBI and ED are on people who are in the Opposition parties,"" Sule said.
Rohit, the grandnephew of the NCP supremo Sharad Pawar before entering the ED office was seen touching the feet of his aunt Supriya Sule who handed him a copy of the Indian Constituion.
Prior to going to the ED office, Rohit Pawar went to the NCP office situated nearby, met with Sharad Pawar and also interacted with other party leaders.
Talking to reporters, Rohit Pawar said that he does not have anything against the ED officials as they were doing their work.
""I am carrying all the files and documents that the agency had asked for. I will answer all the questions of ED and will support them. The ED officials are just doing their work, I don't have anything against them. I am ready to support them in every possible way,"" the NCP MLA told reporters.
The Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank scam case relates to the alleged fraudulent disbursal of loans amounting to Rs 25,000 crore. The case triggered the filing of a PIL petition in the Bombay High Court by four persons.
The PIL shed light on the alleged modus operandi of the fraud. In the petition, it was alleged that some sugar mills defaulted on the loans, which were given without due diligence. Those sugar mills were attached by the MSC banks and auctioned to various office bearers of the bank and politicians.
Acting on the PIL the Bombay High Court ordered the registration of a case. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW), which is under the Maharashtra government, investigated the case. When EOW filed a closure report in 2020 in the Bombay Session Court, ED filed an intervention petition against the closure report and started an investigation. (ANI)"

They will chant slogans and hold banners with messages of solidarity with the families of these defenders. This 'walk' is being organised by the Sindhi Foundation, based in Washington, DC.
The protests in Islamabad are being led by Mahrang Baloch, a 30-year-old Baloch activist who is now suffering because her father was killed and her brother was abducted by Pakistani security forces.
Meanwhile, T Kumar, former International Advocacy Director at Amnesty International, said, ""While all human rights abuses are painful, disappearance can be considered the most painful to those who have disappeared and their families. Successive Pakistani governments have used this gruesome practice, mainly in the Balochistan and Sindh southern provinces, to silence political activists and terrorise their communities.""Thousands of families in Sindh and Balochistan have a brother, father, husband, or son killed or ""missing"" for months, even years, all for the ""crime"" of standing up for their basic and constitutional human rights. The Pakistani government has declared them ""terrorists"" and carried out gruesome acts of torture and extrajudicial killings.
According to Waheed Baloch, former Speaker of the Balochistan Provincial Assembly, ""Balochistan is the black hole of Pakistan, where extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances are committed with impunity. The current uprising of Baloch masses is the result of 75 years of subjugation, oppression, and exploitation committed by Pakistan's military.""The Sindhi Foundation has organised peaceful protests against the enforced disappearances of Sindhis in New York, Ottawa, Geneva, Paris, London and Senegal.

Under the terms of an agreement endorsed by Norway and the US, Norway will not transfer the frozen funds to Ramallah without Israeli consent.
Members of the Cabinet say Ramallah's monthly financial transfers to Gaza benefit Hamas.
According to the decision, the funds or their equivalent will not be transferred under any circumstances without the explicit approval of Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, even through an intermediary.
""Not one shekel will end up in Gaza!"", Smotrich posted on X after the Cabinet vote. ""This time, encouraged by the United States for the steadfast policy I've championed since day one, we stand ready to halt all financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority at the slightest transfer of a shekel to Gaza.""In November, the cabinet approved a partial transfer of funds to the Palestinian Authority, but withholding millions of shekels to offset what Ramallah transfers to the Gaza Strip each month.
The Palestinian Authority added hundreds of Palestinians who participated in the October 7 massacres to its list of people who qualify to receive controversial ""pay for slay"" terror stipends.
Of the 3,550 terrorists slated to receive payouts, 661 are Hamas terrorists from Gaza. The remainder are Palestinians arrested in almost daily Israeli counter-terror operations around Judea and Samaria. According to Israeli figures, around 1,300 of the terror suspects arrested in counter-terror raids since October 7 are affiliated with Hamas.
The Palestinian Authority refuses to accept any financial transfer unless the money earmarked for Gaza is included.
At least 1,200 people were killed in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. The number of men, women, children, soldiers and foreigners held captive in Gaza by Hamas is now believed to be 136. Other people remain unaccounted for as Israeli authorities continue to identify bodies and search for human remains. (ANI/TPS)"

BURLINGTON, ON / ACCESSWIRE / January 22, 2024 / Murchison Minerals Ltd. ('Murchison' or the 'Company') (TSXV:MUR)(OTCQB:MURMF) is pleased to announce the commencement of the 2024 Winter Exploration Program (the 'Program') at its 100%-owned Cu-Zn-Ag-Pb-Au Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) BMK Project in Saskatchewan. The Program is comprised of diamond drilling totaling approximately 3,500 m and is expected to be completed by mid-March. Cyr Drilling of Sunnyside, Manitoba was selected as the drill contractor. The objective of the Program is the discovery of the copper-rich stockwork zone predicted - due to the high-grade nature - to be associated with the formation of the of the BMK VMS Deposit. The Program will focus on testing three target areas: CST, BMK North and BMK South Extensions.
Figure 1: Plan Map View of BMK Deposit and CST zone with drill target areas highlighted in red.
Figure 2- Long Section View of BMK Deposit and CST Geophysical Anomaly, highlighting target areas for 2024 drill program.
2024 Winter Exploration Program:
The Program will focus on diamond drill exploration, utilizing one drill. Murchison maintains a year-round core processing facility, and accommodations within the nearby - 2.5 km - community of Brabant Lake, SK. The BMK Project site is easily accessible with maintained road access within 1.8 km of the Deposit, while exploration target areas have well established drill-trails. The Company has secured all necessary permits and approvals for the Program.
The BMK Deposit has a 2018 NI 43-101 resource estimate of 2.1 Mt indicated at 0.69% Cu, 7.08% Zn, 0.49% Pb, 39.6 g/t Ag, 0.23 g/t Au and 7.6 Mt of inferred at 0.57% Cu, 4.46% Zn, 0.19% Pb, 18.42 g/t Ag, and 0.1 g/t Au (See NI 43-101 dated September 4, 2018) and remains open along strike and at depth. Recent work completed by subject matter expert Dr. Stephen J. Piercy, Professor at Memorial University NFLD, has aided in an updated geological interpretation of the BMK Deposit. The updated geological interpretation indicates that the BMK Deposit should have an associated copper stockwork zone (see release dated June 7, 2023) which is typical in most VMS deposits, and has yet to be discovered at BMK. The copper stockwork zone represents a target which could considerably add to the BMK resource, and its identification is of top priority for Murchison.
During the Program, the Company will drill test three high priority areas. i). The CST target (Figure 1 & 2), a large geophysical anomaly, reidentified in a 2017 Heli-SAM survey (hybrid ground/airborne electromagnetic survey). The target is considered prospective due to its similar conductance to that of the BMK Deposit, as well as being only 400 metres south of the BMK Deposit directly along strike. The large size and proximity of the anomaly to the BMK Deposit may indicate a copper stockwork zone or an additional lens of massive sulphide mineralization. ii). BMK South Extension target, located south of the current extents of the defined BMK Deposit. The target area is along strike from multiple high-grade copper intercepts at the southern edge of BMK. iii). BMK North Extension target, located north of the current extents of the defined BMK Deposit. The target area is along strike from multiple high-grade copper intercepts at the northern edge of BMK Deposit.
2023 Fall Exploration Program at BMK:
Murchison has recently received geophysical data from the fall 2023 ground electro-magnetic (EM) survey over the CST target (see release dated November 8, 2023). The EM survey consisted of two lines, 1 line was 2 km long and the other 1 km long with 50-metre spaced reading stations oriented perpendicular over the CST anomaly. The survey was used as confirmation of the 2017 geophysical data, and they survey successfully confirmed a strong EM response coincident with the previously modelled anomaly. This geophysical survey provided confidence in the robustness of the previous geophysical anomaly and confirmed it as high priority drill target for Murchison.
One (1) hole drilled in 2021 was also selected for a borehole EM survey. This hole detected a significant off-hole anomaly but unfortunately the hole was plugged at the 400-metre level which is approximately where the anomaly was located, and where mineralization had been encountered in the hole. The blocked hole was a hindrance to be able to provide full resolution to the borehole EM results however there is still sufficient data to highlight a significant response directly west of the hole. This off-hole anomaly is located at the far southern extent of the BMK Deposit and is planned to be drill tested during the winter program.
Murchison Minerals' Vice-President of Exploration John Shmyr comments:
'The 2024 Exploration Program at the BMK Project is the culmination of many months of planning and preparation. The team has spent months updating our geologic interpretation of the BMK Deposit and it has reinforced our views on the high potential of the project. The work that Dr. Piercy has done gives us a tremendous amount of confidence in our thesis that a copper stockwork zone should be associated with the BMK Deposit. Additionally, the team is particularly excited about the CST target since it is only 400 meters away from the Deposit, directly on strike. The 2024 Program is the first step in unlocking the potential of the BMK Project, and we are thrilled to be back here exploring.'
OTC Venture Market
The Company wishes to announce that its last day of trading on the OTC Venture Market ('OTCQB') will be on January 31, 2024. For February 2024 onwards, US investors will still be able to trade the common shares of the Company via OTC's 'Pink Sheet'.

BJP National spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla took to X and said that Rahul Gandhi 'arrogantly charged' at the crowd.
""Some people chanted Jai Shri RamModi Modi during his yatra, so Rahul Gandhi arrogantly charges at them. Security personnel stopped him. Mohabbat ki dukaan or Ahankaar ki Dukaan. Shamefulatrocious behaviour by the entitled dynast! He even made kissing actions to the crowd !!"" he said on Monday.
A video of Rahul Gandhi showed him apparently losing his temper in response to chants of ""Jai Shri Ram"" and slogans supporting Prime Minister Modi during the Assam leg of his ongoing Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
The incident came when the 'Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,' was on its fourth day in the northeastern state.
Sharing the video, the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party's IT cell, Amit Malviya, said, ""Rahul Gandhi lost his cool after Jai Shri Ram and Modi Modi slogans were raised in his presence.""""If this is how rattled he is, how will he face the people of this country in the days ahead, after the anti-Hindu Congress rejected the invite to be part of the Pran Pratistha in Ayodhya?"" he wrote on X.
In a reply to Malviya, Congress Social Media and Digital Platforms Chairperson Supriya Shrinate said that his party leader ""didn't lose his cool"" but went to meet the people who were sloganeering.
""You dimwit. Rahul Gandhi didn't lose his cool. But went to meet the people who were sloganeering -- and the moment he went amidst them they ran away What he did takes courage. Something that you and your master won't ever understand. Now shut up and sit down,"" Shrinate said.
Hitting out at the BJP government in Assam, another Congress leader, Anand Sharma, said that the incident should be criticised and that Chief Minister Sarma should respect the law and the Constitution.
""No matter how much we condemn this, it is still less. In democracy, Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders have the right to take out a yatra and speak. Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma should respect law and constitution. Congress is not scared of such threats and it won't have any effect on yatra. But, Congress won't tolerate it, this is not acceptable in democracy,"" the Congress leader said while speaking to ANI on Sunday. (ANI)"
FYYRCS10K4_B354XP3W9ZYM9G2,IMF says Djibouti's logistics investments bring growth,"Xinhua 27th January 2024, 03:05 GMT+11","Xinhua 27th January 2024, 03:05 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274107391/imf-says-djiboutis-logistics-investments-bring-growth,"ADDIS ABABA, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Djibouti's investments in logistics during the last decade have delivered efficiency and growth, a team of International Monetary Fund (IMF) experts have said.
The IMF team of experts made the statement in a preliminary finding issued Thursday after a visit to the Red Sea nation from Jan. 14 to 25.
With Djibouti's concerted investments in logistics during the last decade and as the country became the main port of transit to Ethiopia, its gross domestic product growth averaged over 6 percent between 2013 and 2019, and port performance increased significantly, the IMF statement quoted Joyce Wong, head of the team, as saying.
Wong, however, said the growth was financed by debt, which reached 68 percent at the end of 2022. The combined shocks of the pandemic, the conflict in neighboring Ethiopia, and commodity price increases revealed the need for a more resilient growth model as revenues decreased and fiscal space shrunk.
The IMF staff projected that the recovery will continue in 2024, albeit at a slower pace, and is subject to significant risks stemming from the situation in the Red Sea and developments in Ethiopia.
""The uncertain regional context stresses the need for Djibouti to strengthen its resilience by overhauling its growth model, building fiscal buffers and enhancing governance. In this regard, the authorities have progressed in some key reforms,"" Wong said.
The IMF experts' team advised a clear medium-term vision for fiscal policy, backed by the highest authorities and directed towards the government's growth and job creation goals, which would ensure policy coherence and consistency while supporting revenues.
""The authorities are cognizant that key constraints to increasing employment include high telecom and energy costs, weak private sector job creation, and informality in employment,"" Wong said. ""They are committed to lowering telecoms costs, including by further liberalizing the sector."""

G10RIZDBKY_ZBGIUVLKG2SW5IR,Attacks in Nigeria's Plateau State Leave at Least 30 Dead,"Voice of America 26th January 2024, 00:35 GMT+11","Voice of America 26th January 2024, 00:35 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106148/attacks-in-nigerias-plateau-state-leave-at-least-30-dead,"MAIDUGURI - At least 30 people have been killed and several others injured in Nigeria's central Plateau state in a series of attacks around Mangu town, despite a curfew imposed by the state government, a community spokesperson said.
Farmer-herder attacks and communal conflicts are rife in central Nigeria, an ethnically and religiously diverse hinterland known as the 'Middle Belt' where a circle of violence has claimed hundreds of lives in recent years.
The latest violence on Tuesday and Wednesday came after a Christmas Day attack in the area which left at least 140 people dead. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed on Jan. 23.
Death Toll Rises to 150 Following Christmas Eve Attack in Nigeria
The attackers targeted several villages including Kwahaslalek, Kinat and Mairana, located on the borders of Mangu and Barkin Ladi local government areas, said Joseph Gwankat, head of the community group Mwaghavul Development Association, or MDA.
'The victims had sought refuge in the house of a community leader after earlier unrest in Mangu town. The attackers surrounded the house and killed those inside,' Gwankat told Reuters by phone.
Survivors reported that the gunmen indiscriminately shot at people, including women and children, and set fire to houses and property.
In a subsequent statement, the MDA blamed the attack on herders, and questioned why troops deployed by the federal government to the area since the Christmas attacks didn't intervene to stop the violence.
Nigeria defense spokesperson Tukur Gusau said the military remains neutral following allegations of partisanship in the conflict, adding that troops responded professionally and by the rules of engagement.
'They have successfully arrested criminals involved in looting and burning of properties, as well as recovered weapons,' Gusau said in a statement on Thursday.
The latest attacks come amid a surge in violence in the Plateau, which has seen repeated clashes between nomadic herders and local farming communities.
Plateau governor Caleb Mutfwang condemned the attacks and called for calm as his government 'is taking proactive measures to halt further destruction of lives and property,' his office said on Thursday.

Alexander Zverev quashed a comeback attempt by World No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz to win 6-1, 6-3, 6-7 (2), 6-4 and reach his second Australian Open semifinal on Wednesday in Melbourne.
Zverev, from Germany, will face third-seeded Russian Daniil Medvedev in Friday's semifinal. He'll be looking for his second straight win against a Top 5 opponent in a Grand Slam after recording his first-ever such victory against Alcaraz.
The win for Zverev, the World No. 6, was powered by his dominant first serve, which he landed 85 percent of the time. He was up two sets and serving for the match at 5-3 when his serve failed him for the first time, with Alcaraz getting his first break.
The break gave Alcaraz a burst in momentum and slightly shook Zverev, who lost four points on his serve in the tiebreak.
The two played to a stalemate in the fourth set until Zverev broke Alcaraz at 4-4, then served out for the win in three hours and six minutes.
Zverev admitted in his on-court interview after the match that he got ahead of himself in the third set as the thought of victory against the second-seeded Spaniard crept into his mind.
""We are all human and it is a great honor to play against guys like him,"" he said. ""When you're so close to winning your brain starts going and it is not always helpful, but I'm happy that I got there in the end. I fought back quite well in the fourth set, didn't let go and I'm very happy that I finished the match.""
Zverev moved to 5-3 in his career against Alcaraz.
He'll be facing the World No. 3 when he plays Medvedev, who survived a 7-6 (4), 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4 match against No. 9 Hubert Hurkacz of Poland to book a spot in his third Australian Open semifinal.
It will be the first meeting in a Grand Slam between the two. Medvedev holds an 11-7 lead in head-to-head play against Zverev.
Zverev discussed a medical timeout he took to address a toe issue but said he wouldn't let it stop him.
""I have a lot of blood under my toenails which is quite painful, but I would much rather feel the way I'm feeling right now, with a bit of pain here and there but in the semifinals, than be at home right now watching this tournament,"" he said. ""I'm happy to be here and I'm ready to keep going.""
World No. 1 and 10-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic of Serbia will meet No. 4 Jannik Sinner of Italy in the other semifinal.

He said that it also demonstrates India's long-standing commitment to assist and facilitate development in the Global South, adding that Africa is a region whose potential is yet to be fully realised.
""There is no doubt in anyone's mind that India's outreach to Africa, particularly in regard to its facilitation of the membership of the African Union in the G20, demonstrates India's leadership in the international arena. But more than that demonstrates its long-standing commitment to assist and facilitate development in the third world, in the global south. Africa is a region whose potential is yet to be fully realised,"" the UNGA President said in his press conference in the national capital today.
He noted that India has a ""lot to share"" with other developing countries, as he lauded New Delhi for achieving success in area of digitalization over the last 10 to 15 years.
Francis said, ""In a world of digitalization, that is way below what can be considered satisfactory. So India has a lot to share with other developing countries; so much of its success and prowess have been achieved in the last 10 to 15 years. We're talking about digitalization. You have to talk about India's successes in digitalization...Others in the past have not engaged in outreach in quite the same way as India is doing now.""He underlined how India is willing to share, engage and facilitate Africa's engagement and its voice in global policy-making.
""India is willing to share and to engage and facilitate Africa's engagement and its voice in global policy-making as it relates to economic development and finance...and since this developing world is carrying an excessive burden of debt, many of these middle income countries in Africa are carrying a very heavy debt load,"" he said.
""I think it's a compliment to India's leadership and it's a strategic analysis that Africa should be given the opportunity to contribute to decision-making at the global level,"" the UNGA President added.
The African Union is a continental union consisting of 55 member states located on the continent of Africa. The move to include the African Union in the G20 grouping was proposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June last year.

As President Vladimir Zelensky pushes forward with his so-called ""peace formula,"" which has been dismissed by the Kremlin as ""absurd,"" Ukrainian officials continue to propose additional terms and conditions.
The conflict in Ukraine can only end with a ""complete liberation"" and ""restoration of its 1991 borders,"" Kiev's deputy defense minister Ivan Gavrilyuk told the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel last week. Only then can Moscow and the pro-Kiev ""coalition"" sign a document to ""create preventive mechanisms so that Russia will never think about another war against Ukraine or any country in the future.""
""This document must include Russia's renunciation of nuclear weapons, because it poses a threat to the world,"" Gavrilyuk claimed.
A senior adviser to Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, Mikhail Podoliak, voiced a similar idea, claiming that the negotiation should take place only when Moscow ""suffers a global defeat,"" or at the very least a series of ""tactical defeats,"" and ""internal riots"" that would threaten political stability in Russia and force it to ""voluntarily give up nuclear weapons.""
""What is a global defeat? The Russian Federation will no longer be able to dominate... will not be able to use its veto right in the UN Security Council,"" Podoliak explained. ""Then conditions are possible for nuclear weapons, and for the number of carriers of nuclear weapons, including missiles of a certain range, and for cross-border buffer zones, etc.""
During the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelensky once again attempted to promote his so-called 'peace formula', which among other things proposes that Russia pay reparations, surrender its officials to face war crimes tribunals, and restore Ukraine's 1991 borders. It has previously been rejected by the Kremlin as ""absurd,"" with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov referring to it as a publicity stunt and ""a figment of a sick imagination.""
Moscow insists it never closed the door to talks but Kiev itself did, and now bears full responsibility for the situation in which it finds itself, Russian President Vladimir Putin said last week. Putin noted that the head of Ukraine's negotiation team recently admitted that Kiev was at one point ready to reach an agreement with Moscow - before then-British prime minister Boris Johnson convinced them to continue fighting.
""Are they not idiots?"" Putin asked, adding that if Ukraine had simply ignored Johnson, then the violence could be long over by now. ""This just proves yet again that they are not independent people.""
Even Ukraine's former top spin doctor, Aleksey Arestovich, recently admitted that Kiev' had the chance to make peace at the 2022 Istanbul talks but ""something"" changed Zelensky's mind, and Moscow is unlikely to offer Kiev such favorable conditions ever again.

GBGHSEYUQ8_3YMU7RD3YO3P4B4,US to negotiate future of its troops in Iraq media,"RT.com 25th January 2024, 17:13 GMT+11","RT.com 25th January 2024, 17:13 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105766/us-to-negotiate-future-of-its-troops-in-iraq-media,"Baghdad has pushed for an end to the US-led coalition and condemned recent strikes on Iraqi territory
The United States is set to hold talks on the future of its military presence in Iraq, officials told multiple news outlets, suggesting Washington and Baghdad will discuss a timeline to end the decade-long US deployment.
In a message delivered to Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein on Wednesday, the US government said it was willing to negotiate the next phase of the military coalition in Iraq, according to unnamed officials cited by Reuters and CNN.
Hussein later said it had received an ""important message"" from the US envoy, adding that it would be ""studied by the prime minister and the relevant concerned authorities,"" without elaborating.
The US maintains around 2,500 troops in Iraq, holdovers from a 2014 deployment to combat Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS). They are meant to serve in an advisory role, as the Pentagon declared an end to combat operations in 2021, but the military has carried out dozens of armed missions in the years since - most targeting Iran-backed militia groups.
While the Pentagon said it was not considering a troop withdrawal as recently as January 8, CNN reported that part of the upcoming discussions ""will focus on whether and when it will be feasible to end the US military presence in Iraq.""
According to multiple sources cited by Reuters, Washington has relaxed its stance on the issue. Though the US previously held that it would only agree to a pull-out once attacks by Iran-backed militias had stopped, it has reportedly dropped that precondition.
Some officials in Baghdad have called for a quicker exit, however, urging the US to commit to a specific timeline for a withdrawal. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said he would soon initiate the process to ""end the presence of the international coalition forces in Iraq permanently,"" though did not offer any date for when that might occur.
The negotiations with Washington could take ""several months, if not longer,"" Reuters reported, noting that a US drawdown is not yet ""imminent.""
Al-Sudani has loudly denounced several US airstrikes on Iraqi soil in recent weeks, saying they compromise his country's sovereignty and threaten regional stability. Following the latest round of strikes on Tuesday, the leader said the US was ""undermining agreements and various sectors of joint security cooperation,"" also stressing the need to ""reshape the future relationship"" with Washington.

Russia moved past Saudi Arabia in 2023 to become the largest exporter of oil to China, Chinese customs data released on Saturday showed.
Moscow delivered just over 107 million metric tons of oil to China in 2023, a figure that comes out to 2.14 million barrels per day, thus marking a year-on-year increase of 24%. The record high crude shipments came despite Ukraine-related sanctions imposed on Russian oil exports by the West.
Saudi Arabia shipped some 86 million metric tons in 2023, while Iraq, the third biggest oil supplier to China, delivered 59 million tons. In December alone, Russia's oil exports to China amounted to 9.5 million tons, which is 6.2% higher than the volume of supplies in November.
Moscow began diversifying its energy supplies in 2022 after the EU, G7, and allies imposed an embargo on seaborne Russian oil along with a $60-per-barrel price cap on other types of crude in an effort to curb Russian energy revenues. Similar restrictions were subsequently introduced for exports of petroleum products. The agreed ceiling for diesel is $100 per barrel, and $45 for discounted products such as fuel oil.

As a result, Russian oil producers have rerouted supplies of East Siberian crude to Asia, and resumed transportation of crude by rail.
Last month, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that oil sales to the EU, once Russia's biggest market, had dropped by 90%. Meanwhile, a number of Western officials have noted that oil from Russia is still entering the EU market via intermediaries at an elevated price.

Authorities detained Ghobadlou amid the crackdown on protests that followed the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini in 2022.
Ghobadlou was sentenced to death in November 2022.
Amnesty International raised concerns about his prosecution and treatment in prison, saying it had information that he was repeatedly beaten and forced to confess.
Clara Bunger, a member of Germany's parliament, told VOA's Persian service she was shocked to hear Iran was going ahead with the execution only months after a court agreed to review the case.
Bunger said Germany should call on Iran to halt such executions and release the political prisoners it is holding."

He recalled two resolutions that had raised the issues earlier in 2023, saying the amendments would focus on economic provisions, the same areas that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. wanted reviewed to attract more foreign investment.
Speaking at the Philippine Economic Forum in Iloilo on December 11, Romualdez also revealed that the House was open to a ""people-centered initiative"" as a mechanism for constitutional amendments - which would bypass the question of whether the House and Senate can pursue amendments through joint or separate votes.
Albay Representative Edcel Lagman claimed that some Bicol Region representatives from the supermajority were already starting a signature campaign for Cha-cha. Media reports cited his statement on January 6 that some members of the House supplied ""mobilization funds"" and forms for local officials to collect signatures. A people's initiative requires at least three percent of their voting constituents. Signatures allegedly cost PHP100 per person.
Denying Lagman's claims, Ako Bicol Party-list Representative Alfredo Garbin Jr. told the media that Albay mayors themselves started gathering signatures on their own, adding that funds were available only for transportation and other logistical expenses.
Senator Imee Marcos echoed a similar allegation on January 9, saying she received information that mayors were offered PHP 5 to 20 million worth of projects and financial aid from the Departments of Health, Labor and Social Welfare in exchange for signatures of their residents. Officials of these agencies have denied any involvement in the signature campaigns, stressing that support for Cha-cha has never been a prerequisite to receiving aid.
In an interview with CNN Philippines' The Source on January 12, Senator Marcos said she received a text from an unknown contact before Christmas about a detailed timetable for a so-called ""Project PI."" The calendar that Marcos saw targeted a plebiscite by early July this year.
Rappler reported on January 13 that the signature campaign has been going on in different parts of the country, citing confirmation from Kabataan Party-list, progressive people's organizations, and from representatives and local chiefs themselves. Among those cited in news accounts was Davao City Mayor Paolo Duterte, who warned his constituents against signing the petition for a small amount of money. He claimed the people's initiative being campaigned for was not a reflection of public sentiment but ""the voice of a few who wanted to perpetuate themselves in power.""
TV Patrol, 24 Oras, Frontline Pilipinas and News Night all found residents who either signed the petition because of the supposed promise of financial aid, or did not due to insufficient explanation of its contents. These reports included a clip of a video provided by the Quezon City Urban Poor Coordinating Council, which showed a volunteer for an unidentified representative telling residents that their signatures would entitle them to aid from the DSWD. For her part, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte said there was no prior coordination with her office regarding the signature campaign.
News accounts said they tried getting reactions from Romualdez himself, as well as the Palace, but did not receive any.
Meanwhile, media also reported the Cha-cha initiative of People's Initiative for Reform Modernization and Action (Pirma), a private group that had already pushed for charter change in the past. This time, group made news for having aired ads for amendments. The tagline ""Edsa-puwera"" triggered such a wave of criticism and complaints on social media even before print, TV and online news reports had picked up on the campaign.
Noel Onate, national convenor of Pirma, told Inquirer.net that his group only wanted to make people aware of the issue, denying that they paid anyone to provide signatures. However, Onate also admitted to ABS-CBN that their goal was to ""dilute the Senate vote.""
The current movements indicate an ambitious and seemingly well-coordinated plan for constitutional revision. Funding is a key issue here, and journalists should be alert to the use of public funds for such a campaign. Reports have gathered enough evidence of mobilization through LGUs. So far, the probable misuse of public funds and the offensive propaganda launched by Pirma have provoked well-deserved backlash and has set back once again a meaningful review of the charter. The parties and individuals engaged in this recent effort have only themselves to blame.
The resistance to constitutional amendments is rooted in the danger of opening up the constitution to wholesale revision so political groups can keep their positions in power. The issue is a lack of public trust in those who gain power. Filipinos should bear in mind that few have stood out for the virtue of recognizing the limitations of political office, taking care not to abuse the power given them by the people. The public must understand that amending the Constitution is no simple task, and that blindly signing petitions is tantamount to signing away our future to uncertainty."
GDR1NFVVC8_WKG1LYVX4A60FFF,American RFE/RL Journalist Marks 100 Days Jailed in Russia,"Voice of America 26th January 2024, 11:36 GMT+11","Voice of America 26th January 2024, 11:36 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106712/american-rferl-journalist-marks-100-days-jailed-in-russia,"washington - Alsu Kurmasheva, an American journalist jailed in Russia on charges that press freedom groups say are politically motivated and baseless, marked 100 days in detention on Thursday, as her employer and family renewed calls for her immediate release.
""To be honest, it's all becoming slowly but surely less bearable,"" Kurmasheva wrote in a January 13 letter.
Kurmasheva is a longtime Prague-based editor at the Tatar-Bashkir service of VOA's sister outlet, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
A dual U.S.-Russian national, Kurmasheva traveled to Russia in May 2023 for a family emergency. Her passports were confiscated when she tried to leave the country in June, and she was waiting for them to be returned when she was detained in October.
Kurmasheva was initially charged with failing to register as a ""foreign agent,"" but authorities later added additional charges of spreading false information about the Russian army. Kurmasheva and her employer deny the charges against her.
Russia Adds Fresh Charges to Jailed US-Russian Journalist
""Even one day unjustly behind bars is a tragedy,"" acting RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said, ""but a U.S. citizen wrongfully held in a Russian prison for 100 days is outrageous.""
Kurmasheva is being held in pretrial detention until at least February and faces a combined sentence of up to 15 years in prison.
""One hundred days of Alsu's detention in Russia is 100 days too many,"" Kurmasheva's husband, Pavel Butorin, said in a post on X. ""Russia must drop its criminal cases against Alsu and allow her to leave Russia. She needs to come home and hug her children again.""
Russia's Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment.
Since Kurmasheva's jailing, her employer and press freedom groups have called on the U.S. State Department to declare her wrongfully detained, which would open additional resources to help secure her release.
Network Calls on State Department to Help Jailed American Journalist
""Alsu Kurmasheva is a victim of Moscow's war on journalism and its geopolitical disputes with the United States,"" Clayton Weimers, executive director of the U.S. bureau of Reporters Without Borders, said in a statement.
""As an American journalist targeted for her work, Kurmasheva deserves nothing less than the full weight of her government working to secure her release,"" Weimers added.
Some press freedom analysts have wondered whether Kurmasheva's status as a dual national is complicating or delaying her potential designation as wrongfully detained, but other analysts told VOA that shouldn't be a factor.
Wrongful detention determinations are important because they put political jailings on the U.S. government's radar to drive their response, according to Sarah Moriarty, an international security fellow at the New America think tank.
""It's important because it calls out these actions for what they are, which is really, at its heart, hostage-taking,"" Moriarty told VOA.
Moriarty is the daughter of Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who was abducted in Iran in 2007 by Tehran. He is the namesake for the Levinson Act, which established a framework for responding to wrongful detentions of Americans abroad.
A State Department spokesperson on Wednesday said he had no updates on a potential designation for Kurmasheva.
""We are following closely the detention of Alsu Kurmasheva in Russia. We remain incredibly concerned about the extension of her pretrial detention,"" spokesperson Vedant Patel said, adding that a request for consular access to the journalist was denied on December 20.
""When it comes to dual nationals who may be detained or arrested, Russia has no legal obligation to inform us of the detention of U.S. citizens who are dual nationals,"" Patel continued, saying Moscow had acknowledged her detention to consular officials.
The process of making wrongful detention determinations is unclear, according to Joel Simon, the founding director of the Journalism Protection Initiative.
""The fact that there's really no explanation in Alsu's case is, I would say, not unusual,"" said Simon, who also sits on the Center for Strategic and International Studies Commission on Hostage Taking and Wrongful Detention.
""It's an opaque and mysterious process, and we don't really know how these deliberations are carried out,"" he said.
The absence of a designation in Kurmasheva's case could be chalked up to slow-moving bureaucracy, according to Simon, or it may be a tactical decision if officials think not making the designation may better help get Kurmasheva released.
Kurmasheva is one of two American journalists currently jailed in Russia.
Evan Gershkovich, a Russia correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, was jailed in March 2023 on espionage allegations that he, his employer and the U.S. government deny. The State Department has declared Gershkovich wrongfully detained.
Gershkovich earlier this week marked 300 days behind bars. He will remain in pretrial detention until at least the end of January.
The National Press Club in Washington this week also renewed calls for the Kremlin to immediately release Gershkovich and Kurmasheva.
""We continue to demand the Russian government cease its cruel pattern of sweeping up innocent American journalists to serve as high-profile pawns in its quest to gain diplomatic leverage with the U.S. government,"" Emily Wilkins, president of the National Press Club, and Gil Klein, president of the National Press Club Journalism Institute, said in a statement.
""Journalism is not a crime,"" they said."

As of now, Pleven Region is already grappling with an epidemic, while Varna, Burgas, and Sofia are poised to follow suit from January 25. Concurrently, Gabrovo and Plovdiv are enforcing anti-epidemic measures until January 28, with Smolyan set to continue such measures until January 30.
The implemented measures involve the suspension of scheduled consultations for healthy pregnant women and children, along with preventive examinations and compulsory immunizations and re-immunizations. Stringent daily screening protocols have been activated in nurseries, kindergartens, and schools, while visits to hospitals and social institutions for both children and adults have been prohibited.
The Health Ministry affirmed that depending on the flu epidemic's progression in a specific area, the temporary anti-epidemic measures could be expanded and their duration extended.
Chief State Health Inspector Angel Kunchev expressed his expectation that, by the week's end, one-third of Bulgaria would have reached epidemic levels. This situation underscores the urgency of implementing and adhering to preventive measures to curb the flu's further escalation across the country.

Sharing it on social media, the Iran embassy in India stated, ""Hossein Amir Abdullahian, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, announced that ""we have sent a serious message and warning to the Americans that their joint action with the British in the Red Sea and against Yemen was a ""strategic mistake.""The US and UK have carried out additional strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, marking the eighth round of attacks by the US military in the past 10 days, CNN reported, citing a joint statement.
In the latest development, the countries attacked the rebels' infrastructure on Monday and struck eight sites, as per a joint statement from the US and UK.
Notably, the recent strikes on Houthi targets were ""successful"" and destroyed missiles, weapons storage sites and drone systems, a senior military official and a senior defence official stated.
Reportedly, Monday's strikes targeted a Houthi underground storage site and site associates with Houthi missiles and air surveillance, the statement added, according to CNN.
The senior military official said that the US used fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as surface vessels and a submarine, to strike eight locations.
Furthermore, for the first time, the US also struck an underground storage facility used by the Houthis, the official said, as reported by CNN.
The storage site was assessed to have ""more advanced conventional weaponry,"" including missiles and one-way attack drones.
Reportedly, the USS has named the ongoing operation targeting Houthi assets in Yemen as ""Operation Poseidon Archer,"" which suggests a more organised and potentially long-term approach to the operations in Yemen that have been aimed at dissuading the Iranian-backed group from attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
Since January 11, the US has now struck Houthi targets in Yemen eight times, the majority of which have been carried out unilaterally, as reported by CNN.
Notably, the US redesignated the Yemeni group as a ""terrorist"" organisation in response to its continuing attacks and threats to shipping and imposed sanctions on it. The designation does not go into effect for 30 days.
Last week, several US personnel were wounded after Iran-backed militants in Western Iraq launched multiple rockets and ballistic missiles on Saturday (local time) targeting Washington's al-Assad Airbase in Western Iraq, said US Central Command.
CENTCOM said that several US personnel are undergoing evaluation for ""traumatic brain injuries"" and at least one Iraqi service member was wounded in the attack.
Meanwhile, the Houthis said the counterattack will not affect its operations to prevent Israeli ships or vessels heading to Israel from crossing the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait.
The Houthis, who support the Palestinian armed group Hamas, launched their attacks in response to Israel's war on Gaza. Their strikes have slowed trade between Asia and Europe and alarmed major world powers, Al Jazeera reported. (ANI)"

Iran's first vice-president, Mohammad Mokhber, said his country condemns 'the cruel sanctions that are imposed by the domination system,' in a meeting with Niger's Prime Minister Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine.
'We will definitely share the experiences we have in this field with our brothers' from Niger, he added.
Iran has been slammed with heavy international sanctions since the Islamic revolution in 1979 but has found ways to circumvent some of them.
Tehran has also been under crippling U.S. sanctions since Washington's 2018 withdrawal from a landmark nuclear deal that granted Iran sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear activities.
Niger is under heavy economic and financial sanctions from the Economic Community of West African States after a July 2023 military coup that overthrew elected President Mohamed Bazoum.
In the meeting, Mokhber praised 'the success' of the former French colony in 'having established an independent government' during this coup.
'Niger intends to breathe new life into cooperation, which was dormant, with the Islamic republic,' Zeine said.
Both countries signed several agreements in various fields, including energy, health and finance.
In recent months, Iran has affirmed its support for leaders who seized power in a coup in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in September praised 'the resistance of these African countries' in the face of 'hegemonic European policies and colonialism.'
Iran, similar to Russia and Turkey, is willing to strengthen its influence in Africa, where it has been bolstering ties in an effort to reduce its isolation and offset the impact of sanctions.
Raisi paid a visit in 2023 to Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe.
Before Tehran, Zeine visited Moscow, which agreed to 'intensify' its military cooperation with Niger's army, which is battling jihadist groups."

Sana Hashmi, a fellow at Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation, posted on X, quoting Wu as saying, ""To me, the world is divided into two types of people, those who are going to fall in love with India and those who already have.""Notably, Minister Wu also extended warm congratulations to the Indian populace on the Pran Pratishtha of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, recognising the cultural and spiritual significance of the event.
On the eve of the highly anticipated Pran Pratishtha ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the Indian community in Taiwan came together in a joyous celebration, embracing the significant occasion.
The festivities, held on Sunday, witnessed two distinct events organised by the vibrant Indian community in Taiwan, as well as the dedicated efforts of ISKON Taiwan.
The gatherings were filled with spiritual fervour as attendees engaged in Keertan and Bhajan, creating an atmosphere of reverence and cultural unity. These events were not only a testament to the deep-rooted cultural ties maintained by the Indian diaspora in Taiwan but also an expression of collective joy over the monumental inauguration.
Adding to the spirit of unity, the Indian Association of Taiwan also organised a live stream of the Pran Pratishtha ceremony. This initiative allowed the members of the community to participate remotely, ensuring a broader reach and involvement in the auspicious proceedings.
Highlighting the significance of these celebrations, Manhar Singh Yadav, DG of ITA (India-Taiwan Association), actively participated in the community events.
In expressing gratitude, he thanked the Indian diaspora in Taiwan for their unwavering efforts to stay connected with their roots and wholeheartedly engage in various Indian celebrations.

In doing so, the accounts question the purpose of Charter change which has been gaining ground among the administration's allies in Congress.
In December 2023, House Speaker Martin Romualdez said the lower chamber would begin to review restrictions on foreign ownership in the Constitution. On Jan. 15, Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri filed a resolution to amend constitutional provisions on the operation of public utilities and education services.
Laws opening up the economy
Lian Buan's article in Rappler, headlined ""How the Philippine economy opened up to the world without charter change,"" listed four laws that were passed during the Duterte administration to ease the flow of foreign capital into the economy. These delisted industries and businesses previously closed or restricted to foreign participation.
Buan reported that two laws, the amended Public Service Act and the Foreign Investment Act, liberalized foreign ownership of industries such as telecommunications, transport, and tech enterprises. Meanwhile, the amended Retail Trade Liberalization Act and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership lowered the required paid-up capital and imposed minimal trade restrictions, respectively.
She did note that questions of constitutionality were raised against these measures, but these laws were enacted and no cases were filed with the Supreme Court. She pointedly asked, ""What is the need for Cha-cha at this point?""
Policy framework for FDI
Market Edge took the discussion further, drawing out a crucial point: the country has been receiving foreign investments at even higher levels than other thriving Asian economies. And yet these have not pushed the economy forward. The problem is not the lack of foreign investment but the absence of a policy framework on foreign investments.
Michelle Ong interviewed Sonny Africa, economist and executive director of Ibon Foundation, who said policymakers tend to view foreign investment as a ""magic bullet"" to address gaps in the economy, when there is no empirical basis for the claim that foreign investments per se have significantly contributed to development, whether here or abroad.
Africa said the more important consideration is how foreign capital actually contributes to long-term national development, particularly for Filipino industries. The government has to set regulatory policy that will require foreign investors to ensure long-term benefits for Filipinos. Africa said foreign investment can genuinely help if it ensures ""technology transfer"" to boost local capabilities, which in turn would enable the creation of a stronger local industrial base and open up a competitive local market.
As an example, Africa cited the issue of modernization of public utility vehicles, noting that Filipino manufacturers are limited to importing machines and producing locally assembled vehicles. Foreign investment should finance the local industry for manufacturing vehicles locally, as well as other areas of domestic manufacturing.
Africa stressed that developed economies all had to install their respective regulatory frameworks before allowing entry of foreign investment. Asked by Ong for examples of countries with such frameworks, Africa said practically all countries that have industrialized did so ""historically during their period of economic takeoff.""
But Africa also noted that in the last three years, the United States, Japan, Taiwan and European countries have become more ""protectionist"" in their economic approach, allocating huge government subsidies to domestic industries. The discussion raises fundamental issues: Is the Philippines willing to invest in the same way? Or is foreign investment the only way to support this much-needed development?
Whether or not one agrees with Africa on his last point, the need for a national policy on foreign investments is clear and calls for urgent discussion, even debate.
These reports should force policy makers to move away from Charter change as a requisite to attract foreign investments. What government needs to do is work to establish an investment policy that helps to develop the country's manpower and human resources.
Given the background and context provided by media, the public should question the point of Charter change at this time."

Moscow said the downing of the aircraft casts doubt on efforts for the two countries to resolve their differences diplomatically.
The IIL-76 transport plane (similar to the above), according to the Russian foreign ministry was transporting the Ukrainian captives to a spot where a prisoner exchange was to take place.
""By violating the agreements, they killed our pilots and escort soldiers and wrote off their own citizens,"" Rodion Miroshnik, Russia's ambassador-at-large for Ukraine's crimes said in a statement late Wednesday.
""The Ukrainian dictatorship,"" sacrificed their own service members to ""demonstrate 'Russia's bloody nature.'""
The Russian foreign ministry described the down of the plane as a 'terrorist act.'
The plane, according to the ministry, was hit by a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile system from the village of Liptsy in the Kharkov Region.
Along with the 65 prisoners of war, Moscow says the plane had six crew members on board as well as 3 Russian officers accompanying the prisoners.
""This is yet another atrocity committed by Zelensky's criminal regime. Immediately after the plane went down, they made a misanthropic statement about the victory of the ""valiant Armed Forces of Ukraine."" However, the office on Bankovaya Street changed its rhetoric as soon as it became known that the plane was carrying Ukrainian servicemen to an exchange site. They then began denying their involvement in the crash,"" a Russian foreign ministry statement issued on Wednesday night said.
""Kiev was well aware of the planned exchange. It also knew how the POWs were to be moved and by what route. The attack against the plane was a deliberate act. This terrorist act clearly demonstrates the Kiev regime's inability to negotiate.""
""This is not the first cruel murder of Ukrainian POWs by the Zelensky junta. On July 29, 2022, the Banderites fired a missile at the penal colony in Yelenovka (DPR) where militants from the Azov battalion had been held captive. Over fifty people were killed and more than 70 wounded,"" the statement said.
""We resolutely condemn the Kiev regime's terrorist act in the Belgorod Region. All those involved, including the organizers and executors from the Ukrainian military and civilian officials will be identified and held responsibly under Russian law.""
""This action shows once again the criminal nature of the neo-Nazi dictatorship in Kiev. Its leaders are indifferent to human life. They treat people as ""expendable material"" and kill them on orders from their Western bosses with Western-supplied arms,"" the foreign ministry statement said.
""It is perfectly obvious that the Zelensky criminal regime, nurtured by the U.S. and its NATO satellites, poses a substantial threat not only to Russia but also to Ukraine, its ordinary citizens and the rest of the world. Being in agony, this regime can commit the most heinous atrocities.""
""We believe international organizations, national governments and the world public must denounce this terrorist act and other crimes committed by the Kiev regime. Silence can only mean support for the regime's barbarous nature and terrorist actions,"" the Russian foreign ministry statement added."

Speaking on the occasion of Karpoori Thakur's 100th birth anniversary, acknowledging his significant contributions to social justice and unwavering commitment to the welfare of the people, Shah said the ""Prime Minister did 'Ram Kaaj' (work of Lord Ram) by inaugurating Ram Temple in Ayodhya on January 22 and 'Gareeb Kaaj' (work for poor) on January 23 by awarding Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur.""Shah noted that several leaders raised the issue of awarding Bharat Ratna to Karpoori Thakur, but once in power, they overlooked him.
""With the decision to honour Karpoori Thakur with Bharat Ratna, Modi ji has provided strength to such people by who works for the backward classes, underprivileged sections of society and fight for social justice for them,"" Shah said.
This award is not only a recognition of Thakur's past achievements but also serves as an inspiration for future generations, said the Home Minister, pointing out it is a reminder of the values that Thakur stood for - simplicity, inclusiveness, and the tireless pursuit of social justice.
The Home Minister also paid floral tributes to Karpoori Thakur whom the Government of India on Tuesday announced to honour with the highest civilian award Bharat Ratna recognising the contribution of the stalwart of social justice and an inspiring figure in Indian politics.
This prestigious award is a tribute to Karpoori Thakur's lifelong dedication to the upliftment of the underprivileged sections of society and his relentless fight for Social Justice. Known affectionately as 'Jan Nayak' (People's Leader), Thakur's simplicity in his personal conduct was highly inspiring and contribution to Indian politics has been monumental.
Karpoori Thakur was born in 1924 in one of the most backward sections of society - the 'Nai Samaj'. He was a remarkable leader whose political journey was marked by his unwavering commitment to the marginalised sections of society. He served as the Chief Minister of Bihar and was a key figure in the struggle against social discrimination and inequality. His commitment to affirmative action gave representation and opportunities to the poor, oppressed, exploited and deprived sections of the country. His policies and reforms were pioneering in bringing about significant changes in the lives of many, especially in the fields of education, employment and farmer welfare.
By honouring Karpoori Thakur, the government recognizes his role as a symbol of democracy and social justice. The government also acknowledges his deep impact as a motivating figure for the marginalised sections of society. His life and work embody the spirit of the Indian Constitution, which advocates for equality, fraternity, and justice for all. (ANI)"

Prime Minister of Slovakia Robert Fico has said
Ukraine should concede the loss of some of the territories that were previously under its control in order to end the conflict with Russia, Slovakia's prime minister Robert Fico has said.
Fico made the statement during a weekend interview with broadcaster RTVS dedicated to his upcoming visit to Ukraine. The Slovak PM is scheduled to travel on Wednesday to Uzhgorod, a city near the border between the two countries, for a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Denis Shmygal.
The ongoing conflict between Moscow and Kiev can't be resolved through military means and should end in compromise that might be ""painful for both sides,"" he said.
""What are [the Ukrainians] waiting for? That the Russians will leave Donbass and Lugansk, or that they will leave Crimea? It's unrealistic,"" Fico insisted.
The People's Republics of Donetsk and Lugansk were officially incorporated into the Russian state in the fall of 2022, together the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions, as a result of referendums held in those areas. Crimea has been a part of Russia since 2014.
The continuation of the fighting that has been underway since February 2022 will only make Moscow stronger, Fico added.
The Slovak premier also said Ukraine was ""not a sovereign, independent country"" due to it being ""under the absolute influence of the US."" He criticized the EU for making ""a huge mistake"" of following Washington's lead when it comes to dealing with Kiev, instead of developing its own ""sovereign"" view on the issue.
As for his talks this week with Shmygal, Fico promised to tell his Ukrainian counterpart that he's against Kiev's membership in NATO, as that would be ""exactly the basis of World War Three,"" and to reiterate that President Vladimir Zelensky's government won't be getting any more weapons from Bratislava.
The prime minister's interview caused angry reaction in Kiev, with the head of the Ukrainian parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee Aleksandr Merezhko demanded that Fico's trip to Ukraine be canceled for his ""disgraceful statements"" that crossed ""the red line.""
""Every country should have at least minimal self-respect. It's absolutely unacceptable to pretend that nothing is happening when the leader of another state makes statements that question the sovereignty of a state"" that he's about to visit, Merezhko wrote on Facebook.
Fico made a comeback as Slovakia's prime minister in October after his party won the snap election in the EU country, campaigning on promises of, among other measures, cutting military aid to Kiev and improving ties with Moscow.

Speculations are rife that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will possibly cross over to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) again, an alliance he left in 2022 to join hands with the Opposition and form 'mahagathbandhan'.
If Nitish switches sides, this will mark the fourth time in just over a decade that he would do it.

Last year, Almodovar initially discussed Swinton's casting. 'The Human Voice', a 2021 Venice short film directed by Pedro Almodovar, marked the Scottish actress's maiden foray into the English-language feature film industry.
The short film 'Strange Way of Life', starring Pedro Pascal and Ethan Hawke, was his follow-up and was screened at Cannes last year. Almodovar claimed that the shorts served as a trial run to help him become more at ease directing performers speaking in English. He was supposed to helm the English-language film 'A Manual for Cleaning Women', which was supposed to star and be produced by Cate Blanchett. However, he withdrew from the project in 2022.
Almodovar is regarded as one of the best European directors of his generation. He has received praise from critics around the world for films like All About My Mother, which was nominated for two Oscars in 2003 for best original screenplay and best director, Talk to Her, which won the best international feature Oscar in 2000, and Pain and Glory, which earned nominations for a best international feature and best actor for Antonio Banderas.

Operation Steadfast Defender 24 will see some 90,000 NATO military personnel take part in a range of drills across Europe in coming months. Fifty naval vessels, 80 aircraft and over 1,000 combat vehicles are involved.
The exercises ""will show that NATO can conduct and sustain complex multi-domain operations over several months, across thousands of kilometers, from the high north to central and eastern Europe, and in any condition,"" the 31-nation alliance said.
Logistics
""We do all of this to show we have the readiness, preparedness and the forces in place to remove any room for miscalculation or misunderstanding in Moscow about our readiness to protect every inch of NATO territory. And as long as we do that there will be no attack against NATO territory,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters in Brussels Tuesday.
The logistical challenge of moving soldiers and equipment is a vital part of the exercise, said Liana Fix, fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington.
""How do they get there? And how do they get there quick? Because the war in Ukraine has shown that being too slow means that a part of your territory can be occupied and has to be re-conquered, rather than defending that territory the moment the attack happens,"" Fix told VOA.
Sweden, which hopes to join NATO in coming months, will also take part in the operation, the biggest NATO drill since the Reforger exercises of the 1980s. Hungary is the only NATO member yet to ratify Sweden's application.
Chair of the NATO Military Committee Admiral Rob Bauer, center, Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, left, and Supreme Allied Commander Transformation General Chris Badia prepare to talk to the press in Brussels, Jan. 18, 2024.
Ukraine
The exercises come ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, on February 24. The conflict has descended into a war of attrition, with neither side seemingly able to make significant territorial gains.
While NATO flexes its muscles in Europe, Kyiv is running low on ammunition, as military aid packages in both the United States and the European Union remain blocked by political infighting.
""The narrative from Ukraine is that Ukraine is defending NATO. And that is a valid narrative if one follows the logic that Ukraine is actually diminishing Russia's army, has diminished Russia's army, and has diminished the military threat that Russia poses to the NATO alliance. So from Ukraine's perspective, it must be a lonely moment to watch this NATO exercise,"" analyst Liana Fix told VOA.
Artillery
NATO this week signed a $1.2 billion contract to buy some 220,000 rounds of artillery ammunition. The alliance says it will pass on the shells to Ukraine, which has complained of ammunition shortages, or to member states that want to replenish stockpiles that have been depleted through supplying Ukrainian forces.
""This is important to defend our own territory, to build up our own stocks, but also to continue to support Ukraine,"" said NATO chief Stoltenberg.
""We will support Ukraine with the systems and the weapons and ammunitions they need to prevail as a sovereign independent country, because we cannot allow (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin to win in Ukraine. That would be a tragedy for the Ukrainians and dangerous for all of us,"" he added."

Addressing the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs in Lagos, Jaishankar noted that the world order established in 1945 persists, with those in control reluctant to create more opportunities for others.
Jaishankar said, ""When I spoke about globalization and concentration a different challenge emerging out of that is how globalization itself has been weaponized that today currency is a weapon, trade is a weapon, tourism is a weapon, that dominant players they may be dominant as producers they may be dominant as consumers that they often with very little hesitation leverage their market shares on the global system for their particular national purpose and of course underlying all of this since this is an Institute dealing with International Affairs is a challenge that we know very well which is a world order that was devised in 1945 when the members of the United Nations were roughly 25 per cent of what they are today and that world order continues obstinately because those who are in the driving seat don't want to create more seats for other people to be at that engine.""He noted that the global agenda in so many ways today is about restoring the world to its natural diversity. Jaishankar called restoring natural diversity a ""collective objective"" and highlighted the challenges that the world faces in the process.
In his remarks, Jaishankar said, ""The global agenda in many ways today is about restoring the world to its natural diversity because the world was diverse the world is diverse it was distorted by the period of Western domination and in a post-Colonial world today restoring that natural diversity is actually a collective objective. Now what are the challenges to that process one of course is while many of us attained independence we have all built our Nations and societies.""The minister underscored the challenges of the current global agenda, stating that it revolves around restoring the world to its natural diversity. He referred to this as a ""collective objective"" but acknowledged the difficulties involved in achieving it.
""The reality is also that the old domination has not let go that in different ways it may not be the imperialism of the 19th and early 20th century but in different ways today many of those who dominated the world for the last 200 to 300 years continue to do so with new instruments with new regimes with different techniques and how do we contest that how do we overcome that how do we make sure the world is a fairer place that is challenge number one. Challenge number two is of a more recent vintage we we have for the last three decades spoken about globalisation.""He said that globalisation today is a combination of Economics of interdependence of interpenetration of a shared common dependence or technology of a degree of mobility.
He said, ""Globalisation has been a game changer some people argue that there was always globalization, people always moved from one place to another that is correct after all people moved from Africa to other parts of the world that's how the globe became the globe but globalization today has a very specific sense it is a combination of economics of interdependence of interpenetration of a shared common dependence or technology of a degree of mobility that we have never experienced before.""""Now while globalization has had many positive results. It has also undeniably led to such deep economic concentrations that much of the world today depends on production of a few geographies. Now it worked when we believed that the entire world could be run in the manner in which Japanese cars are produced in Nagoya that everything came just in time to meet the requirements of the day. We were wrong but we didn't know it and then COVID came and COVID brought home to every one of us that the most basic things of our life,"" he added.
He said that the world depended on suppliers and producers from far away before COVID-19 pandemic. He highlighted how people struggled for gloves, masks and basic medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. He stressed that world today needs to be de-risked from over-concentration.
""We were often dependent on suppliers and producers from far away not just dependent on them as we discovered during COVID we were hostage to them that many of us struggled with masks and gloves and ppes and ventilators and basic medicines and vaccines, we struggled for food. So, one of the big takeaways from the covid experience is our world today needs to be de-risked from the over-concentration that if you speak about a more balanced World a more democratic,"" Jaishankar said.
""World Democratic is not just political Democratic it is not just the rights of different nations. Democratic also means every region sometimes every large country must have within its own grasp the basics of its production so that it is economically and socially secure this is our challenge number two.""Speaking about the third challenge, Jaishankar said, ""The setting of narratives and I spoke about the old domination, the old domination today doesn't tell you what to do with a stick the old domination will tell you what to do through social media through regular media through devising what is politically correct to setting standards and this narrative setting is actually a very powerful force today in international relations. There are thinking there are ideologies there are regimes which are raised up brought down made irrelevant brought to the center through narrative setting in all of this of course we have the challenges of the polarization of the world.""He noted that India knows the challenges of the polarization of the world as the country struggled with it during the G20 Presidency. He stressed that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has polarised the East and West. He emphasised that globe itself is divided.
""We in India know it particularly strongly and recently because we struggled with it during our G20 presidency that a conflict such as one taking place in Ukraine has polarised the East and the West. The developmental issues have polarized the North and the South so how do we today talk of a global agenda when the globe itself is so divided that is a challenge in itself,"" Jaishankar said.
""There are of course the traditional what are called global issues these are challenges which threaten every nation but are bigger than what could be contained within the borders so it could be terrorism, a challenge which I know Nigeria has had to experience in its own way like we have had to in in a different way or maritime security, piracy, challenges of course of climate events that we are seeing more and more frequently. So, these are some of the challenges that we have to overcome if you have to really get along with the global agenda some as I said are traditional some have evolved some are more recent,"" he added.
Notably, Jaishankar is on a visit to Nigeria from January 21-23. During this, he will co-chair the 6th India-Nigeria Joint Commission Meeting (JCM) with his counterpart and meet with other leaders.
The EAM will also inaugurate the 3rd edition of the Nigeria-India Business Council meeting. He will also chair the regional conference of Indian Heads of Missions.

Javier ""Chicharito"" Hernandez is returning to Chivas in Mexico's Liga MX following a four-year stint with the Los Angeles Galaxy.
Hernandez, 35, played in 74 MLS matches (65 starts) for Los Angeles from 2020-23 and scored 38 goals with six assists. He had 17 goals in 2021 and 18 in 2022 before being limited to just one over nine matches in 2023, as his season was cut short in June due to a torn ACL in his right knee.
The striker began his professional career with Chivas in his native Guadalajara from 2006-10. He then went to Europe, where he played for Manchester United, Real Madrid, Bayer Leverkusen, West Ham United and Sevilla.
His career now comes full circle with his return to Chivas.
""My home, my family, my team, my everything,"" Hernandez wrote in an Instagram post on Wednesday. ""See you soon!""
Hernandez's 38 goals rank seventh all-time in Galaxy history, but the team did not renew his contract after last season. He is also the Mexican national team's all-time leading scorer with 52 goals in 109 appearances, the most recent coming in 2019.
""It's official. Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez returns to the team of his Amores for the Clausura 2024,"" a Chivas press release said. ""We are convinced that his love for the Institution, the experience acquired during his successful career and the leadership that characterizes him will be reflected in this new stage with Chivas.""

The far-right party ""aims to replace the existing constitutional order with an authoritarian state based on an ethnic 'people's community',"" the court found.
""Its political concept disrespects the human dignity of all those who are not part of the ethnic 'people's community', "" the court said. Also, it added, the party's program is ""incompatible with the principle of democracy.""
The court has twice stopped short of banning the NPD as it deemed the party too politically insignificant. However, in 2017 the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) added the possibility of withdrawing funding from anti-constitutional parties to the Basic Law.
Following media reports about politicians from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) attending an event organized by right-wing extremists, millions of people across Germany have taken to the streets to protest against right-wing extremism.
Due to the revelations, there are now calls for legal action to be taken against the AfD as well. While the party is popular in election polls, even leading in some eastern German states, parts of it are classified as far-right by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
A petition to ban the AfD has so far collected more than 720,000 signatures. However, the German government remains cautious about initiating such a move. The hurdles are ""justifiably very high"" and the damage caused by a failure would ""be massive,"" said Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck."

New Delhi is tracking a Chinese research vessel that has entered the Indian Ocean region and is heading for the Maldives to reportedly run a survey operation, Indian media reported on Monday, citing Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) observers and maritime tracking portals.
The vessel - Xiang Yang Hong 03 - was expected to dock in Sri Lanka but changed course after Colombo announced a year-long moratorium on foreign research vessels in December last year amid repeated requests from India and the US.
A report in the Economic Times describing the Chinese ship as a ""spy vessel"" said India is tracking its activities, including any attempts to gather data on resources in the region. The ship is expected to reach the Maldives next week, according to reports. Sources in the Indian military told the News18 network that the Navy is aware of the vessel's presence and has been monitoring its movement.
The development comes amid a diplomatic row between New Delhi and Male, with the latter asking the Indian government to withdraw its troops from the archipelago by March 15, and less than two weeks after Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, who has been cultivating closer ties with China, visited Beijing.
During the visit, Muizzu held talks with President Xi Jinping. The countries signed 20 bilateral agreements, which included a pledge by Beijing to extend funding for infrastructure in the Indian Ocean archipelago. The countries also vowed to elevate ties to 'comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership'.
China first forayed into the Indian Ocean in 2008 to conduct anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden, and has maintained a presence in the region ever since. However, New Delhi has expressed concerns recently over Chinas' rapidly expanding presence in the Indian Ocean region.
Speaking in New York in September last year, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said that in the past 20-25 years, ""there has been a steady increase in the Chinese naval presence and activity in the Indian Ocean"" and that India has been watching these developments ""very carefully.""
India has viewed the presence of Chinese research vessels near its shores, including in Sri Lanka in 2022, as problematic. A representative of the Indian Navy cautioned the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defense last year that at any point in time, five to nine Chinese ships are operating in the Indian Ocean region, in addition to their research vessels, ""which can influence our security,"" The Hindu reported.

Vanessa Dougnac, a contributor to several French-language publications, including the weekly magazine Le Point and the daily La Croix newspaper, received a notice last week from the Indian home ministry saying that her work was ""inimical"" to national interests.
""Her journalistic activities are malicious and critical in manner... they create biased perception about India,"" the notice said.
""In addition, her activities may also provoke disorder and disturb peace.""
The notice gave Dougnac, who has been based in India for 22 years, and who has an Indian spouse, until 2 February to challenge the decision to cancel her permanent residency - a move that would force her to leave the country.
Press freedom
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has been monitoring the situation.
""We're very concerned by this decision. This is happening as the French president is visiting ... and we want this brought up at these discussions,"" editorial director Anne Bocande told RFI.
The notice was issued to Dougnac a week before Macron's arrival in India, where he will be the guest of honour at the annual Republic Day military parade on Friday.
Macron has courted India as a strategic partner and buyer of arms, and his visit reciprocates his invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for last year's Bastille Day celebrations in Paris
Flashpoint topics
RSF said it wants all foreign journalists to be able to work in India without being intimidated, or without risking expulsion for what they cover.
Dougnac, who has reported on a number of flashpoint topics, including the ongoing Maoist Naxalite insurgency in parts of rural India, denied ""all the allegations and imputations"" made against her in the letter.
""India is my home, a country which I deeply love and respect, and I have never engaged in any acts that are in any manner prejudicial to Indian interests,"" she said in a statement.
The home ministry and foreign ministry were contacted for comment.

As we move toward January 26 this year, I do so with a heavier heart than usual. There are a few reasons for this. The history of January 26 is indelibly inked, yet what comes next remains a challenge.
The result of the 2023 Indigenous Voice referendum, where Australia decided Aboriginal people should not be recognised in the Constitution, nor have a say in matters that affect us, has hit many of us hard.
The ongoing promotion of January 26 as a day to ""celebrate all the things we love about Australia"" serves to minimise the challenges that this moment represents for Aboriginal people and for our non-Indigenous allies.
There are many things everyone can agree January 26 marks: it is the moment that Captain Arthur Phillip set foot on the soil of Sydney Cove and claimed the land of this continent for the British. He did so through an assumption of terra nullius. This was in keeping with 18th century European practices of colonisation whereby they justified sovereignty through means of occupation (assumption of terra nullius), cession (treaty) or conquest (military force).
Terra nullius was found much later to be nothing more than a legal fiction. It failed to recognise Aboriginal peoples' society and relationships with the lands, waters and skies for what it was: pre-existing sovereignty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
We have always known, and the laws of Australia have recognised since 1993, that Australia was not terra nullius. This crucial detail underpins the ongoing challenges of national identity when it comes to January 26.
Many people believe January 26 is the day Australia came into being. It's not.
Australia was not Australia until the ratification of the 1901 Constitution, which had followed a series of constitutional conventions, the first in 1891. This heralded a new phase in the colonisers' history, creating a Commonwealth of six colonies under one federal system, based on the British Westminster System.
Aboriginal peoples were not included in the constitutional conventions, nor were any represented in any early Australian parliament.
Despite this, the new Constitution contained two specific clauses pertaining to Aboriginal peoples. Section 51(xxvi) around not being able to make specific laws regarding Aboriginal people; and, notably in this context, Section 127 which excluded Aboriginal people from being counted a part of the Australian population in the national census. All other Australians were 'amongst the people' in the Australian Constitution.
A few decades later, the 1938 sesquicentenary saw Aboriginal people bussed in to Sydney from Menindee in far west New South Wales, locked in nearby horse stables and forced to participate in the inaccurate re-enactment of Phillip's landing.
On the same day, a historic meeting of the Australian Aborigines League and the Aboriginal Progressive Association was held in Sydney at Australia Hall declaring January 26 a ""Day of Mourning"" and seeking citizenship rights and freedom for all Aboriginal peoples.
January 26 has only been a national public holiday since 1994. Before then, the date was variously acknowledged as First Landing Day, Anniversary Day, Foundation Day, Survival Day and the Day of Mourning.
Despite the fact that Aboriginal people were not reported as 'amongst the people' in the census, it is known that the Aboriginal population had dropped dramatically from that of 1788. By 1901, an estimated 150,000 Aboriginal people accounted for 4 percent of the total population, estimated to be around 3,788,120.
Only in the 1967 Referendum was Section 127 - excluding the reporting of the numbers of Aboriginal people - repealed, along with an adjustment to Section 51(xxvi), deleting the phrase ""other than the aboriginal race"".
There were striking consequences for deciding not to include Aboriginal population data in the national Census, not only constitutional ones - as important as they are. By rendering people invisible, inequity in health, education, rights of free movement, education, health and more - were profound, intergenerational, the effects of which continue.
Most jurisdictions held various acts and rights over each Aboriginal child, with periods ranging from Separation, Segregation, Protection and then Assimilation. Since then, the government has been able to measure and report the state of Aboriginal people to the Australian people.
A lot has happened following the 1967 referendum. In 1971, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were included in Census results for the first time. Communities, advocates and allies worked tirelessly to form the first Aboriginal Medical Service, Aboriginal Legal Aid, Education Consultative Committee, Women's Groups and the Land Rights movements. Many of these groups were world first and remain in the hands and control of the community. These groups and others like them provide bespoke services to their local peoples.
Despite the knowledge of the many equity gaps in health, education and wellbeing, many of these services remain under-resourced, rely on annualised funding, and are not able to fully provide the services their communities need nor plan for programs consistently into the future.
These gaps are exacerbated by the fact many Aboriginal people live far from health, education and other services, with some having to travel hundreds of kilometres for care. Even today, the life expectancy for Aboriginal people is comparable with the whole of Australian data of the early 1980s. In other words, our key measure of health, life expectancy, remains more than 40 years behind that of other Australians.
Since the Apology to Australia's Indigenous Peoples offered by then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on 13 February 2008, the history of this nation is no longer in dispute. The effects of the original act of Arthur Philip and the Crown are still seen today in health outcomes, incarceration rates, out of home care, criminalisation of the effects of intergenerational grief, among others. The Annual Close the Gap reports and commentary still show life disparities across health, employment, home ownership and educational attainment.
Australia is rich. It has a life expectancy higher than the OECD average, lower preventable mortality, hosts the Â 12th largest economy in the world and has some of the highest household income with a place in the top 10 GDP.
The Indigenous Voice referendum was a step towards completing the unfinished business of this land. The ensuing debate saw most agree on the profound disadvantage Aboriginal people and the many injustices faced by people since 1788.
This same debate also saw a significant toxicity in Australian society - we had to ask the 96 percent of people who do not identify as Indigenous about letting us have a say about our own affairs. We asked all Australians to recognise us in the constitution of this land.
Despite nearly half of all Australians being born overseas, or being a child of such parents, Australia still said No. Is this an artefact of some sort, where many recent Australians don't recognise the colonial history of these lands, or of the continuing habitation of this place by Aboriginal people for 60,000-plus years?
A Yes vote would have meant so much to us, and have little or no day to day effect on the rest of the Australian people. I despair the lack of generosity, or insight, or knowledge in this decision by the majority of Australia.
Yet, there is a thirst for reconciliation, in some form. But - for me - the outcome of the same referendum shows the underbelly of harm, disadvantage and grievance for all to see. Still, all agree 'something' must be done.
For decades, we have heard new governments, departments, research groups and mainstream peak bodies make promises, get in tune with a new strategy or policy. Many prime ministers over decades ""claimed to support Indigenous recognition, but failed to achieve it"".
The idea that the debate around January 26 can be resolved by ignoring the complex history, by not facing the inequalities that have been the result of it and hoping that the ongoing health disparities will resolve over time without implementing the solutions offered by Aboriginal people, needs to end.
This year, January 26, offers a chance to reflect on who we are as a nation. Aboriginal peoples across the land have always known what it is to be on these ancient lands.
I hope that one of the wealthiest nations on earth can look beyond its blinkers and get it right for Aboriginal people. Listen to Aboriginal people and the community peak bodies that represent so many of us. Don't water down what these groups are asking for, or the sound solutions they present.
The ongoing promotion of January 26 as a day ""celebrate all the things we love about Australia"" serves to minimise the challenges that this moment represents for Aboriginal people.
We have a real opportunity to become a good ancestor for those who come after us, as those before have been for us. Right now, I don't hold much hope - other than hope I am wrong.

HO1HQSN56D_EDTE73HA3SLQ53C,It's time the ABC resisted external threats and attacks,"Independent Australia 22nd January 2024, 17:52 GMT+11","Independent Australia 22nd January 2024, 17:52 GMT+11",20240122,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274102513/its-time-the-abc-resisted-external-threats-and-attacks,"The ABC's sacking of journalist Antoinette Lattouf raises questions about its independence from outside influences and willingness to stand up against external threats and attacks, writes Dr Victoria Fielding.
THE PUBLIC BROADCASTER'S capitulation to external forces is not just a problem for their journalists who want to uphold the ABC's purpose of reporting in the public interest, but also for the public, who the ABC is meant to serve.
Lattouf was fired from ABC radio in December, ostensibly for sharing a social media post by Human Rights Watch (HRW) on her personal Instagram account which reported that Israel was using starvation as a weapon of warfare.
Lattouf says she had been told by her manager not to post ""anything"" while she was working there ""because of the risk of the perception that you are biased and not balanced"". The ABC are desperately afraid of being accused of left-wing bias, while right-wing bias is apparently fine. This asymmetry in policing standards of neutrality at the ABC, is, paradoxically, an overt form of bias.
The ABC is now engaged in what will likely be a protracted dispute with Lattouf at the Fair Work Commission where she says she is fighting for free speech, against racism and for ""a fair independent and robust ABC"".
This dispute will hopefully start a much-needed public conversation about ABC management's willingness to stand up for its independence. Lattouf's firing is yet another episode which shows how easily the ABC capitulates to those who seek to destroy it.
Politicised attacks are damaging the ABC's editorial independence Australians deserve an independent ABC. Not one that purposely mirrors other often politically compromised reporting, like Murdoch media, to avoid 'left-wing' labels.There is already evidence that external influences may have played a role in the ABC's decision to fire Latouff. Jan Fran has questioned whether Lattouf's HRW post was really the culprit, considering ABC itself did two reports about the human rights organisation's accusations about Israel ""weaponising starvation in Gaza"".Reporting by Nine newspapers has also revealed the ABC was subject to a letter-writing campaign by a group of Israel-supporting lawyers, urging them to fire Lattouf. Leaked WhatsApp messages revealed that hours before Lattouf was fired, a group member shared a letter from ABC chairperson Ita Buttrose saying their concerns were noted and that she had directed the ABC's chief content officer to deal with it.While this lobbying has received much media attention, what has received less attention is Sky News' attacks on Lattouf. These attacks focused on Lattouf's investigations about the veracity of a video taken at a pro-Palestinian protest at the Sydney Opera House on 9 October 2023.Writing for Crikey on 14 December 2023, Lattouf with Cam Wilson questioned the veracity of a video much hyped by Sky News and other media which claimed to show protestors shouting antisemitic hate speech.The next day, in characteristic anti-actual-journalism style, Sky News' Sharri Markson accused Lattouf of being ""from the left"" and criticised her investigative reporting.On the same day, Latouff responded to Markson's accusations in an Instagram video, refreshingly clapping back in a way that most journalists do not do when they are attacked by Murdoch outlets. Just five days later, the ABC fired Latouff. And of course, Sky News was thrilled.In an email to ABC staff who have threatened to walk off the job over Lattouf's ousting, Managing Director David Anderson wrote 'The ABC rejects any claim that it has been influenced by any external pressure' and that the ABC took ""legitimate"" criticism and complaints seriously, and would 'continue to support [staff] and their work'. This is unlikely to reassure journalists; one ABC staff member told The Guardian anonymously that Lattouf's firing was just one of many examples of staff not feeling ""backed from external attacks"".This staff member also raised the ABC's lack of support for Stan Grant. In August 2023, Grant accused Murdoch's The Australian of being a ""racist hit squad"". He said the ABC did not defend him when he was systematically attacked by Murdoch outlets, citing this as the reason why he resigned.There is much evidence that rather than standing up to external pressure, ABC management obediently does what it is told. One such example was Liberal Senator Sarah Henderson thanking Anderson for ""quickly"" rearranging ABC scheduling after she messaged him complaining Senator Jacinta Price's National Press Club speech was only going to be shown on ABC News 24 and not on the ABC's main channel.Another example was when much loved ABC radio Statewide Drive presenter Nicole Chvastek resigned and accused the ABC of bullying after she was told by an ABC executive to ""get a Liberal"" for an interview. This directive came in May 2022 after Nationals MP Darren Chester complained to the ABC about Chvastek reporting allegations that the Morrison Government was favouring Liberal and National seats in their flood response. #9 TOP IA STORY OF 2023: ABC complaint over Insiders' collaboration with Murdoch's News Corp Coming in at ninth in our most popular stories of the year is one by former ABC journalist and now star IA columnist Alan Austin - who always features in our top ten - with this incisive December story about his former employer and its growing relationship with the Murdoch media.These incidents demonstrate that there is an insidious campaign of interference in the ABC by conservative political politicians, lobbyists and media. When powerful people are criticised or scrutinised by ABC journalists - when journalists do their jobs as watchdogs - they use their power to attack journalists. Rather than stand up against these political attacks, ABC management too often weakly surrenders.When asked about the ABC's dispute with Lattouf, Prime Minister Albanese refused to criticise the ABC, saying the public broadcaster is independent from government. He then threw shade on the former Liberal government saying:This is an honourable position for Albanese to take, but where does that leave the public in trying to assert the independence of the ABC?

Australians deserve an independent ABC. Not one that purposely mirrors other often politically compromised reporting, like Murdoch media, to avoid 'left-wing' labels.
There is already evidence that external influences may have played a role in the ABC's decision to fire Latouff. Jan Fran has questioned whether Lattouf's HRW post was really the culprit, considering ABC itself did two reports about the human rights organisation's accusations about Israel ""weaponising starvation in Gaza"".
Reporting by Nine newspapers has also revealed the ABC was subject to a letter-writing campaign by a group of Israel-supporting lawyers, urging them to fire Lattouf. Leaked WhatsApp messages revealed that hours before Lattouf was fired, a group member shared a letter from ABC chairperson Ita Buttrose saying their concerns were noted and that she had directed the ABC's chief content officer to deal with it.
While this lobbying has received much media attention, what has received less attention is Sky News' attacks on Lattouf. These attacks focused on Lattouf's investigations about the veracity of a video taken at a pro-Palestinian protest at the Sydney Opera House on 9 October 2023.
Writing for Crikey on 14 December 2023, Lattouf with Cam Wilson questioned the veracity of a video much hyped by Sky News and other media which claimed to show protestors shouting antisemitic hate speech.
The next day, in characteristic anti-actual-journalism style, Sky News' Sharri Markson accused Lattouf of being ""from the left"" and criticised her investigative reporting.
On the same day, Latouff responded to Markson's accusations in an Instagram video, refreshingly clapping back in a way that most journalists do not do when they are attacked by Murdoch outlets. Just five days later, the ABC fired Latouff. And of course, Sky News was thrilled.
In an email to ABC staff who have threatened to walk off the job over Lattouf's ousting, Managing Director David Anderson wrote 'The ABC rejects any claim that it has been influenced by any external pressure' and that the ABC took ""legitimate"" criticism and complaints seriously, and would 'continue to support [staff] and their work'. This is unlikely to reassure journalists; one ABC staff member told The Guardian anonymously that Lattouf's firing was just one of many examples of staff not feeling ""backed from external attacks"".
This staff member also raised the ABC's lack of support for Stan Grant. In August 2023, Grant accused Murdoch's The Australian of being a ""racist hit squad"". He said the ABC did not defend him when he was systematically attacked by Murdoch outlets, citing this as the reason why he resigned.
There is much evidence that rather than standing up to external pressure, ABC management obediently does what it is told. One such example was Liberal Senator Sarah Henderson thanking Anderson for ""quickly"" rearranging ABC scheduling after she messaged him complaining Senator Jacinta Price's National Press Club speech was only going to be shown on ABC News 24 and not on the ABC's main channel.
Another example was when much loved ABC radio Statewide Drive presenter Nicole Chvastek resigned and accused the ABC of bullying after she was told by an ABC executive to ""get a Liberal"" for an interview. This directive came in May 2022 after Nationals MP Darren Chester complained to the ABC about Chvastek reporting allegations that the Morrison Government was favouring Liberal and National seats in their flood response.

A bench of Justices Bela Trivedi and Ujjal Bhuyan cancelled the bail granted to the Wadhawan brothers.
It said that the High Court and trial court had erred in providing default bail to the Wadhawans.
""We have no hesitation that the chargesheet having been filed and cognisance being taken in due time, respondents could not have claimed statutory bail as a right. High Court and lower court greatly erred. Trial court to hear afresh on regular bail. Appeals allowed accordingly,"" the bench said while pronouncing the order.
The top court set aside the findings of the High Court and the trial court, saying that the Wadhawan brothers cannot claim the statutory right of default bail on the ground that the investigation is pending against the other accused.
The apex court allowed the appeal filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against bail granted to them.
Under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), an accused becomes entitled to a grant of statutory bail if the probe agency fails to file the charge sheet on the conclusion of the investigation in a criminal case within 60 or 90 days period.
In this case, CBI had filed the chargesheet on the 88th day after registration of the FIR and the trial court granted default bail to them and the Delhi High Court upheld the order. The charge sheet was filed on October 15, 2022, and cognisance was taken.
The trial court had granted bail to them noting that the charge sheet filed by the CBI was incomplete.
On July 19 last year, they were arrested in relation to the case. The FIR in the case was based on a complaint made by the Union Bank of India. (ANI)"

Five others were injured in the accident, the FBC reported late Sunday.
Authorities are still trying to establish what caused the driver of the dry freight truck to lose control of the vehicle.
Although Ethiopia has one of the lowest per capita car ownership rates in the world, deadly traffic accidents are relatively common. The blame is often put on bad roads, reckless driving, lax enforcement of safety rules, and a flawed system for issuing driving licenses."

To strengthen ties, the Western Australian government is exploring a direct aviation link, possibly in southern India. Notably, there has been no direct flight from India to Western Australia.
Western Australia's Deputy Premier, Treasurer, and Minister for Transport and Tourism, Rita Saffioti, has successfully concluded a delegation-led mission in Delhi.
She engaged in meetings with Indian officials, hotel industry businessmen, and aviation sector representatives to explore collaboration and enhanced connectivity.
Speaking to ANI, Saffioti conveyed that the Western Australian government would like to ""grow"" business economic ties, saying ""there is a huge opportunity for Indian businesses.""Western Australia is also in contact with a number of players in India, including public sector units and private units for investing in critical minerals, Saffioti informed.
Promoting tourism to Western Australia was the priority talking point for the Deputy Premier during her trade mission in Delhi. India is currently Western Australia's 10th largest trading partner.
""Tourism is a huge opportunity to grow the relationship between India and Australia. We have a lot of tourists but we want to grow tourism. That's one of the key aims to promote investment in tourism infrastructure in Western Australia,"" she said.
In 2023, as many as 90,000 people from India visited Western Australia including those who visited the state for international education. Around 30,000 Indians visited last year for tourism purposes.
""We recorded 15 per cent growth in the number of people visiting from India in 2022. We believe there is an enormous opportunity to grow tourism,"" Saffioti asserted.
Saffioti suggested that Western Australia is ""open"" to any kind of investment in particular into hotels and other tourism-related experiences.
She also met with the Chairman of TATA, India's largest conglomerate, to explore potential collaborations.
The Invest and Trade WA Business Luncheon held at the Australian High Commission and meeting with the High Commissioner emphasised the commitment to bilateral economic and social growth through promoting tourism to Western Australia and during the luncheon, businesses like Perdaman Group advocated the importance of this.
Noting that Western Australia is abundant in critical minerals, the minister said that the state offers the potential to be a major producer of renewable energy to support India's clean energy transition and sustainable development (electric vehicles).
""This is a growing partnership in relation to mineral development. We have an abundance of critical minerals such as lithium and vanadium and potential as a major producer of renewable energy, including renewable hydrogen and energy technology, which places Australia in a prime position to support India's clean energy transition and sustainable development,"" she said.
""As energy demand rises, India is likely to meet a greater share of its energy needs through imports. There are opportunities for Indian investment in Western Australia through offtake agreements for key battery minerals,"" she added. (ANI)"

Nara Lokesh said that righteousness will triumph over unrighteousness, and the aspirations of Amaravati will be realized. Taking to X, he said that Amaravati has stood against conspiracies and intrigues.
Farmers in the Amaravati region have been conducting an agitation for the last 1,500 days in support of their demand for Amravati as the state capital and opposing the state government's move to have three capitals.
""Amaravati stood against conspiracies and intrigues. Congratulations to the farmers who have been fighting against the dictator for 1,500 days,"" Nara Lokesh posted on X.
Nara Lokesh paid tribute to those who lost their lives while fighting for the cause of Amaravati as the capital. He expressed confidence that justice would be served to the farmers who sacrificed their land for the welfare of the state and future generations.
People of Amaravati region villages have given almost 34,000 acres of land for the development of capital for the state.
The farmers relinquished their lands under the Land Pooling Scheme (LPS) in 2014 for the construction of Andhra Pradesh's capital city. The LPS was an initiative of the then Chandrababu Naidu.
Under the LPS, the government promised a partnership to landowners instead of compensation under the Land Acquisition Act.
Originally conceptualised to streamline the establishment of capital and minimise investment in land acquisition, the LPS assured the farmers developed returnable plots in the emerging city.
However, the police changed with the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) came to power. On December 17, 2019, CM Jagan proposed three capitals for Andhra Pradesh.
According to the proposal, Visakhapatnam would be the 'executive capital' of the State, housing the Secretariat and key government departments, while Kurnool would become the 'judicial capital', with the High Court being relocated there. Amaravati, meanwhile, would continue to function as the 'legislative capital' of the State, housing the State Assembly. (ANI)"

Kiev's forces knowingly downed a Russian plane carrying Ukrainian prisoners of war that crashed on Wednesday, killing all on board, in order to pin the attack on Moscow, the Defense Ministry has said, adding that Kiev had once again shown its ""true colors"".
In a statement following the incident, the ministry revealed that a Russian IL-76 cargo plane had crashed in Belgorod Region, claiming the lives of 65 Ukrainian POWs, as well as six crew members and three Russian soldiers.
The Defense Ministry claimed that the ""Kiev regime committed a terrorist act"" by targeting the plane, which was transporting POWs for a further prisoner exchange, from the Chkalovsky military airbase near Moscow to Belgorod.
Russian officials stated that the plane had been hit at 11:15am local time by Ukrainian air defense forces stationed in Kharkov Region, adding that the military had registered the launch of two missiles.
Confirming that everyone aboard was killed in the attack, the ministry said that the Ukrainian leadership was well aware of the flight and its mission. It noted that Moscow and Kiev had agreed to conduct a prisoner exchange later on Wednesday near the Russian border village of Kolotilovka in Belgorod Region.
Russian officials stated earlier that the attack used either US-made or German air defense systems, with State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin urging Kiev's Western backers to finally realize that they are backing a ""Nazi regime.""
Russian MP Andrey Kartapolov said a second plane had been carrying another 80 captured Ukrainian troops, which was swiftly diverted from the danger zone after the first aircraft was attacked.
The Ukrainian Defense Ministry has so far declined to comment on the incident, saying only that it was looking into the matter. However, Andrey Yusov, a spokesman for Kiev's Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR), confirmed that Russia and Ukraine were indeed scheduled to carry out a prisoner exchange on Wednesday, adding that it had since been canceled.
Ukrainian newspaper Ukrainskaya Pravda initially reported, citing unnamed defense officials in Kiev, that the Il-76 was destroyed by the country's military. Later, however, it removed the mention of Kiev's role in the attack.

""In the Gynavapi case, the ASI has given a decisive report. It is clear that before the current structure, there was a huge Sanatani Temple.

Under interim peace accords reached in the 1990s, Israel's finance ministry collects tax on behalf of the Palestinians and makes monthly transfers to the Western-backed PA, which exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
But there have been constant wrangles over the arrangement, including Israel's demand that the funds do not reach Hamas, which it and most of the West deem a terrorist group.
Hamas seized control of Gaza from the Western-backed PA in 2007 after a brief civil war, and two years after Israel withdrew settlers and military forces. Despite the Hamas takeover, many PA public sector employees in Gaza kept their jobs and continued to be paid with transferred tax revenues.
Israel is now at war in Gaza to wipe out Hamas after a cross-border terror attack by militants of the Palestinian Islamist movement on Oct. 7.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the cabinet decision on the tax funds was supported by Norway and the United States, which will be a guarantor that the framework holds.
Netanyahu's offices said the money, or any equivalent, will not be transferred 'in any situation, except with the approval of the Israeli finance minister, and also not through a third party.'
The Palestine Liberation Organization said Sunday it wanted the money in full and would not accept conditions that prevent it from paying its staff, including in Gaza.
'Any deductions from our financial rights or any conditions imposed by Israel that prevent the PA from paying our people in the Gaza Strip are rejected by us,' Hussein Al-Sheikh, secretary-general of the executive committee of the PLO, said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.
A spokesperson for Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who heads a far-right, pro-settlement party, confirmed that Norway would hold the funds under the arrangement.
'Not one shekel will go to Gaza,' said Smotrich, who has long been opposed to transferring funds to the PA.

The group said in an online statement that its fighters fired rockets and drones at a base near the Erbil airport in northern Iraq, the Ayn al-Asad airbase in western Iraq, and a U.S. base in Koniko gas field in Syria. The statement did not provide details about casualties.
The group said the attacks were part of a series of retaliatory measures against the U.S. forces amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip.
An Iraqi army officer in Anbar province told Xinhua that air defense weapons at Ayn al-Asad airbase shot down an explosive-laden drone targeting the base.
There has been no comment from the authorities in the Kurdish-run region of northern Iraq about the attack on the U.S. base near Erbil airport.

Just minutes after the major US media outlets declared Trump the winner of the Republican primary, the former UN ambassador, while speaking to her supporters in Concord, the New Hampshire state capital, said, ""New Hampshire is the first in the nation. It's not the last in the nation. This race is far from over.""Minutes after the last New Hampshire polling sites closed at 8 pm local time, the US media called the Republican primary race for Trump, cementing his strong lead in the race for the party nomination.
It is a significant victory for the former president and puts him in a commanding position to become the party's presidential candidate in November.
The former South Carolina governor plans to travel to her home state on Wednesday, ""fresh off the New Hampshire primary,"" a campaign advisory states, where she will host a rally ""to officially kick off her swing in the Palmetto State leading up to next month's first-in-the-south primary.""Haley's campaign had already released a memo on Tuesday morning emphasising her intention to stay in the race until at least March 5 for the 16 Super Tuesday primaries, a commitment the former UN ambassador repeated in her remarks at the Grappone Conference Centre.
On the other side of the proverbial aisle, US President Joe Biden won the New Hampshire Democratic primary as a write-in candidate after his name was not included on the printed ballot.
Biden was not among the 21 candidates listed on the ballot after New Hampshire defied the primary calendar set by the National Democratic Party.
However, due to the internal party clash, Biden did not register for the primary and the results and did not yield any nominating delegates. (ANI)"

A total of 146 personnel of the CISF handled the security arrangements for 350 VVIPs landed at Maharshi Valmiki International Airport during these two days.
Meanwhile, the CISF handled 42 flights, 32 chartered and 10 scheduled, movements on January 21, and 74 chartered flight movements, including 12 scheduled flights, on January 22-- the inauguration date of the Ram Temple.
As Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled the Ram Lalla idol at the Shri Ram Janmaboomi Temple in Ayodhya on January 22 and the ""Pran Pratishtha' ceremony began at 12.20 pm, a gathering of more than 7,000 people, including seers and prominent personalities, were present at the venue. They all reached with different flights at the newly constructed Maharishi Valmiki International Airport, whose security was handed over to the CISF on January 10.
On arrangements made by CISF in Ayodhya on January 21 and 22, CISF Deputy Inspector General Shrikant Kishore told ANI: ""We handled the biggest challenge at the Maharishi Valmiki International Airport. On January 9 when CISF took over there were only two flights at the airport and on January 21 we handled five scheduled departures, five scheduled arrivals and 32 charter planes. On January 22 we handled 74 flights. We also handled the movement of 350 VIPs...""Asked about the footfall and future challenges at the airport, Kishore said ""There has not been a decrease in footfall (in Ayodhya) after January 22.""""In the coming days, this will be an important airport...Ayodhya's airport is one of the hyper-sensitive airports and we are making arrangements accordingly,"" Kishore said.
The consecration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya was held on January 22 with Prime Minister Narendra Modi attending the rituals. Following the consecration, the shrine is now opened to the public.
It was a challenging task for the CISF to handle such a mega event amid high threat perception as the consecration ceremony was held after the first phase of the temple's construction, made possible by a Supreme Court judgment in 2019 on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit. The Hindu litigants argued that the Babri Mosque was constructed at the site of a temple marking the birthplace of Lord Ram. In 1992, the 16th-century mosque was demolished by ""kar sevaks"".
On January 10, the CISF took over the security of Maharishi Valmiki International Airport, Ayodhya Dham. The unit is headed by a Deputy Commandant rank officer. This move of the CISF to secure the airport aimed to ensure secure passage for pilgrims and visitors to the holy city, contributing to a safe and enriching experience for all.
This development brought the total number of airports under the protective umbrella of CISF to 68 as of date.
The deployment of CISF personnel at Maharishi Valmiki International Airport underscores the organization's unwavering dedication to maintaining the highest standards of security across the nation's vital transportation hubs. (ANI)"
IAC85YO4PZ_NZ3P7SPIDONEI2N,Interim Budget: FICCI advocates measures in comprehensive budget recommendations for 2024-25,"ANI 25th January 2024, 15:55 GMT+11","ANI 25th January 2024, 15:55 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105719/interim-budget-ficci-advocates-measures-in-comprehensive-budget-recommendations-for-2024-25,"New Delhi [India], January 25 (ANI): The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has presented a set of comprehensive recommendations ahead of the Interim Union Budget for 2024-25, outlining a strategic roadmap to fortify India's economic foundation.
The proposals span a spectrum of sectors, ranging from public investments to support for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), innovation, taxation, and the burgeoning start-up ecosystem.
At the core of FICCI's recommendations is a fervent call to sustain and intensify the thrust on investments.
Building on the encouraging data regarding capital formation and the increased investment-to-GDP ratio, FICCI emphasizes the need for continued public capital expenditure, particularly in physical, social, and digital infrastructure.
The organization contends that India stands at a crucial juncture, and in light of global uncertainties, the government should persist with significant investments in the forthcoming budget.
Furthermore, FICCI proposes the creation of an 'Indian Taxonomy' for green finance. The suggestion stems from the belief that a well-defined standardized taxonomy, comparable to global frameworks, is essential for evaluating exposure to sustainable versus non-sustainable activities.
This approach, FICCI argues, would enhance transparency in the financial sector, compelling institutions to set sustainability targets aligned with national and global goals.
In the wake of current global developments and the world exploring alternatives to China, FICCI recommends positioning India as the next global manufacturing hub.
The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes have proven successful, and FICCI suggests extending the concessional tax regime for manufacturing operations for at least five years to provide stability and certainty for potential investors.
This move is anticipated to attract large investments from global manufacturing companies, bolstering India's competitive edge.
Recognizing innovation as a cornerstone for economic growth, FICCI underlines the importance of supporting research and development (RD).
The organization proposes refinements to the existing patent box regime, extending concessional tax rates, and introducing incentives for new RD companies.
These recommendations aim to encourage innovation and ensure that companies investing in RD are adequately rewarded.
Additionally, FICCI suggests extending the concessional tax rate of 15 per cent to new RD companies setting up substantial facilities within the next five years, further promoting industrial growth.
In a bid to support the backbone of India's economy, the MSME sector, FICCI presents a series of recommendations.
Firstly, the organization proposes revising the qualifying criteria for mandatory registration on the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) platform.
By making registration mandatory for all companies with a turnover exceeding Rs 250 crore, FICCI aims to broaden the platform's reach, providing easier access to funds for MSMEs.
Leveraging the Account Aggregator framework for MSME lending is another key recommendation. FICCI argues that expanding the scope to include joint and corporate accounts would significantly benefit the MSME segment.
Moreover, the organization advocates for changing the NPA classification norms for MSMEs, extending the limit for classifying overdue payments from 90 to 180 days.
This extension, FICCI contends, would prevent the diversion of working capital towards loan repayments, preserving the normal business operations of MSMEs.
FICCI underscores the need to simplify compliance with respect to Tax Deducted at Source (TDS). The existing structure, with various provisions for different categories of payments, has led to categorization and interpretation disputes. To enhance the ease of doing business, FICCI recommends a roadmap for rationalizing the TDS rate structure, suggesting three categories and introducing a ""negative list"" of payments exempt from TDS.
This streamlined approach aims to reduce compliance burdens on taxpayers and mitigate disputes.
Drawing attention to the issue of double taxation in buy-back transactions conducted through the 'open market through stock exchange' method, FICCI proposes exempting Buyback Distribution Tax (BBT) for listed shares under this method.
This move aims to prevent double taxation on the same transaction, aligning taxation with the unique nature of these buy-backs.
FICCI envisions collaborative efforts between the banking industry and regulatory bodies to accelerate the creation of digital securities, particularly for physical collateral such as land and vehicles.
By digitizing these assets, the verification and lien-marking processes would become more efficient, fostering credit growth. The Account Aggregator framework could also be leveraged to expedite the adoption of information collateral, further increasing credit penetration.
Recognizing the pivotal role of start-ups in fostering innovation and economic growth, FICCI recommends treating listed and unlisted equities at par for computing long-term capital gains (LTCG).
This parity would make start-up and unlisted equity investments more attractive for both domestic and international investors.
Additionally, FICCI advocates for extending the benefit of tax deferral on Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) perquisites to all employees, irrespective of whether their companies qualify under section 80IAC.
In a bid to enhance dispute resolution mechanisms, FICCI proposes the creation of an independent forum comprising retired judges, professionals, or experts.
This forum would focus on disputes at the assessment or post-assessment levels. The recommendations outline a structured approach, including strict timelines, limited adjournments, and draft order reviews, to ensure a fair and expedited resolution.
This initiative aims to instill confidence in taxpayers, encouraging settlements and reducing the burden of litigation.
In conclusion, FICCI's budget recommendations are comprehensive, addressing diverse facets of India's economic landscape.
The proposals align with the current global economic scenario and strive to fortify India's position as a key player in the international arena.
As the country awaits the unveiling of the Interim Union Budget, FICCI's recommendations reflect a forward-looking vision for economic resilience, innovation, and sustained growth. (ANI)"

The Defence Research and Development Organisation chairman, in an interview with ANI, said the first set of BrahMos missile systems is expected to reach Philippines by the end of March. ""The ground systems should be sent in the next 10 days, the missiles will hopefully go by March (to Philippines),"" Kamat said.
BrahMos missiles export to the Philippines is the biggest ever defence export contract signed with any foreign country by India.
India had signed a deal with the Philippines worth USD 375 million in January 2022 for the supply of shore-based anti-ship variant of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile.
In an interview with ANI, the DRDO chairman said that exports are going to play a significant role in the defence sector.
""I am sure over the coming years exports are going to become a very important part of our portfolio,"" he said.
""So far, a lot of our hull-mounted sonars, lightweight torpedo, we have exported radars, we have now a lot of interested (countries) on Pinaka among others,"" the top DRDO official said.
He said that approximately Rs 4.94 lakh crores worth of DRDO-developed products have either been inducted in defence or have received Acceptance of Necessity (AoN) from the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC).
""The developments are now increasingly getting done much faster than earlier. My estimate is, more than 60 per cent or 70 per cent of the inducted products are in the last 5-7 years. This rate is going to increase dramatically as we go ahead,"" he added.
The BRAHMOS supersonic cruise missile system is one of the most successful missile programmes in the world. As the world's best and fastest precision-guided weapon, BRAHMOS has fortified India's deterrence power in 21st century.

Masquerade rituals in Bulgaria are believed to be dating back to pagan times, when people tried to chase away winter's evil spirits by putting on scary-looking ritual masks and making as much noise as possible with rattles and bells, and to bring fertility and health, and to prepare people for a new beginning.
This year's event, the ""Surva"" International Festival of Masquerade Games, attracted 105 masquerade groups from Bulgaria and 20 from other countries including Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia.
The three-day event, which will end on Sunday, kicked off Friday with a youth masquerade parade, involving 25 groups.
Surva is part of ""our cultural heritage and we value it greatly,"" Nikolay Nenov, head of the festival jury, told Xinhua.
There are different roles played in Bulgarian masquerade groups such as commander, bride, bridegroom, doctor, policeman and various animals.
According to Nenov, the festival in Pernik is a powerful stimulus for the formation of local identity, ""which is especially important in today's globalized world.""
Stoyan Karagogushev, who is leading a group of 70 tradition-loving people from Kolarovo, a village near the Bulgarian border with Greece, has always been fascinated with past beliefs and rituals the Surva embodies.
""I have been playing masquerade games since I was little. Kids want to. We continue the tradition,"" Karagogushev said.
A group from a foreign language high school in Pernik also took part in the youth masquerade parade. The school's principal, Temenuzhka Krumova, said, ""Every year, they are waiting for the festival impatiently, and it is a wonderful emotion."""
IFRI30YB9S_O3S2SRVUOX72E2N,Rwanda's extended gorilla permit promotions boost tourism,"Xinhua 25th January 2024, 23:18 GMT+11","Xinhua 25th January 2024, 23:18 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106100/rwandas-extended-gorilla-permit-promotions-boost-tourism,"KIGALI, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda's gorilla permit promotional rates, extended from January to December this year, present a significant opportunity for boosting tourism businesses, Rwandan tour operators said.
To aid the ongoing recovery of the tourism industry, the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) recently announced an extension of the promotional rates for gorilla trekking until Dec. 31, applicable to both domestic and foreign tourists.
As part of the extended promotional rates implemented in the aftermath of COVID-19, Rwandans and East Africans now pay 200 U.S. dollars, while foreign residents in Rwanda, other African citizens and foreign residents in African countries pay 500 dollars for gorilla trekking in the Volcanoes National Park in northern Rwanda. In comparison, the normal rate for foreigners is 1,500 dollars.
Andrew Gatera, founder of G-Step, a tour company, said ""extending the promotional rates is very positive as it provides a good opportunity for Rwandan tourism operators to sell gorilla trekking tickets to more tourists because it makes the product more affordable.""
Gatera emphasized the importance of these special rates in developing the regional and domestic markets, leading to increased revenue for both the government and tour operators.
Under the current regulations, promotional permits for nationals, foreign residents, East Africans and other African citizens must be purchased 72 hours in advance before the trekking date, the RDB said.
Pacifique Ndayisaba, another tour operator, said the promotional rates would simplify the task for tour companies in attracting tourists, making the trekking experience more accessible and helping grow their businesses.
Rwandan tourism expert Louise Mukandekezi said the promotional rates set by Rwanda could enhance East Africa's tourism, as many tourists might take advantage of the East African Community's single tourist visa, offering multiple entries to Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda with a single document.
Thanks to its conservation efforts, Rwanda has seen an increase in the mountain gorilla population in recent years. The 2016 census reported 604 individuals in Africa's Virunga Massif, contributing to the worldwide population of mountain gorillas reaching 1,063, and they are no longer categorized as critically endangered."

Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports)
Kaapo Kahkonen made 43 saves and stopped both attempts in the shootout to help the visiting San Jose Sharks earn a 4-3 win against the Los Angeles Kings on Monday night.
Fabian Zetterlund, William Eklund and Justin Bailey scored for San Jose, which has won two in a row for the first time since Dec. 5-7.
Logan Couture and Zetterlund converted the Sharks' two shootout attempts.
Quinton Byfield had a goal and an assist, Trevor Moore and Drew Doughty also scored, Kevin Fiala had two assists and David Rittich made 26 saves for the Kings, who are 2-6-5 in their past 13 games.
Doughty tied the score 3-3 with 1:58 left in regulation after Kahkonen was penalized for delay of game when his clearing pass sailed over the glass. The Kings pulled Rittich for a two-man advantage about 30 seconds into the power play, and Doughty scored with a slap shot.
After squandering a 2-0 lead, the Sharks moved back ahead 3-2 at 6:17 of the third period.
Bailey got loose for a semi-breakaway after the Kings turned the puck over following a faceoff win in the San Jose zone. Bailey's shot squeezed through Rittich's pads.
After Kahkonen made 18 saves in a scoreless first period, including seven over the final 1:29, Zetterlund and Eklund scored 1:20 apart in the second period to give San Jose the two-goal lead.
The Sharks were on a delayed penalty when a blocked shot fell at the feet of Zetterlund, who swiped it into the net to make it 1-0 at 7:46.
San Jose stretched the lead to 2-0 at 9:06 when Nico Sturm sped ahead of two Los Angeles players to create a brief two-on-one. He fed Eklund, who scored with a wrist shot to end a 17-game goal drought.
Los Angeles cut the deficit to 2-1 at 17:06 of the second period when Fiala's pass skipped past two San Jose players and left Moore one-on-one against Kahkonen. Moore scored from the bottom of the right circle.
The Kings tied it 2-2 at 1:33 of the third period. Adrian Kempe made a spinning centering pass from just below the goal line, and Byfield scored with a one-timer from the slot.
San Jose defenseman Mario Ferraro hobbled to the dressing room with just under seven minutes left in the second period after a check sent him sliding legs first into the boards.
Ferraro, who came in leading San Jose in average ice time at 22:57 per game, played 14:02.

Speaking to reporters alongside Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara after talks in Abidjan, Blinken said the discussion included growing commercial ties to create jobs and growth in both the U.S. and Ivory Coast, as well as investing in public health initiatives and addressing regional security challenges.
Blinken said the United States and Ivory Coast ""have a strong and growing bond.""
Blinken's visit to Ivory Coast is seen as reflecting U.S. interests in the country's stability and its preparations for the 2025 presidential election.
Blinken Kicks Off Africa Tour Focused on Security, Economic Partnerships
The U.S. and international community are concerned about stability in the Sahel sub-region of West Africa following several coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Niger since 2020.
Ivory Coast borders three countries that have experienced coups in recent years: Guinea in September 2021; Mali in both August 2020 and May 2021; and Burkina Faso in January and September of 2022.
The United States announced $45 million in new funding to aid Ivory Coast and its neighbors in preventing conflict and promoting stability amid regional threats. This contribution brings the total U.S. stability-focused assistance in Coastal West Africa to nearly $300 million since 2022.
From Ivory Coast, Blinken is traveling Tuesday to Nigeria where he is set to hold talks with Nigerian President Bola Tinubu and Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar in Abuja.
Regional security talks in Nigeria
Nigeria shares a border with Niger, where the military ousted its elected leader, Mohamed Bazoum, on July 26, 2023, and subsequently scrapped defense agreements with France, its traditional security partner.
In Abuja, Blinken is anticipated to discuss the military coup in Niger. The meeting comes just days after the country's military junta agreed to enhance relations with Russia.
ECOWAS Tries Negotiations With Niger's Coup Leaders but Analysts Skeptical
American officials have stated that while the U.S. is open to countries diversifying their partnerships, aligning with nations like Russia could be problematic. They point to the situation in Mali, where rising civilian casualties and security issues have followed Russian paramilitary Wagner Group's involvement and France's withdrawal.
The French military withdrawal from the Sahel and the end of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali in December have heightened concerns over regional security.
French Departure From Niger Underscores Fading Influence
Nigeria is the largest country by population and economy in sub-Saharan Africa, and the dominant political, economic, and military power in the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS.
The United States is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, and the U.S. maintains a significant security partnership with Nigeria in its counterterrorism operations against both Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa.
Cabo Verde
Blinken's fourth African trip began Monday in Cape Verde and is scheduled to close in Angola. State Department officials said key priorities included bolstering security partnerships and enhancing health and economic development in the region.

In Cape Verde's capital, Praia, Blinken held talks Monday with Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva and visited the city's port, Porto da Praia, which received funding for modernization efforts from the U.S. government's Millennium Challenge Corporation.
""It is extraordinary that Cabo Verde is the first country to complete two Millennium Challenge Corporation compacts, and now you're starting to build a third one,"" said Blinken.
He also congratulated Cabo Verde's malaria-free certification by the World Health Organization.
Millennium Challenge Compacts are grant agreements designed to fund specific programs that support economic growth.
Silva said Cabo Verde shares values of democracy and good governance with the U.S. in its foreign policy.
""We strongly condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we condemned the terrorist act of Hamas in Israel, and we defend solutions that make the two states of Israel and Palestine viable,"" he said. ""We condemn coup d'etat and changes to constitutional term limits for presidents of the republic that have occurred in Africa.""
Cabo Verde is a small island nation that has a large diaspora in the United States.
The U.S. and Cabo Verde signed a Memorandum of Understanding on defense cooperation in December 2022, focusing on maritime security.
Angola and Luanda Process
In a Monday call, Blinken spoke to Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) President Felix Tshisekedi and discussed the concerns of election observers as well as the need to enhance democratic confidence moving forward.
Congo's President Tshisekedi Sworn Into Office After Disputed Reelection
State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that they also discussed the crisis in eastern DRC and potential diplomatic solutions.
Following a contentious December election, Tshisekedi, sworn in Saturday for a second term, pledged to unify the country and address conflicts in the east.
The worsening conflicts in eastern Congo have prompted countries in the region to broker two peace initiatives: the so-called Luanda Process and the Nairobi Process, according to Molly Phee, assistant secretary of state for African Affairs.
Increasing tensions between Rwanda and the DRC have led to several alleged attacks by Congolese and Rwandan forces on each other's territory.
Angola leads the Luanda Process, where Blinken plans to hold talks with Angolan President Joao Lourenco and Foreign Minister Tete Antonio.
Last week, Blinken met with Rwandan President Paul Kagame on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he reiterated the need for all actors to take concrete steps to ease tensions.
Last November, Avril Haines, the director of U.S. national intelligence, traveled to both Kinshasa and Kigali, meeting with leaders from the two neighboring countries to secure a commitment to de-escalate tensions in eastern DRC.
""We were able to institute a process of weekly check-ins that we undertook through the end of calendar year 2023,"" Phee told reporters during a Thursday briefing."

He said that the slogans of Congress don't reflect Gandhian principles anymore.
""Congress' politics has become 'soft Naxalite'. Their slogans don't reflect Gandhian principles anymore. I too was in Congress for 22 years. But it never had such slogans earlier. Congress had a soft slogan. I see that they have killed even the soul of Congress. Entire carcade was full of so-called Left people, Left-leaning people,"" CM Sarma said in a press briefing here.
This came days after the Bharatiya Janata Party leader termed the Congress protests during the Assam leg of the ongoing Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra on the outskirts of Guwahati city as ""Naxalite tactics"".
Sarma's reactions came after Congress workers, who were stopped from entering Guwahati city, clashed with Assam police. He later instructed the state Director General of Police (DGP) to register a case against Rahul Gandhi for allegedly ""provoking crowd.""In a post on social media platform X, Chief Minister Sarma said ""Naxalite tactics"" were alien to Assam's culture.
""These are not part of Assamese culture. We are a peaceful state. Such 'Naxalite tactics' are completely alien to our culture. I have instructed DGP Assam Police to register a case against your leader Rahul Gandhi for provoking the crowd and use the footage you have posted on your handles as evidence. Your unruly behaviour and violation of agreed guidelines have resulted in a massive traffic jam in Guwahati now,"" Sarma said on X.
Hitting out at the Nyay Yatra, the Assam CM alleged that the Congress had hatched a conspiracy to instigate a major communal clash in the northeastern state.
""What was this Yatra? Look at its timing. They had hatched a conspiracy to instigate a major communal clash in Assam. We had a glimpse of it in Guwahati. But their big conspiracy was to cross through Assam during the Ram Temple Pranpratishtha and a clash ensues in the state. But the people of our party and Ram Bhakts restrained themselves. They did not let anything untoward happen in Assam...I would like to tell Rahul Gandhi...people of Assam will see you in Lok Sabha for your arrogance,"" Sarma said.
""I give you this commitment today - Congress will get an even lesser number of seats in Assam and we will defeat them with a good margin. I promise you this today,"" he said in the presser.
Meanwhile, the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra crisscrossed West Bengal from Assam this morning. Assam Congress chief Angika Dutta handed over the 'tricolour' to the party's Bengal unit president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.
Spearheading the Yatra, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi said that he is happy to have come to West Bengal.
The Yatra, flagged off from Manipur's Imphal on January 14, will conclude in Mumbai on March 20. (ANI)"

The ministry said early Friday that in the last 24 hours, 183 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes and 377 have been injured.
The Israeli military said it is investigating an attack on Thursday that killed at least 20 people and wounded another 150 at a traffic circle in Gaza City as Palestinians waited for humanitarian aid, Hamas health officials said.
Gaza City Attack Kills 20, Wounds 150, Hamas Says
Also in central Gaza, Palestinian health officials said a nighttime Israeli airstrike on a house in Al-Nusseirat refugee camp killed six people.
The death toll from a Wednesday strike on a United Nations training center in Khan Younis in southern Gaza has risen to 12, with more than 75 wounded, according to Thomas White, a senior official with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.
The U.N. relief agency did not directly blame Israel, although earlier it had said the facility was hit by tank fire and Israel is the only force with tanks in Gaza's second-largest city. The Israeli military said it had 'currently ruled out' that the strike was carried out by its aircraft or artillery but that it was still investigating the attack.
It said the building might have been hit by a Hamas rocket.
The fighting is part of Israel's efforts to end Hamas' control of the Gaza Strip since the October 7 attack, when Hamas militants invaded southern Israel, killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 people hostage.
The fighting has severely disrupted the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and the international charity ActionAid said on Thursday that hunger there has reached catastrophic levels, prompting people to grind animal feed to use as flour.
A Palestinian woman bakes bread as children sit next to her, while Gaza residents face crisis levels of hunger and soaring malnutrition, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, Jan. 24, 2024.
""Famine is looming across the territory,"" ActionAid said in a statement, ""while pockets of famine are strongly suspected in the north, where it is extremely challenging for aid to reach.""
ActionAid also reports water is so scarce that people in Gaza have access to only 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day for all their needs, including sanitation.
Adding to the misery, the United Nations said the weather has turned rainy and chilly, raising fears of illness.
'It was entirely predictable at this time of the year, and risks making an already unsanitary situation completely uninhabitable for the people. Most have no more clothes or blankets,' said Ajith Sunghay, head of the U.N. Human Rights Office for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
Meanwhile, the U.S. government has created a channel with Israel to discuss concerns about incidents in Gaza in which civilians have been killed or wounded by Israeli attacks, and civilian infrastructure has been targeted, according to a Thursday report by Reuters.
The channel was established after a meeting earlier this month between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Israel's war Cabinet.
A senior U.N. official called Thursday for 'every measure' to be taken to protect civilians, following the Wednesday attack at the Khan Younis training center, where thousands of displaced Palestinians have been staying.
The U.N.'s White said the situation in Khan Younis shows a 'consistent failure to uphold the fundamental principles of humanitarian law.'
Holding up Israeli flags people take part in a protest against humanitarian aid entering Gaza and against the hostages exchange deal with Hamas, in Jerusalem, Jan. 25, 2024.
'Persistent attacks on civilian sites in Khan Younis are utterly unacceptable and must stop immediately,' White said. 'People are being killed and injured. As fighting intensifies around hospitals and shelters hosting the displaced, people are trapped inside, and lifesaving operations are impeded.'
The United States, which has been a key Israeli ally in its war against Hamas, condemned the training center attack.
State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said, 'You've heard me say it before, you've heard [Secretary of State Antony Blinken] say it before, but civilians must be protected, and the protected nature of U.N. facilities must be respected. And humanitarian workers must be protected so that they can continue providing civilians with the life-saving humanitarian assistance that they need.'
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N.'s Palestinian relief agency, said the Khan Younis compound had been clearly marked as a U.N. facility, and its coordinates had been shared with Israeli authorities.
The head of the World Health Organization called for a cease-fire to the conflict in an address to the organization's governing body Thursday, during which he described the conditions in Gaza as ""hellish.""
Palestinians mourn a relative killed in the Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip outside a morgue in Khan Younis, Jan. 22, 2024.
""War doesn't bring solution, except more war, more hatred, more agony, more destruction. So, let's choose peace and resolve this issue politically,' WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the WHO Executive Board in Geneva.
The U.S. and some Middle East countries are trying to negotiate a new cease-fire to halt the fighting, perhaps for 30 days, to allow the release of more hostages and the release of jailed Palestinians held by Israel.

The accused has been identified as Sayed Shoukat Ulla (42) resident of Ismile Nagar Hyderabad and he was working as a ticket booking agent.
Two passengers and an agent travelling on fake passports from Malaysian country were arrested earlier. They started cheating innocent people to earn easy money.
""On September 11, 2022, two passengers namely Nilesh Shailesh Bhai Patel and a woman aged 26 yrs both residents of Gujarat arrived at IGI Airport, New Delhi after being deported from Azerbaijan by air carrier Air India Flight and approached for arrival immigration clearance,"" Delhi police said.
During scrutiny of travel documents, it was revealed that both duo passengers departed to Dubai, UAE from Mumbai on July 21, 2022 on their Indian Passports.
""Later, they departed from Dubai, UAE to Baku, Azerbaijan via Muskat (transit) on their Indian Passport. But on reaching Baku, Azerbaijan, they produced forged Malaysian passports issued in their names for their entry into Baku which they had acquired fraudulently. The Baku Immigration Authorities returned both passengers to Muskat and after that, they were issued emergency certificates in Muscat, Oman to facilitate their return to India,"" Delhi police added.
During the investigation, both above said passengers who were arrested earlier disclosed that their journey to Europe via Azerbaijan was arranged by one Agent Vijay Bhai Patel from Gujarat in lieu of Rs. 40.00 Lakh (20 Lakh for each). Agent namely Vijay Bhai Patel age 52 yrs was also arrested in this case earlier.
During further investigation, it was revealed that the accused Sayed Shoukat Ulla had booked the tickets of both passengers and also paid the booking amount through Google Pay and cash and was also involved in making forged Malaysian passports.
""Accused Sayed Shoukat Ulla age 42 years was absconding and deliberating evading his arrest in said case. The accused Shoukat Ulla Syed was nabbed from Hyderabad Airport as he was planning to abscond Dubai by flight,"" police added.
Accused Syed disclosed that he was working as a ticket booking agent and he used to work on a commission basis along with other agents. In this case, he had booked the tickets of both passengers, made their stay arrangements in Dubai and helped in arranging forged Malaysian passports. In lieu of this, he had received a commission of Rs 13 lakhs approximately. He further confessed his involvement in this case and disclosed that he along with his associates started cheating people to earn easy money.
The accused has been booked in FIR No. 372/2022 U/s 419/420/468/471 IPC and 12 PP Act, IGI Airport police station.

IUBIHQSI86_RR28XITMYGTOL9A,TV5 contextualizes push for Charter change via people's initiative,"CMFR 22nd January 2024, 17:13 GMT+11","CMFR 22nd January 2024, 17:13 GMT+11",20240122,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274102484/tv5-contextualizes-push-for-charter-change-via-peoples-initiative,"CHEERS TO TV5 for its explainer on the controversial push for Charter change (also called Cha-cha) through the mechanism of a people's initiative. The five-minute report provided the necessary background on the issue and broke down the underlying strategy that sets this current attempt apart from previous undertakings.
In December 2023, House Speaker Martin Romualdez announced that the House of Representatives would ""revisit"" constitutional amendments in 2024. Days later, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. expressed in an interview that the Palace was studying whether ""economic Charter change"" would boost investments, a departure from his earlier position on the matter.
Media had already spotted the circulation of the Cha-cha petition at the barangay level and noted the members of Congress involved in its movement. A few lawmakers questioned the process as evidence of corruption and misinformation surfaced.
Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri said the president dismissed the initiative as ""too divisive."" He then filed Resolution of Both Houses No. 6 convening the Senate and the House as a constituent assembly, another mechanism for changing the Constitution. From the House, Romualdez approved the resolution as a sign of unity.
People's Initiative: What it is
The Constitution outlines three modes for amendments: constitutional assembly, constitutional convention, and people's initiative. The people's initiative is set apart from the first two because it does not start in Congress. It requires public participation from the beginning and the drafting of a petition proposing changes. The petition is then circulated to gather signatures from at least 12% of the country's registered voters and at least 3% of voters in each congressional district. The Commission on Elections verifies the signatures through its records, after which the amendments are subjected to a plebiscite. A majority vote in favor is required to enact an amendment.
Joint voting strategy explained
The ""NewsExplainED"" segment of TV5's late night newscast ""Frontline Tonight"" on Jan. 10 reviewed the people's initiative as a process. Amendments can be made through a constitutional convention, whose members discuss and draft the new provisions, followed by a plebiscite to ratify the changes. The other involves Congress undertaking the task as a constituent assembly.
Anchor Ed Lingao went significantly further than others to examine the current campaign strategy. He noted that this time the move cut down on the steps to achieve change. He called attention to the wording of the present petition, pointing out its limited objective: To amend the Constitution so that it explicitly states that Congress must vote jointly on changes.
The report explained that, at present, Article 17 Section 1 of the Constitution is silent on whether the Senate and the House of Representatives can vote separately or jointly on constitutional amendments, specifying only that amendments must be carried out upon a three-fourths vote of all members of Congress.
He recalled that past attempts since the ratification of the Constitution in 1987 all languished in the Senate, effectively eroding the power of the Senate, and making the vote of the House as the dominant factor.
Lingao stressed that should the people's initiative succeed, the voice of the House is sure to overpower that of the Senate's, simply because the over 300 representatives would vastly outnumber 24 senators in a joint vote. This would then ensure the success of any future amendments eyed by the House, regardless of the Senate's opposition.
Lingao went on to review the role of the Supreme Court in the failed bids using people's initiative. Citing the 2006 case of Lambino v. Commission on Elections, Lingao noted that the Supreme Court ruled that the campaigners ""miserably failed to comply with the basic requirements"" written in the Constitution. Specifically, Lambino's group failed to prove that those who signed the petition were fully aware of the nature and implications of the proposed amendments. This emphasized the complexity of the process. The people's initiative is no small feat, but involves more work than some proponents presume.
Media should continue to keep a watchful eye as the momentum for Cha-cha quickens, both in the people's initiative signature campaign and in Congress. Journalists must closely subject any attempt to alter the fundamental law to utmost scrutiny. News about Charter change should engage the public as stakeholders who cannot leave the matter in the hands of politicians."

The transitional president of the Republic of Chad, Mahamat Idriss Deby, described his visit to Moscow as ""historic"" during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday.
Prior to the talks, the Chadian leader and a delegation from the central African country laid flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the center of the Russian capital.
""This visit is historic, Chad and Russia have very long-standing relations, the last visit of the president of Chad was in 1968, when Mr. Francois [Tombalbaye] was president,"" Deby said.
At his meeting with Deby, Putin announced the preparation of measures that will expand cooperation between the two countries, noting that relations have strengthened significantly in recent years.
""A solid package of documents is being prepared that will strengthen and expand our legal and contractual base. I hope that our colleagues will complete this work in the near future,"" the Russian leader stated.
Putin also pointed out that 2024 marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two states. ""Within the United Nations, we try to provide support, including in the humanitarian sphere,"" the Russian leader stressed, stating that Moscow would make further efforts in this area.
""We have doubled the quota for Chadian students studying in the Russian Federation, and we are still ready to double it in the next two years,"" he added.
Putin also expressed hope that the general elections in Chad scheduled for this year will be held ""at a high level,"" and said Russia will do its utmost to support N'Djamena.
In October 2022, Deby was appointed the head of a military leadership in Chad following the killing of his father by rebels in April 2021. The authorities and opposition reached an agreement to extend the transition period until 2024.
A referendum last December resulted in the adoption of the Chadian Constitution, which permits Deby to run for president. The government commission that organized the referendum reported that 86% of voters approved it.

('Southern Cross Gold' or 'SXG') has provided a geological update with an outline of vein morphology and continuity at its 100% owned Sunday Creek Project in Victoria, Australia (Figure 12). SXG is an Australian Securities Exchange ('ASX') listed company owned 51% by Mawson.
Highlights:
Mawson owns 93,750,000 shares of SXG (51%), valuing its stake at A$88.1 million (C$78.0 million) based on SXG's closing price on January 22, 2024 AEST.
Michael Hudson, Mawson Interim CEO and Executive Chairman, states: 'The Company will soon release a maiden Exploration Target for the Apollo and Rising Sun areas at Sunday Creek. This update describes vein morphology and geological and vein continuity to provide geological context for the Exploration Target.
'The observations made here are important because, while geological continuity is critical when constructing a mineral deposit model, in most cases it is the continuity of the grade of the mineralization that will determine the economic nature of a deposit.'
As is standard in industry, Southern Cross Gold is applying multiple datasets to build the Sunday Creek geological and mineralization model. These are described below.
Geostatistics
A total of 42 mineralized vein set shapes have been created for Sunday Creek. Wireframes were created in Leapfrog Geo using a threshold of 1 g/t Au over 2 m. Modelling consistently shows the vein sets have a higher-grade core with broader lower grade halos. The Company, along with leading global consultants, are preparing grade variography with volumes determined by a strong understanding of geological and grade continuity, trends and other supporting information. The mineralization model provides the first geostatistical summary of the project.
Coefficient of variation
The coefficient of variation ('CV') is the ratio of the standard deviation to the average of the assay results. The lower the CV, the less variable and erratic the distribution of the mineralization is, and therefore it is easier to model (Table 1).
In Apollo, where sufficient drill density and drill spacing is present, geostatistical assessment provides validity of the geological shapes (Table 2). Within Apollo, the average of all the vein sets has a CV below 1.5 when applied to 1 m composite data and an average CV of less than 2 for raw assays (Table 2). Rising Sun requires further drilling before similar calculations can be made. The CV at Apollo implies both a strong understanding of the geological controls on mineralization, correct sub-domaining of high tenor material and the predictability of high-grade mineralization within these shapes.
Table 1: Qualitative description of the range of the Coefficient of Variation ('CV') within mineral systems. The lower the CV, the less variable and erratic the distribution of the mineralization is, and therefore it is easier to model.
Stereonets
All diamond drill core drilled by Southern Cross Gold is orientated. Orientation data can place structures measured in drill core in 3-dimensional space. A measure of confidence is assigned to ensure only quality data are utilized and drill bias, or inaccurate measurements, do not materially influence the interpretation. Combined with triangulation of intercepts (minimum three points on a plane to determine an orientation) high confidence in structural continuity of vein sets is maintained. This allows for major trends and critical controls on high grade trends or linking features to be identified.
Geological controls on mineralization (structural, chemical, stratigraphic) exist in every ore deposit and Sunday Creek is no different. Mineralization is structurally controlled, with increased mineralization associated within the 'bleaching' around and within the intrusive sequence. Early alteration and sulphide (pyrite) mineralization exploited the vesicular/amygdaloidal nature of the pervasively altered/mineralized dyke and the brecciated areas, and forms east-west trending pyrite veinlets. Stereonet data supports this observation and shows pyritic veins parallel the east-west structural host and predates the higher tenor NNW Au-Sb mineralized vein sets (Figure 1).
Stereonet data (Figure 1) also demonstrates that gold-antimony ('Au-Sb') mineralization is dominantly hosted within zones of sub-vertical, brittle-ductile NNW-NW striking shear veins and associated veins, containing visible gold, quartz, stibnite, occasional fibrous sulphosalts and minor ferroan carbonates infill. The veins have an associated selvedge of disseminated sulphides in the form of arsenian pyrite, pyrite and arsenopyrite. The mineralized vein sets are typically between 5-30 m wide, 20-100 m in strike (see Figures 5-7 which show 3 individual veins strike distance 30-40 m, 25-40 m, 40-55 m and up to 110 m) and currently defined vertically down to 1 km depth and up to 570 m in depth extent on an individual vein set basis. These zones repeat every 10-20 m within the Apollo and Rising Sun areas with 42 vein sets currently defined to date.
When observed from above, the altered sediment and dyke host resembles the side rails of a ladder, where the sub-vertical mineralized vein sets are the rungs that extend from surface to depth (Figures 5-7).
Quality Control Data
Drilling recovery at Sunday Creek is excellent (99.2% average core recovery). All samples are oriented diamond core, predominately HQ core size. Quality control data is routinely acquired. Standards are inserted at regular intervals and show appropriate consistency. Both field duplicates (quarter core) and laboratory duplicates (from the LM5 pulverizer) show good consistency implying homogenization at both the core and pulp sampling stages with low variability (Figure 2). Addtional screen fire assay data compares favourably with fire assay data showing the homogenization of mineralization, and low nugget effect after pulverization (Figure 3).
Predictability
The Company is now able to plan drill holes and predict, with a high degree of confidence, the vertical and lateral extents of high-grade mineralization within the altered 'bleached' sediment and dyke host. This is best evidenced at the Rising Sun area where our drilling over the last 6 months has expanded the strike and footprint of these vein sets. Longitudinal section views of vein sets RS10, RS20 and RS80 with mineralized intercepts are shown (Figures 4-7) to demonstrate how the Company is building predictability of veins sets with continued drilling.
Geological Likeness
A strong component of the geological domaining of vein sets and high-grade individual veins relies on the geological similarities of the interval; similar mineralogy, vein types and textures are critical to identifying the domain, as well as consistent orientations ensuring that assays are not simply being linked together in a coincidental manner. Figures 8-9 show examples of textural similarity of veins and breccias containing high grade gold from recent drillholes.
Old mining areas
Hard rock mining at Sunday Creek commenced in the 1870's and continued until after World War 1. Fifty years of historic mining records and remanent stoping highlight similar observations of the E-W host and continuity of the NW veins set structures. Whitelaw (1899) describes the 'ladder' structure of the host structure 'rails' and vein set 'rungs' as observed today:
'Sulphide in large and oxide in small quantities occur in connexion (sic) with numerous quartz reefs crossing a strong well defined diorite dyke, which cuts diagonally through the enclosing Silurian slates and sandstones of Sunday Creek, 8 miles east of Kilmore. The dyke has an average width of 80 feet it strikes E 100 N. It has been traced on the surface for over two miles uninterruptedly, is very fine grained, contains a large amount of arsenial (sic) and iron pyrites disseminated throughout, and towards the north is somewhat porphyritic in structure, passing over into aphanitic porphyry. It is generally a greenish colour.'
'Cutting through the dyke in a direction N100W, at intervals every few yards occur mineral reefs composed mostly of quartz, antimony, pyrites and breccias of the adjacent 'country'. Of these reefs, every one that has been exploited has proved auriferous.'
Additionally, historic mining stope orientations are consistent with surrounding orientated drill core and mineralized intercepts. Drilled mineralization at Apollo coincides spatially with historic stopes and development (Figure 10). LiDAR surface mapping also shows the consistent mining of the mineralized 'rungs' in a NW direction across the 10 km trend of historic surface workings at Sunday Creek (Figure 11).
Pre-Resource Studies
SRK Consulting (Australasia) Pty Ltd ('SRK') have been engaged to work with in-house staff for ongoing modelling assistance and the eventual preparation of a Mineral Resource Estimate, consistent with the requirements of the 2012 edition of the JORC Code.
In-House and External Expertise
Southern Cross Management and Board have deep internal technical experience and the Company is led by those with who have made multiple discoveries which have advanced to mining across the globe over the last 30 years.
The SXG Board is Chaired by Tom Eadie, a seasoned explorer with numerous discoveries and capital market successes.

He has worked extensively in Victoria on some of the highest-grade gold mines in the world including Costerfield and Fosterville. The Company also employs several experienced geological and geotechnical staff, augmented by highly experienced geological consultants.
About Sunday Creek
History
The Sunday Creek deposit is a high level orogenic (or epizonal) deposit. Small scale mining has been undertaken in the project area since the 1880s continuing through to the early 1900s. Historical production occurred with multiple small shafts and alluvial workings across the existing permits. Past production at the Sunday Creek prospect is reported as 41,000 oz gold at a grade of 33 g/t gold. Larger historic workings along the trend from west to east include Christina, Golden Dyke, Rising Sun and Apollo.
Regional Geology
Sunday Creek occurs with the Melbourne Zone of the Lachlan Geosyncline, in sequences folded and thrust-faulted by the Late Devonian Tabberabberan Orogeny. The regional host to the Sunday Creek mineralization is an interbedded turbidite sequence of siltstones, mudstones, and minor sandstones, metamorphosed to sub-greenschist facies and folded into a set of open north-west trending synclines and anticlines.
Structural Setting and Local Geology
Intruded into the sedimentary sequence is a series of intermediate monzodiorite - diorite dykes and breccias on an east-west trend. The Sunday Creek dykes have highly variable textures and compositions with the earliest emplaced aphanitic varieties emplaced along thin fracture sets. These fine-grained dykes locally grade into porphyritic to massive varieties as the thickness of the dykes increases and brecciate in areas of complexity or in proximity to fold hinges.
Large scale thrusts sub-parallel to the NW trending structural grain, dislocate the dyke system and an array of sub-vertical extension veins form subparallel to the bedding trend and orthogonal to the intruded dyke sequence. Veining is focused within areas of high competency contrast, such as the intruded dyke and surrounding alteration, fold hinges and areas of structural complexity.
Alteration
Distally a regional chlorite alteration weakly pervades the sediments, with a change in mica composition from phengitic to muscovitic mica approaching mineralization, an increase in carbonate spotting and cementation and proximal to the dyke a very intense texturally destructive alteration of sericite-carbonate-silica 'bleaching' of the sediments.
Further Information
Further discussion and analysis of the Sunday Creek project is available through the interactive Vrify 3D animations, presentations and videos all available on the SXG website. These data, along with an interview on these results with Managing Director Michael Hudson, with a 3D Leapfrog presentation, can be viewed at www.southerncrossgold.com.au
Gold Equivalent Calculation
SXG considers that both gold and antimony that are included in the gold equivalent calculation ('AuEq') have reasonable potential to be recovered at Sunday Creek, given current geochemical understanding, historic production statistics and geologically analogous mining operations. Historically, ore from Sunday Creek was treated onsite or shipped to the Costerfield mine, located 54 km to the northwest of the project, for processing during WW1. The Costerfield mine corridor, now owned by Mandalay Resources Ltd contains two million ounces of equivalent gold (Mandalay Q3 2021 Results), and in 2020 was the sixth highest-grade global underground mine and a top 5 global producer of antimony.
SXG considers that it is appropriate to adopt the same gold equivalent variables as Mandalay Resources Ltd in its Mandalay Technical Report, 2022 dated 25 March 2022. The gold equivalence formula used by Mandalay Resources was calculated using recoveries achieved at the Costerfield Property Brunswick Processing Plant during 2020, using a gold price of US$1,700 per ounce, an antimony price of US$8,500 per tonne and 2021 total year metal recoveries of 93% for gold and 95% for antimony, and is as follows:
ð´ð¢ð¸ð = ð´ð¢ (ð/ð¡) + 1.58 Ã ðð (%).
Based on the latest Costerfield calculation and given the similar geological styles and historic toll treatment of Sunday Creek mineralization at Costerfield, SXG considers that a ð´ð¢ð¸ð = ð´ð¢ (ð/ð¡) + 1.58 Ã ðð (%) is appropriate to use for the initial exploration targeting of gold-antimony mineralization at Sunday Creek.
Technical Background and Qualified Person
The Qualified Person, Michael Hudson, Executive Chairman and a director of Mawson Gold, and a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, has reviewed, verified and approved the technical contents of this release.
Analytical samples are transported to the Bendigo facility of On Site Laboratory Services ('On Site') which operates under both an ISO 9001 and NATA quality systems. Samples were prepared and analyzed for gold using the fire assay technique (PE01S method; 25 gram charge), followed by measuring the gold in solution with flame AAS equipment. Samples for multi-element analysis (BM011 and over-range methods as required) use aqua regia digestion and ICP-MS analysis. The QA/QC program of Southern Cross Gold consists of the systematic insertion of certified standards of known gold content, blanks within interpreted mineralized rock and quarter core duplicates. In addition, On Site inserts blanks and standards into the analytical process.

NATO is a ""walking war machine"" that has been spreading chaos across Asia since its formation, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian told reporters on Thursday, accusing the bloc of using the specter of a dominant Beijing to foment regional conflict.
Wu appeared to be referencing comments made by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg during the World Economic Forum last week, in which the bloc's leader attempted to frame its buildout in Asia as a response to purported Chinese aggression.
""It should be said that NATO is a walking 'war machine,' and wherever it appears, it brings disorder everywhere,"" Wu said, referencing ""inappropriate statements by the NATO Secretary General regarding China.""
""This is not about NATO moving into Asia, but instead about the fact that China is coming close to us,"" Stoltenberg told attendees at the exclusive Davos gathering, insisting the US-led alliance remains ""regional"" in its focus.
Wu cautioned NATO against deliberate provocations, urging the bloc to treat China and its military development ""objectively and rationally, and do something beneficial to world peace,"" according to Xinhua.
Despite its moniker seemingly limiting its sphere of influence to the North Atlantic Ocean, NATO has openly courted Asian allies in an effort to counter China's growing power. Its members already include countries thousands of kilometers from the Atlantic, such as TÃ¼rkiye and Bulgaria, although Article 6 of its charter specifies that the mutual defense agreement at its core only applies to territories in Europe and North America, plus islands north of the Tropic of Cancer.
In August, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan explicitly denied Washington was seeking to create a ""NATO for the Pacific"" with the establishment of a trilateral defense partnership with Japan and South Korea, even as President Joe Biden heralded a ""new era"" of collaboration with Washington's regional allies. Last July, NATO indefinitely postponed the controversial planned opening of a liaison office in Tokyo.
Russian General Viktor Sobolev argued in September that the US planned to ""drag"" Tokyo and Seoul into NATO by 2030, rather than spawn a copycat organization. In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Washington and its allies of fomenting discord with ""unprecedented"" activity in the region in a doomed bid to stave off the decline of the US-centric world order.
NATO members issued a joint statement in July framing China's ""stated ambitions and coercive policies"" as a ""challenge"" to the alliance's own interests, security and values, accusing the Asian superpower of attempting to ""subvert the rules-based international order."" However, the bloc insisted Beijing was not an enemy, claiming doors remained open for ""constructive engagement.""

The Chief Minister visited Jakhu temple and offered prayers to Lord Hanuman. He visited the temple after the Pran Prathistha ceremony of Ram Lalla was held at the grand temple in Ayodhya.
He said that the Lord Ram is the foundation of India's culture.
""Lord Ram is the culture of India, today Pran Pratishtha has been done. I would like to congratulate and greet everyone. We have tried to follow the path and preachings of Lord Ram in running our government and in our lives. It is important that the Ram temple is being built in Ayodhya. Hanumanji had brought Ramji back to Ayodhya. We recited Hanuman Chalisa here. I appeal to everyone to follow the path of Ramji. We shall set up a big statue of Lord Ram here,"" Sukhu said.
He also urged people to light up earthen diyas. Sukhu accused BJP leaders in the state of trying to take political benefit from temple-related events in Ayodhya.
""I am a Sanatan Dharmi. The leader of the opposition here is trying to take political benefits. Whatever good I am doing he is just misleading,"" Sukhu said.
Sukhu also hit out at Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and accused him of resorting to political gimmicks against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.
Congress has alleged that Rahul Gandhi, who is on Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, was ""stopped and prevented"" from paying obeisance at the Batadrava Than, the birthplace of saint Sri Sri Sankardev, in Hainoragaon near here.
The party alleged that this was done on instructions of Sarma.
Sukhu said there is no law in the country to prevent a devotee from offering prayers at a religious place.
""The Nayay Yatra is getting a very good public response and the government in Assam is trying to mislead the people of state. Ramji is with Rahul Gandhi and people of Assam and the country are with Rahul Gandhij,"" Sukhu said.
Sukhu had paid obeisance at the Ram temple in Shimla on Sunday and lighted diyas. A 24-hour 'Akhand Path' also began at the temple.
Sukhu prayed for the prosperity of the state and said that Lord Rama ""is our ideal"". The Chief Minister also announced a public holiday in the state for January 22.
The Chief Minister had said that Lord Rama does not belong to any particular party and is the ideal of the entire country and our culture.
Responding to a query, Sukhu had said that he would visit Ayodhya in near future.
He added that Lord Rama is considered incomplete without Lord Hanuman and a statue of Lord Rama would be erected along with that of Lord Hanuman in Jakhu as proposed by the Sood Sabha. (ANI)"

In an interview, UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi also told The Associated Press it was important to remind the international community that Ukrainians were living through a brutal war despite other global crises taking the spotlight.
Speaking at the end of a weeklong visit to Ukraine, Grandi said that the invasion launched by Moscow on Feb. 24, 2022, continues devastating civilians by leaving houses destroyed, health centers damaged, and many facilities not functioning.
'I think the big difference from last year to this year is that this year, this is not news anymore in the world,' Grandi said. 'There is somehow a trend towards getting used to Ukrainian suffering.'
War displaces 10 million
UNHCR put the latest figure of people who have been displaced from the war at 10 million - 3.7 million are considered to be internally displaced, while another 6.3 million are categorized as refugees.
The agency has called for $4.2 billion to help Ukraine this year - slightly less than last year.
'We made that choice because we are aware that there are so many crises in the world, that that's a factor, and therefore we really focused on the priority needs,' Grandi said.
Politics holding up aid, says official
The U.N. refugee chief said that he was concerned that discussion over the issue of humanitarian aid to Ukraine had now become held up by political wrangling. He urged the United States and the European Union to pass their aid packages saying it was his duty to 'remind everybody that humanitarian aid should not be hostage of politics.'
In December, EU leaders failed to agree on a four-year, $52 billion package of assistance for Ukraine. Hungary blocked the agreement, which requires unanimity from all 27 EU members. The bloc is working, however, to find a way for the remaining 26 countries to come up with the money before an EU summit on February 1.
In Washington, senators are trying for a bipartisan deal that would include nearly $61 billion in aid for Ukraine and make changes to U.S. border policy. But Republicans are renewing a push to scale back the amount of assistance for Ukraine, targeting money that would go to Ukraine's civil sector and arguing that European nations could step in to fund those needs.
'I very much hope that those discussions can be unblocked and be concluded positively in both places - in the EU and in the United States,' Grandi said. 'If those packages are stuck, I'm very worried that that humanitarian assistance will not come. That will have an immediate impact here.'"

Several people are in joy today and so I have come here to be part of this joyous occasion,"" the Union Minister who is also the president of the Republican Party of India said, speaking to ANI at Ayodhya.
Responding to allegations from the opposition parties that the Pran Pratishtha ceremony has been made into a BJP event, Athawale said that had it been an agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Opposition would not have received an invitation.
""Had this been a BJP agenda, the Opposition would not have been given an invitation. All of them received an invitation, including those from the INDIA bloc. Famous personalities, celebrities and politicians have been invited. This is not a BJP event,"" the Union Minister said.
Athawale said that the Opposition parties should have come to Ayodhya for the Pran Pratishtha event instead of boycotting it.
""Opposition should have come here. But they boycotted it, I appeal to the people to boycott them in the upcoming election,"" he said.
The 'Pran Pratishtha' of Ram Lalla took place on Paush Shukla Kurma Dwadashi, Vikram Samvat 2080, which falls on January 22.
The ceremony witnessed the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat, Governor Anandiben Patel, and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, among other dignitaries.
The historic Pran Pratishtha ceremony was attended by representatives of all major spiritual and religious sects of the country. People from all walks of life, including representatives of various tribal communities, attended the ceremony. (ANI)"

Polish President Andrzej Duda is afraid that his own security detail has been infiltrated by officers loyal to his political opponent, Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Poland's Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper claimed on Monday.
Former Polish Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski and his deputy, Maciej Wonsik, were arrested inside Duda's presidential palace earlier this month. Police officers entered the palace to detain the two politicians, who had been convicted in December of entrapment and abuse of power offenses committed nearly two decades earlier. The pair sought sanctuary in the palace, which Duda told them he would provide.
Upon their imprisonment both announced they had begun a hunger strike but a Polish court subsequently ruled that the men could be force-fed.
Duda ""was first shocked and then furious"" that his State Protection Service (SOP) agents allowed the police inside the palace, Gazeta Wyborcza reported, citing an anonymous SOP agent. ""He directly accused the chief of security of betrayal,"" the source said.
There is a prevailing belief among the president's entourage that two deputy SOP heads, identified as Colonels Bartlomiej Gebda and Krzysztof Krul, ordered the rest of the security detail to step down and allow the 14 police officers to arrest Kaminski and Wonsik, the paper claimed. Duda now reportedly suspects the colonels of being part of a ""conspiracy"" against him.
Kaminski and Wonsik are members of the nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS), while Duda is a former member and is still considered a close ally of PiS.
The case against Kaminski and Wonsik began in 2009, when they were accused of allowing agents of the anti-corruption body that they headed to use entrapment in an investigation two years prior. Both men were convicted in 2015 and sentenced to three and a half years in prison, but they were pardoned by Duda, who took office that year.
Poland's new government, led by the pro-EU Donald Tusk, has claimed that Duda did not have the right to grant the two MPs amnesty. After winning the general election and ousting PiS last month, the new government reopened the case against the former minister and his deputy.
Fearful that Tusk had planted loyalists within the SOP, Duda mulled replacing these agents with Military Police officers, Gazeta Wyborcza's source claimed. Polish law, however, does not allow this, the newspaper noted.
As president, Duda has the power to grant clemency to Kaminski and Wonsik for a second time. According to Polish news site Onet, the president could announce a new pardon for the two PiS members on Monday evening. Both men are currently in separate prisons, with Kaminski on a hunger strike for almost two weeks.

Tensions between the central authorities and the northern separatists have resurfaced since the military consolidated power in two coups in 2020 and 2021, teamed up with Russian military contractor Wagner Group, and kicked out French forces and UN peacekeepers.
In a statement read on state television on Thursday, the junta said it was no longer possible to continue with the agreement due to other signatories not sticking to their commitments, as well as ""hostile acts"" by chief mediator Algeria.
Malian authorities were angered when, in February, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune rolled out the red carpet to former rebels who had signed the agreement. The statement described the ex-rebels as ""terrorists"".
It said the so-called Algiers Accord, brokered by the United Nations in 2015, was no longer workable and would be ended ""with immediate effect"".
Little surprise
The CMA, an alliance of rebel groups formed by Mali's semi-nomadic Tuareg people, said it was not surprised by the decision.
""We have been expecting it since they brought in Wagner, chased out Minusma (the UN peacekeeping group) and started hostilities by attacking our positions on the ground,"" said CMA spokesperson Elmaouloud Ramadane.
""We knew that the aim was to terminate the agreement.""
Russian paramilitaries to stay in Africa despite Wagner mutiny UN call to resume dialogue
Located on the Sahara desert's southern fringe, Mali has been plagued by violence since 2012, when Islamist militants hijacked an uprising by Tuareg groups who complained of government neglect and sought autonomy for the desert region they call Azawad.
The Tuaregs signed the peace accord with the Bamako government in 2015, but the militant groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State have killed thousands of civilians in insurgencies that have since spread to neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.
The Tuareg peace agreement had recently come under increasing strain as fighting between the two sides picked up again last August.
UN pulls peacekeeping force out of Timbuktu early amid insecurity in Mali
In early January, the UN Security Council warned of the importance of sticking with the 2015 peace deal and called for all parties to resume dialogue.
Any escalation with the separatists would pile extra pressure on the Malian army, which is already struggling in the fight against Islamist groups with violence worsening since the military takeover.

In this article from 2017, John examined how the Writers Resist campaigners and other anti-Trumpists needed to reflect that until real politics return to people's lives, the enemy is not Trump, it is ourselves.
ON THE day President Trump is inaugurated, thousands of writers in the United States will express their indignation.
Said Writers Resist:
Thus, real protest is to be avoided, for it is not tax-exempt.
Compare such drivel with the declarations of the Congress of American Writers, held at Carnegie Hall, New York in 1935 and again two years later. They were electric events, with writers discussing how they could confront ominous events in Abyssinia, China and Spain. Telegrams from Thomas Mann, C Day Lewis, Upton Sinclair and Albert Einstein were read out, reflecting the fear that great power was now rampant and that it had become impossible to discuss art and literature without politics or, indeed, direct political action.
America's political killings surge as Trump's hate speech intensifies Data for 2023 shows gun violence increasing as former president Donald Trump campaigns for the top job again.The journalist Martha Gellhorn told the second congress:Her words echo across the unction and violence of the Obama era and the silence of those who colluded with his deceptions.That the menace of rapacious power - rampant long before the rise of Trump - has been accepted by writers - many of them privileged and celebrated - and by those who guard the gates of literary criticism and culture, including popular culture, is uncontroversial. Not for them the impossibility of writing and promoting literature bereft of politics. Not for them the responsibility to speak out, regardless of who occupies the White House.Today, false symbolism is all. ""Identity"" is all. In 2016, Hillary Clinton stigmatised millions of voters as ""a basket of deplorable... racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic - you name it"". Her abuse was handed out at an LGBT rally as part of her cynical campaign to win over minorities by abusing a White, mostly working-class, majority. Divide and rule, this is called; or identity politics, in which race and gender conceal class, and allow the waging of class war. Trump understood this.'When the truth is replaced by silence,' said the Soviet dissident poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, 'the silence is a lie'.This is not an American phenomenon.A few years ago, Terry Eagleton, then professor of English literature at Manchester University, reckoned that:No Shelley speaks for the poor, no Blake for utopian dreams, no Byron damns the corruption of the ruling class, no Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin reveal the moral disaster of capitalism. William Morris, Oscar Wilde, HG Wells, George Bernard Shaw have no equivalents today. Harold Pinter was the last to raise his voice.Among today's insistent voices of consumer feminism, none echoes Virginia Woolf, who described:There is something both venal and profoundly stupid about famous writers as they venture outside their cosseted world and embrace an ""issue"". Across the 'Review' section of The Guardian on 10 December was a dreamy picture of Barack Obama looking up to the heavens and the words, 'Amazing Grace' and 'Farewell the Chief'.The sycophancy ran like a polluted babbling brook through page after page:I have conflated these quotes. There are others even more hagiographic and bereft of mitigation.The Guardian's chief apologist for Obama, Gary Younge, has always been careful to mitigate, to say that his hero 'could have done more', oh, but there were the 'calm, measured and consensual solutions...'None of them, however, could surpass the American writer, Ta-Nehisi Coates, the recipient of a ""genius"" grant worth $625,000 from a liberal foundation. In an interminable essay for The Atlantic entitled, 'My President Was Black', Coates brought new meaning to prostration.The final ""chapter"", entitled 'When You Left, You Took All of Me With You', a line from a Marvin Gaye song, describes seeing the Obamas 'rising out of the limo, rising up from fear, smiling, waving, defying despair, defying history, defying gravity'. The Ascension, no less.One of the persistent strands in American political life is a cultish extremism that approaches fascism.This was given expression and reinforced during the two terms of Barack Obama.""I believe in American exceptionalism with every fibre of my being,"" said Obama, who expanded America's favourite military pastime, bombing and death squads (""special operations"") as no other president has done since the Cold War.According to a Council on Foreign Relations survey, in 2016 alone Obama dropped 26,171 bombs. That is 72 bombs every day. He bombed the poorest people on Earth - in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Pakistan.Every Tuesday - reported The New York Times - he personally selected those who would be murdered by mostly hellfire missiles fired from drones. Weddings, funerals, shepherds were attacked, along with those attempting to collect the body parts festooning the ""terrorist target"".A leading Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, estimated, approvingly, that Obama's drones had killed 4,700 people:Like the fascism of the 1930s, big lies are delivered with the precision of a metronome, thanks to an omnipresent media whose description now fits that of the Nuremberg prosecutor:Take the catastrophe in Libya; in 2011, Obama said Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi was planning ""genocide"" against his own people:This was the known lie of Islamist militias facing defeat by Libyan government forces. It became the media story and NATO - led by Obama and Hillary Clinton - launched 9,700 ""strike sorties"" against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. Uranium warheads were used; the cities of Misurata and Sirte were carpet-bombed. The Red Cross identified mass graves and UNICEF reported that 'most [of the children killed] were under the age of ten'.

Data for 2023 shows gun violence increasing as former president Donald Trump campaigns for the top job again.
The journalist Martha Gellhorn told the second congress:
Her words echo across the unction and violence of the Obama era and the silence of those who colluded with his deceptions.
That the menace of rapacious power - rampant long before the rise of Trump - has been accepted by writers - many of them privileged and celebrated - and by those who guard the gates of literary criticism and culture, including popular culture, is uncontroversial. Not for them the impossibility of writing and promoting literature bereft of politics. Not for them the responsibility to speak out, regardless of who occupies the White House.
Today, false symbolism is all. ""Identity"" is all. In 2016, Hillary Clinton stigmatised millions of voters as ""a basket of deplorable... racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic - you name it"". Her abuse was handed out at an LGBT rally as part of her cynical campaign to win over minorities by abusing a White, mostly working-class, majority. Divide and rule, this is called; or identity politics, in which race and gender conceal class, and allow the waging of class war. Trump understood this.
'When the truth is replaced by silence,' said the Soviet dissident poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, 'the silence is a lie'.
This is not an American phenomenon.
A few years ago, Terry Eagleton, then professor of English literature at Manchester University, reckoned that:
No Shelley speaks for the poor, no Blake for utopian dreams, no Byron damns the corruption of the ruling class, no Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin reveal the moral disaster of capitalism. William Morris, Oscar Wilde, HG Wells, George Bernard Shaw have no equivalents today. Harold Pinter was the last to raise his voice.
Among today's insistent voices of consumer feminism, none echoes Virginia Woolf, who described:
There is something both venal and profoundly stupid about famous writers as they venture outside their cosseted world and embrace an ""issue"". Across the 'Review' section of The Guardian on 10 December was a dreamy picture of Barack Obama looking up to the heavens and the words, 'Amazing Grace' and 'Farewell the Chief'.
The sycophancy ran like a polluted babbling brook through page after page:
I have conflated these quotes. There are others even more hagiographic and bereft of mitigation.
The Guardian's chief apologist for Obama, Gary Younge, has always been careful to mitigate, to say that his hero 'could have done more', oh, but there were the 'calm, measured and consensual solutions...'
None of them, however, could surpass the American writer, Ta-Nehisi Coates, the recipient of a ""genius"" grant worth $625,000 from a liberal foundation. In an interminable essay for The Atlantic entitled, 'My President Was Black', Coates brought new meaning to prostration.
The final ""chapter"", entitled 'When You Left, You Took All of Me With You', a line from a Marvin Gaye song, describes seeing the Obamas 'rising out of the limo, rising up from fear, smiling, waving, defying despair, defying history, defying gravity'. The Ascension, no less.
One of the persistent strands in American political life is a cultish extremism that approaches fascism.
This was given expression and reinforced during the two terms of Barack Obama.
""I believe in American exceptionalism with every fibre of my being,"" said Obama, who expanded America's favourite military pastime, bombing and death squads (""special operations"") as no other president has done since the Cold War.
According to a Council on Foreign Relations survey, in 2016 alone Obama dropped 26,171 bombs. That is 72 bombs every day. He bombed the poorest people on Earth - in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, Iraq and Pakistan.
Every Tuesday - reported The New York Times - he personally selected those who would be murdered by mostly hellfire missiles fired from drones. Weddings, funerals, shepherds were attacked, along with those attempting to collect the body parts festooning the ""terrorist target"".
A leading Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, estimated, approvingly, that Obama's drones had killed 4,700 people:
Like the fascism of the 1930s, big lies are delivered with the precision of a metronome, thanks to an omnipresent media whose description now fits that of the Nuremberg prosecutor:
Take the catastrophe in Libya; in 2011, Obama said Libyan president Muammar Gaddafi was planning ""genocide"" against his own people:
This was the known lie of Islamist militias facing defeat by Libyan government forces. It became the media story and NATO - led by Obama and Hillary Clinton - launched 9,700 ""strike sorties"" against Libya, of which more than a third were aimed at civilian targets. Uranium warheads were used; the cities of Misurata and Sirte were carpet-bombed. The Red Cross identified mass graves and UNICEF reported that 'most [of the children killed] were under the age of ten'.

The summit, under the theme 'Leaving No One Behind', took place in the capital of Uganda, Kampala, from January 21 to 22, 2024, and was attended by heads of state and member state representatives.
During his speech at the summit, Sheikh Shakhboot bin Nahyan expressed his gratitude to the Republic of Cuba for its efforts during the presidential term of the Group of 77 and China in 2023.
Sheikh Shakhboot also congratulated the Republic of Uganda on presiding over the group and for hosting the third session of the summit.
Sheikh Shakhboot bin Nahyan affirmed the UAE's active role in implementing efforts to achieve the domestic and international goals of sustainable development through collaboration with all relevant entities and member states, which benefits nations and societies across the world and contributes to a better future for current and future generations.
He highlighted that the objectives of sustainable development are foundations to build stable and prosperous societies that are resilient to challenges, which results in long-term positive and sustainable change and shapes new prospects of growth and development.
Sheikh Shakhboot bin Nahyan also referred to the Summit of the Future, which will take place in September 2024, in New York, emphasising that such a historical assembly represents an opportunity to explore solutions that safeguard the well-being and prosperity of current and future generations and to rebuild global solidarity and trust in multilateral institutions.
The minister affirmed that the resolution, delivered during the successful Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) that concluded its events in Expo City Dubai in December, to operationalize a new Loss and Damage fund, along with commitments totaling USD 792 million, was announced as a significant contribution to assist developing countries in addressing these damages.
He also highlighted that the UAE has launched the 'Altera' Climate Investment Fund as an incentive tool specialising in financing climate action investments worth $30 billion. The fund aims to raise and stimulate an additional USD 250 billion to support global climate action, particularly in regions of the world that need it the most, especially in the Global South.
Sheikh Shakhboot bin Nahyan stated that multilateral action is necessary to address common global challenges.
He emphasised that important forums such as the G77 and China play an effective role in conveying the needs of developing and emerging economies at the international level.
These forums promote constructive dialogue aimed at developing and advancing nations, and consolidating the values of multilateralism, an essential aspect of supporting peace, security, and development at the global level.
He added that this is achieved by expanding trade flows between various countries, encouraging investment and tourism, enhancing cooperation, exchanging expertise in scientific and technological fields, developing programmes and projects, as well as areas of natural disaster management, among others.
The UAE has also maintained its focus on diplomacy to reach consensus, and build bridges, while promoting the values of tolerance and coexistence. Moreover, the UAE has played a prominent role in confronting some of the most urgent challenges of our time.
The country champions resolving conflicts through peaceful means, prioritises humanitarian relief, maintains peace, addresses global health crises, harnesses the potential of innovation, develops the international system to combat terrorism, and supports gender equality, empowering women and promoting their equal participation.
To conclude, Sheikh Shakhboot bin Nahyan stressed that during its membership in the UN Security Council from 2022-23, the UAE sought to fulfil its obligations during its term, which included securing peace, promoting inclusion, building resilience, and enhancing innovation. (ANI/WAM)"

Along with strong borders, the former president also called for ""honest, free and fair"" elections.
Speaking to the reporters in Londonderry City, New Hampshire, Trump said, ""We have to make sure we have honest, fair and free elections and strong borders. If we don't have borders and elections, we don't have a country. And you see what's going on with the border. There has never been anything like this on the border.""""Millions and millions of people are pouring into our country illegally. Many come from prisons. A lot of terrorists are coming in. They are coming from mental institutions...it's really bad,"" he added.
On being asked about the condition of northern borders, the former president said that the Biden administration has done one of the ""worst"" jobs in the history, calling it one of the ""worst tragedies"" in the country's history.
""The situation at the northern border is getting bad...you have to watch both borders. The southern border is nobody has ever seen, but the northern border is bad too. They have done one of the worst jobs and this is one of the worst tragedies in the history of our country. Either they are very stupid, which I don't believe they are or they hate our country,"" the former president further added.
Meanwhile, the voting has started for the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, where Trump is competing with former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley contending for the GOP nomination, aiming to challenge President Joe Biden in the November 2024 election.
Trump registered a landslide victory in Iowa caucuses winning 20 out of the 40 delegates from Iowa with 56,250 votes -- a whopping difference of over 32,000 votes.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was the distant second with eight delegates and Haley was not much behind with seven. However, the former pulling out of the White House bid has made it a two-way race at the GOP.
A CNN poll released on Sunday found Trump with 50 per cent support among likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire, while his closest competitor, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, stood at 39 per cent.
Trump, having launched his bid in November 2022, seeks to secure a non-consecutive term, persistently denying the 2020 election outcome and facing multiple criminal charges. His potential second term promises a substantial overhaul of federal government factions and aggressive actions against political opponents, CNN reported.

Jean Carroll will resume on Thursday and will not be held on Wednesday as initially scheduled, Manhattan federal court records showed Tuesday.
The trial's second postponement this week delays a potential face-to-face encounter between Carroll and the former U.S. president, who has said he wants to testify.
On Monday, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan delayed the trial until Wednesday after a juror and one of Trump's lawyers reported illnesses.
When the trial resumes, jurors will determine how much Trump should pay Carroll for defaming her in June 2019, when he denied raping her in the mid-1990s in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan.
Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has consistently denied that anything happened and accused Carroll of making up the incident to boost sales of her then-new memoir.

""Until further order(s), the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court shall remain stayed, subject to the condition that the compensation as determined by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) shall be paid by the petitioner,"" the top court said in its January 22 order.
A bench of Justices BR Gavai, Sanjay Karol and Sandeep Mehta also issued notice to concerned respondents on the plea filed by the Meghalaya government.
Meghalaya Govt has challenged a High Court order that directed the state authority to pay compensation in cases of custodial deaths. Meghalaya High Court order has come in a suo motu public interest litigation which was initiated according to a direction issued by the Supreme Court in the judgment related to Re-Inhuman conditions in 1382 prisons.
In its August 2023 order, Meghalaya HC however had clarified that the compensation will be payable only in cases of unnatural death, irrespective of the cause of death.
In cases of natural death in custody, no compensation would be payable at all, HC has made it clear. As to cases where the State suggests that the injuries suffered which caused death were in the course of the person in custody trying to escape, the determination of the cause would be by an appropriate court in accordance with the law, HC has said.
""A death in custody is a slur on a civilised State and completely unacceptable. Ideally, there should be no death, except due to natural causes, while in Custody,"" HC has said. (ANI)"

The ruling on Friday by Judge Enock Chacha Mwita said Kenya could only deploy officers abroad if it had a 'reciprocal arrangement' with the host government. It also ruled that only defense forces could be deployed, not security services.
Last year, the Nairobi court suspended the government's plan to send 1,000 police officers to Haiti.
Three petitioners, including opposition politician and constitutional lawyer Ekuru Aukot, brought the case, telling VOA at the time the proposed deployment was unconstitutional, an argument accepted by the court.
In October, the U.N. Security Council had approved a Kenya-led multinational security force aimed at helping to combat violent gangs in the troubled Caribbean nation.
Other African countries, including Chad, Senegal, Burundi, also have said they will add troops to the multinational force.
While many in Kenya have questioned their country's lead role in this mission, some had been supportive of President William Ruto, who had said, ""It's a mission for humanity and ... is of special significance and critical urgency"" for Kenyans.""
Violence escalated in Haiti on Wednesday as a heavily armed gang surrounded a hospital in the capital of Port-au-Prince. Police later rescued the patients.
On Thursday, the head of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime warned of a 'vicious cycle' of arms trafficking to increasingly powerful Haitian gangs, fueling an internal conflict and worsening violence across the Caribbean.
Also Thursday, Haitian Foreign Affairs Minister Jean Victor Geneus told the U.N. Security Council that gang violence in his country was as barbaric as the horrors experienced in war zones, and once again asked for an international force to intervene.
Gangs across Haiti have continued to grow more powerful since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel MoÃ¯se, and the number of kidnappings and killings keeps rising."

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Houthis told UN agencies that their American and British staff were unwelcome and should not return to the Houthi-held territory.
According to local media, there are more than 20 American and British nationals working for the UN in the Houthi-controlled areas.
The request came amid rising tensions between the U.S. and British forces stationed in the Red Sea and Houthis, who have been attacking ""Israeli-linked ships"" in the region since the onset of the Israel-Hamas conflict on Oct. 7, 2023, to show solidarity with the Palestinians.
The U.S.-Britain maritime coalition in the Red Sea has carried out several airstrikes on Houthi camps in various northern provinces of Yemen. It said these actions are aimed at preventing further Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea shipping lane.
The Houthi group vowed to continue targeting ships linked to Israel in the Red Sea until Israel ends its attacks and blockade on the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian territory.
Last week, the U.S. redesignated the Houthi group as a ""terrorist organization"" and said the move would not affect food and medicine supplies to northern Yemen."

""If your kid does report this to you don't judge; don't be angry.

Tropical Cyclone Kirrily was moving west at 5 mph and forecast to make landfall overnight Thursday.
""After the cyclone crosses the coast, it's likely to weaken to a tropical low but have very high levels of rainfall associated with it,' Queensland Premier Steven Miles said at a news conference in Brisbane. 'And so depending on its path, that rainfall is likely to cause flooding in parts of the state.""
Winds gusting up to 120 kph (75 mph) were expected as it crossed the Whitsunday Islands before increasing to 150 kph (93 mph) on the Australian mainland.
Australian Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Laura Boekel said Kirrily's winds may be strong enough to cause minor damage to buildings, falling trees and power outages.
""In terms of flooding, the most intense rainfall which could lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is possible near the center and the south of that system, and that's most likely as this system crosses the coast on Thursday,"" Boekel said.
It's the second cyclone in as many months to hit the region, which was lashed in December by Tropical Cyclone Jasper, the first tropical cyclone of the Australian season, which spans the hot southern hemisphere months of November to April.
Heavy to intense rain is forecast for other parts of Queensland when the storm heads inland, and authorities have asked people to reconsider their plans for the Australia Day holiday on Friday, with a number of campgrounds set to be closed on Wednesday.
""As of this evening, we will ask the community to start limiting their travel in these (impacted) areas due to strong winds and rain,"" Queensland state disaster coordinator Deputy Commissioner Shane Chelepy said.
""The next 24 hours is critical for our communities, all the way down from Cardwell down to the Whitsunday area, to prepare for this crossing,"" Chelepy said.
The Queensland government said extra emergency services crews, specializing in flood rescues, have also been deployed.
The storm system is expected to move into inland regions of Queensland from Friday. But in welcome news for the storm-battered area, forecast models have shown the potential rainfall may be less than previously forecast."

BrahMos will also form the crux of India's planned Integrated Rocket Force (IRF), aimed at non-contact conventional warfare to counter China's rapidly expanding missile and nuclear forces.

Zelensky informed Scholz of the current situation on the frontline and the priority needs of the Ukrainian military, the presidential press service reported.
The president thanked the chancellor for his efforts aimed at ensuring long-term support for Ukraine and increasing defense assistance to 8 billion euros (about 8.7 billion U.S. dollars) this year.
In particular, Zelensky praised Germany's recent decision to transfer six Sea King Mk41 helicopters to Ukraine.
The parties also discussed in detail the prospects to bolster Ukraine's air defense system and provide the Eastern European country with artillery and armored vehicles.
The preparation of an agreement on security commitments between Ukraine and Germany was another topic of the talks.
In 2023, Germany provided 5.4 billion euros (about 5.9 billion U.S. dollars) in military aid for Ukraine after 2 billion euros (about 2.2 billion U.S. dollars) in 2022."

Ukraine should be designated as a terrorist state, and the government in Kiev should be branded a terrorist cell, the head of the State Duma Defense Committee Andrey Kartapolov has said, following the crash of an IL-76 military aircraft in Russia's Belgorod Region.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Russian military transport plane crashed near the village of Yablonovo, around 90km from the Ukrainian border. It was carrying 65 captured Ukrainian military personnel for a prisoner swap, as well as six crew members and three people accompanying the POWs. It is believed that there were no survivors.
According to Kartapolov, Kiev was well aware of who this plane was transporting and accused the Ukrainian forces of shooting down the aircraft using what he claimed were ""three Patriot or Iris-T air defense missiles.""
He also noted that there had been another IL-76 carrying 80 more Ukrainian POWs in the sky at the time of the incident. This plane was turned around after the crash, the MP said.
Regarding the exact details of the incident, Kartapolov said ""specialists will figure this out later,"" but noted that Kiev had demonstrated an unbelievable degree of cynicism by destroying its own soldiers.
""There can be no negotiations with these 'people,'"" he said, calling on the international community to open its eyes and realize who it is trying to help.
Ukrainian media have also reported that the country's military destroyed the plane, citing government sources.
Ukrainskaya Pravda, however, claimed that the aircraft had been transporting S-300 air defense missiles rather than prisoners. Some time after its initial report, the newspaper removed the reference to Kiev's role in the incident, stating only that its military sources had confirmed the crash.

Moscow bears no responsibility for US-Russia relations reaching an all-time low, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said, insisting that the burden of restoring them lies solely with Washington.
Relations between the US and Russia went into a tailspin after the start of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022, with Moscow condemning Washington and other Western countries for introducing unprecedented sanctions and sending weapons to Kiev. The Kremlin argues the deliveries will only prolong the conflict but not change its outcome.
Another major issue in bilateral relations has been NATO's creeping expansion toward Russia's borders, which Moscow views as an existential threat. Russia has said that Ukraine's desire to join the US-led military bloc was one of the main reasons for the current conflict.
In an interview with CBS News on Monday, when asked about the potential for improving relations between Moscow and Washington amid the stand-off over Ukraine, Lavrov stressed that Russia would not take the initiative to repair them because it was not his country that spoiled them in the first place.
The minister stressed that the ties between the two powers were shattered by ""those who invented the Russian threat"" and ""those who ignored huge amount of goodwill shown by President Vladimir Putin during his first two terms."" According to Lavrov, Western policymakers decided that the Russian leader was ""so nice,"" and tried to ""keep him in [their] pocket,"" which was a mistake.
Lavrov went on to regret that the current generation of politicians in Washington had seemingly drawn no lessons from what he described as ""unacceptable policies which the United States started to promote"" in the early 1990s.
The minister's comments come after Putin admitted last month that he was a ""naive"" person early in his political career because he believed that there was no fundamental reason for Russia and the West to be at odds after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, he said that he later realized that Western countries were seeking to bring about the partition of Russia into several entities in order to gain more global influence.

The law was hurriedly adopted in the National Assembly in December after it won backing from the opposition rightwing Republican Party. It also had the support of the far-right.
However after more than a month of deliberations, the nine judges of the Constitutional Council - the country's highest constitutional court - repealed 32 measures that it deemed were unconstitutional.
Among them were toughening access to social benefits for foreigners, limits on the right to citizenship for children born in France to foreign parents, and restrictions on family reunification visas.
The court also rejected the introduction of immigration quotas set by parliament.
Most of the items struck off were amendments added by right-wing parties to the government's original, softer, bill.
The toughened rules had been denounced by rights groups as ""the most regressive immigration law in decades"", while a third of France's 101 departments said they would refuse to implement the provisions on benefits for non-citizens.
Accepting that some of the law's provisions could be unconstitutional, President Emmanuel Macron had sent it to the Constitutional Council for review and approval.
What are the controversial immigration reforms adopted by France? 'A shield': Macron defends controversial immigration lawMixed reactions
Despite the court's rejection of large parts of the law, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin described the ruling as a ""validation"" of the government's immigration policy.
""Never has a law provided so many means for expelling delinquents and so many requirements for the integration of foreigners,"" he said.
""The government takes note ... of the censorship of numerous articles added by parliament for non-compliance.""
Meanwhile the president of the far-rightNational Rally (RN), Jordan Bardella, accused the judges of staging a ""coup""with the support of the president.
The RN was opposed to the first version of the government's bill, which was replaced by tougher measures that were approved by lawmakers.
Republicans Party leader Eric Ciotti called for constitutional reform saying it was ""essential, now more than ever"".

In a joint effort to enhance pre-hospital emergency response capacities in the Iranian provinces hosting Afghan refugee populations, the WHO, with contribution of France, has donated three ambulances to the National Emergency Management Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran (NEMO), which serves as the primary provider of pre-hospital emergency care in the country.
In remarks at the handover ceremony, NEMO chief Jafar Miadfar expressed gratitude to WHO for its continuous efforts to improve pre-hospital emergency services in the underprivileged provinces of Iran.
He also pointed to a significant rise in the road accidents attributed to unusual movements and the illegal transit of Afghan refugees inside Iran, highlighting the vital role of WHO in addressing these challenges and enhancing nationwide emergency medical services.
Miadfar shed light on the additional hurdles faced by NEMO, citing the consequences of the sanctions imposed on Iran.

The delegation's visit is the first from U.S. lawmakers to the island since the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party won a third-straight term in the January 13 presidential election.
China, America's chief competitor for global influence, claims Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to use force to bring the self-ruling island under its control. Beijing strongly condemned Lai Ching-te's election and appears set to continue its policy of refusing to engage with the island's government - a practice that's been in place since Tsai Ing-wen's election in 2016.
'The support of the United States for Taiwan is firm. It's real, and it is 100% bipartisan,' U.S. Representative Mario Diaz Balart said.
Balart, a Florida Republican, was joined by California Democrat Ami Bera.
'In the 21st century, there's no place for aggressive action. We have to learn to live together, to trade together, to work together, to solve problems together,' Bera said.
'Just know that we are proud of the people of Taiwan. We are proud of the relationship and as strong as that relationship has always been. That is assured. It will even be stronger,' Balart said.
'So, we look forward to working together to continue to protect the peace, prosperity (and) the future of Taiwan. It's up to people of Taiwan,' Bera said.
President-elect Lai thanked the visiting co-chairs of the U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus for their visit, saying that 'today's Taiwan is a Taiwan of the world.'
'Moving forward, I will work with Vice President-elect Hsiao Bi-khim to build upon the foundation laid by President Tsai to unite the people of Taiwan, strengthen social resilience and continue to defend the cross-strait status quo of peace and stability.'
The president-elect also touched on continued military assistance from the U.S. and a proposed agreement to avoid mutual taxation of companies.
Beijing objects to any form of official contact between the U.S. and Taiwan. In 2022, it responded to a visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with some of its largest military maneuvers in years, including missile launches and a simulated blockade of the island. It views visits by foreign government officials as a recognition of the island's sovereignty.
President Joe Biden, seeking to calm that complaint, insists there's no change in America's longstanding 'One-China' policy, which recognizes Beijing as representing China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei.
Washington cut formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in order to recognize China, but U.S. law requires it to ensure the island has the ability to defend itself. That has translated into a heavy reliance on U.S. military hardware and a law saying that Washington must treat threats against the island as a matter of 'grave concern.'
China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships to intimidate and harass Taiwan, with 18 planes and six ships operating near the island in the 24 hours before 6 a.m. Thursday. Another three Chinese balloons were recorded as crossing the island, although it remains unclear if they have a military or intelligence gathering purpose."

K3OJQ0CKEH_I0UPJPBJ075P3ME,"""Father said it was male-dominated job..."": India's first female elephant-keeper after being named for Padma Shri","ANI 27th January 2024, 00:37 GMT+11","ANI 27th January 2024, 00:37 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274107235/father-said-it-was-male-dominated-job-india-first-female-elephant-keeper-after-being-named-for-padma-shri,"Guwahati (Assam) [India], January 26 (ANI): In what will be his life's crowning moment at the age of 70, Assam's Parbati Baruah, India's first female elephant keeper or 'mahout', will be one among 110 unsung yet distinguished persons to receive the country's fourth-highest civilian honour--Padma Shri--from President Droupadi Murmu.
The honour will be doubly special for Parbati, as she will be the second in the family after her elder sister, Pratima Pandey Baruah, to be conferred with the country's fourth-highest civilian award.
Pratima was conferred with Padma Shri earlier for her contribution to Goalpariya, a popular Assamese folk music.
Speaking to ANI on Friday, Parbati, a scion of the royal family of Gauripur in Dhubri of eastern Assam, said she has been around elephants since she was a child.
Trawling back into the past, she said her family had an elephant mahal, where the jumbos were kept in large numbers after being tamed and domesticated.
""I am very happy to be chosen for this recognition after so many years. I thank all, and, in particular, the state and the central governments for this honour,"" Parbati told ANI on Friday.
""I spent the better part of my life with and around elephants. I dedicated my life to their welfare. I kept on doing my work and God has now blessed me with this recognition. I will continue to work in this field. My life is dedicated to elephants and the preservation and welfare of the wildlife in general,"" she added.
Despite growing up as a royal scion in Dhubri, Parvati's earliest memories largely figure elephants and it wasn't long before she found her true calling--elephant-keeping.
Under her supervision, she has so far trained over 600 wild elephants, besides imparting training to elephant-keepers. She has also toured various parts of the country, taking part in various sessions, seminars, and fairs, among others.
Parbati, who is also known affectionately as 'Haathi ki Pari' (an angel for elephants) became the first female elephant mahout in the country, breaking all gender stereotypes associated with the profession.
She spent over four decades pioneering the efforts towards resolving the human-elephant conflict.
Starting her journey at the tender age of 14, Parbati inherited the skills from her father and 'guru', Prakritish Chandra Barua. She imbibed all her elephant-taming and keeping skills from him.
""I was introduced to elephants when I was a one-year-old infant. We had an elephant mahal in our house with a full complement of tuskers. We still have them. Growing up, a thought would often cross my mind as to whether I can also acquire the skills of handling elephants like my father,"" she told ANI.
""I asked my father if I could learn the skills. My father said no as it was a male-dominated job. However, I was adamant and learned the skills from him and the nitty gritties around it. I learnt how to deal with elephants, how to heal them, and how to apply herbal medicine to them in case they come down with an ailment. It's a job that one should learn seeing others at work. It cannot be learnt from books,"" Parbati added.
""Catching hold of an elephant and taming it is not easy as there are risks involved. But I was determined to do it. My father was satisfied with my perseverance and work and it continues to this day,"" she said.
On her message to the youth and generation-next, she said, ""Elephants are benevolent and must loved and cared for. We must learn to coexist with them. Without elephants, our existence will be at stake. Their habitat must, at the same time, be preserved.""""I request conservationists and governments to conserve our forests and ensure free and unhindered passage of elephants,"" she added.
Veering to the human-animal conflict, which is a sad reality of the present times, she said such incidents could be attributed to the everyday assault and encroachment of wildlife habitats.
""Mother nature should not be disturbed at any cost. Collectively, as a society, we have to come forward and make it happen. The government alone can't do it. Every citizen has to take a solemn pledge that he or she would make a conscious effort towards saving nature and conserving forests,"" she said.
She added that ensuring a safe passage was the key to reducing incidents of human-elephant conflicts. (ANI)"

The protestors climbed atop a water tank in the Jawahar Nagar area as a mark of their protest, prompting police and local administration officials to reach the spot and convince them to come down.
Around 103 contractual teachers, led by Harvinder Singh Balaga, State President of the B.Ed Teachers' Union, are demanding to regularise their service.
They also complained about receiving a monthly salary of Rs 6,000.
""The protestors have some demands from the government. Personnel have been deployed here to maintain safety and security. Talks will be held, and decisions will be made,"" Sameer Verma, ADCP, said.
The protestors, however, refused to call off their protest and demanded to meet Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann to secure permanent employment.
The protestors expressed pain over receiving a salary of Rs. 6,000 per month.
""We have been raising this issue, but no steps have been taken by the administration so far. The salary is just Rs 6,000 per month. We want to meet with the Chief Minister on this matter. We will continue our protest until our demands are not met,"" they complained. (ANI)"

In a lawsuit filed in a state court in Polk County, Republican Bird accused TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, of lying about the presence of inappropriate content, including drugs, nudity, alcohol and profanity, on its platform.
""TikTok has kept parents in the dark. It is time we shine a light on TikTok for exposing young children to graphic materials such as sexual content, self-harm, illegal drug use and worse,"" Bird said.
Alleging consumer fraud and engaging in deceptive and unfair conduct, Iowa is seeking financial penalties and a ban against TikTok.
It ""has industry-leading safeguards in place for young people, including parental controls and time limits for those under 18. We are committed to tackling industry wide challenges and will continue to prioritize community safety,"" TikTok said in response.
Other U.S. states, including Arkansas and Utah, have filed similar cases against TikTok, which, along with other social media companies, is being pressured by regulators in many countries to protect children from harmful content.
In November, a judge in Indiana dismissed a lawsuit against TikTok by the state's attorney-general.
On January 31, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and other social media CEOs will testify before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on online child sexual exploitation."

The latest decree by Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky essentially amounts to ""territorial claims"" on sovereign Russian regions, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Monday. Posting on Telegram, he was referring to a document declaring six Russian regions to be ""historically inhabited by Ukrainians.""
Signed on Monday, Ukraine's Day of Unity, the presidential decree claims that six territories that are universally recognized as a part of Russia - the Krasnodar, Rostov, Voronezh, Belgorod, Kursk and Bryansk regions - had been ""historically"" populated by ""ethnic Ukrainians"" that were then supposedly subjected to ""forced Russification.""
The document then orders the Kiev government to develop an ""action plan"" to ""preserve"" the Ukrainian national identity in Russia and demands the ""true history"" of Ukraine be made known to the ""world."" It also demands Russia provide people living in these regions with access to Ukrainian-language mass media and to some special ""civil, social, cultural and religious rights.""
Medvedev dismissed the decree as a ""crude PR stunt"" aimed at drawing public attention away from the Ukrainian forces' failures on the front lines. He also said there was even no need to comment on the contents of the order, since the territories mentioned in it have always been part of Russia.
The former president (2008-2012) also said it was high time Zelensky ""stopped"" such policies and abandoned them, or he might end up ""annexing Canada in the near future.""
Zelensky himself described signing the decree as a way to promote ""truth about Ukrainians... and their history."" He also claimed that it was aimed at ""restoring the truth about the historical past for the Ukrainian future.""
The Russian regions mentioned in the decree have been regularly subjected to drone and missile attacks as well as shelling by the Ukrainian troops. In December, Belgorod - the capital of one of the regions supposedly ""historically inhabited by Ukrainians"" - was struck by a major Ukrainian attack. The strike claimed the lives of 25 people, including children. The Russian Defense Ministry also said that Kiev's forces used banned cluster munitions in an attack targeting the city center just a day before New Year's Eve celebrations.

Baloch people had been protesting in Islamabad since December 20, 2023 against enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings.
Baloch activist Mahrang Baloch said they will head back to Balochistan tomorrow with pain, suffering and anti-Baloch attitudes of Islamabad. She said, ""We will hold a rally in Balochistan on January 27,"" The News International reported.
In a post shared on X, Mahrang Baloch stated, ""Tomorrow we are going back to Balochistan from Islamabad with pain, suffering and anti-Baloch attitudes of Islamabad. We will reach our land and convey the stories of Islamabad from the Singlakh mountains of Balochistan to the blue sea.""""Now our morale and courage have increased, and we will now take this movement to the homes of Balochistan with our powerful morale. It is our promise to our people and the land that we will defeat this imperialist system from our land with the power of the people,"" she added.
The development comes a day after NPC Islamabad registered a complaint with the Kohsar Police Station on Monday requesting to remove the Baloch protesters from the open park in front of the NPC.
Earlier in the day, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said that it stands with the ongoing Baloch camp led by women against enforced disappearances. It said it is ""deeply concerned"" by efforts to uproot the Baloch camp.
In a post shared on X, HRCP stated, ""HRCP stands in solidarity with the ongoing Baloch camp led by women against enforced disappearances that has faced persistent harassment from local law enforcement, as well as dismissal from government authorities.""""We are also deeply concerned by efforts to uproot the camp--this violates not only the Islamabad High Court's order that the camp remain undisturbed, but also the protestors' right to peacefully assemble. The validity of the Baloch protestors' demands cannot continue to be ignored, and must be heeded with the legitimacy it deserves, not with undue force or defamation,"" it added.
In its complaint, the National Press Club's administration said that it felt a security threat due to certain reasons, as many political and social personalities of national stature visit the NPC to participate in different functions, The News International reported.
The NPC administration said that the protesters' sit-in had been going on for more than two months, causing financial loss as the people belonging to political and social sectors as they avoid holding press conferences and other political and social functions at the NPC, The News International reported.
Baloch activist Mahrang Baloch expressed dismay at the letter and stressed that the journalist and media community ""have an obligation to stand with people whose voices are neglected,"" Dawn reported.
""It is painful to see that even now, the Islamabad Press Club is uncomfortable with our staging a sit-in outside the press club, protesting against enforced disappearances. We understand why they are doing this. There is pressure on us, too, and through various means, we are being harassed and threatened, with the police circulating false information,' she added.
Another organiser, Sammi Deen Baloch, said, ""Earlier, our protests were not covered, but now the journalists are becoming a party and they are angry and disgusted with our protests."" Baloch further said,""I don't need to tell you what journalistic responsibilities are, but I must say that if there are strong on one side and weak on the other side, then we should take care of the weak instead of the strong.""Earlier in December, the Islamabad police launched a crackdown on Baloch protesters and dismantled their camps set up outside the National Press Club. Police arrested the majority of the Baloch protesters. The decision was criticised by several human rights activists, which led to the authorities releasing all Baloch protesters after a week-long detention. (ANI)"

The function was presided over by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha at the Convention Centre just two days before the celebration of 75th Republic Day.
The Lt Governor congratulated the Jammu Kashmir Bank for its endeavour to strengthen the spirit of 'Ghar Ghar KCC Abhiyaan' and 'Swarozgar Utsav'--two ongoing campaigns aimed at financial empowerment of farmers and the youth.
""Today, JK creates a new record by distributing sanction letters to set up new units and startups that will fulfil the dreams of youth and their aspiration of being job creators and not job seekers,"" the Lt Governor said.
This momentous occasion also marks a significant leap forward in transforming UT's economic landscape, he added.
He said JK Bank is the common man's bank and is playing an important role for the betterment of common people.
Swarozgar Utsav for entrepreneurship and self-employment covered all panchayats of JK UT, and JK Bank will provide Rs 1384 crore to set up new units and startups, the Lt Governor observed. We will provide training and supportive infrastructure to create sustainable employment for more youth in these units, he said.
The Lt Governor also highlighted the achievements registered in the saturation of Kisan Credit Card across the Union Territory.
""Under Ghar-Ghar KCC Abhiyaan, about 2 lakh farmers are provided with Kisan Credit Cards to ensure they have access to reliable, adequate, and affordable credit. I see a new revolution is under way in the agriculture and allied sectors that will construct new pathways for the prosperity of Jammu and Kashmir,"" the Lt Governor said.
While appreciating the bank's contribution towards social development projects in the UT under its CSR initiatives, the Lt Governor underscored the scope for input credit in the agriculture and MSME sectors to help farmers and youth create employment opportunities besides attaining self-sufficiency, as per the statement.
He directed the JK Bank to achieve saturation in Ghar Ghar KCC Abhiyaan, Stand-Up India, and startups.
We have a lot of expectations from JK Bank, and I expect the bank to devise campaigns to take financial literacy programmes to a vast portion of the population. Under the Back to Village and My Town, My Pride programs, the banks must strive to achieve the envisaged target for the extension of financial assistance to enterprising youth, he observed.
""As we embark on a path of renewed economic and social development in UT, banks, especially JK Bank, will have to ensure the economic needs of farmers, youth, and women are catered to with people-friendly schemes aimed at creating employment and livelihood opportunities not only for the beneficiaries but those associated with them as well,"" the Lt Governor said.
On this occasion, the Lt Governor handed over Insurance Claim Settlement checks to the legal heirs of the deceased government employees covered under the bank's Group Personal Accidental Insurance. He also felicitated successful entrepreneurs and farmers financed by the bank, as per the statement.
The Lt Governor launched the Kisan Sathi Chatbot, an AI-based farmer-friendly application of the Agriculture Production Department. Pertinently, JK Bank has also contributed Rs 40.27 lakh under its CSR initiative for the chatbot application, it added.

Russia welcomes initiatives from Pope Francis aimed at achieving a lasting peace in Ukraine, but has noted Kiev's apparent reluctance to consider such calls, according to Moscow's envoy to the Vatican, Ivan Soltanovsky.
Pope Francis has repeatedly urged a peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict throughout the hostilities. In his latest Christmas address, he once again implored peace between Moscow and Kiev, as well as in the Middle East and other conflict zones, calling on humanity to say ""no"" to war and cease weapons manufacturing. ""How can we even speak of peace, when arms production, sales and trade are on the rise?"" the pontiff asked.
Moscow has backed the Vatican's calls, and Soltanovsky told RIA Novosti on Thursday that ""for our part, we welcome any initiatives that could bring closer the achievement of a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine, especially when they come from such authoritative leaders as Francis.""
However, Soltanovsky claimed that ""practice has shown"" that Kiev only respects the opinions of politicians who are ""interested not in stopping hostilities, but in inflating it by pumping Ukraine with weapons and ammunition.""
The envoy also said Kiev has effectively ""tied its own hands"" by banning negotiations with the current Russian leadership. In October 2022, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree that made it illegal for Kiev to hold talks with Moscow while Vladimir Putin is in power.
Russia, meanwhile, has repeatedly signaled that it remains open to holding peace talks, as long as Kiev acknowledges Moscow's interests and accepts the ""new realities on the ground,"" referring to the former Ukrainian regions that overwhelmingly voted to officially become part of Russia.
In an interview with CBS News earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated that Russia is prepared to listen to anyone interested in establishing ""justice"" in relations between Moscow and Kiev. Russia will also discuss any ""serious proposal"" that addresses the situation on the ground and the root causes of the conflict, he added.
Lavrov stressed, however, that for such talks to happen, the West would have to stop its policy of using Ukraine as ""an instrument of war against Russia,"" recalling Moscow's long-standing concerns about NATO expansion.
Officials from Moscow and Kiev recently revealed that the two sides were close to reaching a peace deal early in the Ukraine conflict. However, the process was reportedly derailed by then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who allegedly convinced Ukraine to continue fighting.

The former president claimed that Iran was ""broke"" during his tenure because of his policies while today the country is 'pumping' money.
Speaking to the reporters in Londonderry City, New Hampshire, Trump said, ""If they (voters) want a great country, if they want a country where we say, 'Make America great again', there's nothing like it...Make America Great Again, that's all you have to say. We are making America great.""The former president further claimed that while everything was going ""so well"" when he was in office, today the whole world is 'blowing up'.
""We had this going so well. And look at the world, the world is blowing up too. We had no wars. Russia would never have invaded Ukraine, and Israel would never have been attacked. Look what is happening, the world is blowing up,"" Trump said.
He added, ""Iran was broke, you know why they had no money? Because I said to other countries, you can't deal with them until we make a deal...now Iran is spreading money all over. We are bombing the Middle East again, and it's having no impact. You know why? because they don't respect Biden, they no longer respect our country.""Citing remarks by Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban, who has weighed his support for the former President, Trump said, ""Bring Trump back, everything worked when Trump was there"".
Meanwhile, voting has started for the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, where Trump is competing with former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley for the GOP nomination, aiming to challenge President Joe Biden in the November 2024 election.
Trump registered a landslide victory in Iowa caucuses winning 20 out of the 40 delegates from Iowa with 56,250 votes -- a whopping difference of over 32,000 votes.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was the distant second with eight delegates and Haley was not much behind with seven. However, the former pulling out of the White House big has made it a two-way race at the GOP.
A CNN poll released on Sunday found Trump with 50 per cent support among likely Republican primary voters in New Hampshire, while his closest competitor, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, stood at 39 per cent.
Trump, having launched his bid in November 2022, seeks to secure a non-consecutive term, persistently denying the 2020 election outcome and facing multiple criminal charges. His potential second term promises a substantial overhaul of federal government factions and aggressive actions against political opponents, CNN reported.
On the other hand, Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, entered the presidential race in February 2023, advocating for a fresh wave of Republican leadership. Her campaign emphasizes economic responsibility, national security, and border strengthening.
If successful in the primary, Haley could become the first woman and the first Asian American nominated by the GOP for president. Her political journey includes serving in the South Carolina House and making history as the state's first female governor, as reported by CNN. (ANI)."

Quoting from the reply of the Election Commission to a query filed under RTI, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said, ""There is no information on the authenticity of EVMs. The Election Commission, itself, has admitted that it doesn't have a tech team and all its operations and functionalities are in the hands of private people.

Seeking a meeting between top EC officials and a ""small delegation of the INDIA bloc"" to ""listen to what it has to say on the issue of VVPATs"", Ramesh said the poll body ""yet again failed"" to provide a ""substantive response"" to their queries and genuine concerns on EVMs.
""It is also surprising to note that the Commission has been taking refuge behind judicial orders while also reminding us that Public Interest Litigations filed on the issue of EVMs and VVPATs have been dismissed with monetary costs. Be that as it may, these litigations have no bearing on the queries raised,"" the Congress leader added.
He claimed that the Commission is ""aware that the pendency of any judicial proceedings pertaining to VVPATS does not bar the Commission from discussing or hearing the suggestions of INDIA parties"".
On January 5, the EC refuted Ramesh's allegations on VVPATs and EVMs, saying that it was firm in its assertion that literature in the public domain on EVMs, including the latest updated FAQs (85 Questions), answers all reasonable and legitimate aspects of the use of such devices adequately and comprehensively.
""The current letter dated 30th December 2023, said to be in sequence of the earlier letters, has no new assertions or reasonable and legitimate doubts which require further clarifications,"" the Commission stated in response to Ramesh's letter.
On January 2, the former Union minister wrote to the EC seeking an appointment for a delegation of INDIA bloc leaders to discuss concerns around VVPATs. (ANI)"

This decision is part of Tata Steel's strategy to revamp its loss-making United Kingdom (UK) steelmaking business by transitioning to lower carbon electric arc furnaces, supported by a government investment of Â£500 million ($634.10 million).
Around 2,500 positions are expected to be affected within the next 18 months, with a total of 2,800 jobs in jeopardy. Tata Steel will initiate a consultation process as part of its restructuring efforts and aims to maximize voluntary redundancies.
Tata Steel's Chief Executive, T V Narendran, acknowledged the difficulty of this course but emphasized its necessity for building a sustainable long-term business in the UK.
Tata Steel is a significant employer in the UK, with over 8,000 employees. The warning of potential 3,000 redundancies was issued in September when the government announced its funding package to safeguard 5,000 jobs.
Trade unions Community, Unite, and GMB expressed their rejection of Tata Steel's plan in a separate statement and indicated that they would consult their members on potential next steps, including industrial action.
The transition to electric steelmaking is expected to reduce Britain's carbon emissions by 1.5%, given that Port Talbot's coal-fired plant is the largest single carbon emitter in the country. Tata Steel intends to provide a Â£130 million support package to assist affected employees in retraining and finding new job opportunities.
While the move to electric arc furnaces is seen as a positive step for environmental reasons, critics argue that it will significantly reduce the industry's size, as electric arc furnaces primarily use recycled scrap steel instead of producing ""virgin steel"" from iron ore, coke, and other raw materials.
British Steel, owned by China, is also discussing with the government a shift to cleaner manufacturing. Union representatives have cautioned that this transition could result in up to 2,000 job losses."

Moscow has never closed the door to dialogue to end the Ukraine conflict, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday, reiterating that Russia's key goal remains stopping NATO's unchecked expansion towards its borders.
In a rare interview with CBS News in New York, where he arrived to take part in UN meetings on Ukraine and the Middle East, Lavrov rejected a recent claim by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who alleged that Moscow has shown no ""willingness... to engage, to negotiate in good faith"" to end the conflict with Kiev.
""It's not true,"" Lavrov stressed, adding that Russia has always been ready to discuss ""any serious proposal"" that addresses the situation on the ground and the root causes of hostilities. Moscow is also willing to reach a solution ""which would guarantee legitimate national interests of Russia and the Ukrainian people,"" the diplomat stated.
Lavrov reiterated that Russia is prepared to listen to anyone interested in establishing ""justice"" in relations between Moscow and Kiev. He insisted, however, that this would require the West to stop its policy of ""using Ukraine as an instrument of war against Russia.""
Lavrov recalled that Russia has long voiced concerns about NATO expansion. ""The goal is very simple... we've been warning publicly since 2008... that NATO's expansion against all promises [to Russia and the Soviet Union]... was going too far,"" he said.
At a 2008 summit in Bucharest, NATO leaders declared that Ukraine would eventually become part of the alliance, sparking a backlash from Russia, which has traditionally viewed the US-led military bloc's expansion towards its borders as an existential threat.
In December 2021, weeks before the start of the Ukraine conflict, Moscow submitted a draft of security guarantees to the US and NATO, demanding that the West ban Kiev's accession to the bloc and retreat to its borders as of 1997. The overture, however, was rebuffed.
Officials from Moscow and Kiev said the two sides were close to reaching a peace deal early in the Ukraine conflict, with a key Russian demand being that the neighboring country recommit to neutral status and abandon its NATO ambitions. According to numerous reports, the process was derailed by then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who convinced Ukraine to continue fighting.

Criticism and hostile actions from western nations only demonstrate their inconsistent stance on human rights matters, Lopez said.
GENEVA, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- China has made significant progress in eradicating absolute poverty, and has developed its own approach to human rights advancement, a consultant from the International Association for Human Rights and Social Development (AIDHDES) said this week.
Criticism and hostile actions from western nations only demonstrate their inconsistent stance on human rights matters, David Lopez told Xinhua in an interview.
China took part in the fourth round of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) conducted by the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council on Tuesday in Geneva, Switzerland. Following the review, Lopez commended China's advancements in the field of human rights.
""I visited China for the first time in April 2023, and I was in Beijing, Hangzhou, Chongqing, Yiwu, Shenyang. I was really impressed by the development of the country."" Lopez said.

China's significant endeavors and successful outcomes in eliminating extreme poverty are a clear demonstration of the country's current human rights accomplishments, he said.
Lopez also acknowledged that certain countries have deficiencies in the realm of human rights. ""There are problems on the borders with Mexico and the United States. There are problems in New York, there are problems in Paris."" However, it is paradoxical that western nations have engaged in numerous hostile attacks and demonization tactics when dealing with China, he noted.
""In the western countries, unfortunately, people don't take the time to understand the culture and the trajectory of a country like China,"" he said.

China has been unjustly targeted by fabricated human rights allegations originating from western sources, he said, adding that ""it's not China that has more than 5,000 military bases around the world.""
Lopez asserted that the United States employs military and economic methods to intervene in other nations, while simultaneously undermining China's credibility in the realm of human rights. This is a clear instance of double standards, he said, referring to the ongoing situations in Afghanistan and Libya.
Regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Lopez said that the United States has contributed to the worsening of human rights conditions in Gaza, particularly in relation to displaced children.

""The United States promoted that. They (said) Israel has the right to defend itself, so it can use aggressive activity to kill and to promote this genocide in Palestine,"" he said.

Ties between Moscow and Washington are unlikely to improve, even if Donald Trump wins the upcoming 2024 US presidential elections, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS in an interview that aired on Tuesday. The former US president had previously repeatedly boasted about his good relations with Vladimir Putin.
America's general approach towards Russia has not changed over the past decades, Lavrov said, adding that Washington itself had ruined its relations with Moscow by dismantling all the ""confidence-building"" mechanisms and eroding mutual trust.
The minister pointed in particular to the decision by former US President George W. Bush to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty) in 2002. The key arms control agreement signed by the US and the USSR in 1972 limited the number of ballistic missile defense systems each side could have and was designed to de-pressurize the arms race between the two Cold War rivals.
Washington has since shattered the ""foundations"" of bilateral relations with Russia by terminating ""all agreements on strategic stability, parity, mutual trust, inspections and transparency,"" Lavrov said. Trump himself was instrumental in dismantling one of the few remaining arms control treaties - the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Agreement, which banned the two nations from having any ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers.
The US first unilaterally suspended the INF Treaty in February 2019, during Trump's presidency, and then withdrew from it in August of the same year. Russia suspended the agreement in February in response to the initial American move.
According to Lavrov, Washington is still too obsessed with its own perceived ""superiority"" and ""impunity"" to change its approach to relations with Moscow. The US leaders had ""ignored [the] huge amount of goodwill shown by Putin during his first two terms,"" the Russian minister said, adding that American politicians apparently sought to keep the Russian president ""in their pocket.""
They had ""miscalculated everything,"" Moscow's top diplomat said, adding that the current generation of US politicians had not learned a ""single lesson"" from the mistakes of their predecessors.
In recent months, Trump has on several occasions vowed to put an end to the conflicts both between Moscow and Kiev and Israel and Hamas. He particularly claimed that he would be able to quickly convince both Putin and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to sit down at the negotiating table since he allegedly knew both leaders ""well.""
Moscow denied it had held any talks with the former US president and the current GOP frontrunner on reaching peace with Kiev. ""There have been no contacts on this issue,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.

West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said that the alliance is unnatural and not politically viable as the Congress, Left and the TMC are at loggerheads with one another in the state.
""This alliance is unnatural and not politically viable because, in West Bengal, Congress and CPM are fighting against Mamata Banerjee. A while ago, in the Panchayat elections, Congress and CPM were thrashed by TMC workers,"" Majumdar said speaking to ANI on Wednesday.
Majumdar said that though top leaders of the three parties met together and had cordial ties with one another the situation on the ground is much different.
""If you had thought that with Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee and Sitaram Yechuri having tea together, the alliance would be strong and the workers on the ground would get trashed and vote for TMC, that would not have happened. Mamata Banerjee knows the ground report and the state CPM and the state Congress were opposed to it,"" he said.
""The INDI alliance is such a boat that does not have anyone steering it. It neither has a leader nor any ideology...,"" he added lambasting the Opposition alliance.
Meanwhile, Karnataka BJP leader R Ashok welcomed Mamata Banerjee's stand saying that the Congress do no have any state leader in West Bengal which makes it a 'nalayak' party.
""I welcome Mamata Banerjee's stand. Congress is a 'nalayak' party. There is no leader of Congress in West Bengal which means it is a 'nalayak' party,"" R Ashok said speaking to reporters.
Pointing out the cracks in the alliance, Ashok said, ""Nitish Kumar is one step out. Akhilesh Yadav is already gone. They came for an alliance in Bengaluru.

""Today, India's glory shines highly on the global stage. When I meet and greet global leaders, it's not Modi but 140 crore Indians who represent India, who represent this great nation. Today, India stands strong and resilient, more than ever before. Notably, this is the power of a poorna bahumat sarkar',"" PM Modi said.
Talking about the current circumstances of the country, PM Modi said, ""The conditions prevailing in the country 10-12 years ago had made the future of India bleak. You may not even be aware of the conditions of those times. The generation before 2014 had given up hope in the possibilities we are talking about today. But today, the circumstances have changed! From the ramparts of the Red Fort, I stated that 'yehi samay hai, sahi samay hai.' And this holds true today. You read the newspapers, and you will get to see India shine and make big strides in one sector after another.""Emphasising the importance of every vote in a democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged young voters and said that when the country is working to become a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, your vote will decide the direction of India.
While addressing the youth, he said, ""My youth of India, please join the MY Bharat organisation. You can also keep sending me your views and suggestions through the NaMo app as to how the BJP's resolution letter should be in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, especially what should be included in it for the youth."" PM Modi said.
Earlier, the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, extended greetings on the occasion of National Voters Day.
The Prime Minister posted on X, ""Greetings on National Voters Day, an occasion that celebrates our vibrant democracy and is also a day to encourage people to register as voters if they haven't already. (ANI)"
L2RDW6DX8C_XVUXZE7XZBCYIRS,Nepal Asks Russia to Return Nepalis Fighting in Ukraine,"Voice of America 25th January 2024, 23:36 GMT+11","Voice of America 25th January 2024, 23:36 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106119/nepal-asks-russia-to-return-nepalis-fighting-in-ukraine,"KATHMANDU, Nepal - Nepal has asked Russia to send back hundreds of Nepali nationals who were recruited to fight against Ukraine and repatriate the bodies of those who died in the conflict, Nepal's top diplomat said Thursday.
The Russian army is estimated to have recruited more than 200 Nepali nationals to fight in Ukraine and at least 14 of them have died there, Nepal's Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud said in an interview with The Associated Press.
'We have asked Russia to immediately stop the recruitment of Nepali nationals in their army, immediately return those who are already serving in the army, repatriate the bodies of those killed, and treat and return those who were wounded in the fighting,' Saud said.
Nepal is also seeking monetary compensation from Russia for the families of those Nepali nationals who were killed in the fighting, Saud said.
Among the 14 confirmed killed Nepali nationals, Russia has said it is in possession of 12 bodies. Most Nepali people want the bodies of their deceased relatives to be cremated following religious rituals.
'We have information that five of our citizens who fought on behalf of the Russians are being held captive by the Ukraine side. We are asking the Russian side to take initiatives to get them freed,' Saud said.
Russian officials have not commented on the recruitment of foreign nationals for military service in Ukraine, but media reports have said that along with Nepal the Russian military has recruited some people from Cuba.
Russian law allows foreign nationals to enlist in its army after they sign a contract with the Defense Ministry.
In September, Cuban authorities arrested 17 people in connection with what they said was a network to recruit Cuban nationals to fight for Russia in Ukraine.
Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree that speeds up a path to Russian citizenship for foreigners who enlist in the country's military as Moscow tries to replenish its troops in Ukraine by various methods, including the recruitment of migrants.
Ukraine is also believed to have hired some Nepalis to fight as soldiers, but Saud said he did not have more information on this.
Nepal's government has banned its citizens from traveling to Russia or Ukraine for employment, saying many have been recruited by the Russian army to fight in the conflict in Ukraine.
Tens of thousands of Nepalis go abroad in search of work each year and are required to get a permit from the government before leaving the country for employment.
Saud met with Russian officials on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement conference in Uganda earlier this month and discussed the issues with them.
For centuries, Nepali nationals were recruited by the British army to fight as famed Gurkha soldiers and later by India when it gained independence from Britain. That arrangement was made in 1816 after signing a treaty between Nepal and Britain."

The Pentagon has dubbed its campaign of air and missile strikes against the Houthis of Yemen 'Operation Poseidon Archer', CNN reported on Monday, citing two unnamed officials.
The name has been applied retroactively to the January 11 attacks carried out by the US and the UK, as well as seven more rounds of strikes since, the officials said.
They also said that 'Poseidon Archer' is being treated as entirely separate from 'Prosperity Guardian', an operation announced in December that officially involves personnel and ships from 20 countries.
The US launched 'Prosperity Guardian' to secure the passage of merchant ships through the Red Sea and the Bab-el-Mandeb, after the Houthis said they would interdict any ""Israeli-linked"" ships in solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. After the January 11 attacks, the Yemeni group said that British and American vessels would be fair game as well.
The naming ""suggests a more organized, formal, and potentially long-term approach"" by the Pentagon to the situation in the Red Sea, according to CNN.
The US military has long used names intended to influence international and domestic perceptions about its operations. The practice of using ""heroes of antiquity"" and ""figures from Greek and Roman mythology,"" was introduced by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in WWII. Poseidon is the Greek god of the sea, known in the Roman pantheon as Neptune.

US President Joe Biden admitted last week that the Anglo-American strikes failed to deter the Houthis, but said they would continue anyway.
""When you say 'working', are they stopping the Houthis? No. Are they going to continue? Yes,"" he told reporters outside the White House.
The US is ""clear-eyed about who the Houthis are"" and doesn't expect them to stop their attacks ""immediately,"" but hopes to ""degrade and destroy their capabilities,"" the Washington Post reported on Saturday, citing anonymous US officials. Rather than invading Yemen, the US wants to hit ""infrastructure"" that enables the Yemeni group to fire missiles and drones at merchant vessels, one unnamed diplomat explained.
The Houthis have said they would continue targeting ships until Israel stops its offensive and lifts the blockade of Gaza. West Jerusalem has vowed to ""eradicate"" Hamas after the Palestinian group's October 7 raid that claimed the lives of an estimated 1,200 Israelis.
The attacks have impacted the global shipping industry more than the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the maritime advisory firm Sea-Intelligence. Roughly 15% of the world's sea trade uses the Red Sea and the Suez Canal to deliver goods from Asia to Europe and vice versa.
Facing skyrocketing insurance premiums, major Western carriers such as Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM, and Hapag-Lloyd have chosen to reroute their vessels around Africa, at the cost of time and fuel.

L8QIRCRXGT_49Q28INVKKFZUP1,Anti-Semitism in France 'quadrupled' on back of Israel-Hamas war,"RFI 25th January 2024, 21:47 GMT+11","RFI 25th January 2024, 21:47 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106025/anti-semitism-in-france-quadrupled-on-back-of-israel-hamas-war,"Anti-Semitic acts in France nearly quadrupled in 2023 compared with the previous year, the country's main Jewish interest group warned on Thursday. The Crif pointed to a surge in incidents since the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel.
The Council of Jewish Institutions in France (Crif) reported a whopping 1,676 anti-Semitic acts in 2023, compared to 436 the previous year.
It was citing figures from the French Interior Ministry as well the Protection Service of the Jewish Community watchdog.
Nearly 60 percent of those incidents were attacks involving physical violence, threatening words or menacing gestures, the Crif said in its report.
Others were against property, while 7.5 percent of incidents were online.
The number of anti-Semitic incidents exploded in the three months following Hamas's attack on Israel, and Israel's retaliatory bombing campaign on Gaza.
The number ""equalled that of the previous three years combined"", the report said.
French rallies against anti-Semitism 'a vital battle for national cohesion': PMPerpetrators in schools
Nearly 13 percent of the anti-Semitic acts took place in schools, most of them in middle schools.
""We are witnessing perpetrators of anti-Semitic acts becoming younger. Schools are no longer a sanctuary of the republic,"" the report said
""For the first time in a long time, new generations are more open to anti-Semitic prejudices than previous generations,"" the group's president, Yonathan Arfi, told the AFP news agency.
He pointed to three so-called ""fuels"" for the phenomenon: the hatred of Israel, Islamism and belief in conspiracy theories.
Anti-Semitic and anti-French graffiti condemned in CorsicaSharpest rise
The increase in anti-Semitism is the worst since the Crif started keeping such statistics in 2012.
Previous spikes came after Mohammed Merah killed three children and a teacher at a Jewish school in Toulouse in 2012, and after the 2015 attack on a Paris kosher market that left four people dead.
The Crif warns that its tally reflects only incidents that were reported officially to the police, and that the real number may be much higher.
Pointing to the Jews who have started hiding their identity - by removing mezuzah door ornaments or changing names on mailboxes - Arfi worries that ""the risk, in the end, is that of the invisibilisation of Jews in the public sphere"".
Anti-Semitism, he said, was an issue that ""goes beyond Jews"", and says something about the ""societies in which it develops"".

Raised in 1953, 61 Cavalry is the only serving active Horsed Cavalry Regiment in the world, with the amalgamation of all the 'State Horsed Cavalry Unite. It has the unique distinction of leading the last recorded Cavalry charge in history when it took on the Turks at battle of ""HAIFA"", on 23 Sep 1918.
This Day is also celebrated as its Battle Honour Day (Haifa Day). The Regiment has won 39 Battle Honours and stands tall in Equestrian and Polo with one Padma Shri, one Sarvottam Jeevan Raksha Padak, twelve Arjuna Awards, six Vishisht Seva Medals, fifty two Chief of Army Staff Commendation, two Chief of Air Staff Commendation, two Chief of Staff Committee Commendation, two Chief of Naval Staff Commendation, nine Vice Chief of Army Staff Commendation, eight Chief of Integrated Defence Staff Commendation, one Vice Chief of Naval Staff Commendation and 195 General Officer Commanding in Chief Commendations. Its motto is 'Ashwa Shakti Yashobal' which means `Horse Power is Forever Supreme'.
The Republic Day 2024 celebrations began after Prime Minister Narendra Modi began paid floral tributes at the National War Memorial to honour bravehearts of the Indian armed forces.
PM Modi was received by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on his arrival at the National War Memorial.
This year, the guards were commanded by an Indian Army Officer, Major Indrajeet Sachin from 6th Battalion of Sikh Regiment.
When the Prime Minister laid the wreath, the Inter-Services Guards presented `Salami Shastra' followed by 'Shok Shastra'. Simultaneously, the buglers sounded the 'Last Post'.
PM Modi observed a two-minute silence in homage to the supreme sacrifices of the armed personnel in protecting the nation after which the buglers played 'Rouse' and the guards presented 'Salami Shastra' again.
The Prime Minister then endorsed his remarks in the digital Visitor's Book of the National War Memorial.
PM Modi was joined by the three service chiefs as he paid his respects at the solemn function. He then proceeded to the Kartavya Path for the Republic Day parade.
President Droupadi Murmu leads the country in the grand celebrations of its journey of Amrit Kaal that began post the 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav' celebrations to commemorate 75 years of the country's independence.
Viksit Bharat's rich cultural diversity, the 'Aatmanirbhar' military prowess and the growing Nari Shakti are the dominating themes of the 90-minute parade that will be graced by French President Emmanuel Macron as Chief Guest.
Based on the twin themes of 'Viksit Bharat' and 'Bharat - Loktantra ki Matruka', this year's parade will witness the participation of around 13,000 special Guests - an initiative that will provide an opportunity for people from all walks of life to take part in the celebrations and encourage Jan Bhagidari in this national festival.

The report titled 'Under Siege: Legislative, Judicial and Executive Actions Stifling Freedom of Expression and Right to Information' was published by the Institute of Research, Advocacy and Development (IRADA) as part of its annual state of digital journalism series.
""This year's report examines key legislative developments in Pakistan during the critical year of 2023, shedding light on recent acts impacting freedom of expression, access to information and the digital media landscape,"" Muhammad Aftab Alam, the executive director of IRADA said.
The report investigated the effects of judicial decisions on the overall freedom of expression, indicating nuances in court decisions that both protect and impose restrictions.
Journalists' arrests raise concerns over press freedom
""The fact that courts have used restrictive interpretations on FOE laws to shut down criticism of courts erodes their credibility to uphold it against other organs of the state. There is a fundamental mistrust of free speech in our post-colonial state structure, where the presumption is against free speech, and a citizen has to prove an exception: as opposed to it being the other way around,"" Mr Saroop Ijaz of the Human Rights Watch is quoted as saying in the report.
Concerns
Former Senator Farhatullah Babar, also interviewed and quoted in the report, said, ""Digital journalism in Pakistan is facing several challenges, including no legislation in some critical areas, faulty legislation where legislation exists and finally non-implementation of the provisions of the existing law.""
Cases of arrests of journalists, including prominent names such as Imran Riaz Khan and Khalid Jamil, involving the FIA raised concerns about press freedom, transparency, and due process, the report noted.
The report also uncovered a significant number of content removal requests from the Pakistani government to big tech platforms such as Google, Meta, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter).
For example, between January 2021 to June 2022, Meta restricted access to 12,001 items in Pakistan over PTA complaints for allegedly violating local laws.
The report cited international digital rights organisation AccessNow to show that between 2022 and 2023 there were six internet/network shutdowns across the country, as per directives from the government.

Kiev's actions in Donbass between 2014 and 2022 were nothing short of ""genocide,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday. The post-Maidan coup authorities in Ukraine were determined to ""physically"" get rid of anyone who still supported the development of good relations with Moscow, he added.
Russia cited the need to protect the people of Donbass from continued persecution by Kiev as one of the major reasons it launched its military operation in February 2022. In the wake of the 2014 Maidan coup, two former Ukrainian territories with predominantly Russian-speaking populations declared their independence from Kiev and created the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics. The post-coup Ukrainian government responded by launching an ""anti-terrorist"" operation against the two Donbass republics, sparking a protracted conflict that has raged ever since, in one form or another.
Russia initially sought to resolve the issue through the later-derailed Minsk Agreements, which envisaged a special autonomous status for the two republics within Ukraine. Moscow repeatedly accused Kiev of failing to implement the terms of the accords. In 2022, former German chancellor Angela Merkel admitted that the accords brokered by Russia, Germany, and France in 2015 were merely a strategic ploy aimed at buying Ukraine more time to prepare for a conflict with Russia.
""Everything that was happening there... was genocide,"" Putin said on Friday, referring to the events that had been unfolding in Donbass between 2014 and 2022. ""This cannot be called otherwise,"" he said, adding that people were being ""exterminated."" He also pointed to the fact that Kiev's forces continued to fight the Donbass militias after the Minsk Agreements had already been signed.
According to the president, Russia's ""geopolitical adversaries understood that they could not just turn Ukraine upside-down with its Russian-speaking population in the southeast."" The 2014 coup opened the way for the ""physical extermination of anyone who was willing to develop normal relations with Russia,"" Putin said, adding that ""it had become clear that we would not be allowed to build normal relations with our neighbor.""
Ukraine was being turned into an ""anti-Russian"" state, the president said, adding that such developments had left Moscow no choice to avoid launching its military operation.
Putin has repeatedly referred to Ukraine's policies in Donbass as ""genocide."" In June 2022, several months into the conflict with Ukraine, he said ""there can be no other definition for the Kiev regime's actions than 'a crime against humanity'.""
In February 2022, just days before the start of the Russian campaign, the nation's Investigative Committee reported that more than 2,600 civilians had been killed over the past eight years amid the conflict in Donbass. More than 5,500 civilians were injured over the same period, it added.
A UN report published in January 2022 put the total number of deaths linked to the Donbass conflict at that time at more than 14,000. At least 3,400 of them were civilians, including more than 150 children, it added.

However, the learned court, after hearing the arguments on both sides, ruled in favour of making the report available for both parties. The report will be made public and everyone will get to know what's in it.""Further weighing in on the court ruling, the counsel for the Hindu side told ANI, ""The report will tell us what the ASI has to say about the building (Gyanvapi mosque). However, the question crossing every mind right now is this: will the report throw light on whether a temple demolished was demolished to construct the so-called mosque?""He claimed that there is 'evidence' to determine beyond any reasonable doubt that a temple was razed to raise the mosque.
""I am sure the ASI, in its report, will bring this aspect of the dispute very clearly. It should as there is evidence that there used to be a mandir, which was demolished to build the so-called mosque,"" the counsel for the Hindu side said.
Earlier, on Wednesday, the Varanasi district court directed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to make public its report and provide hard copies of the same to both parties in the Gyanvapi dispute.
On January 16, the Supreme Court allowed an application by women Hindu petitioners seeking direction for cleaning the entire area of 'wazukhana' of the Gyanvapi mosque where the alleged 'Shivling' was found and ensuring that the space in question was in 'hygienic' state.
A Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said the area of 'wazukhana' shall be cleaned under the supervision of the district administration of Varanasi while referring to previous orders of the apex court.
Gyanvapi mosque management committee said it supports cleaning of the water tank, which has remained sealed for nearly two years following an apex court order.
The area of 'wazukhana' was sealed in 2022 following a Supreme Court order after the discovery of what was said to be a 'Shivling'.
The structure, which was claimed to be a 'Shivling' by the Hindu side and a 'fountain' by the Muslim side, was found in the mosque premises on May 16, 2022, during a court-mandated survey of the building located next to the Kashi Vishwanath temple.
The 'Wazu' area is at the centre of the Gyanvapi mosque-Kashi Vishwanath temple dispute in the case, with both sides staking claim to the structure discovered during the court-mandated survey. (ANI)"

LIBR1LWBF0_XBG1N6V4690C7DB,"US Calls on Israel to Protect Patients, Hospital Staff in Gaza","Voice of America 23rd January 2024, 17:05 GMT+11","Voice of America 23rd January 2024, 17:05 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103570/us-calls-on-israel-to-protect-patients-hospital-staff-in-gaza,"The United States called for Israel to protect civilians in hospitals as Israeli forces pressed ahead in its fight against Hamas militants in Gaza, carrying out airstrikes Monday in the territory's northern, central and southern regions.
White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Monday that while Israel has a right to defend itself, 'We expect them to do so in accordance with international law and to protect innocent people in hospitals, medical staff and patients as well, as much as possible.'
Reuters news agency reported that Israeli troops Monday stormed a hospital in Al-Mawasi district, west of the southern Gazan city of Khan Younis. Gaza Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qidra told the news agency that Israeli forces arrested medical staff at the hospital.
Israel has blamed Hamas for putting civilians in danger, saying the militant group intentionally operates in and around hospitals and has created a network of tunnels underneath.
Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza, after the militant group sent fighters rampaging into Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli tallies. Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others, also took about 240 people hostage.
The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 25,295 Palestinians have been killed in the war, many of them women and children. The ministry does not specify the number of civilians and Hamas fighters among the dead.
A Palestinian holds a child wounded in an Israeli strike at Nasser Hospital, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip Jan. 22, 2024.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Monday that the way Israel is carrying out its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip is ""seeding hate for generations.""
Borrell spoke ahead of separate talks EU ministers held Monday with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz and the Palestinian Authority's top diplomat, Riyad al-Maliki.
""We have in mind what Hamas is, what Hamas has done, and certainly we reject and we condemn,"" Borrell told reporters. ""But the peace and stability cannot be built only by military means, and not in this particular way of using military means.""
""The humanitarian situation could not be worse,"" Borrell said. ""There [are] no words to explain how the situation is, with hundreds of thousands without anything, without shelter, without food, without medicine and under the bombs.""
In fighting Monday, airstrikes were reported across the Gaza Strip, with intense battles in Khan Younis, the second-largest city in Gaza.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society said its ambulances were unable to reach the wounded in Khan Younis due to Israeli troops besieging the group's ambulance center.
Also Monday, groups of relatives of the Israeli hostages disrupted an Israeli parliamentary committee meeting, demanding lawmakers do more to free those still being held. The demonstration was the latest in a string of similar actions in recent days, including a protest Sunday near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence.
Netanyahu on Sunday rejected a proposal by Hamas to end the war.
""In exchange for the release of our hostages,"" the Israeli leader said in a statement, ""Hamas demands the end of the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of all the murderers and rapists. And leaving Hamas intact.'
'I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,' Netanyahu said.
Hamas on Sunday defended its terror attack on Israel but admitted to 'faults' and called for an end to 'Israeli aggression' in Gaza.
In its first public report on the attack that began the war, the militant group said it was a ""necessary step' against Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.
In late November, in a deal brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, more than 100 of the estimated 240 hostages who were taken captive to Gaza were freed in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
Since that deal ended, Netanyahu has faced mounting pressure from within Israel and from some world leaders to secure the release of the 136 hostages who remain in captivity, perhaps two dozen of whom have died or been killed.

Russia raked in record earnings from agricultural exports last year, Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev has announced, citing preliminary estimates.
Speaking at a ministerial meeting on Wednesday, Patrushev said that cross-border sales of agricultural goods brought Moscow more than $45 billion in 2023. He noted that the figure is likely to rise once final calculations are made.
""The production indicators have allowed Russia to reaffirm its status as a net exporter of agricultural products,"" the ministry's press service cited Patrushev as saying.
The minister noted that Russia's grain harvest amounted to 147 million tons last year, just short of the 157 million record reached in 2022. Milk production increased by 500,000 tons, and meat production surged by 300,000 tons. Fish production was the highest in 30 years, at 5.3 million tons. Output of salmon was particularly high at over 600,000 tons, making Russia the world's top salmon producer, according to the minister.
The Agriculture Ministry earlier estimated that Russia's grain for export this growing season totaled 60 million tons. The country has been the world's largest exporter of grain in recent years thanks to bumper harvests and attractive pricing, despite Western sanctions that have hampered the country's foreign trade. Russia has also been supplying free grain to a number of African countries that are facing food insecurity.
The ministry has not yet published data on the geographical breakdown of Russia's agricultural exports in 2023. In 2022, the top destinations were China, TÃ¼rkiye, the EU, Kazakhstan, Belarus, South Korea, and Egypt.

The date, January 27, marks the day in 1945 in which Auschwitz-Birkenau - the largest Nazi death camp - was liberated by Soviet troops. More than 1.1 million people were killed at Auschwitz - the majority of them Jews - but also Roma, Sinti and Poles, as well as other minorities.
The date was formally established in November 2005 by the United Nations General Assembly, following resolution 60/7, which marked the day to commemorate all victims of the Holocaust and to bolster international education to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive and prevent future genocides.
Currently, there are approximately 245,000 Holocaust survivors in the world, spread across 90 countries. Almost half of these survivors - 119,300 - live in Israel, according to the Claims Conference, which seeks damages for survivors of the Holocaust.
Many Israelis compare massacre to Holocaust
This day is observed in many ways, but some of the most common ways to commemorate the lives lost in the Holocaust is to light candles in the victims' honor, read their names at commemoration sites, and to learn more about the history of the Holocaust, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
Although this is a global date to remember the Holocaust, many countries have other designated remembrance days, such as Israel which also celebrates Yom HaShoah on May 5 and 6.
A visitor walks at the Holocaust Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe as Germany commemorates the victims of the Holocaust on the eve of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, in Berlin, Germany, Jan. 26, 2024.
Many people in Israel compare the genocide of the Holocaust to the October 7 Hamas massacre, in which more than 1,200 Jews were murdered and more than 240 were taken hostage - the largest single-attack loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust.
U.S. President Joe Biden issued a statement on Friday in which he condemned the October 7 Hamas attack and outlined his administration's plans to combat a rise in antisemitism that has occurred since the attack.
'In the aftermath of Hamas's vicious massacre, we have witnessed an alarming rise of despicable antisemitism at home and abroad,' Biden said. 'We cannot remember all that Jewish survivors of the Holocaust experienced and then stand silently by when Jews are attacked and targeted again today.'
In the statement, Biden discussed actions the White House has taken to address this rise in antisemitism, referencing its 2023 National Strategy to Combat Antisemitism, which calls for improved education and research, providing security for Jewish communities, fighting antisemitism online and forging multi-faith partnerships.
Holocaust survivors tell their stories
In Washington, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is hosting a commemoration event on Friday and Saturday. During the event, visitors will be able to read the names of victims in the Hall of Remembrance, engage with Holocaust survivors and watch a special episode of the 'Stay Connected Live' series, which is a Holocaust remembrance program produced by the museum.
On Friday, a United Nations Holocaust Memorial Ceremony was hosted by Melissa Fleming, U.N. under secretary-general for global communications. During the event, Holocaust survivors shared testimonies and other guest speakers commemorated the day.
'We have seen an outburst of antisemitism and anti-Muslim bigotry around the world. Every one of us must resolve to stand up against the forces of hate, discrimination and division,' said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his opening remarks.
Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations Gilad Erdan gave remarks as well, saying, 'Today is not only a day of remembrance; this day was designated to also prevent future acts of genocide - to internalize the lessons of the Holocaust.'
In his remarks, Erdan expressed frustration with the United Nations, saying, 'To this day, no U.N. institution has condemned the October 7 massacre. It's shocking.'
Early this month, South Africa recently brought a charge of genocide to the U.N.'s International Court of Justice over Israel's treatment of Palestinians in Gaza. In a preliminary ruling Friday, the court declined to order Israel to stop its offensive in Gaza but said Israel must do all it can to prevent genocide in the embattled territory.
Israel launched an offensive against Hamas in Gaza after the October 7 attack. The Gaza health authority says more than 26,000 Palestinians have died since then.
Israeli leaders have rejected accusations of genocide, saying its offensive is targeted at Hamas, not civilians.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported a dire situation in the DRC, where nearly half of the country's 26 provinces are affected, leaving over 400,000 households in need of urgent aid, Stephane Dujarric, chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said in a routine noon briefing.
The United Nations and humanitarian partners are working closely with the Congolese authorities to develop an emergency response plan and mitigate a public health crisis, said Dujarric.
Humanitarian organizations are providing emergency health assistance to the injured and implementing measures to prevent the risk of disease outbreaks, said the spokesman.
Similarly, Somalia is dealing with more than 470 Cholera cases, including at least nine deaths, while Tanzania contends with flooding that has injured 140 individuals, impacting over 9,000 people and displacing 760.
In Somalia, the OCHA warned that cholera and acute watery diarrhea are spreading.
United Nations and its partners are scaling up the response in flood-affected districts, said the OCHA, adding that the world body is also preparing for further flooding expected during the April-to-June rainy season.
However, it noted that underfunding for the humanitarian response is a critical concern. Last year's appeal for 2.6 billion U.S. dollars to help 7.6 million people in Somalia was less than 44 percent funded, with 1.1 billion dollars received.
In Tanzania, said Dujarric, the UN team assisted the government in response to recent devastating floods.
The spokesman said that the World Food Programme distributes food rations, the World Health Organization focuses on disease prevention and the UN Children's Fund provides water and sanitation services, hygiene kits, water tanks, and more."

""Just finished a phone call with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. I reaffirmed that the Hungarian government supports the NATO membership of Sweden. I also stressed that we will continue to urge the Hungarian National Assembly to vote in favor of Sweden's accession and conclude the ratification at the first possible opportunity,"" Orban wrote on social media platform X.
With TÃ¼rkiye's ratification on Tuesday, Hungary remains the only NATO member country that hasn't approved Sweden's application.
Stoltenberg tweeted shortly after his talks with Orban: ""Good call with PM Viktor Orban of Hungary. I welcome the clear support of the Prime Minister and his government for Sweden's NATO membership. I look forward to the ratification as soon as parliament reconvenes.""
The Hungarian Parliament is set to reconvene in the second half of February.

The tunnel was located in the centre of Khan Younis and ran about 830 meters (0.51 miles) at a depth of 20 meters (66 feet), the IDF said.
There were booby traps, explosives and various obstacles inside the tunnel, according to the IDF, which said it encountered and killed several Hamas operatives as it entered the tunnel.
""This is where Hamas held hostages. IDF soldiers operated in a tunnel located at the heart of a civilian area in Khan Yunis that was used to hold about 20 hostages at different times. The tunnel was about 830 meters long and about 20 meters deep. We cannot and will not rest knowing innocent civilians are being held in compounds like this one. We will not stop operating until we bring the hostages home,"" IDF posted on X.
However, the IDF found no hostages in the tunnel but said, based on testimonies from former hostages and DNA evidence, that about 20 hostages were held in there at different times, some of whom have been released while others remain held in Gaza, CNN reported.
The videos shared by the IDF show long tunnels, some of which lead to rooms with mattresses, blankets and food wrappers scattered on the floor, and kitchen and bathroom areas.
It also showed photos of a pair of child's drawings, which it said were drawn by five-year-old former hostage Emilia Aloni, according to her family.
Aloni and her mother were released in November during a brief truce between Hamas and Israel to allow for the exchange of hostages and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. More than 100 hostages were released during the truce, according to CNN.
Israel estimates that 132 hostages from the October 7 attacks remain in Gaza -- 25 of whom are believed to be dead. (ANI)"

LSNQMDWXQM_4YRUFWH93K1B4SD,UN chief calls for urgent action to combat terrorism in Africa,"Xinhua 25th January 2024, 07:18 GMT+11","Xinhua 25th January 2024, 07:18 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105471/un-chief-calls-for-urgent-action-to-combat-terrorism-in-africa,"UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 24 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday emphasized the urgent need to combat the rising tide of terrorism in Africa, describing the situation as a ""clear and present danger"" not only to the continent but to the world.
""Now this building, and our organization, represent humanity's highest ideals. Peace, dialogue, development, human rights, and collaboration. Terrorism represents the polar opposite of these ideals,"" the secretary-general stated in an address at the meeting of the Global Counter-Terrorism Compact at the UN headquarters in New York.
The secretary-general highlighted the alarming increase of terrorist activities in Africa. ""In just a few short years, Africa has become a global epicenter of terrorism,"" he noted.
He stressed the vulnerability of women and girls to sexual and gender-based violence in this growing inferno, which is ""engulfing millions of Africans.""
Terrorist groups such as Da'esh and Al-Qaida, exploiting local conflicts and weaknesses, are extending their reach across the continent ""community by community,"" the secretary-general underscored.
In regions like Somalia, eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, northern Mozambique, and the Sahel, civilians are enduring the brunt of these conflicts, living in what the secretary-general described as ""a hell on Earth.""
The top UN official called for urgent, scaled-up action, highlighting positive examples of counter-terrorism efforts like the Multinational Task Force in the Lake Chad Basin and the African Union's initiatives.
He emphasized the importance of sustainable, inclusive development and human rights as critical anchors in the fight against terrorism. ""Terrorism finds its home in fragility and instability,"" he said, adding that a comprehensive approach connecting development, governance, and sustainable peace is vital.
In a reminder of the human cost of terrorism, the secretary-general referred to the plight of women and girls, often the first and worst affected, citing examples from Nigeria and Iraq. He reiterated the need for counter-terrorism strategies to prioritize human rights. ""We cannot fight (terrorism) by repeating the same denial.""
Concluding his remarks, Guterres expressed his belief in Africa's potential, calling it ""the home of hope.""
He called for immediate and collaborative efforts to eradicate the shadow of terrorism. ""For Africa, for Africans, and for the world we share - let's continue standing together and forging new solutions to lift this shadow, once and for all.""
The Global Counter-Terrorism Compact is the largest inter-agency framework across the three pillars of work of the United Nations: peace and security, sustainable development, and human rights."
LWFGUO8SCT_TEPIM79EJZHIBO3,1st LD Writethru: U.S. completes first nitrogen gas execution,"Xinhua 26th January 2024, 18:44 GMT+11","Xinhua 26th January 2024, 18:44 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106961/1st-ld-writethru-us-completes-first-nitrogen-gas-execution,"HOUSTON, Jan. 25 (Xinhua) -- The southern U.S. state of Alabama on Thursday night completed the country's first execution using nitrogen gas asphyxiation, according to a news release from Alabama Governor Kay Ivey.
Inmate Kenneth Smith, a 58-year-old convicted of a 1988 murder and sentenced to death, died at 8:25 p.m. local time (0225 GMT Friday) at an Alabama prison after breathing pure nitrogen gas through a face mask to cause oxygen deprivation, authorities said.
Earlier on Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a last-minute appeal by Smith's lawyers to halt the execution, who argued such a method would violate constitutional protections against cruelty.
Three liberal Justices, Elena Kagan, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor, issued a written dissent saying they would have paused the execution. The majority justices did not issue any statements.
Smith also brought separate claims before a federal court of appeals trying to put the execution on hold, which were declined in a 2-1 decision issued later on Wednesday.
It was the first nitrogen hypoxia execution nationwide. Alabama botched its previous attempt to execute him by lethal injection in November 2022.
""If Alabama proceeds with its planned execution attempt, it will be only the second time in U.S. history that a state follows through with a second execution attempt after a previous, failed attempt,"" Smith's lawyers wrote in court filings.
Smith's lawyers argued that if the mask were a poor fit, it could allow oxygen in and prolong Smith's suffering, or if he becomes nauseous, he could be ""left to choke on his own vomit,"" according to U.S. media.
The untested method of capital punishment is controversial. Supporters said the method would be humane, but critics called it cruel and experimental.
Oklahoma and Mississippi are the only other states to approve nitrogen for executions."

Perhaps there's often an element of nostalgia involved, but when we look back over the legacies of most former prime ministers, there is at least one achievement that can be found for which they can be commended.
Even John Howard, widely thought to be the worst PM ever - until Abbott and Morrison - can at least claim the gun reform legislation following the Port Arthur massacre.
During ScoMo's reign, however, there does not appear to be even one positive move, not one proactive decision that has benefitted the nation in any way.
Dictator Morrison and the 'you made me do it' defence So, Scotty the Dictator secretly took over all the portfolios of the key ministers around him.DRESS-UPS, LIES BUT NEVER HOSESThe former PM with a penchant for dress-ups, selfies, singalongs and damaging the reputation of ukelele players everywhere is famous for not holding a hose or accepting responsibility for anything at all. Not even secretly appointing himself into five ministries.The only things for which Morrison will be remembered are wildly egregious. Robodebt. Hawaiian holidays during natural disasters. Cosying up to Donald Trump. Money for donors. Money for mates. Money for fellow happy-clappers. Money for fossil fuel corporations. Money for everyone who already has it. The dismantling and erosion of anything remotely beneficial to the populace: Medicare, Fair Work Commission, women's rights, Indigenous affairs, education, climate change and energy policy, the ABC.Oh, and there was that lump of coal.Scott Morrison's legacy is one of chaos, vandalism and abuse of public trust but the real damage goes even further. Unfortunately, the destruction bill for his collective misdeeds is incalculable and involves far more than money.RELIGIOUS RANTINGSMorrison was fueled by a slavish religious fanaticism that would be considered delusional by most thinking individuals. Indeed, if any of us tried to tell a court of law or a health professional that we believed we had intimate conversations with the heavens, we would likely end up locked away in a rubber room. Messiah Morrison direct messages God via the social media devil The PM attended a Pentecostal national convention, at which he shared with those gathered his belief that he and wife Jenny have been ""called to do God's work"".Morrison, however, shared publicly his belief that ""god"" spoke to him and took time out to personally arrange his ""miraculous"" appointment as prime minister. It would be funny were it not for the fact that such crazed imaginings were not only held by the former PM but announced publicly. And, since these fantasies were nonchalantly publicised by his mainstream media entourage, they were also presented to the general public as normal behaviour - a little eccentric, perhaps, but nothing about which voters should be concerned.His prime ministership was characterised by the trashing of public institutions, an admitted and well-established lack of empathy on his part and on the part of many within his Cabinet, and a general arrogant disregard for the wellbeing of the nation. And the many, many lies.The Member for Cook's slavish Pentecostal rantings revealed far more than delusion, they exposed an ethos where wealth does not only equal power, it equates to a level of reverence generally reserved for so-called saints and spiritual leaders. This obsession with wealth led to a disinterest in the welfare of others, as well as a cruel disregard for the ""unwashed"" poor. In this land of the wealthy, nothing else was safe. Certainly not the poor. Not asylum seekers. Not the economy. Not our jobs. Not our women. And not our children.THE PEASANTSRobodebt was an unlawful government scheme, under which the poorest Australians were hounded for debts they did not owe - for many years. It broke people and forced thousands into depression, despair and suicide.Unbelievably, Morrison, the architect of the scheme, who misled parliament, lied repeatedly about it and then denied all wrongdoing, was still able to access Legal Aid to cover his personal legal costs.Throughout his political career, Morrison also resisted any increase in welfare or pensions and advocated for the introduction of the cashless welfare card. Scott Morrison's robodebt to society Labor has joined the Greens' call for a royal commission into 'robodebt' - an unlawful Morrison Government debt recovery scheme.THE REFUGEESMorrison awarded himself a trophy for ""stopping the boats"" - one of the cruellest policies ever to darken our borders. In essence, ""stopping the boats"" meant that no matter how persecuted, people fleeing war zones could not seek refuge in this country. Should they survive the journey, they were unwelcome and would effectively leave one hellhole for another, usually to be imprisoned indefinitely in island gulags, where even their children would be refused medical care.Even children born here, such as the Biloela kids, who would once have had automatic Australian citizenship, were instead locked up for years in a custom-made, isolated prison.IN THE REDNot only did ScoMo and his Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's ""back in the black"" promises never eventuate, but the economy nose-dived, hitting the most vulnerable hardest and forcing many into homelessness.During the pandemic, JobKeeper created temporary relief for some but in the end, many businesses pocketed the cash before sacking workers anyway in their perpetual quest for ever-increasing profits - the only quest prized by the Morrison Government.THE WOMENOn the subject of women's rights, Scotty believed that since he had a wife, two daughters and even a mother, he was clearly a feminist. Meanwhile, he accepted the word of an accused rapist as evidence of his innocence without further inquiry, ignored the groundswell of frustration among the populace over sexual assault and harassment in Parliament House, and informed women protesting gender-based violence they should count themselves lucky they weren't shot. Morrison tells women protesting violence they're lucky not to be shot Yesterday, tens of thousands of Australians marched across the country in 40 rallies. They marched against violence and they marched against complacency.THE KIDSAnd then there's all the kids.The favouring of non-government schools had long been a feature of Coalition governments but ScoMo took an already inequitable system and created a whopping, near-insurmoutable funding crevasse.The findings of the first Gonski Inquiry were ignored by the Morrison Government.A second Gonski Inquiry found gross inequalities, even greater than the last, but its recommendations were still mostly ignored as religious institutions and other ""independent"" schools were gifted even more money, while public schools continued to wither.SCOTTY'S MONEY PROBLEMSInterestingly, one of the reasons cited by Morrison for his exit from politics is that he just can't educate his own two kids or live in the ""appropriate manner"" on his current salary of $217,000 per annum for sitting on the back bench.Of course, as PM, Scotty's salary was $550K each year for almost four years (while the Morrisons lived rent-free at Kirribili House and The Lodge), so things must be tough.In addition to the $217K salary plus super, backbench-sitting Scotty gets a gold travel pass, a fully maintained office, a car and driver while on business ventures, unlimited postage, free books and other stationery, free mobile phone, home telephone and internet, all on us.But it is just not enough for the man who has the ""Man Upstairs"" on speed dial.In short, Scotty has made a mockery of our democracy. If nothing else, perhaps he has inspired a cashless welfare card and debt-recovery scheme, tailored especially for ex-PMs who cannot point to any achievements but still sponge off the public purse.This editorial was originally published as part of our members-only weekly newsletter - usually only available to subscribers in the IA members-only area.

Labor has joined the Greens' call for a royal commission into 'robodebt' - an unlawful Morrison Government debt recovery scheme.
THE REFUGEES
Morrison awarded himself a trophy for ""stopping the boats"" - one of the cruellest policies ever to darken our borders. In essence, ""stopping the boats"" meant that no matter how persecuted, people fleeing war zones could not seek refuge in this country. Should they survive the journey, they were unwelcome and would effectively leave one hellhole for another, usually to be imprisoned indefinitely in island gulags, where even their children would be refused medical care.
Even children born here, such as the Biloela kids, who would once have had automatic Australian citizenship, were instead locked up for years in a custom-made, isolated prison.
IN THE RED
Not only did ScoMo and his Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's ""back in the black"" promises never eventuate, but the economy nose-dived, hitting the most vulnerable hardest and forcing many into homelessness.
During the pandemic, JobKeeper created temporary relief for some but in the end, many businesses pocketed the cash before sacking workers anyway in their perpetual quest for ever-increasing profits - the only quest prized by the Morrison Government.
THE WOMEN
On the subject of women's rights, Scotty believed that since he had a wife, two daughters and even a mother, he was clearly a feminist. Meanwhile, he accepted the word of an accused rapist as evidence of his innocence without further inquiry, ignored the groundswell of frustration among the populace over sexual assault and harassment in Parliament House, and informed women protesting gender-based violence they should count themselves lucky they weren't shot.

Yesterday, tens of thousands of Australians marched across the country in 40 rallies. They marched against violence and they marched against complacency.
THE KIDS
And then there's all the kids.
The favouring of non-government schools had long been a feature of Coalition governments but ScoMo took an already inequitable system and created a whopping, near-insurmoutable funding crevasse.
The findings of the first Gonski Inquiry were ignored by the Morrison Government.
A second Gonski Inquiry found gross inequalities, even greater than the last, but its recommendations were still mostly ignored as religious institutions and other ""independent"" schools were gifted even more money, while public schools continued to wither.
SCOTTY'S MONEY PROBLEMS
Interestingly, one of the reasons cited by Morrison for his exit from politics is that he just can't educate his own two kids or live in the ""appropriate manner"" on his current salary of $217,000 per annum for sitting on the back bench.
Of course, as PM, Scotty's salary was $550K each year for almost four years (while the Morrisons lived rent-free at Kirribili House and The Lodge), so things must be tough.
In addition to the $217K salary plus super, backbench-sitting Scotty gets a gold travel pass, a fully maintained office, a car and driver while on business ventures, unlimited postage, free books and other stationery, free mobile phone, home telephone and internet, all on us.

He added that in this trade partnership, India has committed USD 27-30 billion of investment, making Nigeria a premier economic partner in Africa.
Addressing the Nigeria-India Business Council (NIBC) in Abuja, Jaishankar said, ""There are different ways of describing this relationship. But to a business audience and to a policy audience, it is the relationship today of about 13 to 15 billion dollars worth of trade annually, where India has committed somewhere between 27 to 30 billion dollars of investment, where Nigeria is our premier economic partner in Africa.""Speaking on the flourishing trade between the countries, the EAM underlined that India, today provides the basis for a more serious interaction.
""I was reminding some folks yesterday, that India's exports in the year that has just been completed was 766 billion dollars. And I'd surely like, and I'm sure you would surely like, a larger part of that share to come to Nigeria. Because today we are a 4 trillion dollar economy, an economy with a range of capabilities and technologies and experiences and practices, which we perhaps did not have in earlier years, and which really today provide the basis for a more serious interaction,"" the EAM went on to say.
He also underlined that Banking, insurance, credit guarantees, flight connections, trade settlements, are some of the challenges that should be put on the table, and approached honestly.
""I think our primary responsibility is to improve the enabling environment, to look at the kind of problems that I've been hearing about in the last two days. Banking, insurance, credit guarantees, flight connections, trade settlements. I think these are challenges today that we should put on the table, approach it very honestly, and look to find constructive, practical solutions,"" Jaishankar said.
""I'm also very pleased today to see my ministerial colleagues from the Nigerian government, because yesterday I had the honour to meet the Minister for the Blue Economy. And I mention this because, in many ways, if we are to give this relationship more weight, substance and practicality, we should get beyond the world of protocol and diplomacy. Not to look at it in a very narrow sense, but really to get down to business and look at different parts of our economy and of our government and of our policy making and see, where is it that we can build the connect,"" he said.
""So, even though I'm a Foreign Minister, I urge all of you to really look beyond the foreign policy establishment to build the linkages that will really take our relationship to a new level,"" the EAM added.
EAM Jaishankar, who was on a visit to Nigeria from January 21-23, concluded his diplomatic trip today.
""Concluded my Nigeria visit with an address to the Nigeria-India Business Council (NIBC) today. Investment and trade are at the heart of our partnership,"" he wrote on X, as he addressed the NIBC Council in Abuja.
""Recognise contribution of those driving it and seeking to take our ties to a higher level. Appreciate the presence of the Ministers of Trade, BudgetEconomic Planning, Blue Economy and Steel Development of Nigeria and the Governor of Nasarawa,"" he said.
This was EAM's first visit to Nigeria, which will further consolidate bilateral relations between the two countries.

Bommai asserted that several key allies, including Mamata Banerjee's TMC, Sharad Pawar's NCP, and Nitish Kumar's JD(U), were drifting away, signalling the end of the alliance.
""Mamata Banerjee has already exited the alliance, and Sharad Pawar is likely to follow suit. Nitish Kumar has taken a step outside the alliance. The INDI alliance will not endure much longer as parties withdraw due to the attitude of Congress leaders. It won't exist when Narendra Modi becomes Prime Minister for the third time,"" Bommai stated, highlighting the dissatisfaction that led to Mamata Banerjee's departure.
Responding to queries about former CM Jagadish Shettar's potential return to BJP, Bommai noted the challenges, stating that Shettar's past association with Jan Sangh might make it difficult for him to join the Congress Party.
He added, ""I am not aware of efforts to bring him back to our party. We will abide by whatever decision is taken by our high command.""In regards to conferring the Bharat Ratna on late Bihar CM Karpuri Thakur, Bommai rejected the notion that Dalits and OBCs were exclusive to the Congress, highlighting previous instances where the BJP government honored BR Ambedkar, Abdul Kalam, and Pranab Mukherjee.
""The Dalits and OBCs were not the sole property of the Congress. How conferred Bharat Ratna on Dr B.R.Ambedkar? Why Congress Party didn't give? The BJP government conferred the same award on Dr Abdul Kalam and Pranab Mukherjee. This award had been given to those who had done good work,"" he said.
Expressing strong dissatisfaction with Rahul Gandhi's comments on Lord Rama, Bommai asserted, ""Lord Rama is not seen if Rahul wears the glasses of Ravana. But the lord is seen everywhere if he wears the glasses of devotion.""Discussing the upcoming Haveri seat elections, Bommai acknowledged multiple aspirants within the BJP, including B.C.

MBH23H74JY_S5YTU5Z4TZ8SVPE,Tanker Ship Reports Missile Fire in Red Sea Near Yemen,"Voice of America 27th January 2024, 01:06 GMT+11","Voice of America 27th January 2024, 01:06 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274107250/tanker-ship-reports-missile-fire-in-red-sea-near-yemen,"UNITED NATIONS - A commercial vessel operating in the Red Sea Friday reported that two missiles exploded in the water near its position as it sailed near Yemen, but caused no damage or injuries.
Safety organization United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations - UKMTO - said it received a report from the vessel that an explosion was heard and a missile was sighted about seven kilometers from the ship's position, 111 kilometers from the Yemeni city of Aden.
The ship reported a second explosion and missile sighting shortly after, this time less than one kilometer away. No damage or injuries were reported from either missile and the vessel continued to its next port of call.
UKMTO said ""coalition forces"" were ""responding"" but offered no details.
Reuters news agency, citing the British maritime security firm Ambrey, reports the ship is a Panama-flagged, India-affiliated oil products tanker.
The attacks come after a week in which Britain and the United States launched a new round of strikes targeting Iran-backed Houthi rebel sites in Yemen. The U.S. military said the attacks hit radar installations, missile launch sites, and most significantly, an underground weapons storage facility.
The strikes came in response to Houthi attacks on commercial and military vessels operating in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
Thursday, Britain and the United States announced sanctions on four senior Houthi officials, freezing and or blocking any or all of their financial assets under the control of U.S. citizens.
In a statement, the U.S. State Department said the Houthi attacks on merchant vessels ""have disrupted international supply chains and infringed on navigational rights and freedoms.""

The rally in Bulandshahr will kick off the election campaign for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, following the Ram Lalla Pran Pratishtha Samaroh in Ayodhya on Monday.
Party workers and BJP leaders are actively involved in the preparations, anticipating a significant turnout in the western Uttar Pradesh city.
Notably, the BJP holds eight out of 14 seats in western Uttar Pradesh, with defeats in six constituencies in 2019. The PM is reportedly preparing to turn the tide in these seats in the 2024 elections. PM Modi is set to commence the election campaign from Bulandshahr, aiming to connect with voters and supporters in previously contested areas, sharing the mantra for victory.
The BJP claims that around five lakh people will attend PM Modi's rally in Bulandshahr. The Prime Minister's scheduled public meeting in Bulandshahr's Navada village on January 25 is expected to rally support, featuring a shooting range field in Meerut Commissionerate.
Meanwhile, a day after announcing an alliance with Rashtriya Lok Dal for the Lok Sabha polls, Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav has said that there will be more meetings with Congress to decide on seat-sharing formula in the state and that ""INDIA alliance should be strong"".
Akhilesh Yadav held a meeting in Lucknow with party leaders who included former MPs, former MLAs and former MLCs. He said winnability is the criterion in decisions on seats.
Yadav urged party workers to ensure registration of voters who are supporters of the party in the new voter list. He accused the BJP government in the state of getting the names of some party workers removed from the list.
Congress and the Samajwadi Party have held seat-sharing talks for the Lok Sabha polls expected in April-May this year. (ANI)"

Kiev's downing of a Russian military cargo plane carrying dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war is ""an act of insane barbarism"" that calls into question the possibility of further diplomatic engagement between the two countries, a senior Foreign Ministry official has said.
On Wednesday, the Russian Defense Ministry reported that Kiev had shot down an IL-76 cargo aircraft carrying 65 captured Ukrainian service personnel as well as several crew members and soldiers over the Belgorod Region, which borders Ukraine. The captives were to take part in a prisoner exchange with Kiev. Russian officials also claimed that the Ukrainians used Western-supplied air defense systems to shoot down the plane.
Rodion Miroshnik, Russia's ambassador-at-large for Ukraine's crimes, condemned Kiev over the attack, warning that the perpetrators would be brought to justice. ""By violating the agreements, they killed our pilots and escort soldiers and wrote off their own citizens,"" he said.
""The Ukrainian dictatorship,"" the diplomat continued, sacrificed their own service members to ""demonstrate 'Russia's bloody nature.""' In practice, however, Kiev only revealed its own ""Nazi inhuman core by conspicuously sending to kingdom come those for whom it supposedly 'fought' and was waiting for,"" he stated.
According to Miroshnik, the incident also casts serious doubt on the possibility of future agreements between Moscow and Kiev. ""They are certain to violate the guarantees that they are giving if they have not already; there is no doubt about it.""
Ukrainian officials have so far declined to comment on the incident, saying they are still investigating the matter. However, Andrey Yusov, a spokesman for Kiev's Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) spokesman, confirmed that Russia and Ukraine were scheduled to conduct a prisoner exchange on Wednesday.
Commenting on the incident, Russian Senator Viktor Bondarev told the 'Vmeste RF' TV channel that the crew of the Il-76 was able to report ""external impact"" after the attack. He also suggested that the plane's pilots - whom he described as highly experienced - managed to steer the aircraft out of the populated area to avoid civilian casualties.
He added that while the Il-76 was equipped with decoy flares, its crew did not use them because the plane was flying over friendly territory and far from the frontline.

MC6XEC7QJM_GVWOTSQF3AKFWWJ,China Focus: Experts applaud China's effective counterterrorism efforts,"Xinhua 27th January 2024, 03:05 GMT+11","Xinhua 27th January 2024, 03:05 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274107405/china-focus-experts-applaud-chinas-effective-counterterrorism-efforts,"BEIJING, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- China has made positive contributions to regional and global security and stability through its counterterrorism efforts, said experts when commenting on a new white paper on the topic.
The white paper titled ""China's Legal Framework and Measures for Counterterrorism"" was released by the State Council Information Office on Tuesday.
The document sums up the principles underlying China's fight against terrorism and the experience gained, demonstrates the effectiveness of the country's law-based counterterrorism efforts, and helps the international community understand the relevant legal framework and measures, according to the experts.
""Compared with previous editions, the latest white paper provides a more comprehensive introduction to China's counterterrorism legal system, such as how power is exercised and human rights safeguarded during the fight,"" said Li Changlin, a professor at the Human Rights Institute of Southwest University of Political Science and Law.
LAW-BASED COUNTERTERRORISM
""By focusing on the legal framework and measures, the white paper underscores the fact that China's counterterrorism efforts consistently operate under the rule of law and are integrated into the country's daily governance,"" said Yang Haitao, an associate professor at the Criminal Investigation Police University of China.
Thanks to more than four decades of experience, a counterterrorism legal framework based on the Constitution has been gradually formed in China, said the white paper.
In the legal framework, the Counterterrorism Law is the centerpiece, the criminal laws and National Security Law play major roles and other laws serve as supplements, according to the document.
It also covers administrative regulations, judicial interpretations, local regulations, and departmental and local government rules, the document added.
Such a legal framework has yielded a set of experiences in terms of law-based counterterrorism and explored special approaches such as preventive counterterrorism, said Huang Bin, director of the regional counterterrorism research center at Fujian Police College.
As a model that can be used for reference, the legal framework provides a nomological foundation for further international cooperation in counterterrorism, added Huang.
HUMAN RIGHTS
""China respects and protects human rights as an underlying principle in improving its legal framework and practices in the field of counterterrorism,"" the white paper said.
To effectively prevent and combat terrorist activities is an important aspect of safeguarding human rights, said Yang.
""China's counterterrorism efforts have always adhered to a people-centered approach, placing lives above all else,"" said Zheng Ruohan, an associate professor at the Human Rights Institute of Southwest University of Political Science and Law.
The country emphasizes safeguarding human rights through combating terrorism and also focuses on ensuring human rights in specific counterterrorism work, according to Zheng.
""Upholding the vision of a global community of shared future, China is willing to work closely with other countries to push forward counterterrorism cause as part of global governance,"" said the white paper.
""On the basis of equality and respect, China will engage in extensive exchanges, cooperation, and mutual learning to facilitate the global effort to counter terrorism,"" said the document."

The PM said that the construction of the temple, which was supposed to 'set off a firestorm', is a symbol of peace, patience, harmony and the integration of the country.
""There was also a time when some people used to say, 'Ram Mandir bana toh aag lag jaegi' (the construction of the temple will set off a firestorm). Such people could not understand the purity of India's social spirit.

The European Union is ""unlikely"" to confiscate the Russian Central Bank funds that are currently frozen due to Ukraine-related sanctions, Reuters reported on Tuesday. There is no agreement among the members for the risky move, senior bloc officials told the agency.
The US and its allies froze an estimated $300 billion of Russian state assets in 2022, citing the Ukraine conflict. Kiev has repeatedly called for the West to seize the funds and hand them over to Ukraine, even more so in recent months as financial and military aid from Washington and Brussels has dried up.

And in six months we have a judicial decision saying we are not allowed to give it to them. Who will [we] pay then?"" Bettel said.



Another concern for the bloc is that most of the currently frozen Russian assets - about $200 billion - are with the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear.""The EU cannot bail out Euroclear,"" one senior official said. ""Euroclear manages trillions and its bankruptcy would be far more than the budget of the EU.

""You have not listened to the whole statement of Mamata Banarjee. Her whole statement is that we want to defeat BJP and we will not take even a single step back from defeating BJP. With the same feeling, we are entering West Bengal. When the journey is long, there can be some speed breakers in the path, and there can be a red light as well, but that does not mean that we should stop the journey itself. The journey continues; we cross the speed breakers, and red lights turn green,"" said Jairam Ramesh.
""Rahul Gandhi had clearly said yesterday that TMC, and especially Mamata Banarjee, is an important pillar of the INDIA alliance. We cannot imagine the INDIA alliance without Mamata Banerjee, and we hope that we will enter West Bengal with the same feeling of defeating the BJP as said by Mamata Banerjee,"" he said.
He further said that the issues would be resolved and INDIA alliance will contest in West Bengal as well, standing united.
Earlier, the INDIA bloc suffered a huge setback on Wednesday as Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee said that her party declared that the Trinamool Congress would fight alone in Bengal.
""I had no discussions with the Congress party. I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we will alone will defeat BJP. I gave many proposals but they rejected them from the beginning. From then, we have decided to fight the elections in Bengal alone"" the TMC supremo said.
The Bengal Chief Minister also claimed she had not been informed of Rahul Gandhi's Nyay Yatra passing through Bengal, contrary to claims by the Congress that they had invited INDIA bloc parties to join the Yatra.
""They did not even bother to inform me that they will be coming to West Bengal as a matter of courtesy even though I am a part of the INDIA bloc. So there is no with relation with me as far as Bengal is concerned"" Mamata Banerjee said""We will decide on what to do at the all-India level. We are a secular party. We will do whatever we can to defeat the BJP. The alliance does not comprise any one party. We have said that they should fight in some states and the regional parties should be left to fight alone in the other states. They should not interfere"" she added.
The breakdown in Trinamool and the Congress came after state unit chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdury continued his attack on the Bengal Chief Minister.
In a news conference on Tuesday Adhir Chowdhury claimed that in the 2011 elections, Mamata Banerjee came to power with the mercy of Congress.
""This time, the elections will not be fought at the mercy of Mamata Banerjee. The Congress defeated the BJP and TMC in the two seats that Mamata Banerjee is leaving. The Congress party knows how to contest the elections. Mamata Banerjee is an opportunist; she came to power in 2011, with the mercy of Congress,"" the Congress MP said.
Rahul Gandhi who is in Assam as part of his Nyay Yatra tried to quell the damage been done by the state unit chief's repeated attacks by insisting that he had a good relationship with the TMC supremo.
""The negotiations on seat-sharing is underway, I don't want to comment here. But Mamata Banerjee is very close to me and our party. Sometimes our leaders say something, their leaders say something, and it goes on. It's a natural thing. Such comments won't matter and these are not things that are going to disrupt things,"" Rahul Gandhi had said on Tuesday.
The Trinamool Congress reportedly was willing to offer the Congress a maximum of three Lok Sabha seats of the 42 seats in Bengal. In the 2019 elections the Congress had won two Lok Sabha seats while the TMC had won 22 seats.
With this announcement, of going alone, by Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday it appears that the doors are closed for the Congress in Bengal. For the INDIA bloc stitching together alliances has proven as stumbling block and it appears that now the alliance may not be able to put together a united front against the BJP. (ANI)"

Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said the missiles were fired on Wednesday morning.
""Our military detected several cruise missiles launched by North Korea towards the Yellow Sea at around 7:00 am today [22:00 GMT on Tuesday],"" the JCS said in a statement.
""The detailed specifications are being closely analysed by South Korean and US intelligence authorities,"" the statement added.
The capital, Pyongyang, which is under strict United Nations sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme, has continued to conduct weapons tests this year, including a solid-fuelled hypersonic ballistic missile and the test of a purportedly nuclear-capable underwater attack drone, as reported by Al Jazeera.
However, cruise missile tests are not banned under UN sanctions but the JCS said that it was monitoring further activities by North Korea.
Cruise missiles tend to be jet-propelled and fly at a lower altitude than more sophisticated ballistic missiles, but analysts say they could pose a risk to South Korea and Japan because they are harder to detect by radar.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have increased in recent months as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un continues to accelerate his weapons development and issue provocative threats of nuclear conflict with the US and its allies in the region, according to Al Jazeera.
Japan, South Korea and the US, meanwhile, have been expanding their combined military exercises, which Kim portrays as invasion rehearsals, and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around nuclear-capable US assets.
This comes after the South Korean Navy's special warfare unit was participating in training on the east coast near the border with North Korea.
The 10-day training, which ends today (Thursday), is designed to strengthen operational readiness, as per the JCS, following North Korea's recent military activities.
Moreover, Kim Jong Un has also abandoned any goal of unification with South Korea, which is now designated as a ""primary enemy"".
Kim might also have ordered to demolish the 30-meter-high Pyongyang monument that symbolised the goal of reconciliation with South Korea, as reported by Al Jazeera. (ANI)"

The doodle featured by guest artist Vrinda Zaveri depicted the Republic Day parade as it would have been seen on different screens.
Last year, Gujarat-based artist Parth Kothekar crafted an intricately hand-cut paper artwork to illustrate Google Doodle on the occasion of India's 74th Republic Day.
Many elements of the Republic Day parade were represented in the artwork including the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the India Gate, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) marching contingent, and motorcycle riders.
On this day in 1950, India declared itself a sovereign, democratic, and republic state with the adoption of the Constitution.
India gained its freedom from the British Empire in 1947 and began drafting its Constitution soon after.
The India Constituent Assembly took two years to discuss, modify, and approve the governing document, and when adopted, India became the country with the longest Constitution.
The adoption of this document paved the way for democracy and empowered Indian citizens to elect their own representatives.
There are various parades around the country to celebrate the national holiday, with the largest one taking place at Kartavya Path, a ceremonial boulevard in New Delhi.
After a ceremonial wreath-laying to honour fallen soldiers, regiments of India's armed forces and tableaus representing cultural and historical heritage march through the street.
To conclude the festivities, the Beating Retreat ceremony takes place on the evening of January 29. The saffron, white, and green Indian flag is flown as the Indian National Anthem plays.(ANI)"

Azerbaijan may quit the Council of Europe due to a dispute over human rights, the country's official news agency APA reported on Thursday. The news came after the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) voted to suspend Baku's delegation.
According to APA, Azerbaijan ""will not stand idle in the face of unfair and biased attitude"" and is considering ""not only leaving PACE, but the Council of Europe as a whole."" Baku may also decide to stop abiding by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights, the news agency said.
During Wednesday's session in Strasbourg, PACE passed a resolution arguing that Azerbaijan has ""not fulfilled major commitments"" in the field of democracy and the rule of law. ""Very serious concerns remain as to [Azerbaijan's] ability to conduct free and fair elections, the separation of powers, the weakness of its legislature vis-Ã -vis the executive, the independence of the judiciary and respect for human rights,"" the resolution read.
The delegates also accused Baku of failing to ensure ""free and safe access through the Lachin corridor"" connecting Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region with Armenia. Last year, Azerbaijani troops re-established control over the region, expelling the authorities of the breakaway ethnically Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR), which had existed since the early 1990s. More than 100,000 Armenians - more than 90% of Karabakh's population - has since fled.
The Azerbaijani delegation to PACE released a statement, accusing the body of attempting to meddle in the country's elections. Officials described the decision to reject the credentials of the delegates as ""a serious blow to the credibility and impartiality of the Council of Europe.""
""Never before in the history of the PACE has this organization behaved in such a disgraceful manner,"" the statement read, as cited by the news agency Trend. Baku said that it is suspending all engagements with PACE until further notice.

The UPR, a peer review process that only takes place once every 5 years, allows UN States to examine each other's human rights records, make specific recommendations to States under review, and address abuses.
The protesters were carrying banners reading ""Decolonise Tibet,"" ""China out of Tibet,"" and ""Shame on China"". A poster exhibition was also held at the Broken Chair, highlighting human rights violations in Tibet and Xinjiang.
Dolkun Isa, President of the World Uyghur Congress, said, ""More than 160 countries made recommendations; among them, 30 countries raised the Uyghur, Hong Kong and Tibetan issues. It is a good step, I believe, because in 2018, only 14 countries raised the Uyghur issue. But, this time more than 30.""He added, ""In 2018, people were unaware of the issue as China successfully concealed the reality. But, after that, so many leaked documents were published, survivors gave their testimony, a lot of international scholars made statements, and also a UN high commissioner report was released"".
Rizwana, President of World Uyghurs Congress, Switzerland, ""We stand together here today at this critical juncture. Let us remember that the Universal Periodic Review is more than a diplomatic engagement; it is a moral obligation.""She added, ""We are entrusted with a responsibility to uphold the principle of human rights, to advocate for silence and to ensure that no individual or community is left behind. Let this UPR be a testament to our unwavering commitment to these ideas.""At the UPR, India called on China to steadfastly uphold its commitment to human rights and gender equality while asking it to play a constructive role in the realisation of the aspirations of developing countries.
India asked China to ""Continue taking steps to ensure the fullest enjoyment of basic human rights by its people through inclusive and sustainable development.""Meanwhile, the United Kingdom severely criticised China for the persecution and arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and Tibetans and asked Beijing to ""guarantee an impartial judiciary"" and implement measures to allow genuine freedom of religion without fear of surveillance and torture.
Condemning the human rights violations in Xinjiang by China, the United States has called for the cessation of harassment, surveillance, and threats against individuals in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong.
The remarks were made by Michele Taylor during the 45th Session of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) at the United Nations today.""...cease discrimination against individuals, cuilture, language, religion or belief and forcible assimilation policies including boarding schools in Tibet and Xinjiang...and torture unjust, residential detention and persecution throughout China, and forced labour, marriage, birth control, sterilisation, abortion and family separation in Xinjiang,"" the American diplomat said.
Notably, China's human rights record is facing international scrutiny during the fourth Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Working Group session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, taking place from January 22 to February 2.
The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a peer-review process under the auspices of the UN Human Rights Council, where UN Member States assess each other's human rights records, their fulfilment of human rights obligations and commitments, and provide recommendations to the State under review.
Since 2018, mounting human rights abuses have been largely documented by a range of UN human rights bodies.
In the absence of a UN Human Rights Council debate on the human rights situation in China, the UPR is a rare moment of global scrutiny of the country's human rights crisis. (ANI)"

As China remains the biggest importer of dairy produce from Australia, the development of the country's companies in the Chinese market is of great significance, local business leaders and officials said.
SYDNEY, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- Under a blue sky and white clouds in the middle of summer on a recent day, herds of cows grazed peacefully on pastures in South Gippsland, a region in Australia's southeastern state of Victoria.
""There are about 700 cows on the farm. We can probably produce more than 17,000 litres of fresh milk a day,"" farmer Clint Staley told Xinhua, adding that a boom was expected for this year.
Starley is one of many farmers in South Gippsland Shire, about 160 km southeast of Melbourne.
The region is home to about 10 percent of Victoria's dairy farms. More than 30,000 people live in the area, and there are seven times as many cows.
As dairy is one of the most important industries in the region, and China remains the biggest importer of dairy produce from Australia, the development of the country's companies in the Chinese market is of great significance, local business leaders and officials said.
""China is our largest single market and the most important market for our business,"" said Jon McNaught, chief executive officer at ViPlus Dairy, one of Australia's leading nutritional and functional milk powder manufacturers.
""China makes up over 80 percent of our business,"" McNaught said. ""We supply a mixture of products -- infant formula, adult formula and pregnancy formula, but also whole milk and skim milk powder.""

ViPlus Dairy, which boasts a history of over 130 years, has participated in every one of the China International Import Expo (CIIE), a trade fair held annually in Shanghai, China, since 2018.
""CIIE is a very important part of our business interaction with China,"" McNaught said. ""They're very important part of our trade with China, so to meet our current customers but also to find out new trends and new business that may be going on.""
The company plans to continue to attend the CIIE this year to explore more opportunities in the Chinese market, he said.
While all markets around the world are going through a bit of uncertainty, the China base is still strong and the consumer market is still healthy, the ViPlus CEO said.
South Gippsland Shire Council's manager of economy, community and investment Christian Stefani said Asian markets, including China, southeast Asia and Middle East, are all very important markets to the region for numerous products.
""We are very proud of the products that are produced in South Gippsland,"" Stefani said. ""They are renowned across the world in terms of being produced from a very clean and green environment.""
The local community is very proud of how important the dairy sector is not just to South Gippsland, but also to Victoria, Australia, the council manager said.
""So when people think of South Gippsland, they often think about dairy production and that's something we are very proud of,"" Stefani said.
He also hoped that more and more Chinese tourists would visit South Gippsland to experience its beautiful scenery and unique farming culture, and deepen their understanding of local dairy products."

The EU is moving forward with plans to impose a windfall tax on the income generated by frozen Russian assets, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing sources.
The bloc's foreign ministers approved the tax on Monday and its ambassadors will discuss the step later this week, the outlet quoted people familiar with the matter as saying.
The report comes after EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Monday that member states had reached an agreement on the windfall tax, and that the bloc's ambassadors were expected to greenlight the decision to first accumulate the funds on a separate account and then use them in Ukraine.
The report comes ahead of an EU summit scheduled for next week where the bloc's leaders plan to discuss new financial aid to Kiev. A four-year package worth â¬50 billion and financed from the EU budget was vetoed by Hungary last month. The country's prime minister, Viktor Orban, spoke against committing money for years in advance and warned that supporting Kiev must not ""harm"" the bloc's finances.
The EU and the G7 froze about $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank in 2022. Most of the assets in the EU are held by the Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear, where they generated about â¬3 billion in income last year.
A number of countries have spoken out against seizing the assets outright over legal concerns. The idea of taxing the profits instead was first circulated last year. However, according to Bloomberg, it has progressed slowly as several EU member states and the European Central Bank are concerned about the potential impact the move could have on the stability of the euro.

Apple said it would allow third-party mobile wallet and payment service providers to access the contactless payment function on its iOS operating system, added the EU, which is now seeking subsequent feedback from ""all interested parties"" before deciding on the case.
In 2022, the European Commission, the 27-country bloc's executive arm and leading antitrust regulator, claimed that Apple was limiting access to its mobile payment technology and, therefore, abusing its dominant position.
Apple was blocking developers of rival mobile wallet apps from accessing the near-field communication, or NFC, technology used by its Apple Pay system on its devices, the EU said.
Companies that breach EU competition law can be fined up to 10 percent of their annual global revenue, which in Apple's case could total tens of billions of euros.
The European Commission said Apple aims to ease EU antitrust concerns for at least ten years and apply to rival mobile wallet makers, as well as iOS users in the bloc's 27 member countries, in addition to Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein.
During ""ongoing discussions"" with the commission, it offered to provide developers of payment, banking, and digital wallet apps with an option for their users to ""make NFC contactless payments from within their iOS apps, separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet,"" the U.S. tech giant said in response."

Three men were shot dead in a car park and a supermarket, and a receptionist was taken hostage until a gendarme, Arnaud Beltrame, volunteered to take the place of the captive at the cost of his life.
On the morning of 23 March 2018, Radouane Lakdim, a 25-year-old small-time drug dealer from a housing estate in Carcassonne, went to a car park that had a reputation as a gay meeting place. He was highly radicalised and under police surveillance,
Lakdim took aim and shot at two men in a car. One of them, aged 61, died. The other was seriously injured.
Lakdim then continued his journey by car, passing four police officers jogging and firing in their direction, seriously injuring one of them.
Shortly before 10.30am, he arrived at a Super U supermarket in TrÃ¨bes, a town close to Carcassonne, where he shot the shop's 50-year-old butcher and a customer, a 65-year-old retired bricklayer, in the head.
He proceeded to shout ""Allahu Akbar"" while shouting at people between the aisles. Armed with a revolver, Lakdim took a 39-year-old shop assistant hostage.
He ordered her to call the police, and while on the phone he introduced himself as an ""Islamic State brigadier"", referring to France's bombing raids in Syria.
Lakdim demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam - the only surviving member of the 13 November, 2015, attackers serving a life sentence in France.
French police ""hero"" who took place of hostage diesBeltrame's heroism honoured
After an hour, 44-year-old Lieutenant-Colonel Arnaud Beltrame entered and convinced Lakdim to take him hostage instead of the shop assistant.
The GIGN - the gendarmerie's elite intervention unit - launched an assault at around 2.30pm. Lakdim was shot dead.
Beltrame, who received serious knife wounds to the neck by Lakdim, died in hospital.
Days later, a national tribute was paid to hilm at Les Invalides in Paris, with Beltrame unanimously described as a hero.
""His greatness stunned France,"" President Emmanuel Macron said.
'Criminal terrorist conspiracy' charges
The attack had been claimed by the Islamic State armed group - an opportunistic claim according to the investigators - as no contact between the assailant and the terrorist organisation had been established.
None of the seven people close to Radouane Lakdim - six men and one woman, aged between 24 and 35 - will be tried before the Paris Special Court for complicity in the crimes committed.
They will be tried primarily for ""criminal terrorist conspiracy,"" punishable by a maximum of 30 years' imprisonment.
The court will hear from Marine Pequignot, Radouane Lakdim's girlfriend at the time - she was 18 - who was also highly radicalised.
According to the prosecution, she knew what he was capable of.
She reportedly told investigators that he loved weapons, that he had gathered ""five or six machetes and knives,"" ""two pump-action shotguns"" and a pistol, often saying that ""he was going to lose it with the miscreants.""
Suspected accomplices in court
Also on trial is Radouane Lakdim's brother-in-law, Ahmed Arfaoui, who is suspected of having rushed to ""clean"" the jihadist's flat on the day of the attack before the police searched his premises, taking a large bag full of his belongings.
Meanwhile, Samir Manaa, a friend who accompanied Radouane Lakdim to the hunting and fishing shop where the attacker bought the knife that fatally wounded Arnaud Beltrame, is also due to appear in court.
According to the prosecution, Manaa was aware of ""his jihadist tendencies and his dangerousness"".
Reda El Yaakoubi, who is considered to be the ""leader"" of the drugs trade on the estate, is accused in particular of having given Radouane Lakdim work, ""thereby helping the attacker materially and financially"", even though he was ""perfectly aware"" of his state of mind.
The trial is scheduled to last until 23 February.

The Israeli military said it was investigating the report.
Meanwhile, the death toll from a Wednesday strike on a United Nations training center in Khan Younis in southern Gaza rose to 12, with more than 75 wounded, according to Thomas White, a senior official with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees.
The U.N. relief agency did not directly blame Israel, although earlier it had said the facility was hit by tank fire and Israel is the only force with tanks in Gaza's second largest city. The Israeli military said it had 'currently ruled out' that the strike was carried out by its aircraft or artillery but that it was still investigating the attack.
It said the building might have been hit by a Hamas rocket.
Israeli tanks bombarded areas around two hospitals in Khan Younis, forcing displaced Palestinians to scramble away from the city to look for safe shelter. The Israeli attacks are part of its efforts to end Hamas control of Gaza, the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea.
Gaza health officials said at least 50 Palestinians had been killed in Khan Younis in the past day, including two children in an Israeli air strike that hit a residential home. The city is now encircled by Israeli armored forces and under almost non-stop aerial and ground fire, residents say.
Palestinians flee Khan Younis amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, move towards Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, Jan. 25, 2024.
The Hamas-controlled health ministry says more than 25,700 people have been killed and another 63,000 wounded in Gaza since the shock October 7 Hamas attack in southern Israel, when militants killed about 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.
The U.S. and some Mideast countries are trying to negotiate a new cease-fire to halt the fighting, perhaps for 30 days, to allow the release of more hostages and the release of jailed Palestinians held by Israel. About 100 hostages held by Hamas and 240 Palestinians jailed by Israel were freed in a late November week-long cease-fire.
But no new cease-fire agreement has been reached.
A U.N. court at the Hague in the Netherlands is expected to issue a ruling Friday on South Africa's request for an order to halt Israel's Gaza offensive. But Israel often ignores such international rulings and it is not clear whether it would honor any decision against it this time either.
A senior U.N. official called Thursday for 'every measure' to be taken to protect civilians, following the Wednesday attack at the Khan Younis training center, where thousands of displaced Palestinians have been staying.
The U.N.'s White said the situation in Khan Younis shows a 'consistent failure to uphold the fundamental principles of humanitarian law.'
'Persistent attacks on civilian sites in Khan Younis are utterly unacceptable and must stop immediately,' White said. 'People are being killed and injured. As fighting intensifies around hospitals and shelters hosting the displaced, people are trapped inside, and lifesaving operations are impeded.'
The United States, which has been a key Israeli ally in its war against Hamas, condemned the training center attack.
State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said, 'You've heard me say it before, you've heard [Secretary of State Antony Blinken] say it before, but civilians must be protected, and the protected nature of U.N. facilities must be respected. And humanitarian workers must be protected so that they can continue providing civilians with the life-saving humanitarian assistance that they need.'
Philippe Lazzarini, head of thew U.N.'s Palestinian relief agency, said the Khan Younis compound had been clearly marked as a U.N. facility, and its coordinates had been shared with Israeli authorities.

The former ally of Bihar Chief Minister told ANI that it is true Kumar is considering leaving his current alliance.
""There is talk that he may join the NDA alliance. It is true that CM Nitish Kumar is considering leaving the (INDIA alliance). If he joins the NDA, the big question is whether he will stay with the NDA after the elections or not... What is the guarantee that he will not leave the NDA alliance after the Lok Sabha elections,"" Kushwaha said.
Earlier, Lalu's daughter Rohini Acharya took a swipe at RJD's ruling ally, JDU, on X posting that while the 'socialist party' (JDU) styles itself as progressive, its ideology shifts with the changing wind patterns, a statement which triggered cracks within the ruling alliance.
However, a few hours later, all three posts by Lalu's daughter were deleted.
Earlier on Wednesday, on the occasion of Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur's birth centenary celebrations, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar launched a scathing attack on dynastic politics saying, ""Karpoori Thakur never promoted his family. Taking inspiration from him, I too have never promoted any member of my family. But today, people are promoting dynastic politics.""However, Janata Dal (United) leader KC Tyagi on Thursday affirmed that the party was still with the Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) in the state and the opposition bloc--INDIA.
Speaking to ANI, Tyagi said, ""JD(U) remains a part of the INDIA alliance.""Meanwhile, Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi on Friday said that the ruling Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) government will not last for long.
""Recently I had said that there would be a change in Bihar after January 20 and the basis of this was Nitish Kumar's statement. He has said many things against RJD...On this basis, we said that the alliance would not work. Their alliance will not last for long. Nitish Kumar's dream of becoming PM has been shattered... Therefore, after breaking the alliance, he may contest the Lok Sabha elections independently or join the other alliance,"" Manjhi said.
The former Bihar Chief Minister said that if Kumar jumped ship again, he would not compromise with the top post.
""For now, we cannot say when that will happen, but normally Nitish Kumar does not compromise on the Chief Ministeral post. Nothing can be said about whether the NDA alliance under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will accept Kumar as the Chief Minister or not,"" he added.
Notably, the BJP has convened a meeting with its local leaders on Saturday in the state capital Patna.
The meeting, which would be attended by district presidents and district-level officials of the party has been called for a ""confidence building"" among the leaders of BJP's state unit before they take any decision regarding forming the government with Kumar's JD(U) in the state, sources said.
Bihar BJP in-charge Vinod Tawde will also go to Bihar tomorrow morning, they said. (ANI)"
NCAZC5WT0J_PY6I69SZ9SXMALV,Uncertainties Remain With Renegotiated Chinese Mining Deal in DRC,"Voice of America 27th January 2024, 06:35 GMT+11","Voice of America 27th January 2024, 06:35 GMT+11",20230126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274107627/uncertainties-remain-with-renegotiated-chinese-mining-deal-in-drc,"Kinshasa, Congo - Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshisekedi has promised to use $7 billion from a renegotiated Chinese mining deal to build roads and infrastructure but his critics say the new agreement lacks transparency and is unfavorable towards Congo.
In a surprise announcement last weekend, Tshisekedi said that talks between his government and a consortium of Chinese investors over rebalancing the so-called Sicomines mining agreement would bring in $7 billion to the Congolese treasury.
The sum represents a huge and possibly transformative opportunity in the impoverished central African country of about 100 million people, where the national budget this year is set to reach $16 billion.
The deal was first made public last Saturday, when Tshisekedi referenced the Sicomines deal during his inauguration speech for a second term in office in front of tens of thousands of people.
'There is the thorny issue of the opening up of our regions, for which a solution in terms of financing has just been made possible,' he said.
Negotiations over Sicomines had been underway since last year after Tshisekedi - as well as numerous analysts - described the original 2008 deal as deeply unfair to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Under the original accord, a group of Chinese investors, including state-owned Chinese firms such as Sinohydro and China Railway Engineering Corporation, entered a $6.2-billion joint venture with Congo's state mining company to run the Sicomines copper and cobalt mine, in Kolwezi in southeastern DRC.
In return, the Chinese investors were supposed to build $3 billion worth of infrastructure across the country, using the proceeds from the mine.
This innovative minerals-for-infrastructure deal was a response to Congo's pressing development needs. The country is roughly the size of continental western Europe, but has a grossly inadequate road system due to endemic poverty, corruption and conflict.
According to many observers, the Chinese consortium failed to uphold its end of the bargain. A lack of transparency over spending also plagued the project and raised suspicions of corruption.
The U.S.-based NGO Carter Center found in a 2017 report, for example, that Sicomines consortium was unable to account for $685 million out of about $1.16 billion that had been allocated for infrastructure spending by that time.
In February 2023, Congo's state auditor, the Inspectorate General of Finances (IGF), also released a report raising numerous problems with the Sicomines deal.
It said that the mine had likely been undervalued, for example, and demanded that the consortium raise its infrastructure investments to $20 billion to reflect the mine's worth.
The IGF also found that only $822 million had been invested in infrastructure since 2008 - a sum it called 'glaringly low.'
'Unprecedented' renegotiation
Tshisekedi made renegotiating the deal one of his priorities towards the end of his first presidential term, even visiting Beijing in May in an attempt to get better terms.
FILE - Republic of Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi, right, and Chinese President Xi Jinping attend a welcoming ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, May 26, 2023.
The push for rebalancing mining deals also targeted another Chinese company, CMOC, which in July last year agreed to pay the Congolese government $2 billion to settle a dispute over declared mineral reserves at its Tenke Fungurume copper-cobalt mine.
At present, no details about the renegotiated Sicomines deal have been released to the public beyond what the president announced recently.
China's embassy in Congo's capital Kinshasa refused to comment. A spokesman for the Congolese presidency said he was unable to comment for the time being.
The Congolese government is nevertheless keen to stress that the renegotiated deal is a boon for its people. Interviewed on French radio on Tuesday, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya hailed the new Sicomines deal as 'unprecedented.'
'In China's favor'
However, mining sector analysts in the DRC say that a host of questions surround the new $7-billion deal, the details of which remain murky.
Emmanuel Umpula, the executive director of the DRC-based NGO African Natural Resources Watch, said the whole renegotiation took place in secret.
'We asked that this happen in a transparent way, we should know the terms of reference of the renegotiation,' he said, explaining that Tshisekedi's announcement had come as a surprise.
Umpula said there were many questions left to answer, such as, critically, how the negotiating parties arrived at the figure of $7 billion.
He also expressed concern that this money would come in the form of interest-bearing loans to the Congolese government, which would ultimately cause headaches for the treasury.
Sicomines has also continued operating and generating profits despite a lack of infrastructure spending, Umpula said, adding that 'a simple way' of resolving the issue would have been to halt the mine's operations until the Chinese investors started construction.
Another expert who was briefed on the negotiations between the Congolese government and Chinese investors, said that the final deal was 'largely in China's favor.'
The expert, who declined to be named so he could speak freely with VOA, explained that few of the original problems had been resolved.
There has been no new study of the mine's reserves, he said, meaning that it was difficult to independently assess the value of the mine. It is also unclear where the money Sicomines had earmarked for investments ended up.
'Where did they go, what did they finance?' he said, referring to Sicomines. 'It's on this basis that we should negotiate an agreement.'
The expert said his understanding was that the $7 billion would be paid out over 10 to 15 years, in a deal he said appeared highly unfavorable.
'We're losing out on the Sicomines project,' he said. 'For the Congo, this is catastrophic.'"

India has accused Pakistan of ""peddling false and malicious propaganda"" after Islamabad alleged that New Delhi was involved in two assassinations on its soil, claiming the cases were linked to similar incidents in the US and Canada.
On Thursday, Islamabad's foreign secretary, Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi, accused India of orchestrating the killing of two Pakistani nationals, Shahid Latif and Mohammad Riaz, in Pakistan last year. Latif was believed to have been involved in a 2016 attack on an Indian Air Force base in Punjab, while Qasim was alleged to have been one of the main conspirators behind an attack in Jammu and Kashmir on January 1, 2023. Both were considered terrorists by New Delhi.
During a televised briefing, Qazi claimed Islamabad has ""documentary, financial, and forensic evidence"" linking Indian agents to the deaths. ""These are killings for hire cases, involving a sophisticated international setup spread over multiple jurisdictions,"" he alleged, claiming that Indian agents used social media and ""safe havens on foreign soil"" to orchestrate the murders. Qazi said similar cases allegedly involving India are under investigation.
Responding to the claims, Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said Pakistan ""has long been the epicenter of terrorism, organized crime, and illegal transnational activities."" He added that ""India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence.""
India and Pakistan have been locked in a border dispute since 1947, primarily over Kashmir, a former princely state nestled between the two neighbors. The countries have engaged in four wars since their independence and have experienced numerous skirmishes in border areas.
Earlier this month, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar claimed that Pakistan's fundamental policy involves utilizing ""cross-border terrorism"" to compel India to negotiate. He insisted that New Delhi does not resort to such tactics.
Similar allegations of extrajudicial killings were previously leveled against India by Canada and the US. Last September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau claimed his government had ""credible intelligence"" linking Indian agents to the killing of Sikh separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar outside Vancouver. New Delhi has denied the accusations.
In November, a US court indictment maintained that an Indian government agent orchestrated a plot to kill another prominent Sikh leader, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, in New York, prompting New Delhi to form a high-level committee to investigate the case.

Richard Glossip, 60, had been scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection on May 18, but the nation's highest court put his execution on hold.
The stay came after the Oklahoma attorney general, a Republican, asked the court, in an unusual move, to halt the execution, citing questions about the fairness of his trial.

Following the Supreme Court's Monday announcement that it would hear Glossip's appeal, his lawyer John Mills said his team was 'grateful' and emphasized that Glossip had 'maintained his innocence throughout a quarter century.'
'Mr. Glossip has faced execution nine times, even though the state knew full well that the evidence used to convict him and sentence him to death was false,' Mills said.
Glossip was convicted of the 1997 fatal beating of an Oklahoma City motel owner, but has steadfastly maintained his innocence.
Glossip, who worked at the motel, was found guilty of hiring another motel employee, maintenance man Justin Sneed, who was 19 at the time, to carry out the actual murder.
Glossip was convicted based on the testimony of Sneed, who pleaded guilty and was able to negotiate a life sentence, claiming that his co-worker had masterminded the plot.
Actors Mark Ruffalo and Susan Sarandon and British billionaire Richard Branson have been among the celebrities advocating for Glossip's life to be spared.
In 2015, when Glossip's execution also appeared imminent, the representative of Pope Francis in the United States sent a letter on behalf of the pontiff to the then governor of Oklahoma asking that the execution be called off.
His case has also been the subject of a four-episode documentary series titled 'Killing Richard Glossip.'"

The alliance was being launched in conjunction with the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU), member states, ports authorities, European associations, EU anti-crime agencies, customs and law enforcement authorities.
The vast majority of illicit drugs into the EU are trafficked along maritime route and 70 percent of drug seizures are in EU ports, according to Ylva Johansson, Commissioner for Home Affairs. ""That is why cooperation between national and EU authorities and EU ports is vital,"" Johansson said in a press release.
The Commission said the launch comes against a backdrop of ""criminal networks using extreme violence, corruption and intimidation in their search for profits."" Seizures of cocaine in the EU are at record levels, with more than 300 tonnes seized on an annual basis in recent years, said the Commission.
In Belgium alone, authorities seized a record 121 tonnes of cocaine at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges in 2023, a 10 percent increase over the previous year.
EU figures show that ports contribute to 75 percent of EU external trade volumes and 31 percent of EU internal trade volumes, making them vulnerable to drug smuggling and exploitation by high-risk criminal networks."

Maratha reservation protests reignited in Maharashtra on Friday as Manoj Jarange Patil led a march to Mumbai demanding immediate implementation of the Maratha reservation.
The Supreme Court posted for hearing on January 24 a curative petition filed by the Maharashtra government challenging its May 5, 2021 judgment, which had held the Maratha reservation law unconstitutional.
The curative petition is the last chance available to the people or parties in the case after the review petition is dismissed.
On May 5, 2021, the Supreme Court struck down reservations for the Maratha community in colleges, higher educational institutions, and jobs, after noting that there was no valid ground to breach 50 per cent reservation while granting Maratha reservation.
Moreover, Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde said that a special session will be called to discuss the Maratha reservation in February 2024 and assured that no injustice will be done to any other community while giving reservation to the Maratha community.

The mausoleum was built in 1930 alongside the walls of the Kremlin facing Red Square to publicly display the embalmed remains of Lenin. Lenin's tomb is a major tourist destination in Moscow and was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1990.

NJLYVN9U1Z_YB6T2ROY40HYD9H,OECD urges reforms in Italian economy report,"Xinhua 23rd January 2024, 10:05 GMT+11","Xinhua 23rd January 2024, 10:05 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103354/oecd-urges-reforms-in-italian-economy-report,"ROME, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) on Monday released a report on Italian economy, suggesting an array of reforms that it said would help the country avoid an economic slowdown.
The Italian government's statistics entity has estimated that the country's economy grew 0.7 percent in 2023, slightly better than the EU estimate of 0.6 percent for the eurozone.
In its report, the OECD said Italy was at risk of slower growth if it did not make certain reforms, including scaling back pensions for the wealthiest residents.
""Reducing the generosity of pensions for high-income households could limit the increase in spending (on pensions), while maintaining adequate public services and social protections,"" the report said.
The organization also said Italy should lower income taxes, raise the value-added tax and increase taxes on property. In specific terms, it said the country should reintroduce taxes on primary residences and increase taxes on inherited wealth.
The OECD economic survey also said Italy risked seeing its ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP) increase from its already-high level due to higher spending stemming from its aging population exacerbated by paying interest on debt.
""Public spending on aging-related and debt servicing costs as a share of GDP is expected to increase by about 4.5 percentage points between 2023 and 2040,"" the report said, calling for reforms to help reverse the trend. The OECD said Italy's debt was equivalent to around 140 percent of GDP, compared to an average of 90 percent for the EU as a whole."

The EU's media outlets should take notes from RT if they hope to make themselves heard outside of the West, the bloc's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said on Tuesday. He described the Russian broadcaster as a prime example of successful work in the Arab world, in particular.
The High Representative for Foreign Affairs was speaking at a conference aimed at combating disinformation, manipulation, and foreign interference, according to its organizer, the EU's diplomatic service. Borrell criticized the Western-centric approach of EU media and argued that it simply does not work.
""We believe that everybody around the world speaks English or French,"" he said, adding that the bloc thus fails to reach millions of people who speak Arabic or Chinese. The official then said that RT did not have such a problem.
""The other day at the Cairo Airport, it was full of advertising for Russia Today broadcasting in Arabic. Russia Today has arrived in the Arabic world and it is announcing themselves as a good source of information in Arabic. We have to do the same thing: to speak and to use the same language,"" Borrell said.
He then also pointed to the growing presence of Russian media in Sub-Saharan Africa, claiming that it is influencing the views of people on the continent ""against the Western countries."" Borrell maintained that the West is engaged in a ""battle of narratives"" with Russia, adding that this battle ""has to be won."" To do so, the EU needs effective instruments, ""capacities, tools and dedicated people,"" he argued.
""Sorry to say but we need people who speak not only English but Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and languages spoken by hundreds of millions of people which are not part of our traditional parameters [of] our linguistical culture,"" he stated, calling the competition with Moscow's outlets ""a matter of security.""
The West has long viewed RT as a seemingly omnipotent threat. The broadcaster has been banned on YouTube and platforms owned by the US-based Meta tech giant, including Facebook and Instagram, since the spring of 2022.
Many Western nations have also demanded that TV services and other platforms ban RT's content from being shown on their territory. Even before the conflict, RT's German-language channel, RT DE faced a difficult legal battle to broadcast in Germany. The nation's banks refused to work with the channel, and regulators in Berlin threatened legal action when it finally began broadcasting from Serbia in December 2021.
RT DE was eventually blocked by German regulators in February 2022, a month before the European Commission ordered a bloc-wide ban on all RT channels and websites.
In 2022, Western media also sounded the alarm over Russian media expansion in the Global South. Last year, RT was including in Washington's list of security threats.
In 2023, RT launched a major PR campaign in various regions around the world under the slogan: ""They think you believe. We believe you think."" It was aimed at highlighting the network's global presence, as well as challenging multiple Western narratives about both Russia and the nations of the Global South.

NKZIR8674F_T45OR66X7GBN41W,"Poland, Ukraine Put Aside Differences in Common Front Against Russia","Voice of America 23rd January 2024, 05:36 GMT+11","Voice of America 23rd January 2024, 05:36 GMT+11",20240122,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103170/poland-ukraine-put-aside-differences-in-common-front-against-russia,"Polish and Ukrainian leaders pledged Monday to bolster their alliance against Russia's invasion of Ukraine, putting aside differences over the recent Polish blockade of Ukrainian trucks trying to enter the European Union.
In his first visit to Kyiv, newly elected Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk described Ukraine's defensive war against the Russian invasion as a ""battle"" between 'good and evil,' adding, 'Poland will do everything to increase Ukraine's chances of victory in this war.'
'The security of the Polish nation and the Polish state is also at stake in this fight,' Tusk said.
Relations between the two countries had soured in recent months due to Polish blockades against Ukrainian trucks at the border.
Polish truckers enforced the blockade from November until last week, protesting Ukrainian truckers' permit-free access into the EU.
The EU had waived the permits system after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but Polish truckers want it reintroduced, saying their earnings have taken a hit.
The truckers agreed last week to suspend their protests until March 1.
'We understand the depth of the reasons that led to this kind of situation but draw attention first and foremost to the depth of the threat that stands before our peoples,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a media briefing with Tusk.
The two leaders hailed plans for joint arms production while Zelenskyy said on X, formerly Twitter, that they had discussed a new form of cooperation aimed at larger-scale arms purchases for Ukraine. He did not provide details.
As part of a new aid package for Ukraine, Poland's new government is exploring how to make more ammunition and military equipment available to Ukraine, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said last week.
Tusk's surprise trip to Kyiv coincides with Ukraine's Unity Day, commemorating the unification in 1919 of western and eastern Ukraine, which has faced numerous invasions over its long history.
Zelenskyy marked the day by signing a decree offering dual Ukrainian citizenship to ethnic Ukrainians and their descendants from all around the world, apart from Russia.
Tusk is among many European leaders visiting Kyiv in recent weeks to reassure Ukraine of international support as its biggest political and military backers struggle to secure aid.
Zelenskyy lashed out at 'skeptical' members of the NATO alliance holding out against Ukrainian membership in the bloc, and said his country is 'fighting this skepticism.'
Kyiv has made gaining control of its airspace a priority for this year and urged the West to supply more air defense systems.
Meanwhile, Ukraine's military said Monday it thwarted Russian drone attacks in multiple parts of the country overnight, while Russian officials accused Ukrainian forces of carrying out a ""vicious"" attack in a Russia-controlled city in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian air force said its air defenses downed eight drones launched by Russia, including in the skies over the Mykolaiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Officials say the drones came from Russia's southern Primorsko-Akhtarsk region.
In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused Ukraine of using indiscriminate weapons and attacking civilian infrastructure, leaving at least 27 people dead in the city of Donetsk Sunday.
Peskov also said Monday that Russia is taking necessary measures after a suspected Ukrainian attack on a Baltic Sea fuel export terminal.
Ukraine's military remains tight-lipped on both attacks.
Russian drone and missile attacks have repeatedly hit Ukrainian civilian sites throughout the war that Russia began nearly two years ago, killing thousands of Ukrainian civilians.
The market strike Sunday was one of the deadliest on Russian-controlled Donetsk since Moscow attacked Ukraine in February 2022. Russia claims to have annexed the territory; a move condemned as illegal by most countries in the U.N. General Assembly.
Responding to media questions about the attack, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement Sunday that the secretary-general strongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including the shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine.
Russia remains on high alert for drone attacks against its infrastructure after its second-largest natural gas producer Novatek said Sunday it had to suspend some operations at a huge Baltic Sea fuel export terminal due to a fire started by what Ukrainian media said was a drone attack.
The giant Ust-Luga complex, located on the Gulf of Finland close to the border with Estonia and about 170 kilometers west of St. Petersburg, ships oil and gas products to international markets.

NM4F41Q4RR_EYR54BYY6T8AEM4,FAA wants airlines operating Boeing 737s to conduct more inspections,"Robert Besser 25th January 2024, 03:24 GMT+11","Robert Besser 25th January 2024, 03:24 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105248/faa-wants-airlines-operating-boeing-737s-to-conduct-more-inspections,"WASHINGTON D.C.: After some operators reported issues with bolts on Boeing 737-900ERs after inspections, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommended airlines operating affected planes to inspect door plugs and ensure that they are properly secured.
After an incident on January 5 when a panel on an eight-week-old Alaska Airlines MAX 9 jet suffered a blowout mid-air that made a hole in the aircraft, regulators have increased scrutiny on Boeing.
The FAA grounded 171 Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes after the incident.
To contain the damage, the Seattle-based plane maker appointed an independent advisor to examine quality control in its manufacturing processes while the planes were grounded.
In its new ""Safety Alert for Operators,"" the FAA said that some airlines had conducted additional inspections on the 737-900ER mid-exit door plugs and had noted ""findings with bolts during the maintenance inspections.""
More widely used than the 737 MAX 9, the 737-900ER is an older model but has the same optional door plug design that allows for an extra emergency exit door when an airline chooses to install more seats.
Cirium data showed that out of the 490 Boeing 737-900ER jets in service, at least 79 have an active door rather than the plug because they are operated by low-cost airlines with denser cabins.
""Carriers should perform key portions of a fuselage plug assembly maintenance procedure related to the four bolts used to secure the door plug to the airframe as soon as possible,"" the FAA stressed.
""We fully support the FAA and our customers in this action,"" a Boeing spokesperson said.
Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, the only two U.S. carriers that use the MAX 9, said that during preliminary inspections, they discovered loose parts on several grounded MAX 9 planes.
Due to the grounding of the planes, they had to cancel thousands of flights this month, with United's cancellations potentially extending till January 19.
On January 21, the FAA said MAX 9 planes would remain grounded until it was satisfied that they were safe to return to service."

War and misery in Gaza are fueling turmoil far beyond, he told a high-level open debate of the Security Council on the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.
""We are seeing dangerous developments across the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, where tensions are off the charts, with a dramatic increase in casualties,"" he said.
Dozens of Palestinians are being arrested daily. Over 6,000 Palestinians were detained since Oct. 7, with many subsequently released. Settler violence is also another major concern. The demolition and seizure of Palestinian-owned houses and other structures continues, he noted.
The Palestinian economy is in crisis. Israel's withholding of a significant portion of Palestinian tax revenues, the continued prohibition on nearly all Palestinian workers entering Israel since Oct. 7, and severe movement and access restrictions across the West Bank are all contributing to soaring unemployment and poverty, he said.
The risks of broader regional escalation are now becoming a reality, warned Guterres.
Daily exchanges of fire across the Israeli-Lebanese border, including strikes on civilian areas, have killed six Israelis and 25 Lebanese civilians and driven tens of thousands from their homes on both sides, he said. ""The risk of miscalculation is dangerously high. I urge all parties to refrain from aggressive rhetoric, and to immediately end activities that could further inflame tensions.""
The situation in the Red Sea is also deeply worrying, said the UN chief.
Houthi attacks are disrupting global trade. These have been followed by airstrikes by the United States and Britain on Houthi positions in Yemen, he noted. ""De-escalation is essential, and all attacks on merchant and commercial vessels in the Red Sea must cease immediately.""
Also, there are almost daily attacks on facilities hosting U.S. and international coalition forces in Iraq and Syria. In response, the United States has launched airstrikes targeting individuals and groups suspected of these actions. And in Syria, airstrikes that Iran and Syria have attributed to Israel, have targeted officials of Hamas and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, he said. ""I urge all parties to step back from the brink and to consider the horrendous human cost of a regional conflict.""
Beyond the need for immediate de-escalation, each situation demands the implementation of a clear political roadmap that would contribute to long-term regional stability, he said.
In Syria, that is a UN-facilitated political solution in line with Security Council Resolution 2254 that meets the needs of all Syrians; on the Israeli-Lebanonese border, the need for the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701; and in Yemen, the establishment of a UN roadmap to implement the commitments made by the parties and prepare for a Yemeni-owned, inclusive political process under UN auspices, said Guterres."

South Africa has expressed hopefulness ahead of an International Court of Justice (ICJ) hearing on the genocide case against Israel which was filed by Pretoria, Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor told Ubuntu Radio.
The ICJ will meet in The Hague on Friday, January 26 to discuss potential emergency measures against Israel regarding alleged violations of the UN's Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The 17-judge ICJ panel is expected to announce their decision by the end of the day.
The three letters 'ICJ' were not known to many people in South Africa until the case was filed, Pandor added. According to her, the main aim has been ""to highlight the plight of the innocent in Palestine"" and ""draw attention to the lack of justice and freedom."" She added that regardless of success or failure, ""the real analysis and judgment is going to be on the court itself.""
Pretoria called for a preliminary ruling to compel Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza as part of two days of hearings earlier this month. The allegations have been strongly denied by Israel, which has called for the case to be dismissed.
Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, launching rockets and taking hostages. The Israel Defense Forces responded with a massive bombing campaign and ground invasion of Gaza, as well as cutting off the water and electricity supplies. Palestinian health officials report that since the war began, more than 25,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in Gaza. According to official Israeli statistics, at least 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed, and 248 hostages were taken in the initial assault by Palestinian armed groups.

The letter written by Kharge on Tuesday night also addressed security issues in the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra in Assam over the past few days.
Kharge, in his letter to Amit Shah, said that on Day 1 of the Yatra's entry in Assam on January 18, 2024, the Assam Police was found protecting the posters of the BJP in Sibsagar district's Amguri instead of ensuring safe passage for the Yatra, while on Day 2, the miscreants associated with the BJP were caught defacing and taking down posters and hoardings of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra (BJNY) in Lakhimpur District.
""On the 21st of January, 2024 as the Yatra returned to Assam via Arunachal Pradesh, another outrageous attack occurred on the Yatra in Sonitpur district. The local Superintendent of Police in Sonitpur District happens to be the brother of Chief Minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma. He watched to see that BJP workers attacked and manhandled the Indian National Congress' social media team, along with our General Secretary, Jairam Ramesh. Jairam Ramesh's car was attacked while miscreants were shouting anti-BJNY slogans, tearing off the BJNY sticker on the vehicle, and attempting to throw water on the passengers inside,"" further read the letter.
""On the same day in Sonitpur district, the BJP's district party workers approached and blocked Rahul Gandhi's convoy. The BJP's workers then physically assaulted Assam Pradesh Congress Committee President Bhupen Borah, resulting in him bleeding profusely,"" it added.
The letter further mentioned that on the next evening, BJP workers blocked Rahul Gandhi's convoy, coming extremely close to him and creating an extremely unsafe situation in Nagaon district.
The Congress President, in his letter, alleged that in all of these troubling events, the Assam Police has systematically stood by and allowed BJP workers to come closer and closer to the convoy of Rahul Gandhi, breaching his security cordon and endangering his physical security and that of his team.
""Despite all of the instances listed above and the presence of ample evidence available in the public domain, none of the miscreants have been arrested, and in many instances, investigations have not been initiated. As the risk increases and the Yatra proceeds as planned, we request your intervention to ensure that the Chief Minister of Assam and the Director General of Police, Assam, ensure that no such untoward incident takes place that may lead to grave personal injury to Rahul Gandhi or any members of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra,"" Kharge appealed in his letter to Amit Shah.
Meanwhile, an FIR has been registered against Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, party General Secretary KC Venugopal, National Students' Union of India All India Congress Committee Incharge Kanhaiya Kumar, and other individuals under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.
""With reference to wanton acts of violence, provocation, damage to public property and assault on police personnel today by Cong members, a FIR has been registered against Rahul Gandhi, KC Venugopal , Kanhaiya Kumar and other individuals under section 120(B)143/147/188/283/353/332/333/427 IPC R/W Sec. 3 of PDPP Act,"" Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma posted on X.

The Hungarian government is in favor of Sweden joining NATO and will soon schedule a ratification vote in the parliament, Prime Minister Victor Orban announced on Wednesday. The move will allow Stockholm to become a member of the US-led military bloc after almost two years of delays.
Sweden applied to join NATO in May 2022, citing the Russia-Ukraine conflict, but ran into opposition from TÃ¼rkiye and Hungary due to ongoing disputes with the two states. The bloc's rules require the consent of all members before it can accept new ones.
""Just finished a phone call with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg,"" Orban said on X (formerly Twitter). ""I reaffirmed that the Hungarian government supports the NATO membership of Sweden. I also stressed that we will continue to urge the Hungarian National Assembly to vote in favor of Sweden's accession and conclude the ratification at the first possible opportunity.""
Budapest has accused Stockholm of telling ""blatant lies"" about Hungarian democracy as part of an ongoing dispute within the European Union. As of Wednesday, the Hungarian parliament has not put up the ratification vote on its docket.
Turkish lawmakers voted to approve Sweden's membership on Tuesday, sending the ratification bill to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's desk. Ankara had serious differences with Stockholm over human rights, terrorism and arms trade, which interfered with NATO plans to have Sweden and Finland join the bloc together.
Both Scandinavian countries abandoned their long-standing policy of non-alignment after Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine, citing it as a threat to their security. When Finland officially joined the bloc in April 2023, NATO doubled the length of its border with Russia.
Moscow said that it had no issue with either country until then, but would have to react to them joining NATO. Russia has repeatedly insisted that the bloc's expansion eastward, which began in 1999, is a threat to Russian national security and one of the root causes of the Ukraine conflict.
Orban has repeatedly called for peace in Ukraine and said he would block any attempts by Kiev to join NATO or the EU, as that would mean ""bringing the war"" into both organizations.

NT556RVAAO_1EA84OBY0ZCRZZM,Supply Chain Investment trend in 2024,"ACCESSWIRE 23rd January 2024, 02:17 GMT+11","ACCESSWIRE 23rd January 2024, 02:17 GMT+11",20240122,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274102942/supply-chain-investment-trend-in-2024,"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / January 22, 2024 / If you're an accredited investor, you likely have a lot of opportunities that come your way. But have you considered investing in supply chain financing? While no investment is without risk -- which is why you want highly curated offerings such as those on Yieldstreet's platform -- high returns are possible. But is investing in supply chain a good idea in 2024? The answer is yes, but let's explore.
What is a Supply Chain?
Generally, this is the network of individuals, companies, resources, and technologies involved in a product's creation and sale. This means everything from delivery to the manufacturer of supplier source material, through to delivery to the end user.
What is Supply Chain Finance?
Supply chain finance (SCF) refers to technology-based solutions that seek to reduce financing costs and heighten business efficiency for purchasers and sellers in a transaction. Here, suppliers are paid quicker, and buyers gain more time to clear their balances. Supply chain financing usually pays all earned interest at maturity.
What Role do Investments Play in the Supply Chain?
The investment chain is where most of the money for a project derives, especially during its development stage. Capital flows downstream to the project from accredited investors as well as lenders, shareholders, and insurers. Some of the investors fund the project directly, while others go through one or multiple parent companies.
Why Do Companies Invest in Supply Chain?
In the modern business space, a smooth-running supply chain is paramount. Also, that supply chain must be flexible. An elastic supply chain allows companies to adapt to market changes and take advantage of opportunities. Through implementation of optimal approaches and technologies, organizations can increase their resilience and set themselves up for enduring success.
Is Investing in Supply Chain Still a Good Idea?
Yes. Supply chain finance has been primarily driven by the supply chain's complexity and globalization, phenomena that continue to increase. Further, investors can diversify their portfolio by adding supply chain financing to their holdings. Portfolio diversification mitigates risk and is key to long-term investing success.
There are sectors of the manufacturing economy that will likely shift toward a more domestic orientation. Such shifts could also result in more long-term opportunities for investors. Because the federal government has focused on semiconductor manufacturing amid geopolitical and security concerns, companies that are part of the semiconductor supply chain, or that build semiconductors, stand to experience sustainable revenue growth.
Similar opportunities are likely to play out in domestic renewable energy, automation hardware and software, as well as in ground transportation and industrial real estate. It's a good idea to ask your financial advisor how you could benefit from taking positions in the prospective beneficiaries of these trends.
While investing in supply chain is a good idea, an accredited investor would be wise to go through a private-market investment platform that engages in selective deal sourcing.

NY765QWU4C_2ZINIKTV3DMR450,Section 144 imposed in Punjab to hamper PTI show of strength: Imran Khan,"ANI 26th January 2024, 00:37 GMT+11","ANI 26th January 2024, 00:37 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106151/section-144-imposed-in-punjab-to-hamper-pti-show-of-strength-imran-khan,"Islamabad [Pakistan], January 25 (ANI): Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday said the Punjab government has imposed Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to hamper the upcoming power show by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf's candidates, Dawn reported.
The former PM made the remarks after attending court proceedings of GBP 190 million, Toshakhana, and cypher cases. Accountability judge Mohammad Bashir deferred the indictment of Khan in thePound 190m reference as the defence counsel was absent.
Khan said Pakistan's caretaker government, a few individuals in the establishment, and the Election Commission of Pakistan are united against his party, according to Dawn report.
He stressed that PTI had an overwhelming vote bank within the armed forces, and the party will not be deterred whatever coercive measures were adopted to suppress its voice.
Khan said he never witnessed such pre-poll rigging in Pakistan's history, and they planned to rig elections set to be held on February 8. However, he added that they would see the public rage on election day.
In response to a question about the possibility of a deal with stakeholders, he said that the only deal in which he is now interested is conducting free and transparent polls, Dawn reported.
Khan said the prevailing mindset of the power corridors is harmful for Pakistan and stressed that the election is for ""real freedom."" He stated that he has applied to cast his vote through the postal ballot.
He said Section 144 was imposed after he asked the PTI candidates to carry out large-scale public meetings. He expressed apprehensions that the government will not permit PTI candidates to hold their show of power.
The PTI founder accused Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader of being behind the imposition of Section 144 as he was not able to bring out people in public meetings, Dawn reported.
Imran Khan said the PTI has formulated a contingency plan and in case any candidate is arrested or stopped from contesting the polls, his replacement will do so.
Special Court Judge (Official Secrets Act) Abual Hasnat Mohammad Zulqarnain, concluded the cross-examination of four prosecution witnesses in the cypher case. There are 25 prosecution witnesses to be cross-examined by Imran Khan and Shah Mehmood Qureshi's lawyer.
The witnesses who were cross-examined on Wednesday included Deputy Director of Ministry of Foreign Affairs Iqra Ashraf, Imran Sajid, Shamoon Qaiser and cypher assistant Mohammad Nauman, Dawn reported.
In a related development, a division bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) reserved its decision on two petitions of Imran Khan against his trial at Adiala Jail in Toshakhana and corruption case.
Khan's lawyer Shaheen said the notification had been issued in violation of relevant laws. He stressed that earlier, another division bench of the Islamabad High Court had scrapped court proceedings while observing faults in the issuance of the notification for the jail trial, according to Dawn report.
During the court proceedings, Attorney General Awan said the matter before the other bench was not identical. He said the government has completed all codal formalities of Imran Khan's trial in jail. (ANI)"

The 10-day film festival annually draws more than 100,000 people, including Hollywood celebrities.
A young man wearing gold sunglasses offered the ""from the river to the sea"" chant, prompting Tishby to ask what river he meant. Caught off-guard, he said, ""Um, uhh. I forgot the river's name.""He then stated: ""But the sea is the Red Sea.""He also told her that ""the occupation is illegal. Even chocolate is not allowed. Wedding dresses are not allowed"" (eliciting an eye roll from Tishby). ""It's been that way for 15 years.""The slogan, ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,"" is a call for a Palestinian state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, encompassing not only Judea and Samaria but the entire state of Israel.
Tishby posed the same question to a young woman in a hooded red coat and a keffiyeh. ""So where is the river and the sea that everyone's chanting about?""Carrying a sign with a watermelon on it, she responded, ""I think it's the Black Sea and the river on the other side of Gaza."" She acknowledged getting the poster from someone else.
""Do you know what it means?"" asked Tishby.
""No,"" the woman responded.
Tishby served as special envoy for combating antisemitism and the delegitimization of Israel until she was removed in April 2023 after just a year in the role.
She interviewed a young woman in a purple parka who proclaimed that ""the Palestinian genocide,"" is ""just awful."" Tishby asked her about the hostages kidnapped by Hamas.
""Unfortunately, I'm not that educated about that part,"" responded the protester.
An older woman insisted that Hamas wasn't in the Gaza Strip. When Tishby asked her if there are hostages in Gaza, she replied, ""Oh, I don't know,"" and looked away.
Tishby's findings align with recent research that showed only 47% of students who supported the protest slogan could identify which river and sea it referenced.
The festival runs through January 28. (ANI/TPS)"

The move, on Wednesday, comes after a week of confrontations between Moscow and Paris.
Russia claimed, without evidence, to have killed 60 French mercenaries in a strike in Ukraine's Kharkiv before summoning French ambassador Pierre Levy.
Russia's claims come after Paris announced it would send dozens of long-range missiles to Ukraine.
Moscow's choice of the word ""mercenary"" implies that France is breaking its own law against citizens working abroad as guns-for-hire - a crime punishable by five years in prison and a fine of â¬75,000.
The French Foreign Ministry has said it has no mercenaries ""anywhere"", calling the claims ""another clumsy Russian manipulation"" and pointing to Russia's own mercenary activity in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa.
The Kremlin said Wednesday that it had ""reliable information"" that there were French mercenaries in Ukraine but stopped short of providing details.
""Despite the fact that Paris officially denies that French mercenaries are participating in the military conflict in Ukraine ... objective information about losses in mercenary neo-Nazi units reliably indicates the opposite,"" the Russian resolution read.
France has been one of Kyiv's staunchest allies during Moscow's almost two-year offensive.
""Russian manipulation"" France accuses Russia of faking websites to sow confusion about Ukraine warParis also said Russia's claims are part of an ongoing disinformation campaign.In June, Paris revealed a digital influence operation publishing anti-Ukraine content on websites imitating major French newspapers.

RAWALPINDI, Pakistan, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Rab Nawaz, a 63-year-old barber by profession, is a citizen of Rawalpindi city in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province, who has not been able to earn properly for the last two years due to cataract in one of his eyes.
All his six family members were financially dependent on him while his health was affecting his daily life until he recently visited a medical camp launched by Chinese and Pakistani charities to provide free eye screening and cataract surgery.
""I am happy that Chinese friends cared for us. We are poor people, we can't afford it. I didn't even have money for food, but today, after this free surgery, I will be able to properly earn,"" Nawaz told Xinhua when he visited the camp at Rawalpindi for a post-surgery checkup.
It was among the few camps that were part of a campaign launched by the Beijing One Heart Sphere Charity Foundation (BOHS) and China-Pakistan Youth Exchange Community (CPYEC) in collaboration with local charity groups in different parts of Pakistan that started in mid-January.

Under the campaign, screening of around 1,500 patients took place, out of whom 100 needy people underwent cataract surgery in the Rawalpindi camp.
Talking to Xinhua, Ammar Afzal Tarar, an eye surgeon at the camp, said that the cost of the surgery in the country goes from 50,000 rupees (about 178 U.S. dollars) all the way up to 150,000 rupees which the majority of the poor family in Pakistan can't afford, adding that ""this is a very good initiative taken by our Chinese friends.""
He said the laser surgery that is being used in the campaign is utilized all over the world for the operation of this disease.
It's considered the latest and most effective treatment for the disease and is regarded as a golden standard for cataract operation, Tarar added.
Explaining the work and procedure at the camp, the surgeon said that the Chinese volunteers have been very helpful in the entire activity, noting that they have not just funded the project but, in fact, actively helped and supported at each and every step.
""Not only have they been motivating us, but when sometimes our spirits are down, and we feel exhausted during those stressful times, there has been a lot of support from the Chinese volunteers. They have been supportive of this whole campaign, this whole session,"" he said.

Wang Jing, a Chinese volunteer of the CPYEC and one of the organizers of the campaign, said that the joint efforts of the Pakistani and Chinese volunteers have brought light and hope to the patients.

""In the future, with the help of the BOHS, we hope to bring light to other Pakistani patients also to truly implement the concept of building an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future and contribute to China-Pakistan friendship,"" the Chinese volunteer added."

Lekhi also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the whole team for selecting Karpoori Thakur for the Bharat Ratna.
""An attempt to keep every such gem out in the open is underway. Karpoori Thakur worked in social service, worked for those deprived in society and struggled during the emergency. I thank PM Modi and the whole team that made this selection,"" the Union Minister told ANI.
Earlier today, the government announced the posthumous award of the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, to Karpoori Thakur. Following the announcement, family members of the late Bihar CM exchanged sweets in recognition of the forthcoming Bharat Ratna honour.
Union Minister Pashupati Kumar Paras said that the decision taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is ""historic.""""PM Narendra Modi has made a historic decision. The people of Bihar and the entire country are thankful to him for this decision...The PM made a historic decision. He will now be considered a messiah of the backward and Dalits,"" Paras said.

""He connected the poor, the deprived and the backward to the mainstream...I express gratitude to the Prime Minister for conferring the Bharat Ratna on him. This is an honour of the poor and their voice, of the backwards...Several of the previous governments used to think about only the people around them. Some of them thought only about their own families. Narendra Modi Government thinks about the entire country,"" Prasad said.
He further said that awarding Karpoori Thakur with Bharat Ratna is an honour of the poor, the backward of the country.
""For this much-awaited decision, I express my gratitude. Awarding Karpoori Thakur with Bharat Ratna is an honour of the poor, the backward of the country,"" he said.
Former Bihar CM was born on January 24, 1924, and passed away on February 17, 1988.
Thakur was born in one of the most backward sections of society - the Nai Samaj. He was a remarkable leader whose political journey was marked by his unwavering commitment to the marginalised sections of society.
He served as the Chief Minister of Bihar and was a key figure in the struggle against social discrimination and inequality. His commitment to affirmative action gave representation and opportunities to the poor, oppressed, exploited and deprived sections of the country.
Embarking on his political career with the Praja Socialist Party, he later joined forces with the Janata Party during his initial tenure as the chief minister of Bihar from 1977 to 1979. Over time, he established connections with the Janata Dal, marking a significant shift in his political affiliation. (ANI)"

The main entrance to the temple is situated on the eastern side, which can be approached by ascending 32 stairs through the Singh Dwar. There are a total of five Mandaps (Halls) in the Mandir - Nritya Mandap, Rang Mandap, Sabha Mandap, Prathana Mandap and Kirtan Mandap.
Near the temple is a historic well (Sita koop), dating back to the ancient era. In the southwestern part of the temple's complex, at Kuber Tila, the ancient temple of Bhagwan Shiv has been restored, along with the installation of a statue of Jatayu.
The foundation of the temple has been constructed with a 14-meter-thick layer of roller-compacted concrete (RCC), giving it the appearance of artificial rock. No iron is used anywhere in the temple. For protection against ground moisture, a 21-foot-high plinth has been constructed using granite.
The temple complex has a sewage treatment plant, water treatment plant, water supply for fire safety and an independent power station. The temple has been constructed employing the country's traditional and indigenous technology. (ANI)"

Canada and China must engage in constructive government interactions, as China remains a key global market to diversify Canada's economic interests and overcome ongoing challenges effectively, said CCBC Executive Director Sarah Kutulakos as she announced the results of the council's 2022/2023 Canada-China Business Survey.
Kutulakos regarded the phone talks held earlier this month between Chinese and Canadian foreign ministers as ""a very good sign,"" adding she hopes it ""will be the start of a waterfall effect of ministers' engaging"" and lead to productive and regular interactions at multiple levels of government.
According to the survey, nearly 70 percent of the respondents from Canadian and Chinese companies identified the availability of direct flights and increased travel time due to fewer direct flights as top barriers to travel.
Normalizing flights is a top priority for the CCBC, and regular dialogue on a broader range of issues will help, Kutulakos said."
O6MQK0F8B2_M37VRNFHXN2C2LC,Island nation Tuvalu heads to polls today,"ANI 26th January 2024, 12:03 GMT+11","ANI 26th January 2024, 12:03 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106721/island-nation-tuvalu-heads-to-polls-today,"Taipei [Taiwan], January 26 (ANI): The island nation of Tuvalu is all set to head to polls today.
The country will examine its ties with Taiwan and China if Finance Minister Seve Paeni becomes prime minister following the election.
Tuvalu is one of the 12 countries that formally recognise Taiwan's government.
Speculation that Tuvalu will cut ties with Taiwan rose after Nauru switched to China following Taiwan's presidential election.
The elections in Tuvalu will be the deciding factor if the island nation will also walk in the footsteps of Nauru, which recently severed its diplomatic relationship with Taiwan.
According to ABC Pacific, there will be a lot of attention on the outcome around the Pacific, especially since Australia signed a security agreement with the current government, known as the Falepili Union. However, despite considerable criticism in Tuvalu, the transaction may not be on voters' minds.
Moreover, according to experts, if the agreement came into force, it would make it harder for Tuvalu to break ties with Taiwan in favour of China.
Australia has been vocal and active in confronting China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific.
China - Australia ties were affected in 2018 after Canberra announced legislation to crack down on foreign interference, which was perceived to be aimed at China. The ties between the two nations were further affected after Australia joined the Western nations in their demand for independent investigations into the origins of Covid-19.
The US, Japan, India, and Australia together formed Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD).
Tuvalu was formerly known as the Ellice Islands. The official languages spoken there are Tuvaluan, and English.
Enele Sopoaga, who is also running for prime minister of Tuvalu, has stated that if elected, he will continue to recognise Taiwan as a ""sovereign and independent state and diplomatic friend,"" according to Taiwan News.
Taiwan's ambassador to Tuvalu, Tung-heng Lin told CNA on Thursday that if the existing prime minister is re-elected, Taiwan-Tuvalu ties would remain strong.
Tuvalu will elect new members to its 16-member parliament on Friday.
Because there are no political parties in the country, elected MPs will negotiate to create factions following the vote, with the biggest group selecting the prime minister, according to Taiwan News.
Tuvalu's election results are anticipated today evening, with a government and prime minister chosen in the coming days.
Notably, the Pacific region has become a contesting point between China and other nations as its quest to emerge as a global power continues to irk countries.
As a result of the Solomon Islands government's decision to move its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Beijing in 2019 under Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, the Pacific region has become a flashpoint for Chinese-American conflict.
In April 2022, the Solomon Islands inked a security agreement with China that alarmed the US and its allies, including Australia, who worry that it could open the door for a Chinese military presence in the area, Bangladesh-based The Daily Asian Age reported, citing a funding document and email examined by RFA-affiliated news organisation BenarNews.

It will also rule on South Africa's demand for the court's urgent intervention to stop Israel's military operation in Gaza.
Judge Joan E. Donoghue, the president of the court, will read out the order at 1 p.m. local time (1200 GMT) during a public sitting at the Peace Palace.
On Dec. 29, 2023, South Africa filed an application to the ICJ for proceedings against Israel, concerning alleged violations by Israel of its obligations under the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide related to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
In this application, South Africa also requested the court to indicate provisional measures in order to ""protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people under the Genocide Convention,"" and ""to ensure Israel's compliance with its obligations under the Genocide Convention not to engage in genocide, and to prevent and to punish genocide.""
During two-day public hearings held earlier this month, South African representatives accused Israel of ""deliberate"" and ""systemic"" genocide against Palestinians. Israeli representatives argued that Israel's military operation in Gaza was an act of self-defense, and denied South Africa's genocide accusation.
As the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the ICJ was established by the UN Charter in 1945. It has the power ""to indicate, if it considers that circumstances so require, any provisional measures,"" while resolving legal disputes between countries. Its judgment is final and without appeal."

The ruling on Friday by Judge Enock Chacha Mwita said Kenya could only deploy officers abroad if it had a 'reciprocal arrangement' with the host government. It also ruled that only defense forces could be deployed, not security services.
Last year, the Nairobi court suspended the government's plan to send 1,000 police officers to Haiti.
Three petitioners, including opposition politician and constitutional lawyer Ekuru Aukot, brought the case, telling VOA at the time the proposed deployment was unconstitutional, an argument accepted by the court.
In October, the U.N. Security Council had approved a Kenya-led multinational security force aimed at helping to combat violent gangs in the troubled Caribbean nation.
Other African countries, including Chad, Senegal, Burundi, also have said they will add troops to the multinational force.
While many in Kenya have questioned their country's lead role in this mission, some had been supportive of President William Ruto, who had said, ""It's a mission for humanity and ... is of special significance and critical urgency"" for Kenyans.""
Violence escalated in Haiti on Wednesday as a heavily armed gang surrounded a hospital in the capital of Port-au-Prince. Police later rescued the patients.
On Thursday, the head of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime warned of a 'vicious cycle' of arms trafficking to increasingly powerful Haitian gangs, fueling an internal conflict and worsening violence across the Caribbean.
Also Thursday, Haitian Foreign Affairs Minister Jean Victor Geneus told the U.N. Security Council that gang violence in his country was as barbaric as the horrors experienced in war zones, and once again asked for an international force to intervene.
Gangs across Haiti have continued to grow more powerful since the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel MoÃ¯se, and the number of kidnappings and killings keeps rising."

The Russian IL-76 heavy transport plane was carrying 65 captured Ukrainian military personnel when it crashed in Belgorod Region some 90km (55 miles) from the Ukrainian border. The Russian Defense Ministry has claimed that the aircraft was brought down by Kiev's forces.
Here is what we know so far about what happened.
The plane crash On Wednesday at 11:15 Moscow time, reports came in that an IL-76 military transport plane carrying Ukrainian POWs had crashed and exploded in a field near the village of Yablonovo in the Korochansky district of Belgorod Region, which neighbors Ukraine.
Several people captured footage of the crash and shared videos of the incident on social media.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the plane was flying from the Chkalovsky airfield to Belgorod and was transporting the Ukrainian personnel for a prisoner swap with Kiev. Aside from the POWs, there were also six crew members and three accompanying personnel.
All those on board the aircraft were killed in the crash, according to the governor of Belgorod Region, Vyacheslav Gladkov. However, the crash did not cause any damage to structures or people on the ground, landing five to six kilometers from the nearest village.
According to Russian officials, another plane carrying an additional 80 Ukrainian POWs was also in the air at the time of the incident. After the first plane crashed, the second aircraft was diverted, according to MP Andrey Kartapolov.
What was the cause? Following the incident, the Russian Defense Ministry released a statement accusing Kiev's forces of shooting down the plane using an anti-aircraft missile system. The ministry claimed that Russia's Aerospace Forces radars recorded the launch of two Ukrainian missiles from the village of Liptsy in Kharkov Region.
The ministry has also stated that the Ukrainian side was informed of the flight ahead of time and was aware that it was carrying POWs, noting that the prisoner exchange was supposed to take place later in the afternoon at the Kolotilovka checkpoint.
Ukrainian media reports Shortly after the crash, the Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainskaya Pravda released a report claiming that it had received confirmation from Kiev's military that the its forces had shot the plane down and that it had been told that the aircraft was believed to be carrying S-300 missiles.
Shortly after, however, the outlet redacted that statement, stating only that Kiev had confirmed that it was aware of the plane crash but could not confirm it was carrying Ukrainian POWs.
Meanwhile, other Western media outlets such as US-state funded Radio Liberty have confirmed from sources within the Kiev government that a prisoner exchange with Russia was indeed scheduled for Wednesday, but no further comments have been provided.
Kiev's intelligence A representative of the Ukrainian Intelligence Service, Andrey Yusov, has also confirmed the scheduled prisoner exchange.
Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Coordination Headquarters for matters regarding prisoners of war has refused to confirm the planned swap, only stating that it was ""collecting and analyzing all the necessary information"" while urging the media and its citizens to refrain from speculating on the incident. The body also noted that Russia is ""actively carrying out special information operations"" aimed at destabilizing Ukrainian society.
Russia's reaction The head of Russia's State Duma Defense Committee, Andrey Kartapolov, has suggested that the IL-76 was shot down using Western Patriot or Iris-T air defense missiles. He has also proposed calling off any further prisoner swap negotiations with Kiev and insisted that Ukraine should officially be branded a terrorist state and its government a terrorist cell.
State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin has called on Russian lawmakers to make a formal address to the US and Germany, urging them to stop actively supporting the ""Nazi regime"" in Kiev, which has stooped to killing its own POWs.
Meanwhile, the Russian Defense Ministry stated that Kiev had once again ""shown its true colors"" by committing this ""terrorist act"" against its own citizens in an attempt to slander Moscow's forces.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has said that this act of ""mindless barbarism"" puts into question the possibility of reaching future agreements with Kiev, noting that ""there is no doubt"" that the Ukrainian authorities will eventually violate any guarantees that they give.
The ministry also stressed that the regime of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, which was propped up by the US and its NATO allies, has once again proven to be a threat not only to Russia, but to ""Ukraine itself, its citizens and the whole world.""
Former Russian President and current deputy chairman of the National Security Council Dmitry Medvedev has suggested that the downing of the IL-76 may have been the result of internal political turmoil between ""neo-Nazi elites in Kiev."" He suggested that ""it'll be even worse in the future"" as the Ukrainian government will continue slaughtering its own troops and POWs and bombing its own cities to protect its power and money.

""I am going by data and data always speaks for itself. In the Parliament, there was a reply given by the Government of India, that 95 per cent of cases of ICE meaning Income Tax, CBI and ED are on people who are in the Opposition parties.

The Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank scam case relates to the alleged fraudulent disbursal of loans amounting to Rs 25,000 crore. The case triggered the filing of a PIL petition in the Bombay High Court by four persons.
The PIL shed light on the alleged modus operandi of the fraud. In the petition, it was alleged that some sugar mills defaulted on the loans, which were given without due diligence. Those sugar mills were attached by the MSC banks and auctioned to various office bearers of the bank and politicians.
Acting on the PIL the Bombay High Court ordered the registration of a case. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW), which is under the Maharashtra government, investigated the case.

Ukrainian forces used a US-supplied Patriot missile to shoot down a Russian cargo plane carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, Radio France reported on Wednesday, citing a source in the French military.
The Il-76 military transport plane was shot down over Russia's Belgorod Region on Wednesday morning. Everyone on board - 65 prisoners, six flight crew, and three Russian soldiers - died; Russia's Defense Ministry claims that the plane was brought down by Ukrainian anti-aircraft missiles.
The prisoners were being transported to the city of Belgorod to be exchanged for Russian servicemen in Ukrainian captivity, the ministry stated, adding that the Ukrainian side had been made aware of the incoming flight.
Radio France's source did not provide any additional information, but the claim backs up an earlier assertion by a senior Russian MP that ""Patriot or Iris-T air defense missiles"" were used to bring the aircraft down.
The defense ministry stated that the missiles were launched from the Liptsy suburb of Kharkov, around 100km from the site of the crash. Both the American Patriot and German Iris-T systems are capable of engaging targets from this range, and the General Staff of Ukraine's armed forces said on Wednesday that it regularly uses such systems to target Russian military flights in the area, without explicitly admitting that it shot down the Il-76.
Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has not admitted that his forces were responsible for the downing of the plane. In a statement on Wednesday, he called for an ""international investigation"" to determine ""all the hard facts"" surrounding the incident.
The closest step to an admission of guilt came from Ukraine's military intelligence agency, the GUR. In a statement on Wednesday night, the agency claimed that it ""was not informed about the need to ensure the safety of the airspace"" over the border, and that it did not know how the prisoners would be transported.
The White House has not commented on the alleged use of Patriot missiles in the incident. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Wednesday that the US was ""not in a position to confirm"" any reports on the attack, and was working to ""get more clarity and more information on it.""
Russian Foreign MInister Sergey Lavrov requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Wednesday to discuss the incident. France, which holds the council's rotating chairmanship, refused this request, calling a meeting on Thursday afternoon instead.

OFMJ44AUSL_J7XJ3MSTMEJEMOL,China steps up support for home services industry,"Xinhua 22nd January 2024, 17:55 GMT+11","Xinhua 22nd January 2024, 17:55 GMT+11",20240122,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274102518/china-steps-up-support-for-home-services-industry,"BEIJING, Jan. 22 (Xinhua) -- China has rolled out measures to bolster its home services industry, in response to the demands of its aging population, the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said Monday.
The ministry, in collaboration with relevant departments, has offered an array of tax incentives, startup subsidies and financial assistance aimed at enhancing the industry's quality and growth, said MOC official Zhu Guangyao at a press conference.
Zhu said that China's home services industry currently employs around 30 million people, yet the industry's demand exceeds 50 million. Efforts are thereby underway to increase the workforce.
For instance, the ministry is encouraging job fairs to go online to better connect jobseekers with potential employers, and for training courses to be run online, according to Zhu.
The official added that employment will increasingly focus on home-based elderly care to meet the rising demand in this area.
China has previously released a guideline to strengthen the ""silver"" economy, which incorporates economic activities that cater to senior citizens with tailored products and services, and prepare for the challenges of an aging population.
Official data showed that China's population aged 60 and above had reached 297 million by the end of 2023, accounting for 21.1 percent of the country's total population."

WHAT WOULD it take for 18 million Australians to stop using Facebook and Instagram?
Would knowing how your data is mined do it? How about the fact that there are six million accounts worldwide ""whitelisted"" so that anything they post is exempt from the rules against misinformation, polarisation and hate speech? Or that, outed by journalists for covering up their own research about the social harm caused by their unruly platform, the company's response is not to get better at preventing harm, but to get better at hiding it?
The first users of Facebook were like a cosy club, people who saw this emerging technology and said, ""Thank you very much, we'll make that ours"". Over the years, this kind of user has been able to see the benefits of a networked, unmediated communication tool and enjoyed its accessibility.
When users notice some of the changes made to the platform launched by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, sometimes they complain vociferously. They believe a multi-billion-dollar company is, as Zuckerberg claims, all about the needs of its users.
When glitches happen - such as pornography dominating the ""recommended for you"" news feed or live-streaming of beheadings in Myanmar - the cosy club, now blossomed into billions of scrolling users both casual and compulsive, might be upset again, but Facebook's response is to suggest it's not the platform's fault, it's people who misuse it.
When the Wall Street Journal unrolled a series of damning reports in 2021 about how Facebook 'took human failings and encouraged them', it was noisy news. The Journal's Jeff Horwitz had been working with a whistleblower for months, with access to documents that showed, for example, that 'Facebook Knows Instagram Is Toxic for Teen Girls'.
The company's response, Horwitz writes in his book, Broken Code: Inside Facebook and the Fight to Expose Its Harmful Secrets, was to claim the Journal used ""limited"" research in a ""negative"" light. But it also took what Horwitz calls a ""conciliatory"" tone - which backfired spectacularly. The head of Instagram said, yes, company feedback and research did suggest Instagram was causing harm to teen girls whose insecurities were massively intensified by the way the platform works.
But, he said, social media is like cars:
There's a lot to unpack there and Horwitz's book does an excellent job of doing so. He is careful not to overload a general reader with too much technical information but he nevertheless pulls back the curtain to reveal just what the tens of thousands of engineers employed at Facebook (now Meta) actually do - and how what they do is controlled by a hierarchy of management that is dominated by Mark Zuckerberg himself.
Why would a social media company admit that they think putting teenagers' well-being at risk is unavoidable collateral damage? Simple - it's the numbers that count.
Broken Code reads like a thriller as the plot unfolds and it's so unbelievable it occasionally approaches farce. Time and again, when it becomes clear that Facebook (and Instagram, also Meta-owned) is being used to spread misinformation and to incite lethal violence, or when evidence emerges that a teenager's suicide is linked to her social media use, Horwitz describes how the company hits the panic button, with measures nicknamed ""Break the Glass"". When the urgent emergency situation calms down (when the very worst viral content is suppressed), the controls are watered down or removed and it's back to business as usual.
Oh, but it's too hard to monitor and control all the billions of posts and comments piling on to the site constantly, from all over the world, you might think. Indeed, when something goes wrong, you probably put it down to an internet outage or a bit of tweaking going on at the Facebook coalface. Try replying to someone posting to their friends and followers that the short-term disappearance of the comments from their post, on the Gaza genocide, may well have something to do with the words ""Gaza"" and ""genocide"", triggering a crisis of hate and abuse that Facebook needs to crack down on. Yeah, nah, is the perfectly reasonable response. That sounds like a conspiracy theory. It's more likely just a glitch.
Surveillance, shadow profiling and political omniscience Melanie McCartney delves into the murky world of big data surveillance methods and the ramifications for our privacy.Read Horwitz and the conspiracy theory hardens into facts. Facebook has constantly-improving systems which can detect undesirable and dangerous usage and respond with shutdown mechanisms that slow down or prevent the spread of misinformation or hate speech. That's a good thing, right? Read on.The book's first disturbing revelation is that these control mechanisms for awful content and the gaming of the system to make such content go viral are only developed in response to crises - that is, once damage has been done. The Myanmar massacres of Rohingya are one such example. While integrity workers at Facebook are pretty good at putting up red flags when a crisis looms, there's a wait-and-see attitude that puts off doing anything until that crisis hits. It's like ignoring cyclone warnings until the tsunami has taken out the coastline.Closer to the home and therefore heart of those tasked with Facebook's ethical integrity - that is, keeping it nice and safe for users, the election of Donald Trump in 2016 was a huge clarion call. Had Facebook's weak response to misinformation and hate speech (and the lack of knowledge within the company about how a minuscule number of people were able to dominate the most-viewed lists) played a part in getting a dangerously anti-democratic lunatic elected President of the United States?You bet - and Facebook itself had the figures to prove it. But they dithered about what it meant and whether they needed to fix it.The next of many revelations in Broken Code is how completely uninteresting - except to boost the engagement numbers - Zuckerberg and the Facebook head honchos find what they call the ""rest of the world"".

At the same time, they decided that political figures were exempt from censorship (Trump eventually becoming an exception to that).Facebook's laissez-faire attitude towards content that was rotten but popular is at least monitored by teams within the corporation that worked on ""integrity"". There are also people within the company who report on how such content causes harm. As Horwitz recounts, these are people who believe in the positives of social media - the kinds of uses that are now so embedded in our online societies that, to turn off Facebook would be a huge disruption, unthinkable for myriad community groups, businesses and individuals who rely on it.The problem is that negative media such as the Wall Street Journal's Facebook Files has seen some of those working on integrity give up and leave, while the self-reporting at the company is now more difficult to find (although workers still leak information).While Zuckerberg's decision to put the company's eggs in the Meta ""virtual reality"" basket has stalled, for now, that part of the business's growth, the bad press that the Facebook Files precipitated caused a mere blip on the ever-rising growth and profit graph.Just as Horwitz was completing Broken Code, a tip-off from someone on Meta's Oversight Board led to the Journal's story about ""a large-scale pedophilic community fed by Instagram's recommendation systems"".

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is willing to consider enlisting non-nationals into the country's armed forces in a bid to ease manpower shortages, according to the Rheinische Post newspaper.
Pistorius admitted last year that the EU country's military, the Bundeswehr, was experiencing problems attracting new recruits to its ranks. Berlin is seeking to implement an overhaul of its armed forces in the wake of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz has vowed to increase defense spending to help modernize the Bundeswehr, which has long faced claims of a lack of resources and adequate funding. In a bid to boost flagging numbers, Pistorius has said he is willing to consider broadening recruitment to include people who do not have a German passport.
""We would not be the first armed forces in Europe to do this,"" Pistorius said, according to the Rheinische Post on Sunday. ""There are people in the country who live in Germany in the second or third generation, but do not yet have German citizenship.""
The initiative has gained some support from the Free Democratic Party (FDP), which is part of Germany's three-way coalition government, as well as the opposition bloc of the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU).
""In the search for suitable young people ready to serve in the ranks of the Bundeswehr, we must in principle be prepared to think on a much more European scale,"" Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmerman, head of the Bundestag's Defense Committee, was quoted as saying.
""Related to this issue is the idea that soldiers without a German passport can quickly obtain one through service in the Bundeswehr,"" she added.
However, Johann Wadephul, a defense adviser for the CDU/CSU faction, warned that the proposal requires further clarification before it can be formally implemented. ""Will this opportunity be provided only to citizens of EU and NATO countries or to others too? Is fluency in German necessary for this?"" he asked, according to the Rheinische Post.
Germany is planning to increase its military to 203,000 personnel from its current level of around 181,000 by 2025, DW said last month. Speaking in Stuttgart in August, Pistorius said that attempts to boost Bundeswehr numbers are being hampered by sluggish recruitment, and that 7% fewer potential recruits had applied up to that point than in the same period one year prior.

We also run a centre for homeless women. Orphans are also cared for and provided with good education. They go on to get good jobs later in life. We also arrange their nuptials and take care of all expenses. We are also actively engaged in the 'Beti Bachao 'Beti Padhao' campaign of the government.""Kazi, who rose from being a board member to becoming the president of the organisation 15 years ago, said they have collaborated with two universities at the international level to provide education to poor children who can't afford fees.
""We have expanded the scope of education that we provide over the last 15 years, taking it across the country. At the international level, we collaborated with two universities last year. The outcome is very encouraging. Our initiatives are aimed at helping out poor children who can't afford fees,"" Kazi added.
A radiologist by profession, he said that everything can't be left to the government. ""I reduced my (medical) practice to devote more time to this work. A lot needs to be done.

The fires have already destroyed more than 6,600 hectares of vegetation, according to the National Disaster Risk Management Unit.
Officials say there are 31 active fires, with only nine under control. By declaring a disaster, the government has more leeway to allocate funds to fight the fires. Nearly half of the country's $508 million designated to combat issues such as wildfires has already been spent.
The high number of fires raises concerns for municipalities that may not have firefighting capacity. According to the Colombian Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies, nearly half Â­of municipalities have been put on maximum alert for fire risk. And according to the National Fire Department of Colombia, about a third don't have a fire department.
More than 600 soldiers, along with aircraft and vehicles, have been deployed to emergency areas. Colombian police are transporting and spraying water over fires, using planes meant to spray chemicals over coca leaf crops.
Air quality has deteriorated in many areas - particularly in Bogota, the capital, where at least three fires surround the city. Hundreds of firefighters, police officers and volunteers are fighting fires on the mountains surrounding the city.
More than 200 fires have already been put out this month in Colombia, according to the Environment Ministry and disaster agency.
The increase in fires is due to hotter-than-normal temperatures and dry conditions, which have been worsened by the El Nino phenomenon, which is when ocean water in the central Pacific Ocean reaches above-average temperatures, affecting the weather.

The Uttarakhand Chief Minister was addressing the media during the 75th Republic Day function at his residence in Dehradun, where he also unfurled the national flag.
""UCC committee has almost completed its task. A little more time is needed to compile it and complete some other formalities, so the time-period has been extended by 15 days. We are going to get the draft soon. As soon as we get it, we will take further steps and convene an Assembly session,"" the Uttarakhand Chief Minister said.
The tenure of the committee headed by Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai has already been extended three times earlier, with the latest being an extension of four months in September last year.
A statement by the Chief Minister's office on September 23 last year said, ""The Uttarakhand government has extended the tenure of the expert committee for the Uniform Civil Code by four months.""The panel was constituted on May 27, 2022, and it is the fourth time an extension has been given to the committee.
After receiving public suggestions, the committee has done the work of preparing a draft but the report has not been submitted to the government yet, the statement added.
The UCC was promised to the people of the state in the run-up to the 2022 assembly polls in Uttarakhand.
Article 44 of the Constitution of India says that the State shall endeavour to secure a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) throughout the territory of India. The UCC proposes a common set of laws dealing with marriage, inheritance, adoption, and other matters.
The UCC, which had been a hot topic that had polarised opinions over the last 4 years, hit the forefront in June last year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strong case for the implementation of uniform legislation in an address in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal.
PM Modi said the country cannot run on two laws and that the Uniform Civil Code was in keeping with the founding principles and ideals of the Constitution.
""Today people are being instigated in the name of UCC. How can the country run on two (laws)? The Constitution also talks of equal rights...Supreme Court has also asked to implement the UCC. These (Opposition) people are playing vote bank politics,"" PM Modi had said in Bhopal. (ANI)"

The Turkish parliament voted on the bill after a debate in the Grand National Assembly. A total of 346 lawmakers participated in the voting, with 287 votes in favor, 55 against, and four abstentions.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is expected to sign the bill into law within a few days.
Turkish parliament's ratification was welcomed by Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. ""Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO,"" he wrote on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.
With TÃ¼rkiye's ratification, Hungary remains the only NATO member country that hasn't approved Sweden's application to join the military alliance.
Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO after Russia launched its military campaign in Ukraine in 2022. Their accession requires the unanimous approval of all members of NATO.
TÃ¼rkiye approved Finland's NATO bid in March last year but has slow-walked Sweden's accession, demanding the Nordic country further address Ankara's security concerns.
In October last year, Erdogan signed Sweden's NATO accession protocol and submitted it to the parliament for ratification.
The foreign affairs committee of the Turkish parliament approved Sweden's NATO bid following deliberation in December last year, in a key step to put it to a full parliamentary vote.
TÃ¼rkiye has been under pressure from the United States to approve Sweden's accession to NATO, but Ankara was holding up its ratification to press Washington to allow the sale of F-16 fighter jets."

American bombers struck Houthi installations in Yemen again on Monday, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) has said. It is the second time British bombers have taken part in the operation, now dubbed 'Poseidon Archer'.
Royal Air Force (RAF) jets based in Cyprus had been involved in the January 11 attack, while the US used cruise missiles and aircraft from the carrier USS Eisenhower. Since then, the US has carried out six more strikes on its own, reportedly targeting Houthi missiles as they prepared to launch.
US and UK forces ""conducted strikes on 8 Houthi targets"" in Yemen just before midnight on Monday, CENTCOM said on X (formerly Twitter). ""The targets included missile systems and launchers, air defense systems, radars, and deeply buried weapons storage facilities.""
According to CENTCOM, the strikes were carried out ""alongside UK Armed Forces, and with the support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands.""
Although the countries named have all pledged participation in the US-led 'Operation Prosperity Guardian', aimed at ensuring the safety of international shipping, the US military insisted that the strikes were ""separate and distinct from the multinational freedom of navigation"" operation.

Earlier on Monday, CNN reported that the Pentagon has named the strike mission 'Operation Neptune Archer,' suggesting a long-term US commitment to bombing the Houthis. The Washington Post reported over the weekend that the US objective was to ""degrade and destroy their capabilities,"" citing officials who wanted to remain anonymous.
CENTCOM has accused the Houthis of ""reckless and unlawful attacks on US and UK ships as well as international commercial shipping in the Red Sea, Bab Al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden.""
The attack comes after the call between US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, in which they discussed the situation in Yemen.
The Houthis announced in late October that they would strike all Israeli-linked shipping in the Red Sea until the blockade of Gaza is lifted, and have since targeted several merchant vessels. After the January 11 strikes, they expanded the target list to British and American ships as well.
Houthi attacks have impacted the global shipping industry more than the Covid-19 pandemic, the maritime advisory firm Sea-Intelligence said last week. Roughly 15% of the world's sea trade passes through the region.
Facing the rising insurance premiums, major Western carriers such as Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM, and Hapag-Lloyd have chosen to reroute their cargoes around Africa, which takes more time and fuel.

The 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony of Ram Lalla at the historic Ram Temple in Ayodhya was held with great buzz, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi performing the rituals, led by a group of priests.
Meanwhile, a mega 'Deepotsava' was also organised at Saryu Ghat in Ayodhya, with the 'Ram Jyotis' illuminating the city and symbolising the divine presence of Ram Lalla.
It is believed that the people of Ayodhya lit up 'Diyas' and celebrated Diwali upon the return of Lord Ram, along with brother Lakshman and wife Seeta, from their 14-year-long exile.
Celebrations are being held across the nation to mark the auspicious occasion.
An 'Aarti' was performed at 'Har Ki Pauri' in Uttarakhand's Haridwar, which saw the participation of a large number of people immersed in devotion towards Ram Lalla.
Meanwhile, 'Diyas' were lit up at Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Kerala's Thiruvananthapuram, drawing parallels to the historic celebration of Diwali upon Lord Ram's return from exile.
Celebrations were also held in Bihar's Patna as people prepared colourful 'Rangolis' welcoming Ram Lalla.
The grand Ram Temple of Ayodhya will be open to public from tomorrow onwards.
The Pran Pratistha ceremony of Ram Lalla, held today in Ayodhya, is set to go down in history. The Pran Pratishtha ceremony of Lord Ram in the newly built Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya was held at 12.29 pm, led by rituals that were performed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The ceremonial journey leading up to the Pran Pratishtha included a seven-day ritual that commenced on January 16, 2024.
The ceremony was attended by representatives of all major spiritual and religious sects in the country. People from all walks of life, including representatives of various tribal communities, will also attend the ceremony.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the gathering on occasion. He congratulated the people on the Pran Prathistha ceremony in the Ayodhya temple and said Ram Lalla will not stay in a tent now.
""After centuries of unprecedented patience, countless sacrifices, renunciations and penances, our Prabhu Ram has come,"" he said.
""Ram Lalla will not stay in a tent now. He will stay in the grand temple..."" the Prime Minister added.

In the latest development, the countries attacked the rebels' infrastructure on Monday and struck eight sites, as per a joint statement from the US and UK.
The two countries conducted the strikes, and Canada, the Netherlands, Bahrain, and Australia supported the attacks, according to CNN.
Notably, the recent strikes on Houthi targets were ""successful"" and destroyed missiles, weapons storage sites and drone systems, a senior military official and a senior defence official stated.
The officials, who briefed reporters following the Monday afternoon operation, said the strikes ""achieved the desired effect.""However, the strike that was conducted on January 11 was smaller as compared to the first joint operation, which struck over 30 Houthi targets.
Reportedly, Monday's strikes targeted a Houthi underground storage site and site associates with Houthi missiles and air surveillance, the statement added, according to CNN.
The senior military official said that the US used fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as surface vessels and a submarine, to strike eight locations.
He further added that approximately 25-30 precision guided munitions were fired at the targets, including Tomahawk cruise missiles.
Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden held a conversation with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday, and they discussed several topics, including security in the Red Sea, according to the White House statement.
""Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats,"" the countries said in their statement.
Furthermore, for the first time, the US also struck an underground storage facility used by the Houthis, the official said, as reported by CNN.
The storage site was assessed to have ""more advanced conventional weaponry,"" including missiles and one-way attack drones.
Grant Shapps, the UK's secretary of state for defence, noted that four British Typhoon fighter jets took part in the strikes on Houthi targets. He warned that the ongoing Houthi launches against commercial vessels ""threaten the lives of sailors and disrupt shipping at an intolerable cost to the global economy.""Reportedly, the USS has named the ongoing operation targeting Houthi assets in Yemen as ""Operation Poseidon Archer,"" which suggests a more organised and potentially long-term approach to the operations in Yemen that have been aimed at dissuading the Iranian-backed group from attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea.
Since January 11, the US has now struck Houthi targets in Yemen eight times, the majority of which have been carried out unilaterally, as reported by CNN.
The first wave of strikes, in which the US and UK hit approximately 30 sites across Houthi-controlled Yemen, marked the beginning of Operation Poseidon Archer, according to an official.
Moreover, the officials emphasised that the latest strikes were specifically intended to target the Houthi weapons and supporting capabilities used to target international shipping lanes, describing them as similar in nature to the first round of coalition strikes against Houthi targets on January 11.
""We are not at this time expanding beyond that target set,"" the senior military official said.
According to US officials, Iran has been silently fueling the attacks, enabling and supporting its proxy groups across the region.
Moreover, Tehran has been supplying the Houthis with tactical intelligence and weapons to help them target ships in the Red Sea, as reported by CNN. (ANI)"

Visibly overcome with emotion on her visit to the shrine, the Israeli Consul General also paid a glowing tribute to the ancient Indian culture and tradition.
Sharing his sentiments on the significance of the historic site and occasion, Shoshani told ANI that he knows the story around the Ram Mandir 'quite well'.

He was also seen sprinkling flowers on the idol of Jatayu at the Ram Temple premises and also offered prayers to Lord Shiva in Ayodhya Dham.
While addressing the dignitaries invited to the Pran Pratishtha ceremony, PM Modi said the unveiling of the Ram Lalla idol is not only a moment of triumph after a prolonged struggle but also one of humility.
""This is not just a moment of celebration for us all but also one to reflect the coming of age of the Indian society. This occasion is as much about triumph as it is about humility. The world is replete with instances of countries that faced a lot of difficulties resolving historic wrongs and injustices. However, the way we untied the knots and resolved all outstanding issues gives us hope that our future is going to be more beautiful and fulfilling than our past,"" PM Modi said.
The PM said that the construction of the temple, which some feared would set off a firestorm, now stands as a symbol of peace, patience, harmony and integration.
""There was also a time when some people used to say 'Ram Mandir bana toh aag lag jaegi' (the making of the Ram Temple would set off a firestorm). Such people lacked an understanding of the purity of our society, the spirit that binds us all. This majestic abode of Shri Ram Lalla will now stand as a symbol of peace, patience, mutual harmony and social unity. The construction of this temple did not set off a fire but exuded a positive energy that has been infectious for us all,"" he added.
He added that the Ayodhya temple also testifies to a renewed national consciousness of Lord Ram and his place in our everyday lives.

In his first visit to Kyiv since being elected prime minster of Poland, Donald Tusk described Ukraine's defensive war against the Russian invasion as a ""battle"" between 'good and evil,' adding, 'Poland will do everything to increase Ukraine's chances of victory in this war.'
'The security of the Polish nation and the Polish state is also at stake in this fight,' Tusk said at a joint media briefing with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Relations between the two countries had soured in recent months because of Polish blockades against Ukrainian trucks at the border.
Polish truckers enforced the blockade from November until last week, protesting Ukrainian truckers' permit-free access into the EU.
The EU had waived the permits system after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, but Polish truckers want it reintroduced, saying their earnings have taken a hit. The truckers agreed last week to suspend their protests until March 1.
Tusk returned to Polish politics last month after serving as president of the European Council.
Tusk and Zelenskyy hailed plans for joint arms production while Zelenskyy said on X, formerly Twitter, that they had discussed a new form of cooperation aimed at larger-scale arms purchases for Ukraine. He did not provide details.
Tusk's surprise trip to Kyiv coincided with Ukraine's Unity Day, commemorating the 1919 unification of western and eastern Ukraine, which has faced numerous invasions over its long history.
Zelenskyy marked the day by signing a decree offering dual Ukrainian citizenship to ethnic Ukrainians and their descendants from all around the world, apart from Russia, as well as foreign fighters who took up arms alongside Ukrainian soldiers to defend Ukraine against the Russian invasion.
Drone attacks
Meanwhile, Ukraine's military said Monday that it had thwarted Russian drone attacks in multiple parts of the country overnight, while Russian officials accused Ukrainian forces of carrying out a ""vicious"" attack in a Russia-controlled city in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian air force said its air defenses had downed eight drones launched by Russia, including in the skies over the Mykolaiv, Kherson and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Officials said the drones had come from Russia's southern Primorsko-Akhtarsk region.
In Moscow, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused Ukraine of using indiscriminate weapons and attacking civilian infrastructure, leaving at least 27 people dead in the city of Donetsk on Sunday.
Peskov also said Monday that Russia was taking necessary measures after a suspected Ukrainian attack on a Baltic Sea fuel export terminal.
Ukraine's military remained tight-lipped about both attacks.
US defense secretary
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will attend a meeting on Ukraine's military aid virtually from his house, as the defense chief continues to recover from complications of prostate cancer treatment that led to his secret hospitalization, the Pentagon said Monday.
Tuesday's virtual conference will mark Austin's first public engagement since treatment.
The meeting comes as Republicans in Congress have blocked President Joe Biden's emergency funding request for Ukraine, seeking increased security along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said that while the United States is committed to Ukraine, lawmakers need to pass more funding for Kyiv as it battles Russian forces. 'Our partners, our allies continue to do that, despite the fact that we do not have a supplemental [funding bill] that's been passed by Congress,' Singh told reporters.
Biden has requested $61.4 billion in additional military funding for Ukraine as well as for replenishing U.S. stocks as Ukraine nears the two-year mark of its war with Russia. The funds sought for Ukraine are part of a supplemental funding request that also includes $14.3 billion for Israel and $13.6 billion for U.S. border protection.
Lavrov at the UN
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday attended a U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine in New York.
At the meeting, requested by Russia, Lavrov focused on U.S. and European arms support to Ukraine, saying the aid was dragging out the conflict. He did not address Western accusations that Moscow has been procuring drones and missiles from Iran and North Korea.
""It is cynicism of the highest order to claim that legitimate and lawful support for Ukraine's self-defense is prolonging Russia's war of aggression,"" U.S. envoy Robert Wood told the council.
More than 40 ambassadors joined Ukraine's envoy in the reading of a public statement ahead of the meeting. The statement condemned Russia's aggression and its procurement of weapons from Iran and North Korea - which is a violation of several U.N. Security Council resolutions.
""The Russian Federation's actions undermine the credibility of Security Council resolutions, undermine the global nonproliferation regime, exacerbate regional tensions and endanger us all,"" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.N. Sergiy Kyslytsya read on behalf of the group.
Asked by a reporter whether Ukraine could win the war, Kyslytsya said, ""Ukraine will win this war. But not only Ukraine, but all the democratic world.""
Next month marks two years since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

The increase comes weeks after the French government passed a controversial new immigration law.
Around 142,500 people applied in total - including 123,400 for the first time - and around a third of all requests for protection were accepted, the French Office for the Protection of Refugee and Stateless Persons (OFPRA) said in provisional figures.
Just 131,000 people applied in 2022, with a slightly lower proportion of 29 percent receiving a positive response.
""This increase is not specific to France, but comes within a European context,"" said OFPRA director Julien Boucher.
""It is much lower than the European average"" increase, he added.
In Germany, first-time asylum applications rose by more than 50 percent last year to 329,120, official figures showed earlier this month.
Asylum seekers mainly from Afghanistan
In France, the largest number of first-time applicants last year were from Afghanistan for the sixth year in a row, OFPRA figures showed, with 17,500 Afghans seeking refuge away from their war-torn country.
Other large contingents applying for protection hailed from Bangladesh, Turkey, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea.
France has a long tradition of welcoming refugees and immigrants, but a rise in the number of asylum seekers, a chronic affordable-housing shortage, and a cost-of-living crisis have worsened social tensions in the country.
Parliament last month backed a controversial new immigration law after it was hardened under pressure from the right.
Does France's hard-line immigration law breach the constitution?
A council of experts is to rule this week on whether it is in line with the constitution.

The Hamas-run Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip said in a statement that the Israeli army's besiegement has rendered the hospitals in Khan Younis completely paralyzed and hindered the movement of ambulances.
It added that Israel conducted 21 attacks against families in the Gaza Strip over the past 24 hours, resulting in 200 deaths and 370 injuries, raising the total Palestinian death toll in the Palestinian enclave since Oct. 7, 2023 to 25,900.
Meanwhile, a number of Palestinian victims were still under the rubble as ambulances and civil defense crews could not reach them, said the statement.
Currently, medical teams are working to resume partial operation of the hospitals in northern Gaza that were damaged by Israeli attacks.
Efforts were also underway, in collaboration with international organizations, to provide medical supplies and fuel to restore the operation of the hospitals in Gaza.
Medical aid has been entering the besieged enclave in limited quantities, falling far short of basic needs, while 70 percent of the aid is deemed unusable, according to the statement.
The ministry called on the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations institutions to protect local hospitals, and step up the delivery of medicines, food and fuel, among other humanitarian aid.
Khan Younis has witnessed during the past two days the intensification of Israeli attacks, the fiercest since the Hamas-Israel conflict started last October."

Notably, to enhance the operational preparedness of the Armed Forces, Defence Acquisition Council, chaired by Rajnath Singh, approved in its meetings proposals worth a total of over Rs 3.50 lakh crore.

Due to the investigation related to certain inter-segment transactions, which was launched in response to a voluntary document request by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ADM cut its 2023 profit forecast and said its fourth-quarter results will be delayed.
Amid weak demand for meat alternatives and other products, as well as production difficulties at its major soy processing facility, ADM's high-margin Nutrition segment has been under pressure.
According to the Chicago-based Center for Research in Security Prices, ADM's stock closed at US$51.69 per share, the lowest since February 2021, with the 24 percent fall being the largest one-day percentage decline since 13th November, 1929, two weeks after the 1929 market crash.
After the SEC's request, at least four brokerages downgraded ADM's stock, and the company cut its adjusted earnings forecast to $6.90 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2023 from an earlier ""excess of $7 a share.""
Goldman Sachs analyst Adam Samuelson said, ""First and foremost, understanding the true scope of potential accounting irregularities and their impact on Nutrition segment revenues/margins will be critical.""
To better shield itself from commodity price volatility, ADM, one of the world's largest grain traders and processors, has been growing its flavors and nutrition business."

The second bill would have made police officers document more of their stops.
However, city council leaders said they would override Adams' vetoes.
During a City Hall ceremony marking his vetoes, Democrat Adams said, ""We cannot handcuff the police, we want to handcuff bad people who are violent.""
In December, New York City's Democratic-controlled council passed the law banning solitary confinement, but Adams and the labor union representing the city's jail guards argued that it would make it more difficult to protect jail workers from violence by detainees.
The legislation forcing police to provide more documented details about their investigative stops was also passed last month, to ensure accountability for police stops.
""The legislation would drown officers in unnecessary paperwork, force the city to pay more in overtime, and detract from officers policing our streets and engaging with the community,"" Adams said.
In a joint statement, Adrienne Adams, speaker of the New York City Council, and Sandy Nurse, the council's criminal justice chairperson, said the council passed the bills with a ""veto-proof majority"" and would soon override the vetoes.
Two-thirds of the council's 51 elected members, or 34 votes, are required to override Adams' vetoes."

China has been dispatching medical teams to Benin since 1978. By the end of 2023, Ningxia had sent 616 medical personnel across 26 teams to the country, providing medical services to more than 3 million people.
Medical teams from Ningxia last year officially established a TCM department at a local hospital in Benin, and have been pushing forward the development of telemedicine since 2019."

A US-based Sikh activist at the center of an assassination plot foiled by the FBI last year, who is also designated a ""terrorist"" by New Delhi, has threatened to ""sabotage"" Monday's inauguration ceremony of the new Ram Temple in Ayodhya, India, CNN-News18 reported, citing officials.
In an audio clip, which RT could not verify independently, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun can be heard egging on accomplices to carry out an ""action"" at the local airport, ""where everyone will be busy heading towards Ayodhya."" Maharshi Valmiki Airport was recently inaugurated by the country's prime minister as part of an infrastructural upgrade drive in Ayodhya.
The outlet cited an official who said that ""all forces"" were ""on alert"" at the event, and that the audio clip would be shared with America and Canada as ""evidence."" Security has received a major boost in Ayodhya because of the temple dedication ceremony, as well as for upcoming Republic Day celebrations.
New York-based Pannun heads Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a group seeking to carve out Khalistan, a separate nation-state, from northern India's Punjab state. Last week, the activist dared the Indian Prime Minister to attend Friday's Republic Day celebration, which will feature French President Emmanuel Macron as chief guest, without security cover.
""If you are a popular leader, come to Delhi on Republic Day without security,"" Pannun was quoted as saying by The Indian Express, based on video footage that went viral. ""The SFJ will raise the Khalistani flag and avenge the killing of Shaheed Nijjar,"" he added, referencing the assassination last year of prominent Khalistan movement leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada.
Pannun was a target of a failed murder plot allegedly involving Indian government agents, a US court claimed in November last year. The indictment said that Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national, had tried to recruit a murder-for-hire to kill Pannun. Gupta, 52, who claims to be a businessman from New Delhi, was apprehended in the Czech Republic. Last week, the High Court in Prague approved his extradition to the US.
The case is closely linked to the assassination last June of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, also in Canada. Last September, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau triggered a massive diplomatic row when he alleged that there was an Indian hand in the killing. While New Delhi rejected Canada's claims and urged Ottawa to provide evidence to substantiate its accusation, the Indian government said it had formed a high-level committee to probe relevant aspects of the US indictment.

The root cause of the China-U.S. maritime and air security issues lies in the U.S. military's harassment and provocations on China's doorstep, engaging in prolonged, extensive and high-frequency activities in the maritime and aerial areas surrounding China, according to Wu.
""The actions taken by the Chinese military per laws and regulations are legitimate, reasonable, professional and restrained,"" Wu said.
He urged the U.S. side to stop abusing international law, cease all dangerous provocations, and strictly discipline its troops on the ground.
Also at the press conference, Wu said the two militaries are steadily restoring dialogues and consultations on the basis of equality and respect, and are maintaining communication and coordination on mechanisms such as the China-U.S. Military Maritime Consultative Agreement meetings."
PME2NVFRVV_JKTK6RLULW9B7CR,"On TikTok, 'Tim Houthi Chalamet' Sends Yemen Rebels' Message to West","Voice of America 26th January 2024, 18:36 GMT+11","Voice of America 26th January 2024, 18:36 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106954/on-tiktok-tim-houthi-chalamet-sends-yemen-rebels-message-to-west,"Sanaa, Yemen - Gazing smolderingly into the camera as he boards a hijacked ship, a young influencer is gaining attention as he promotes a controversial cause: Yemen's Houthi rebels and their attacks in the Red Sea.
Rashed Al-Haddad, 19, has become a minor celebrity for his social media posts, some set to triumphant music and showing him brandishing the red, white and black flag of Yemen, with a large ceremonial dagger thrust into his belt.
Though not a member of the Iran-backed group, the telegenic TikToker with cherubic curls, who lives in the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, has been dubbed 'Tim Houthi Chalamet' by social media users for his resemblance to Wonka star Timothee Chalamet.
'I received many offers to participate in fashion shows and advertisements, but I decided to take advantage of this fame for the Palestinian cause,' he told AFP.
Profile grows
Haddad's profile has grown alongside the rise in international attention on war-torn Yemen after Houthi attacks on shipping. The rebel group says its attacks are in protest of Israel's war against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza, and they have triggered U.S. and British strikes.
The attacks led the United States to redesignate the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization, and ships are being diverted thousands of miles around Africa, threatening to disrupt everything from car factories to natural gas deliveries.
The fresh-faced teen received millions of views for his video of a trip to the Galaxy Leader, the Israel-linked cargo ship that was captured in November and is now being paraded as a trophy of war.
He presents an alternative to the grizzled image of the Iran-backed Houthis, who seized Yemen's capital in 2014.
A Saudi-led coalition intervened the following year to prop up the internationally recognized government, plunging the country into a brutal war that has resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths.
'Millions of views'
'When I started on TikTok, I posted videos of the ship (Galaxy Leader) that was seized by the Yemenis. When I posted the video clips, they reached millions of views within four days,' he told AFP in Sanaa, wearing a combat belt with a rifle slung across his lap.
'After that, the account was banned (by TikTok) and deleted permanently,' he said.
Haddad said his Instagram account with 70,000 followers was also deleted along with his Facebook profile. Both platforms, owned by Meta, ban hate speech.
In contrast to Haddad's videos, the Houthis are often seen holding mass demonstrations where weapon-toting crowds chant: 'Death to Israel, death to America!'
'Three of my TikTok accounts were banned as well, but I have created new accounts, and thankfully, the number of followers is increasing,' Haddad said, shrugging off comparisons with Hollywood's Chalamet.
'I did not care that (social media users) compared me to this actor, but I was happy in another way,' he said. 'I was happy that I would be able to send messages to the West, because many foreigners followed me.'
Haddad also insisted that despite the focus on his looks, he remained committed to his cause.
'I'm not interested in being famous because of my handsomeness, there is definitely something more important,' he said. 'The most important thing is our basic cause, Palestine, and we are all on the side of Palestine.'"
PMUT2NIBMY_O6GYEQ06C8IP688,Capacity Planning in Operations Management: A Vital Element,"World News Wire 26th January 2024, 18:30 GMT+11","World News Wire 26th January 2024, 18:30 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106953/capacity-planning-in-operations-management-a-vital-element,"Capacity planning is a measure of an organisation's requirement for resource amounts essential to render services or generate outputs over given periods such as years, months, weeks, and days. Resource is a broad concept that may refer to physical assets like machinery, facilities, and materials, as well as human beings' labour, skills, and knowledge. Capacity planning focuses on managing the available resources, such as personnel, in a manner that ensures there is an equilibrium between the demand for and consumption of the resources.
Capacity planning in operations management involves comparing the design capabilities with the estimated demands, effective capacity and the expected results. It is a component which helps most firms in achieving their set objectives and missions within a specific timeline.
Why is Capacity Planning Important?
Capacity planning has many benefits for an organisation, such as:


Improving efficiency: Capacity management, therefore, reduces wastage, downtime, and over-production while increasing resource utility and output.


Improving quality: The capacity plan ensures that the quality standards and specifications, as well as the number of defects and errors, are minimised.


Improving customer satisfaction: It also ensures that such customer expectations and requirements are met through the delivery of the products or services at a specified time and quality level.


Improving profitability: Such capacity planning ensures a reduction in cost and increase in revenue while making an organisation more profitable and competitive.


Improving decision-making: Capacity planning ensures that relevant information and data are availed to inform the organisation's operational and strategic decisions.


How to Accomplish Capacity Planning?
To successfully achieve capacity planning, organisations need to go through the following basic steps:


Identifying the objectives: It is important first to identify the reason for conducting capacity planning and define what the organisation seeks to accomplish.


Analysing the current situation: The second stage involves examining the present capacity levels as well as determining how well it functions. The process entails determining the design capacity, effective capacity, and actual output and subsequently computing the capacity utilisation and efficiency ratios.


Estimating the future demand: This involves estimating the future demands, projecting the market and anticipating customer tastes about these products/services. Such methods include employing historical data for this purpose, trend analysis, regression analysis, and simulation models.


Evaluating the alternatives: In the fourth step, various proposals to increase or decrease the system's capacity should be evaluated against each other based on how much they would cost and what they could yield as benefits. These include demand variability, manufacturing lead times, flexibilities, scalabilities, risks, and uncertainties.


Implementing the plan: Therefore, the last stage involves implementing the selected capacity plan and monitoring its performance as well as results. It entails assigning and arranging the resources, followed by assessment of outcomes and giving feedback.


What are the Benefits of Capacity Planning?
The benefits of capacity Planning are many. Here are some of the vital perks.Â


Knowing the Capacity: Capacity planning enables in recording or measuring of design capacity, effective capacity, as well as the actual output that are taken into consideration while evaluating the current and future potential.


Reducing the Resource Costs: Capacity planning prevents overcapacity or under-utilisation of capacity that translates to wastage of resources, space, time and money. Also, it aids in effective resource allocation that minimises resource costs with the aim of making a profit for the system.


Getting Real-Time Data: Capacity planning also includes the collection and analysis of real-time data about the demand and producer of the system, thus enabling the appropriate as well as in-time changes and augmentations.


Considering Employee Skills: This aids in the consideration of staff capacities, skills, competencies as well and preferences, which assists in the allocation of tasks suitable for staff abilities and interests. This also allows for the identification and solution of any gaps or training requisites, which may contribute to high performance and satisfaction among the team members.


Ensuring Availability: Capacity planning facilitates that the system can handle the present and projected customer demands, thus averting capacity shortages and delays. Moreover, it aids in ensuring that the system delivers its output within satisfactory limits of quality and customers' expectations. This contributes towards improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.


Maximising Utilisation: By implementing capacity planning, an organisation can increase the utilisation level of its system to boost the system's productivity and efficiency. Secondly, it enables one to explore the areas where there are prospects for expansion, diversion, or innovation that may increase the growth potential of the system.


Organising Your Time: Capacity planning would help you organise your time and schedule your tasks, which would help you manage your workload and priorities. It also provides a way of making a realistic and workable plan that could also decongest a stressed-up system.Â


Calculating Accurate Workload: Capacity planning allows us to determine the actual capacity of our system and thus assess the duration and costs necessary for these assignments. The system's workload, as well as the demand, becomes balanced, thereby avoiding an overloaded or underutilised system.


How to Use Software Tools for Capacity Planning?
Software tools such as ProHance may assist companies in their capacity planning so as to schedule, allocate, and trace their resources. Software tools can offer many advantages, such as:

These can be used to automate capacity planning processes as they are very simplified, saving time and effort.
More accurate and reliable capacity planning can be achieved through the provision of current and actual information and data in a real-time manner.
These can make the visualisation and assessment, for instance, through modelling of the potential capacities planned, and also help in comparing the alternatives.
It can facilitate an interlink between capacity planning and other processes like project management, resource coordination, and budgeting, among others.
This provides them with opportunities for monitoring and controlling how the capacity plan is executed and its results, as well as measuring and evaluating results and feedback acquired.

Conclusion
Capacity planning is an important part of operations management that ensures effective use of resources for the business or project. It entails estimating the demand on a system based on its current plans through a comparison of the actual output, design capacity, and effective capacity. Capacity planning is associated with a number of advantages, including enhancing efficiency, quality, customer satisfaction, and profits, among others and better decision-making.Â Software tools, such as ProHance, a capacity planning tool, can assist in capacity planning in operations management by offering intelligent data for better decision-making in a complex, dispersed and mixed workforce. Through ProHance, it is possible to determine the time and efficiency of the workers and digital properties while managing the ratio between the supply and demand of resources. The other way ProHance helps the company is by optimising and interconnecting the teamwork and the operations. This goes hand in hand with better efficiency, quality, customer service, profitability, and improved decision-making towards achieving maximum productivity within the specified timeframe.

Recent statements from the US suggest it regards Ukraine as nothing but a ""lucrative business project,"" one that it is profiting from, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the UN Security Council on Monday.
The minister was referring to earlier statements made by US State Secretary Antony Blinken. Last month, the top US diplomat claimed that 90% of the money allocated for Ukrainian aid ends up getting funneled back to the US ""to the benefit of American business, local communities, and strengthening the US defense industrial base.""
In November 2023, the Washington Post also reported that the majority of these funds were spent on manufacturing new weapons or replacing the equipment sent to Ukraine out of American stockpiles.
The US is essentially ""developing its military industrial"" complex while ""dumping the old junk in Ukraine,"" Lavrov said. Russia's top diplomat also claimed that most major Ukrainian companies, including lithium producers, are being sold to Americans and US companies have been able to get their hands on Ukraine's fertile land ""on the cheap.""
Lavrov denounced the statements made by US officials as ""cynical"" and said that Washington has been treating the ongoing conflict ""not as a war that has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives ... but as a profitable business project.""
Moscow is waging a military campaign not against Ukraine but against ""a criminal regime, presumptuous in its impunity,"" he declared. Kiev has not forgone on the ""war against its own citizens in the east and south"" despite years-long efforts by Moscow to find a peaceful solution to this crisis, he explained, adding that over 7 million Ukrainians had found refuge in Russia since the 2014 Maidan coup.
Kiev's Western backers have never tried to stop the government from persecuting Russian-speaking Ukrainians, the minister said, accusing the US and its allies of using the past few years to ""arm Ukraine and prepare it for war against Russia,"" while using the Minsk Agreements as a cover.
Russia is ready for talks on Ukraine but it is not willing to discuss ways to keep Kiev's current government in power, Moscow's top diplomat concluded.

PNN80SSNUU_UT4OSU3JKATBN5F,Plane with Ukrainian POWs was struck by missile officials,"RT.com 26th January 2024, 07:13 GMT+11","RT.com 26th January 2024, 07:13 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106578/plane-with-ukrainian-pows-was-struck-by-missile-officials,"The Russian military has blamed Kiev for shooting down the Il-76 transport over Belgorod Region
Russian investigators have found what appear to be fragments of one or more missiles among the debris of the downed Il-76 in Belgorod Region, TASS reported on Thursday, citing a source in the emergency services.
The military plane was transporting Ukrainian prisoners of war to a scheduled exchange when it crashed on Wednesday morning. The Russian Defense Ministry said that two surface-to-air missiles were fired from Ukrainian territory and apparently struck the Il-76, leaving no survivors. The flight manifest showed six crew members, three Russian officials and 65 Ukrainian POWs were on board.
""Elements were found on the ground confirming an external impact on the aircraft,"" the agency's source said on Thursday. ""They will be sent for examination.""
Civilian, military and criminal investigators are currently combing the crash site for clues and collecting the evidence for analysis.
Initial reports in the Ukrainian media spoke of a successful downing of a Russian military plane transporting missiles. Those reports were quickly deleted when Moscow revealed the flight had carried prisoners instead.
Kiev officials have since said that they were never notified about the prisoner flight, that planes over Belgorod are a legitimate military target, and that Russia is ultimately responsible for anything that happens to the POWs anyway.
A French military source has told state broadcaster FranceInfo that the missiles that brought down the Il-76 were US-made Patriots, operated by the Ukrainian army. One of the Russian investigators on site also said the ""pattern of destruction and damage to the fuselage"" pointed to the Patriot, according to Russian reporter Alexander Kots.
The Kremlin has condemned the incident as a ""monstrous act"" by the Ukrainian government against its own citizens. Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has called for an ""international investigation"" to ""determine the hard facts"" about what happened, insisting that the plane went down in Russian territory.
France, which chairs the UN Security Council, refused Russia's request to hold an emergency session about the incident, scheduling a meeting for Thursday afternoon instead.

He said the suspects, who were transporting the drug across the border from a neighboring country, abandoned the car and fled into a nearby forest after they were spotted by provincial military police officers who patrolled the area.
""A total of 1,020 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine was seized, and we are hunting for the suspect(s),"" he told Xinhua.
Cambodia has seen a spike in the number of people arrested for drug involvement despite a drop in the amount of narcotics seized in 2023, according to an Anti-Drug Police Department (ADP)'s report.
The authorities had detained 19,940 drug-related suspects last year, up 35 percent from 14,784 a year earlier, the report said, adding that 499 of the detainees were foreigners of 17 nationalities.
A total of 2.97 tons of all kinds of illicit drugs had been confiscated from the suspects' possession during the crackdowns from January to December 2023, the report said.
The seized drugs included heroin, ecstasy, ketamine, nimetazepam, cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, methamphetamine pills, and cathinone, among others.
The Southeast Asian country has no death sentence for illicit drug traffickers. Under its law, those found guilty of trafficking more than 80 grams of illicit drugs could be imprisoned for life."

Last summer, the US and Iraq agreed to establish a higher military commission, according to the Pentagon, providing a platform for the impending talks. The focus of the discussions between the two nations will center on the next phase of the US-led anti-ISIS coalition, with the terrorist group now significantly diminished. Officials confirm that US military officials and diplomats will be actively engaged in these deliberations.
The urgency surrounding talks on the future of the US military presence in Iraq has intensified as regional instability escalates. This comes in response to recent US airstrikes inside Iraq, targeting Iran-backed militants who have been attacking US personnel in the region.
The US currently has approximately 2,500 troops in Iraq, operating in an advise and assist capacity since the US military officially concluded its combat role in December 2021. Discussions will also delve into determining the feasibility and timeline for the potential withdrawal of US forces from Iraq.
Notably, on January 10, the office of Iraq Prime Minister Mohammed Shia-al-Sudani announced plans to ""end the presence of the international coalition forces in Iraq permanently."" A US official stated, ""The HMC will be an opportunity to jointly evaluate the conditions required for the future of the D-ISIS fight in Iraq and shape the nature of the bilateral security relationship. The US will maintain its full right to self-defense during the talks.""

Q8PZCSDIZL_X7ZSKVRY754V983,Will China now play a long or short game against Taiwan?,"ANI 23rd January 2024, 14:27 GMT+11","ANI 23rd January 2024, 14:27 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103469/will-china-now-play-a-long-or-short-game-against-taiwan,"Beijing [China], January 23 (ANI): Following the Taiwanese people's refusal to buckle to Chinese coercion in the January 13 elections, voting back into power the incumbent Democratic People's Party (DPP) with its new leader Lai Ching-te, opinion varies as to what Beijing's next course of action will be.
Will China make a precipitative military move against Taiwan, or will it continue its policy of incessant coercion? China's reaction has been rather subdued so far, though this does not preclude more vigorous actions before Lai assumes office in May.
Notably, though, China hit back almost immediately by announcing on January 15 that Nauru was switching recognition from Taiwan to Beijing.
Taiwan now has diplomatic ties with just twelve nations as China picks off its allies one by one. Nauru asked for ""massive economic assistance,"" according to Taiwan, but Taipei cannot compete with China in this regard.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning denied that money exchanged hands: ""Those who see 'dollar diplomacy' as a go-to tool need to understand that there are things that money cannot buy.""One wonders what China can offer Nauru other than money. In some respects, then, it is better for Taiwan to shrug off the burden of countries who value money more than morals.
Nonetheless, this marked a setback for the USA, for President Joe Biden has been working hard to rally nations in support of a ""rules-based international order"". Nauru is a tiny nation of just 12,500 inhabitants, but China has gained a sharp win there against the wider run of play.
Wendell Minnick, a veteran American defence analyst based in Taiwan, is pessimistic about cross-strait ties. Indeed, he thinks China will act militarily this spring (i.e. March-May), catalysed by the DPP's election win.
""This could be the beginning of ballistic-missile strikes and cruise missile strikes on command-and-control nodes, radar, air defence batteries and the utter destruction of airbases. Xi is growing old quickly and wants a legacy that brings Taiwan back into the bosom of Mother China. He wants to be the Father of Modern China--to take down Mao's picture at Tiananmen Square and replace it with his own. He is a man. He is not a win-win negotiator. He wants to be beloved by the nation for the next 100 years.""Minnick added that the lunar-solar calendar is perfect for military operations around April-May, which leaves ""summer for fighter and bomber aircraft to clean up the scraps, then the amphibious invasion in the autumn with the lunar-solar calendar holiday of Ghost Month.""The latter period is when conditions in the Taiwan Strait calm again and become more conducive to amphibious operations.
However, it will be a massive challenge for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to cross this ""moat"" that separates Taiwan from the mainland.
China is encountering severe challenges that might cause Chairman Xi Jinping to take irrational actions. As tsar Vladimir Putin demonstrated with his fateful invasion of Ukraine, the twisted calculus of leaders in autocratic countries often does not correspond with logic.
Xi might calculate that his window of opportunity is narrowing, or that he needs a national crisis to bind China around him.
One disconcerting issue is China's economy, which is deeply unwell.
Last year, China's gross domestic product (GDP) fell in dollar value to about USD 17.5 trillion. This was the first drop in almost 30 years, and China's share of world GDP slipped to slightly less than 7 per cent.
In yuan terms, China's GDP rose by more than 4.5 per cent, but this ignores a sharp drop in the yuan's value.
In 2023, America's GDP rose 6 per cent to about USD 27 trillion. The gap between the respective GDPs of the USA and China grew by USD 2 trillion last year, which is set to widen unless China's economy turns a corner.
George Magnus, an economist at the China Centre, Oxford University, and at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, commented: ""Given (what) we know about population shrinkage, debt capacity constraints, weak governance and the political awkwardness of market reforms, China's tech prowess islands are not the saviour. Only a real policy shift can do that, and the government is in stasis.""He added that this year will therefore be important policy-wise. The bite of reality is a far cryfrom Xi's New Year message that the economy had ""sustained the momentum of recovery"".
Another looming issue is demographics. China's population is shrinking; the birth rate contracted 5.7 per cent last year to reach the lowest in modern China's history - and the death rate in 2023 was the highest it has been since 1974, during the throes of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.
With 280 million citizens aged over 60 (a figure that will increase 30 per cent over the next decade), China is facing a ticking demographic time bomb.
However, many would disagree with the dire warnings from the likes of Minnick in Taiwan.
For example, Professor Rex Li, Research Affiliate of the Lau China Institute, King's College London, assessed: ""Although China has not recognised the legitimacy of the Lai government, it is unlikely that it will opt for a military solution to the Taiwan issue for the time being.
Most analysts believe that China does not yet possess the full military capability to take over Taiwan by force, especially if it has the backing of the United States. In addition, China is currently facing considerable economic difficulties due mainly to the recent COVID lockdowns. Beijing is also keen to stabilise its relations with Washington following the Xi-Biden summit in San Francisco in November 2023.""Li concluded, ""It can be expected that Beijing will continue to exert economic and military pressure on Taiwan and constrain its international activities where possible. But China would try to avoid a major armed conflict with Taiwan, which might trigger an unpredictable reaction and intervention from the US.""Leading figures in the US armed forces concur with this viewpoint.
For instance, Admiral John Aquilino, head of the US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), said at a Pacific Forum conference in Hawaii in mid-January that he expected the PLA to put on a show of ""force against Taiwan in the near term"".
""The pressure campaign against Taiwan continues, and we're watching it in the wake of the elections...Their actions over the past number of years have been pretty consistent. When something occurs that they don't like, they tend to take action.""An obvious example is the PLA's reaction to then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's 2022 visit to Taiwan.
Admiral Aquilino predicted that China would also manipulate events so as to put the blame on American shoulders. He suggested Beijing would ""attempt to spin it in the information space as the United States as the aggressor. I don't know how you connect those dots, but they're pretty effective in the information space. Doesn't have to be true. They've just got to say it enough times.""The INDOPACOM commander also commented on China's increasingly aggressive actions farther south. Its ""expansive claims in the South China Sea are not just thoughts anymore. What we are seeing as it applies to Second Thomas Shoal and our Philippine partners is that the rhetoric and the actions, whether they be lawfare, information warfare or physical actions, are now enforcing or attempting to enforce that illegal claim.""Separately, General Charles Flynn, commander of the US Army Pacific, described recently at the Irregular Warfare Forum in Virginia how China is seeking to disrupt American regional influence.
""The Chinese are trying to disassemble, fragment and fracture a network of allies and partners that the United States enjoys globally, but definitely in the Indo-Pacific. And they're working every day.""The American commander said China is on a ""very, very dangerous path. The PRC's immediate goal: prepare the operational environment for the seizure of Taiwan, full stop.""If conflict erupts, it is essential that Taiwan already have in place the military equipment that it needs, for the PLA could effectively blockade the island and prevent American resupplies from reaching Taiwan.
Taiwan needs to strengthen its mobile air defences and drone fleets with much larger quantities; such asymmetric capabilities strengthen its ""porcupine strategy"" designed to deter China by imposing an unacceptable level of loss and risk on the PLA.
Taiwan is taking actions to deter China militarily, but these are often done under sufferance. This month, Taiwan's military conscription period extends from four months to twelve for 18-year-old males, after the USA pressured Taipei to raise the duration.
Conscription is deeply unpopular in Taiwan but, faced by recruitment issues, conscription is the only way to fill out the armed forces.
Bloomberg Economics, in an effort to quantify the cost of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan - came up with a figure of USD 10 trillion, equating to about 10 per cent of global GDP.
Taiwan is the leading maker of advanced-logic semiconductors, and global supply would be hard hit.
Of course, it is impossible to accurately predict the cost of a conflagration involving Taiwan.
Regardless, Bloomberg predicted a 40 per cent drop in GDP for Taiwan in the first year, -16.7 per cent for China, -6.7 per cent for the USA, and -10.2 per cent for the world.
However, military adventurism is fraught with risk for China, especially an operation as complex as an amphibious invasion. Xi still does not have confidence in the PLA, with serious question marks about the loyalty and capability of the Rocket Force in particular at present.
Of course, the loss of Taiwan to Chinese military conquest would be horrendous. Apart from the tragedy of a democracy being swallowed by an authoritarian regime, a Chinese presence on Taiwan shatters the so-called First Island Chain of containment upon which the USA's whole defensive strategy depends.
PLA forces garrisoned in Taiwan would have instant access to the Western Pacific, threatening maritime and aerial routes from the USA to Japan, South Korea and all American military bases there.
It was Sir Walter Raleigh who said, ""Whoever commands the sea, commands the trade; whosoever commands the trade of the world, commands the riches of the world, and consequently the world itself.""China would be able to control all seaborne trade heading to and from economic powerhouses like Japan and South Korea.
Taiwan already has de facto independence, but this means the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is fed up with the status quo. ""Reunification"" is a stated national goal, and it has become a point of pride for Xi.
China was visibly angered that nations like Japan and the USA should congratulate Taiwan's Lai on his recent election win, though interestingly, Biden's first comment was, ""We do not support independence.""Separate from military pressure, China has plenty of other tools at its disposal. For instance, it can economically pressure Taiwan with measures such as fining Taiwanese companies in China, cancelling tariff reductions, banning certain imports from Taiwan, or restricting individual tourism.
Xi advocated stronger United Front efforts to win Taiwanese hearts and said in an article published by the CCP's Qiushi magazine: ""The patriotic, unifying forces in Taiwan should be developed and empowered. Separatist acts for Taiwan independence should be rejected. The full reunification of the motherland should move forward.""Beijing will continue to exert undue influence, and the fact that the DPP won only 40.5 per cent of the votes (compared to 57.13 per cent in 2020) might encourage the CCP in thinking that the more amenable Kuomintang party might win the next election.
During an official visit to Egypt, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, ""Taiwan independence seriously threatens the wellbeing of Taiwan compatriots, seriously damages the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, and will also seriously undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. It is a dead end and a path to ruin. China will eventually achieve complete reunification and Taiwan province will surely return to the embrace of the motherland.""Such sweeping talk illustrates the absurdity of Taiwan's international status - it is unrecognised by the United Nations and ostracised at every opportunity by China.
China has no power or sovereignty over Taiwan's physical territory, yet it continues to force the rest of the world into maintaining a fiction about Taiwan's actual status. The CCP is imposing its will and a falsehood on the international community, with far too many being afraid to upset China. (ANI)"

QCD9XSFTHY_2DBDJKEQ3H46GA2,Ramaphosa Says South Africa 'Vindicated' in Israel Genocide Case,"Voice of America 27th January 2024, 05:35 GMT+11","Voice of America 27th January 2024, 05:35 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274107574/ramaphosa-says-south-africa-vindicated-in-israel-genocide-case,"Johannesburg - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday praised the International Court of Justice for essentially ruling that its case against Israel had merit.
South Africa is disappointed the ICJ did not order an immediate cease-fire, but the court did order Israel to take measures to avoid more deaths in Gaza and allow humanitarian access.
A significant majority of the 17 ICJ judges in The Hague ruled South Africa has a plausible case against Israel under the international Genocide Convention.
UN Court Tells Israel To Prevent Genocide in Gaza, Stops Short of Ordering Cease-Fire
However, the ruling by the top U.N. court involves provisional measures only, with a full verdict on the genocide allegation expected to take years.
The ICJ essentially ordered Israel to make every effort to avoid killing Palestinians and prevent acts of genocide, as well as to allow aid into Gaza.
Since the advent of democracy in 1994 and the presidency of the late Nelson Mandela, South Africa has been a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause.
The governing African National Congress (ANC) party, which waged an armed struggle against South Africa's former white apartheid government, has always said it sees parallels in the situation of the Palestinians.
In a televised address to the nation after the court ruling Friday, Ramaphosa said that is why South Africa took Israel to the ICJ earlier this month.
""Some have told us that we should mind our own business and not get involved in the affairs of other countries,"" Ramaphosa said. ""Others have said it was not our place. And yet it is very much our place as the people who know too well the pain of dispossession, discrimination, state-sponsored violence - we are also a people who were the victims of the crime of apartheid.""
Israel has slammed South Africa's case as ""antisemitic"" and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed the country would ""continue to defend ourselves and our citizens while adhering to international law."" He said the war would continue until ""absolute victory.""
But Ramaphosa said Israel must respect the ruling.
""This order is binding on Israel and must be respected by all states that are party to the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide,"" he said.
The United States, also a party to the convention, is one of Israel's main supporters.
After the ruling, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said, 'We continue to believe that allegations of genocide are unfounded and note the court did not make a finding about genocide or call for a cease-fire in its ruling.'
Mia Swart, a visiting international law professor at South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand, said the ruling might prove to be merely symbolic.
""The provisional measures ordered by the ICJ today certainly represent a victory of sorts for the South African Department of International Relations,"" she said. ""It also is a morale-boosting judgment for South Africa. ... However, one feels very skeptical about the possibility of implementation. It looks very unlikely that Israel will implement the judgment.""
While the order is legally binding, there is no enforcement mechanism. An ICJ ruling against Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was never adhered to.
The war between Israel and Hamas broke out after fighters for the Palestinian militant group attacked Israel on October 7. Some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped. Since Israel started bombarding the Gaza strip, some 26,000 Palestinians have been killed according to the Gaza health authority."

On his visit to the fort, the French President was accompanied by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Diya Kumari. At the fort, Macron also posed for a picture with Jaishankar and Diya Kumari.
As the French President walked around the Royal fort and took in the unique architecture, he was also given an overview of the history the fort carries. Macron appreciated Rajasthani painting and art and also interacted with artists at Amber Fort.
Macron's state visit marks France's sixth participation, the highest of any other nation, as chief guest on India's Republic Day.
Furthermore, it comes months after PM Modi's Paris trip on France's Bastille Day on July 14, last year. The French President arrived in Jaipur earlier today as part of his two-day state visit to India.
Upon his arrival at the Jaipur International Airport, he was received by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra and Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma.
Prime Minister Modi had extended an invitation to the French president to be the chief guest at Republic Day celebrations. His visit caps the 25th-anniversary celebrations of the India-France Strategic Partnership.
The pink city has been decked up with posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Macron. Later in the evening, he will visit Hawa Mahal, following which PM Modi and the French president will hold a bilateral meeting at Taj Rambagh Palace.
A French armed forces contingent is participating in the Republic Day parade and flypast alongside Indian troops and aviators. Later on January 26, President Macron will attend the Republic Day parade as the chief guest.
""He will attend the At Home reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan and, later, the State Banquet, at the invitation of the Hon'ble President of India, H.E. Smt Droupadi Murmu,"" the statement stated.
Macron is being accompanied by a ministerial delegation comprising Stephane Sejourne (Europe and Foreign Affairs), Sebastien Lecornu (Armed Forces), and Rachida Dati (culture); a C-level business delegation of French majors, SMEs and mid-caps; and other eminent personalities, including ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet.
Macron's visit will consolidate the ambitious renewal of the France-India strategic partnership that the two leaders decided on in Paris on July 14 through the ""Horizon 2047 Roadmap"". (ANI)"

QE5XFNTKW9_4A1HWWQY1QSVCRP,Chinese Music Student Faces US Trial for Allegedly Threating Activist,"Voice of America 23rd January 2024, 11:35 GMT+11","Voice of America 23rd January 2024, 11:35 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103392/chinese-music-student-faces-us-trial-for-allegedly-threating-activist,"Boston - A Chinese music student went on trial Monday on U.S. charges that he harassed an activist who posted flyers at the Berklee College of Music in Boston supporting democracy in China and threatened to report her activities to Chinese law enforcement.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Alathea Porter told a federal jury in Boston that Xiaolei Wu, 25, scared the activist, referred to only as Zooey in court, by making threats online to chop off her hands and report her to the Chinese government because of her 'reactionary posters.'
'She was afraid for herself, and she was afraid for her family, who was back in China,' Porter said in her opening statement to a 12-person jury.
The trial comes as U.S. and Western authorities continue to warn that China's government has increasingly exerted pressure to silence its critics abroad.
Human rights groups have also complained of threats to academic freedom and monitoring of Chinese students on international university campuses.
Wu was first arrested in December 2022 and has pleaded not guilty to charges of cyberstalking and interstate transmissions of threatening communication.
Porter told jurors that his threats began after Zooey, who also attended the private music college, posted a photo on Instagram of a flier she put in a window that said, 'We Want Freedom,' 'We Want Democracy' and 'Stand with Chinese People.'
Wu in response in October 2022 posted on a 300-person chat of Chinese Berklee students and alumni on the social media app WeChat a demand that she tear down the flyers and said he had called in a tip to a Chinese public security agency about her.
Porter called that a serious threat, as the Chinese government does not allow the type of expression her posters contained and worked to suppress dissent against the Chinese government.
A lawyer for Wu, Michael Tumposky, countered that Wu's comments were never meant to threaten Zooey but were made as part of an 'immature, online dispute between two young people,' who were acquainted with each other.
He said his client 'was not some agent of the Chinese government' but an 'awkward, nerdy guy' who came to Boston to learn jazz and had spoken out about Zooey's posters 'in his own misguided way to remind her of consequences of her activism.'
'He came here to learn guitar, not to shill for the Chinese Communist Party,' he said.

Peace cannot be achieved by feeding weapons into the battlefield, said Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, adding that prolonged fighting will only result in more civilian casualties.
""Diplomatic efforts must not be given up under any circumstances. We call for the prompt launch of direct engagement and the step-by-step resumption of negotiations with a view to forging consensus to end the hostilities,"" said Zhang.
He called on the international community and the United Nations to create enabling conditions to end hostilities, stressing that other relevant parties should refrain from counterproductive action or irresponsible rhetoric.
Zhang said that security is indivisible. No country should attempt to secure itself at the expense of another country's security, nor can regional security be guaranteed by muscling up or expanding a military bloc.
The envoy said that the consequences of NATO's eastward expansion indicate that seeking absolute security at the expense of other countries' security will only widen the security and trust deficit.
It would do nothing to make the world more peaceful and stable, and in this regard, NATO should do well to learn its lesson, he added.
Noting that Russia and Ukraine are neighbors who cannot escape each other, Zhang said their respective legitimate security concerns should be taken seriously.
The ultimate way out of the crisis lies in an effort on the part of Russia and Ukraine, as well as other parties concerned, to build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture guarded by the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, he said.
At a time when the Palestinian-Israeli conflict continues to drag on, and some hot-spot issues are at risk of flaring up, the world cannot afford to see geopolitical clashes further spreading, said Zhang.
Countries with significant influence should take a responsible approach and refrain from politicizing, instrumentalizing or weaponizing the world economy. Instead, countries should work together to maintain global food, energy and financial security and the stability of industrial and supply chains, Zhang added.
He noted that The Ukraine issue is where it is today due to a tangle of complex factors, which deserve serious reflection, emphasizing that complex problems may defy simple fixes.
Confronted with all these challenges, Zhang said the ultimate solution is to work harder to build a community with a shared future for humankind and shape a world with lasting peace and universal security.
Zhang said that China would continue to stand on the side of peace, justice and international security."

The purpose of the visit was stated as the rotation of personnel and replenishment, with assurance that the Chinese vessel would refrain from conducting research in Maldivian waters.
In a statement, the Maldives government stated, ""Concerning the media reports regarding the port call of the Chinese Research Vessel XIANG YANG HONG 3 at Male', theMinistry of Foreign Affairs would like to inform that a diplomatic request was made by the Government of China to the Government of Maldives, for the necessary clearances tomake a port call, for rotation of personnel and replenishment. The vessel would not be conducting any research while in the Maldivian waters.""The statement of the Maldives government comes after a Reuters report claimed that a Chinese research vessel is heading to Maldives. The timing coincides with Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu's recent state visit to China, aimed at strengthening ties.
The Maldives Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Maldives has always been a welcoming destination for vessels of ""friendly nations"" and continues to host both civilian and military vessels making port calls for peaceful purposes.
It further said, ""Such port calls not only enhance bilateral ties between the Maldives and its partner countries, but also demonstrate the centuries old tradition of the Maldivian peoplewelcoming vessels from friendly countries. The Maldives continues to uphold international best practices, and relevant international maritime law on all such cases.""This development raises concerns in New Delhi, as India has previously viewed the presence of such vessels near its shores, including in Sri Lanka in 2022, as problematic.
Relations between India and the Maldives have strained since President Muizzu took office in November, shifting the government's focus towards China and requesting the withdrawal of nearly 80 Indian troops stationed in the Maldives, according to Reuters report.
The Chinese vessel is heading to Male, according to post shared by open source intelligence researcher Damien Symon on social media platform X, the report said.
Damien Symon said Xiang Yang Hong 03 ""is entering the Indian Ocean Region, displaying its destination as Male, the vessel is expected to run an ocean survey operation in the Indian Ocean region raising concern in India"".An Indian military official has confirmed Symon's finding and said they are monitoring its movement, Reuters reported.
Previously, India flagged similar visits by other Chinese research vessels with its neighbour Sri Lanka, which has not permitted China to dock such vessels in its ports since 2022.
This comes as India and the Maldives on January 14 ""agreed to fast-track the withdrawal of Indian military personnel"" from the island nation, according to the Maldives' Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On January 14, India and the Maldives held a core group meeting. During the meeting, both sides deliberated on finding a ""mutually workable solution"" to ensure the ""continued operation"" of Indian aviation platforms providing humanitarian and Medvec services, the Ministry of External Affairs said.
The MEA announced that the next meeting will be held in the national capital. During the core group meeting, both nations delved ""on several aspects of the bilateral relationship,"" MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing on January 18 while sharing insights on the deliberations that took place in the meeting.
""We mentioned that both sides held discussions on finding a mutually workable solution to enable continued operation of Indian aviation platforms that provide humanitarian and Medvec services to the people of the Maldives,"" he also said.
""The next meeting is to be held in India to take discussions forward. So that is where the situation as far as the Maldives is concerned,"" Jaiswal added.
When asked if India received a formal request from Maldives to withdraw the Indian military, Jaiswal said, ""Whatever's discussed was put out in the press release. That is where the situation actually stands. It is an ongoing process. Both sides held discussions on finding mutually workable solutions...This is an ongoing discussion, so things will go forward or things will be discussed in the next meeting of the core group subsequently soon.""Recently, Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu and First Lady Sajidha Mohamed travelled to China for a state visit. Upon arrival at Velana International Airport, Mohamed Muizzu announced that agreements to assist the Maldives in expanding agricultural growth to cater to food security were signed with the Chinese government.
The agreements were signed following the official talks between China and Maldives during Muizzu's state visit to China, according to the statement released by Maldives President's Office. The two nations exchanged 20 key agreements at the signing ceremony. (ANI)"

Despite criticism from the U.N. regarding possible human rights violations in the operation, Sri Lankan authorities have pledged to continue their efforts.
Since the operation commenced in December, heavily armed police and military personnel, often accompanied by sniffer dogs, have conducted nighttime raids on residences and bus searches. These operations have led to the confiscation of narcotics and the arrest of various suspects, including drug users, local dealers, distributors, and individuals with prior drug-related arrests.
Acting police chief Deshabandu Tennakoon revealed that more than 40,000 people have been arrested and questioned during joint operations conducted by the police and security forces. Additionally, 5,000 individuals have been ordered detained by the courts.
Sri Lanka, with a population of 21 million, has long been recognized as a drug trafficking hub.
Tennakoon stated that approximately 65 percent of Sri Lanka's narcotics distribution network has been dismantled over the past month, and they aim to completely eradicate it by the end of this month. Intelligence operations are also underway to identify drug importers and potential drug dealers.
The U.N. human rights council expressed apprehension about unauthorized searches, arbitrary arrests, torture, and strip searches during the operations, codenamed ""yukthiya,"" or justice. ""While drug use presents a serious challenge to society, a heavy-handed law enforcement approach is not the solution. Abuse of drugs and the factors that lead to it are first and foremost public health and social issues,"" the U.N. body said.
Despite the criticism, Public Security Minister Tiran Alles affirmed that the operations would persist, urging the U.N. body to specify instances of abuse. ""We will not stop this operation. We will go ahead and we will do it the same way because we know that we are doing something good for the children of this country, for the women of this county and that is why the general public is whole-heartedly with us in these operations,"" Alles said."

While India's past is largely shadowed by British colonial history, France occupied a much smaller part of the country for many years - and traces of its presence can still be seen today.
Today known as Puducherry, the city of Pondicherry on India's south-east coast was taken by France in 1674, when the French East India Company set up a trading centre to exploit India's rich spices and other goods.
The area joined the towns of Chandernagor, Mahe, Yanam Karaikal and Masulipatam in the colony of French India.
Today's Government of Puducherry markets the city online as the ""quintessence of French culture"", ""India's Little France"" and ""the French Riviera of the East"".
The old French quarter - ""La Ville Blanche"" or ""White Town"" - has become a favourite with tourists for its colonial architecture.
Unlike elsewhere in India, where streets have been renamed and statues torn down to strip away Britain's legacy, echoes of France remain.
The town's mansions, wide boulevards and place names such as ""Rue de la Marine"" all attest to its enduring French flavour.
Some residents still chat in French, policemen wear the peaked kepi hats of the French military and street signs mimic the famous blue-and-white enamel lettering of Paris.
India's French citizens
The colony of French India was administered under a single French governor based in Pondicherry. French rule over one or more of these enclaves was more than once interrupted by the Brits.
In late 1954 - seven years after India's independence from Britain - France withdrew its forces and transferred the territories to the Republic of India, though it would take French lawmakers until 1962 to ratify a treaty making it official.
Today, in spite of the geographical distance between them, the former French districts form the ""Union Territory of Pondicherry"" - with the exception of Chandannagar, which merged with the state of West Bengal.
The Puducherry areas have a population of some 1.25 million, including about 5,000 people whose ancestors were in the service of the French government at the time of independence and chose to remain French instead of taking Indian nationality.
That choice gives their descendants the right to a French passport to this day.
Apart from a consulate, a number of French cultural and educational institutions including the Institut Francais, the Alliance Francaise and an overseas French school can be found in the town - signs of France's soft power in its former colony.

A US-based Sikh activist at the center of an assassination plot foiled by the FBI last year, who is also designated a ""terrorist"" by New Delhi, has threatened to ""sabotage"" Monday's inauguration ceremony of the new Ram Temple in Ayodhya, India, CNN-News18 reported, citing officials.
In an audio clip, which RT could not verify independently, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun can be heard egging on accomplices to carry out an ""action"" at the local airport, ""where everyone will be busy heading towards Ayodhya."" Maharshi Valmiki Airport was recently inaugurated by the country's prime minister as part of an infrastructural upgrade drive in Ayodhya.
The outlet cited an official who said that ""all forces"" were ""on alert"" at the event, and that the audio clip would be shared with America and Canada as ""evidence."" Security has received a major boost in Ayodhya because of the temple dedication ceremony, as well as for upcoming Republic Day celebrations.
New York-based Pannun heads Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a group seeking to carve out Khalistan, a separate nation-state, from northern India's Punjab state. Last week, the activist dared the Indian Prime Minister to attend Friday's Republic Day celebration, which will feature French President Emmanuel Macron as chief guest, without security cover.
""If you are a popular leader, come to Delhi on Republic Day without security,"" Pannun was quoted as saying by The Indian Express, based on video footage that went viral. ""The SFJ will raise the Khalistani flag and avenge the killing of Shaheed Nijjar,"" he added, referencing the assassination last year of prominent Khalistan movement leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada.
Pannun was a target of a failed murder plot allegedly involving Indian government agents, a US court claimed in November last year. The indictment said that Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national, had tried to recruit a murder-for-hire to kill Pannun. Gupta, 52, who claims to be a businessman from New Delhi, was apprehended in the Czech Republic. Last week, the High Court in Prague approved his extradition to the US.
The case is closely linked to the assassination last June of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, also in Canada. Last September, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau triggered a massive diplomatic row when he alleged that there was an Indian hand in the killing. While New Delhi rejected Canada's claims and urged Ottawa to provide evidence to substantiate its accusation, the Indian government said it had formed a high-level committee to probe relevant aspects of the US indictment.

The Trinamool Congress is one of the strongest partners of the INDIA bloc.
""Mamata Banerjee's decision to fight alone in West Bengal is a sign of desperation. Unable to hold her political ground, she wants to fight all seats, in the hope that she can still be relevant, after the polls,"" Malviya said in a post on 'X'.
Malviya said that the West Bengal Chief Minister wanted to be ""the face of the Opposition"" but no one had proposed her name.
""Much against her desire, to emerge as the face of the Opposition alliance, no one ever proposed her name. Her several trips to Delhi, to build a national profile, didn't work,"" Malviya said.
Hitting out at Banerjee over post-poll violence in West Bengal, Malviya said, ""She (Mamata) just couldn't hide the blood of post-poll violence and rid herself of the nauseating stink of appeasement politics.""Malviya claimed that Banerjee pitched for Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge as the Prime Minister candidate to save her face and had been building ground to come out of the alliance.
""An embarrassed Mamata, to save face, pitched for Mallikarjun Kharge, ruling herself out in the process. She realised, despite her bluster, she had no currency in the Opposition camp and had been building ground to snap out for long,"" he said.
The BJP IT cell head said that Banerjee's announcement to contest alone in West Bengal before the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra steps into the state is a ""death knell"" for the INDIA bloc.
""But the fact that her announcement to go solo comes just before Rahul Gandhi's circus arrives in Bengal, is a death knell for I.N.D.I Alliance...,"" she said.
The INDIA bloc suffered a huge setback on Wednesday as Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee said that her party declared that the Trinamool Congress would fight alone in Bengal.
""I had no discussions with the Congress party. I have always said that in Bengal, we will fight alone. I am not concerned about what will be done in the country but we are a secular party and in Bengal, we will alone defeat BJP."" the TMC supremo said.
""We will decide on what to do at the all-India level. We are a secular party. We will do whatever we can to defeat the BJP. The alliance does not comprise any one party. We have said that they should fight in some states and the regional parties should be left to fight alone in the other states. They should not interfere"" she added.
The breakdown in Trinamool and the Congress came after state unit chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury Chowdhury continued his attack on the Bengal Chief Minister. In a news conference on Tuesday Adhir Chowdhury claimed that in the 2011 elections, Mamata Banerjee came to power with the mercy of Congress.
The Trinamool Congress reportedly was willing to offer the Congress a maximum of three Lok Sabha seats of the 42 seats in Bengal. In the 2019 elections the Congress had won two Lok Sabha seats while the TMC had won 22 seats. (ANI)"

QTGJGUCHK4_6ZPT0F7W2L1YNJH,"Fewer, older, poorer: France's farming crisis in numbers","France24 25th January 2024, 09:37 GMT+11","France24 25th January 2024, 09:37 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274105556/fewer-older-poorer-frances-farming-crisis-in-numbers,"The protests sweeping across France have cast a renewed focus on the plight of farmers, a shrinking and ageing category at the mercy of volatile prices and grappling with a bleak economic outlook. FRANCE 24 talks to an economist and a unionist about the key figures behind France's farming crisis.
French farmers expanded their roadblocks on Wednesday in protest at plunging food prices, soaring costs and crippling regulations they say are killing their livelihoods.
The protests, part of a rising tide of anger among agricultural producers across the European Union, pose a major challenge to President Emmanuel Macron's government, coming just months ahead of European elections.
The turmoil has reopened a sensitive debate in France, the EU's leading agricultural producer, which has seen the number of farmers shrink from 2.5 million in the 1950s to fewer than half a million today.
An ageing population
France's farming population has not only shrunk dramatically; it is also older than ever before. According to the latest available census, farmers averaged 51.4 years of age in 2020, up from 50.2 in 2010.
Of the 496,000 farmers counted in 2020, almost 200,000 - two fifths of the total - will be eligible for retirement by 2026. Meanwhile, aspiring younger farmers are being priced out of the industry, unable to invest in land and property.
""Young people who want to go into farming have to invest hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of euros in a profession that is known to be tough, with long working hours, on-call duty, few holidays and a fluctuating income,"" says economist Alessandra Kirsch, head of studies at the French think tank Agriculture Strategies.
""The loan repayments they have to make in the first few years are too high compared to the meagre profits generated by farms,"" she explains.

Improving the sector's attractiveness is crucial to its survival, adds Yohann Barbe, a cattle farmer from eastern France who sits on the board of the FNSEA, France's main farming union.
""We need to offer people the prospect of better working conditions,"" he says. ""We're lucky enough to work in contact with nature, but we have to be able to make ends meet too.""
100,000 fewer farms in one decade
The corollary of a shrinking workforce is an almost symmetrical decline in the total number of farms, down by almost 21% between 2010 and 2020 - a loss of around 100,000 businesses in the space of a decade.
Kirsch points to major hurdles in handing over farms from one generation to another, owing to both the cost of properties and the lack of candidates.
""Not to mention the fact that the value of agricultural production decreases over time: to produce the same wealth, you need more capital and more labour,"" she adds. ""That's why you end up with bigger farms that employ more people, but earn no more.""
The latter trend explains why the actual farming area has remained largely stable between 2010 and 2020, shrinking by just 1% nationwide.
A higher risk of suicide
The hardship experienced by farmers has been blamed for a significantly higher suicide rate than the wider population.
In 2020, the rate of suicide among farmers aged 15 to 64 was 43.2% higher than the national average, according to figures compiled by the Mutuelle sociale agricole (MSA), the agricultural sector's main health insurance provider.
""It's a profession that requires a lot of work and knowledge of many fields (business, administration, agronomy), and which is constantly under fire,"" says Kirsch. ""Reconciling professional and social is not easy in such circumstances, and it's easy to lose one's footing.""
For Barbe, the cattle farmer, agricultural workers have been left behind while the rest of the professional world adapted to changing times.
""Nowadays, when we sit down for our evening meal on Sundays, I'm the only one who gets up to go look after the cows,"" he says.
Poorer and more vulnerable
Struggling to cover costs and bills, while fretting over uncertain earnings, is an all too familiar experience for most farmers.
At 17.4%, the share of farming households who live below the poverty threshold is higher than among blue-collar workers (13.9%) and clerical workers (12.1%), and almost twice as high as the national average (9.2%), according to INSEE, the national institute of statistics.
Read moreIn pictures: French farmers block roads, bridges as protests sweep country
Farmers' greater vulnerability is a consequence of their high income volatility, says Kirsch.
""Market prices can change in a matter of weeks, and a weather hazard can wipe out a harvest in a matter of hours. In other professions, you can negotiate your salary, set your selling price and make forecasts. In agriculture, you don't know what your income will be until you've harvested and sold - and it's not you who sets the price.""
Grain prices in freefall
Wild fluctuations in grain prices are indicative of the challenges farmers face.
The price of wheat slumped to â¬214 per ton in December, its lowest level in over two years and less than half its value in May 2022, according to the Euronext stock exchange.
Kirsch points to several factors behind this sharp drop, starting with the abundant Russian stocks that allow Moscow to sell its wheat at ultra-competitive prices, out-competing the French.
Adverse weather conditions have compounded French farmers' disadvantage.
""It was difficult to get tractors into flooded fields to prepare the soil and sow at the right time,"" Kirsch explains. ""We are therefore expecting a poor harvest, combined with prices that are below production costs.""

The British broadcaster interviewed the group of 5 members on Tuesday and after completing the interview as the men walked off, the Israeli army opened fire on them.
Within seconds, the man who was being interviewed was fatally hit. The shooting caused panic amongst the group, however placing the white flag on the dead man's chest they lifted him and carried him some distance away which they believed was safe.
At this point the wife of the man who had been shot arrived on the scene wailing. Panicked children could be seen as ITV continued filming when the Israeli army opened fire again on the scene. Children could be seen traumatized as they looked for somewhere to run to protect themselves. However there was nowhere.
The footage, filmed by Mohammed Abu Safia, a cameraman for ITV News, captured the moment Ramzi Abu Sahloul was fatally shot in the chest.
Before being killed Sahloul said his family had fled Gaza City when the Israeli army ordered an evacuation of the north. They arrived in Khan Younis only to be attacked again. They were planning to head to Rafah.
""Nowhere is safe in Gaza,"" an observer told ITV News just before the fatal shooting.
""Everywhere you find the Israeli Army. They shoot at us at home, in any building and in the street.""
The small group holding the white flag was standing still pleading with the Israeli army that they wanted to reach their mother and brother to get them out of harm's way.
""It's an absolutely shocking video... civilians are protected, precautions should be taken to shield them, it's not debatable the law is very clear,"" Jan England, the leader of the Norwegian Refugee Council said Wednesday.
""If it was the Israel Defence Force (IDF) you could charge commanders here, it's utterly important there will be accountability.""
Ramzi Abu Sahloul being interviewed by ITV News moments before being shot dead
Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, described the incident as ""a televised war crime.""
""What kind of justification can be found for the killing of someone waving a white flag? From that distance? What kind of danger were those people posing? They were just talking to some journalist,"" she said.
In the British parliament on Wednesday Stephen Flynn put a question to the prime minister. ""Last night, as Tory MPs were once again fighting amongst themselves, the public sat at home watching John Irvine of ITV News report on footage from Gaza of an unarmed Palestinian man walking under a white flag being shot and killed by the IDF. Prime Minister, such an act constitutes a war crime, does it not?""
""international humanitarian law should be respected, and civilians should be protected,"" Prime Minister Rishi Sunak responded.
But Flynn pushed back: ""I don't think it's unreasonable to ask the PM of the United Kingdom to rise to that dispatch box and tell the people of these isles and elsewhere, that shooting an unarmed man walking under a white flag is a war crime. Now in recent weeks this house has acted with urgency and intent following an ITV drama, the question is will this house now show the same urgency and intent following this ITV News report and finally back a ceasefire in Gaza?""
Sunak responded: ""Mr Speaker no-one wants to see this conflict go on for a moment longer than necessary, and we do want to see an immediate and sustained humanitarian pause.""
ITV News Washington Correspondent Robert Moore asked White House spokesperson Vedant Patel for the U.S.'s reaction.
He said it was down to the IDF to investigate. ""Any civilian life lost is one too many and we have made this clear with the Israelis and will continue to do so.""
""We have been clear to our Israeli partners that they need to take every possible measures to avoid civilian harm during an operation and investigate credible allegations of war violations when they arise that is for our partners in the IDF to speak to,"" the White House spokesperson said.
Pentagon spokesman Brigadier General Pat Ryder when asked, told ITV News, ""For questions about IDF operations, I would refer you to the Israeli Ministry of Defence.""
""There's no question the war between Israel and Hamas is a great tragedy. And the death of any innocent civilians in this conflict, whether they be Palestinian or Israeli, is tragic.""
""As you've heard us say, we support Israel's inherent right to defend its citizens from terrorism,"" Ryder said.
""We also expect them to conduct operations in accordance with the laws of war and to help enable the flow of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza.""
In a statement to ITV News, the Israeli army (IDF) said it was ""not aware of this incident.""
""The video is clearly edited and we have no way to comment,"" a spokesperson said.
The incident has spurred accusations of a ""war crime,"" with leading charities, including Amnesty International along with the Norwegian Refugee Council condemning it.
Sunak has been urged to support a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas but has refused to do so alongside the U.S."

The Congress Committee alleged that the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led BJP government is desperately putting everything at its disposal to stop the Yatra.
""It is regrettable, that in Assam, the Himanta Biswa Sarma-led BJP government is desperately putting everything at its disposal to stop the Yatra, ranging from tearing down of posters and banners to carrying out multiple planned attacks on the convoy, leading to many casualties among the yatris, including injuries to the Assam PCC President"", it said.
""The NPCC strongly condemns the state-sanctioned acts of violence against the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra convoy in Assam and reaffirms our full support and commitment towards the success of the Yatra,"" it added.
Earlier, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday who arrived at the Batadrava Than, the birthplace of revered Vaishnavite saint Srimanta Sankardeva, in Assam, took a veiled dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi after he was denied permission to enter the shrine.
""We want to visit the temple (Batadrava Than). What crime have I committed that I cannot visit the temple?..."" Rahul Gandhi said.
""I want to go to the temple, what is wrong with this? Earlier we were invited but now the administration is saying that we cannot go. ""Aaj sirf ek vyakti mandir mein ja sakta hain...""(Perhaps today only one person can go to the temple),"" the Congress leader said in an apparent dig at PM Modi.

The EU is considering a plan to boost military aid to Ukraine, as its proposed â¬50 billion (54 billion) package for Kiev remains blocked by Hungary, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
According to the article, the scheme would involve the creation of an EU-wide â¬20 billion fund that would be used to reimburse individual member states that provide military assistance to Kiev, including ammunition, drones, and missiles.
The WSJ reported, citing a confidential draft circulated on Friday, that the fund would absorb â¬6.5 billion in assets from the European Peace Facility (EPF), the EU's off-budget instrument which compensates its members for providing aid to Ukraine. Under the proposed initiative, the fund would receive up to â¬5 billion each year between 2024 and 2027.
All excess funds would be used to cover the costs of the EU's military training program for Kiev, the article said, adding that the bloc's officials estimate that the new mechanism could allow compensation worth some â¬7.5 billion for member states this year alone.
The WSJ warned that one key drawback of the plan is that it would need unanimous backing from EU members. However, it would allow smaller countries to pool their resources to help Ukraine as well as eliminate the need for regular tranches of aid, frequently blocked by Hungary, which has been highly critical of the EU's approach to the Ukraine conflict, the article said.
Formal discussions on the matter are expected to start as early as this week, with the plan likely to be a major item on the agenda of the EU summit on February 1.
The latest attempt by the EU to boost military aid to Kiev comes after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban last month vetoed a â¬50 billion package. Hungary is at odds with Brussels over the blocking of billions in assistance to Budapest over rule-of-law concerns.
Russia has repeatedly warned the West against sending arms to Kiev, arguing that it will only prolong the conflict and make it a direct participant in the hostilities.

""11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano case surrendered at Godhra sub-jail in Gujarat's Panchmahal district last night,"" said the officials at Central Jail, Godhra.
The development comes days after the Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the applications filed by convicts in the case seeking an extension of time to surrender before jail authorities.
The convicts were granted remission by the Gujarat government in the gangrape of Bilkis Bano and the murder of her family members during the 2002 Godhra riots.
They were sentenced to life imprisonment but released in August 2022 after serving 14 years of sentence.
On January 8, the Supreme Court struck down the Gujarat government's order granting remission to 11 convicts.
It had quashed the Gujarat government's remission order, by which convicts were released pre-maturely, and asked them to surrender before jail authorities within two weeks.
The bench had held that the Gujarat government was not competent to pass the remission orders but the Maharashtra government.
The judgement of the top court had come on a petition filed by Bilkis Bano and others challenging the premature release of 11 convicts.
Earlier, the Gujarat government, in its affidavit, defended the remission granted to convicts, saying they had completed a 14-year sentence in prison and their ""behaviour was found to be good.""In March 2002 during the post-Godhra riots, Bano was allegedly gang-raped and left to die with 14 members of her family, including her three-year-old daughter. She was five months pregnant when rioters attacked her family in Vadodara. (ANI)"

After the announcement, the total loan forgiveness approved by the Biden administration is now worth $136.6 billion for more than 3.7 million Americans.
After the Supreme Court's ruling on June 30 blocking his plan to cancel debt worth hundreds of billions of dollars, Biden pledged to continue providing student debt relief to as many borrowers as possible.
In a statement, Biden said, ""I will not back down from using every tool at our disposal to get student loan borrowers the relief they need to reach their dreams.""
The department was moving ""full speed ahead"" to deliver even greater debt relief for more borrowers and help them get on a faster track to loan forgiveness under a new SAVE repayment plan, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said.
According to the Federal Student Aid website, some 43.4 million student loan recipients had $1.63 trillion in outstanding loans as of June 2023.
The website added that the figure represents an increase of nearly $17 billion in the outstanding loan balance and almost 600,000 in the number of student loan recipients since last year."

R8GLU8JC08_1E0E6LYV4U49C8O,Is war coming to the Korean peninsula,"RT.com 23rd January 2024, 17:13 GMT+11","RT.com 23rd January 2024, 17:13 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103583/is-war-coming-to-the-korean-peninsula,"With nothing to lose and limited time to achieve certain geopolitical goals, Kim Jong-un might opt for conflict as his only option
A few days ago an analysis piece appeared on the North Korea research website 38North with the headline asking the question: ""Is Kim Jong un preparing for war?""
38North is a respected source of analysis and does not push an agenda or sensationalism. This particular piece was authored by Robert Carlin and Siegfried Hecker, who are also not known to be alarmist.
Their argument is as follows: North Korea has attempted to pursue a process of normalization with the US, particularly during the Donald Trump administration in 2018-2019, and failed after Trump walked out on the February 2019 meeting in Hanoi. After that effort failed, Pyongyang has now effectively ""given up."" It believes it has no options left, and has continued developing its nuclear program and increasingly hardening its position, emboldened by the geopolitical context in respect to Russia and China.
It might be noted early on that this assessment does not give ""hard"" evidence of North Korea pursuing such a path, and relies only on changes in Pyongyang's rhetoric to argue that the DPRK's claims are not ""bluster"" but a true reflection of its strategic position. Many things have changed since 2019 that should be taken into consideration: the Biden administration has no interest in negotiating with North Korea, a hostile Presidency has came to power in Seoul under Yoon Suk-yeol, who is pro-Japan and has abandoned the reconciliatory approach of Moon Jae-in, while the US' confrontation against both Russia and China has given the DPRK new options to try and subvert the isolation it experienced during the era of American unipolarity.
Because of this, the US has completely lost its ability to hold North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs to account, with new sanctions now being blocked at the UN by Moscow and Beijing, and existing ones not enforced. North Korea is increasingly capable of hitting the American homeland with ICBMs. This is also making unilateral, pre-emptive military action by the US against the DPRK an increasingly unrealistic prospect. But why would this enable Kim Jong-un to pursue a war of choice against South Korea and, should he start one, would he truly have a chance of winning it?
North Korea's entire diplomatic strategy from the 1950s onwards has always been to exert maximum leverage for itself as a small country, by creating crisis. This is the Juche ideology's ultimate focus on independence and sovereignty at all costs, even to its own population. To this end, the DPRK has always been provocative, whether it be killing US soldiers with axes, capturing the US spy ship USS Pueblo, shelling South Korean islands indiscriminately or even sinking a South Korean warship during an exercise. In doing so it aims to force the hands of not only its enemies but also of those who are friendly to it.
Recognizing its critical strategic position, Pyongyang has absolutely no problem dragging Moscow and Beijing into a crisis whether they like it or not, and was happy to cause significant trouble during the Sino-Soviet split. Therefore, in an era when China and Russia are both in a state of tensions -even confrontation- with the US, North Korea ultimately calculates opportunity for itself and extended leverage. Kim Jong-un will recognize that neither state in such a geopolitical situation could tolerate the fall of his regime and the reunification of the Korean peninsula on US-centric terms, which, for China, places an American military presence right next to its own border.
Indeed, even though Kim Il-sung started the Korean war in 1950 and subsequently faced defeat from the US and its allies, China still saved him - and back then it was much weaker than it is now. So, would Kim Jong-un fancy his chances in unleashing a full-scale war again on the Korean peninsula on the premise China would be forced to intervene? That isn't beyond the realm of possibility. Does Kim want the US and China to normalize and improve ties? Of course not, because it means they will cooperate against him to force him to denuclearize. As for the benefits of such a reconciliation for the global economy - why would Kim care about that when his country is impoverished and isolated from said global economy anyway?
So where does this leave the DPRK? It leaves Kim Jong-un with a window of time to achieve a series of geopolitical objectives and goals, in a context which is favorable to him, and therein raises the prospect of a serious escalation of tensions in some way. We've already seen how similar considerations led to a full-scale war, or two now, in the Middle East. We can't determine whether they will lead to the outbreak of a conflict on the Korean peninsula, but it would be foolish to rule out the possibility, given the world we live in today.
Multipolarity has arrived and it heralds the collapse of the US-centric, unipolar order which imposed stability by force as a one-way street. Many obviously assume the DPRK's Soviet-era military could be destroyed by overwhelming US and allied power in the same way Saddam Hussein's was in 1991 and 2003, but that was a different world. Here, you have a nuclear capable DPRK that has overseas backers who, while never wanting such a conflict, can't afford to see the state fail. North Korea has made attempts at peace but met with America's absolute unwillingness to compromise - therefore, what options does Kim have left to deal with South Korea?

R8K10G25ZE_RNJU42C0J5YH7UK,Netanyahu Rejects Hamas Call to End Gaza War,"Voice of America 22nd January 2024, 11:06 GMT+11","Voice of America 22nd January 2024, 11:06 GMT+11",20240122,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274102311/netanyahu-rejects-hamas-call-to-end-gaza-war,"Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a proposal Sunday by Hamas militants to end the war in Gaza that now is in its fourth month.
""In exchange for the release of our hostages,"" the Israeli leader said in a statement, ""Hamas demands the end of the war, the withdrawal of our forces from Gaza, the release of all the murderers and rapists. And leaving Hamas intact.' 'I reject outright the terms of surrender of the monsters of Hamas,' Netanyahu said.
Hamas on Sunday defended its October 7 terror attack on Israel but admitted to 'faults' and called for an end to 'Israeli aggression' in Gaza.
In its first public report on the attack that began the war, the militant group said it was a ""necessary step' against Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.
In late November, in a deal brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, more than 100 of the estimated 240 hostages who were taken captive to Gaza during the October 7 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, were freed in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.
Since that deal ended, Netanyahu has faced mounting pressure from within Israel and from some world leaders to secure the release of the 136 hostages who remain in captivity, perhaps two dozen of whom have died or been killed.
Some world leaders, but not U.S. President Joe Biden, have called for an immediate cease-fire in the fighting. About 1,200 Israelis were killed in the initial attack, and, according to Hamas health officials, more than 25,000 in Gaza during Israel's counteroffensive, including civilians and militants.
Netanyahu in recent days has also taken a strong position against Palestinian statehood to stabilize the volatile Mideast and prevent the spread of the Israel-Hamas war throughout the region. Biden and other American officials have called for Palestinian statehood.
'I will not compromise on full Israeli security control of all territory west of the Jordan River,' he said.
Biden on Friday said he spoke with Netanyahu about possible solutions for the creation of an independent Palestinian state that could include a nonmilitarized government.

Netanyahu said that he has faced down 'international and internal pressures' to change his position on Palestinian statehood.
'My insistence is what prevented for years the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have posed an existential danger to Israel,' Netanyahu said.
British Defense Secretary Grant Shapps told Sky News Sunday that it is ""disappointing"" to hear of Netanyahu's opposition to a Palestinian state at the end of the Israel-Hamas war.
""Unless you pursue a two-state solution, I really don't see that there is another solution,"" Shapps said.
Discussing his administration's position Friday, Biden said, ""There are a number of types of two-state solutions."" Asked if a two-state solution was impossible with Netanyahu in office, Biden replied, ""No, it's not.""
Biden said he had spoken with Netanyahu on Friday, the first call the White House had in nearly a month with the Israeli leader.
Netanyahu's office said, 'In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.'
Netanyahu is increasingly facing conflicting pressures at home.
A protester, wearing a shirt with an image of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu covered with a bloody hand print - stands at a rally in Tel Aviv, Israel, Jan. 20, 2024, demanding the release of hostages kidnapped on Oct. 7 by Hamas militants.
Relatives of hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza protested outside his home Saturday, demanding his government take decisive steps to secure the release of their family members. They say they fear that escalating military activity further endangers the captives' lives.
Meanwhile, a divide over the direction of the war, now in its fourth month, is growing inside the Israeli Cabinet.
Former Israeli army chief Gadi Eisenkot, a member of the War Cabinet has said a cease-fire is the only way to secure the hostages' release, a comment that implied criticism of Israel's current strategy not to let up on Israel's war on Hamas militants until their destruction.
Netanyahu also is under heat from members of his right-wing governing coalition who want an all-out war against Hamas, while the U.S., Israel's main ally, is calling for restraint in Gaza to protect civilian lives.
The Israeli leader has said he will push for ""complete victory"" against Hamas but has not outlined how he would achieve it.
Critics have accused him of preventing a Cabinet-level debate about a post-war scenario for Gaza. They say Netanyahu is stalling to prevent conflict within his coalition.
The Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday the Gaza death toll is at 25,102, with about 70% of the victims being women and children. Health officials said 62,681 people have been wounded.
In the past 24 hours, the ministry said 178 Palestinians have been killed and 293 injured.

He had also sought subsequent 3 weeks' interim bail for rituals and conjugal rights. He is one of the accused of murdering rival gang leader Tillu Tajpuria in the Tihar Jail in May last year.
He is also accused in other cases including one case under MCOCA.
While dismissing the plea, Special Judge (MCOCA) Chander jit Singh held that the right to procreation is not absolute and necessitates a contractual examination. It is also held that it is not an irrefutable right.
The court also considered the previous conduct of the accused and the status report filed by Delhi Police.
The court noted that the previous conduct of the accused regarding the forging of documents for getting bail has also been reported.
""The report also states that the accused had committed the crime while being in custody.Therefore, in view of the above discussion, the application seeking custody bail andconsequent interim bail is dismissed,"" the court said in the order dated January 22, 2024.
It was further reported that earlier another bail application was filed by forging a Covid-positive certificate claiming that the father of the accused had caught Covid.
Delhi police filed a status report and stated that this crime syndicate has 60 cases against it. The members of this organized Crime Syndicate had a record of escaping from police custody.
""Accused is one of the assailants who had committed a murder in jail as well. That there is a strong apprehension that accused can jump the bail if this application is accepted,"" Delhi police said.
It was submitted by Advocates Virender Mual and Abhishek Thakur counsel for accused Yogesh that the effect of fixing the marriage has been verified which is reflected in the report. It was also submitted that custody parole for six hours is granted and after that, interim bail for whatever period the court finds fit may be granted.
On the other hand, while opposing the plea, the Prosecution submitted that there is a strong apprehension that the accused shall flee from the process of law.
It was submitted that earlier also an attempt was made to procure interim bail by forging documents. The present application seems another attempt in a similar vein by the accused. The application should be dismissed, argued the Prosecution and the Prosecution submitted.
The special judge (MCOCA) said in the order that the accused was arrested in this case on August 4, 2018. It has further been reported that the mother of the girl had stated that she was told about a week ago about the proposed marriage of Yogesh and her daughter.
""It implies that this marriage has been fixed while the accused is in custody and was not fixed before his being in custody,"" the court said.
It further said that the court is mindful of the order of the Delhi High Court in Kundan Singh v State wherein, the Delhi HC adjudicated upon the aspect of the convict having a right to procreate.
""The said case is distinguishable from the contention raised in the present application. Firstly, the applicant in the said case was convicted whereas, the applicant in the present case is an under-trial,"" the Court observed. (ANI)"

Ottawa is investigating India as part of a probe into suspected ""foreign interference"" in the 2019 and 2021 national elections. The development comes against the backdrop of a diplomatic row between the two countries after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged that ""Indian agents"" could be involved in the assassination of a Sikh activist on Canadian soil last year.
An independent commission, which was set up by Trudeau in September last year amid reports of alleged Chinese election meddling, has now asked the government to ""share information about possible meddling"" by India.
The probe also named China and Russia, among others. In its statement, the Canadian commission vowed to ""evaluate the actions taken in response, assess the federal government's capacity to detect, deter, and counter foreign interference, and make recommendations on these issues.""
Trudeau launched the investigation after leaked intelligence documents seemed to suggest that China interfered on behalf of candidates who were friendly towards President Xi Jinping's government. Beijing has denied any interference and called the allegations ""purely baseless and defamatory.""
Last year, an independent review by Canadian officials claimed that foreign nations attempted to interfere in the previous two federal elections, but they did not succeed in ""impacting"" the results. It singled out China, Russia, and Iran as having ""interfered"" in the votes. Canada's commission, led by Judge Marie-Josee Hogue, is expected to deliver its final report on the matter by the end of the year.
Indian-Canadian relations took a dramatic hit last year following Trudeau's accusation of ""potential"" Indian involvement in the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader designated as a ""terrorist"" by New Delhi. Nijjar, as well as his supporters, had sought the creation of Khalistan, a nation-state for the Sikh minority in India to be carved out of the country's northwestern state of Punjab.
India has repeatedly expressed its concerns to Canada, which is home to the largest Sikh diaspora in the world, over harboring ""extremist"" elements on its soil.
Trudeau has insisted on probing the alleged link despite New Delhi's repeated assertions that it was not involved. The Indian ambassador to Ottawa has stressed that New Delhi would help in the investigation ""if there is anything specific and relevant and communicated to us.""
In the early days of the row, both countries expelled each other's diplomats and India briefly stopped issuing visas for Canadians citing security threats. A free trade agreement between the two countries which was close to being sealed has also been put on the back burner, and the number of Indian students going to Canada for higher education has sharply decreased since the row broke out.
The US has also charged India in a foiled assassination attempt involving another pro-Khalistan activist - New York-based lawyer Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. A US court claimed in November last year that an Indian government official orchestrated the murder plot and New Delhi businessman Nikhil Gupta tried to recruit a hitman to kill Pannun, who is also designated as a ""terrorist"" by India. Gupta was apprehended in the Czech Republic and a High Court in Prague last week approved his extradition to the US. Meanwhile, India has formed a high-level committee to probe aspects of the US case.

RIQQ5B2LUT_GL2ED7VXSI3IVS3,Green Energy Expected to Cover Growth in Demand for Electricity,"Voice of America 24th January 2024, 20:06 GMT+11","Voice of America 24th January 2024, 20:06 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274104757/green-energy-expected-to-cover-growth-in-demand-for-electricity,"Paris - Power generated from low-emissions sources, such as wind, solar and nuclear, will be adequate to meet growth in global demand for the next three years, the International Energy Agency said, adding that emissions from the power sector are on the decline.
Following record growth, electricity generation from low-emissions sources will account for almost half of the world's power by 2026, up from less than 40% in 2023, the IEA said in report on Wednesday.
Renewables are expected to overtake coal by early 2025, accounting for more than a third of total electricity generation, the report said.
Nuclear power is also forecast to reach a record globally as French output continues to recover from lows in 2022, several plants in Japan come back online and new reactors begin operations in markets including China, India, Korea and Europe.
Electricity demand is expected to rise on average by 3.4% from 2024 through 2026 with about 85% of demand growth seen coming from China, India and southeast Asia, after growth eased slightly to 2.2% in 2023, IEA data showed.
Over this period, China is expected to account for the largest share of the global increase in electricity demand in terms of volume, despite a forecast for slower economic growth and a lower reliance on heavy industry, the report said.
Meanwhile, global emissions are expected to decrease by 2.4% in 2024, followed by smaller declines in 2025 and 2026, the report said.
'The decoupling of global electricity demand and emissions would be significant given the energy sector's increasing electrification, with more consumers using technologies such as electric vehicles and heat pumps,' the report said.
Electricity accounted for 2% more of final energy consumption in 2023 from 2015 levels, though reaching climate goals would require electrification to advance significantly faster in coming years, the IEA said.

A German air force plane carrying Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has been denied permission to fly over Eritrea due to a lack of government authorization in the East African country.
The diplomat, who left Berlin on Wednesday for a tour of three African nations, was en route to Djibouti for the first leg of her trip but was forced to make an unplanned stopover in Saudi Arabia after being refused entry to Eritrean airspace.
According to the German Press Agency (dpa), Baerbock's Airbus A321LR aircraft landed in the Saudi port city of Jeddah after spending more than an hour circling over the Red Sea.
""When things happen that are not actually planned, you have to be flexible,"" the diplomat told reporters, claiming that the situation reflects the overall instability in the region, where armed conflicts persist in Sudan and Yemen.
Baerbock's East African tour will also take her to Kenya and South Sudan. She intends to hold talks on potential ways to bring the warring factions in Sudan, where hostilities have raged since April of last year, to a ceasefire agreement.
""In Djibouti, one topic of my meetings will be how we can protect international shipping in the Red Sea from the Houthis' attacks. Djibouti lies in direct proximity to Yemen, and the two countries have traditionally enjoyed close relations,"" the minister said in a statement prior to her departure.
It is not the first time the German diplomat has been delayed on a foreign trip due to a flight problem. Baerbock's week-long visit to the Indo-Pacific region in August was canceled after she was forced to land in Abu Dhabi due to mechanical issues with her Airbus A340 aircraft.
Apart from the lack of Eritrean authorization, Baerbock's three-nation East African tour had already been hampered by mechanical issues. She had to travel on an air force plane due to engine trouble on her official aircraft, according to German media.
The military plane's captain told the dpa that it was impossible to obtain overflight permission from the Eritrean Foreign Ministry ""despite all our efforts.""
Eritrean authorities have previously accused Berlin of meddling in regional affairs after the African country's human rights record was criticized in the German parliament in 2018. Then German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas had claimed Eritrea had made little progress in improving citizens' rights following a peace agreement with neighboring Ethiopia to end a two-decade conflict.

RLU6Q7KLPU_3IYB41N6EVNWORB,Nine US Governors Call for Action on Immigration Reform,"Voice of America 24th January 2024, 11:05 GMT+11","Voice of America 24th January 2024, 11:05 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274104448/nine-us-governors-call-for-action-on-immigration-reform,"As the U.S. Congress struggles to agree on a package of immigration reform measures, the Democratic governors of nine states have added their voices to the call for action.
In a letter directed to President Joe Biden and both Republican and Democratic congressional leaders, the governors said decisive action is needed to support states that are increasingly unable to cope with the volume of immigrants they have been receiving in recent months.
The letter demands the leaders make 'a serious commitment' to improving a national immigration system that is 'outdated and unprepared to respond' to a recent surge in migrants across the southern border.
The list of governors calling for assistance includes the leaders of Arizona, California and New Mexico - three states directly on the southern border. Their letter echoes the complaints of leaders in Republican-led Texas, which has a longer border with Mexico than the rest of the border states combined, and has been demanding increased federal assistance for years.
However, several of the governors who signed the letter are from states far from the southern border, including Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey and New York, signaling that the stress of increased levels of immigration is being felt nationwide.
Record number of arrivals
Record numbers of migrants have been attempting to cross the border in recent months, with as many as 300,000 making the journey in December alone. Of those crossing, the overwhelming majority are doing so outside of designated entry points, hoping either to enter the country undetected or to claim asylum immediately on apprehension.
Because U.S. law allows individuals who make asylum claims to have their eligibility assessed before they are turned back, many thousands of these migrants are released into the country on 'parole,' sometimes with instructions to show up for immigration court hearings scheduled years later.
This leaves migrants to seek food and shelter in communities throughout the United States. While many remain near the border, thousands fan out into the interior of the country, often assisted by Republican leaders who have begun to charter buses and airplanes to deliver homeless migrants to cities in states seen as Democratic strongholds.
Humanitarian crisis
In their letter, the governors said the scope of the current problem must be met with a concerted federal response.
'The sustained arrival of individuals seeking asylum and requiring shelter and assistance, due to lack of Congressional action on infrastructure and policies, can only be addressed with federal organizational support and funding to meet the public safety and humanitarian needs of our local communities,' they wrote.
'States and cities cannot indefinitely respond to the subsequent strain on state and local resources without congressional action,' they said. 'Communities along the southern border - as well as interior states and cities across the country - lack the vast coordinated infrastructure needed to respond to the humanitarian and public safety concerns of those seeking lawful entry into the United States.'
New York in focus
New York Governor Kathy Hochul took the lead in organizing the letter. Her state, and New York City in particular, has been the target destination of thousands of migrants and has been increasingly struggling with the burden.
New York City Mayor Eric Adams has in recent months instituted rules limiting the time and place where buses carrying migrants are allowed to discharge their passengers, in order to organize support services and to prevent migrants from being left stranded with no resources in the middle of winter.
Mario Russell, executive director of the Center for Migration Studies, a New York-based think tank, told VOA that the state has been experiencing a 'significant and impactful number of migrants and asylum-seekers coming to its communities - to New York City and throughout the state - so, this is something that the governor, obviously, is having to respond to.'
Russell, who has worked in immigration policy for 25 years, said the people currently arriving in the city typically have the same limited resources as refugees from natural disasters or war.
When they arrive, 'They are being put into a system that is old, frail, degraded and under-resourced,' he said.
Global problem
In the United States, migration over the southern border has historically been driven by people in Mexico and Central America seeking opportunity in the north. However, in their letter, the governors note that the current surge in migration is a global phenomenon being driven not just by poverty and repression in the Americas, but by events thousands of miles away, including the war in Ukraine, strife in Africa and turmoil in the MIddle East.
In a recent study, the Migration Policy Institute confirmed that the basic contours of migration to the U.S. have changed in recent years.
'Heightened levels of spontaneous migration have become a new norm across the Western Hemisphere, reflecting growing displacement that is fueled by political instability, violence, slow post-COVID-19 economic recovery, human rights abuses, poverty, and climate events,' the report found.
Unprecedented stress
'Due to increased unprecedented refugee flows globally, we are at an all-time high of forced migration - as measured by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees - as we have ever seen in the history of recorded refugee flows,' Greg Chen, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told VOA. 'Well over 100 million people are currently displaced.'
Chen continued, 'What that means is that Congress and the administration urgently need to ensure that there is a more orderly and efficient process for managing the border, and also a system that can rapidly and fairly review requests by migrants to get protection when they arrive at the border.
'For those that are eligible for asylum, they should be given protection to be able to stay here, quickly. And for those who are not eligible for protection, there should be a process that is safe and humane, that returns them to their home country,' he said.
Congressional progress in question
In Congress, the stakes of the immigration reform debate are extremely high because Republicans have insisted that aid packages worth tens of billions of dollars for Ukraine and Israel will not move forward without progress on the border.
There appears to be a bipartisan effort underway in the Senate to craft a wide-ranging immigration bill that would provide new resources to help federal officials cope with the inflow of migrants. Reports indicate that Democrats are also willing to accept a bill that makes it easier for the government to deport individuals who do not have valid asylum claims.
While senior Republican senators have urged their fellow party members to support the effort, it is unclear whether a bill that clears the Senate would survive the House of Representatives. In the House, a small but powerful minority of Republican lawmakers are opposed to additional funding for Ukraine and have indicated that they do not want to give Biden a 'win' by passing immigration reform legislation during a presidential election year."

This occasion is as much about triumph as it is about humility. The world is replete with instances of countries that faced a lot of difficulties resolving historic wrongs and injustices.

""There was also a time when some people used to say 'Ram Mandir bana toh aag lag jaegi' (the making of the Ram Temple would set off a firestorm). Such people lacked an understanding of the purity of our society, the spirit that binds us all. This majestic abode of Shri Ram Lalla will now stand as a symbol of peace, patience, mutual harmony and social unity. The construction of this temple did not set off a fire but exuded a positive energy that has been infectious for us all,"" he added.
He added that the Ayodhya temple also testifies to a renewed national consciousness of Lord Ram and his place in our everyday lives.

""We can imagine what would have been the situation if 3000 people and 200 vehicles had entered Guwahati.

Justice Subramonium Prasad issued notice to the Central Government and others and directed them to file a reply.
The matter has been listed on March 7 for further hearing.
The high court noted the submissions of the petitioner, DIAL, that permitting regular commercial operations at Hindon Air Force Station will affect the petitioner.
The petitioner DIAL moved a petition through Advocate Milanka Chaudhary, challenging a decision of October 31 last year of the Ministry of Civil Aviation to allow the Airports Authority of India to commence scheduled commercial flight operations at the Indian Air Force Station situated in Hindon, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.
DIAL has also challenged the note on April 17 last year, wherein the Airport Authority of India (AAI) has proposed the cancellation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated November 10, 2017 entered into between the petitioner, Ministry and Authority, wherein the petitioner consented to use of the Hindon Airforce Station for the limited purpose and limited time of operating certain specific flights falling under the Regional Air Connectivity Scheme ('RCS') only as an interim and stopgap arrangement while the upgradation at IGIA was underway.
The petitioner also sought quashing of the communication dated October 31, last year, issued by Authority inviting various airline operators to increase flight operations and file their respective flight schedule for availing slots at the Hindon Air Force Station.
The plea stated that the said decision, proposal, and communication essentially amount to the establishment of a greenfield airport at Hindon Air Force Station, which is defined in the 350th Report of the Department-Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism, and Culture, titled 'Development of Greenfield and Brownfield Airports and Issues pertaining to Civil Enclaves in Defence Airports' (July 2023).
Senior advocate Arvind Nigam argued that Hindon Air Force Station is not a green field airport.
""A Greenfield airport is conventionally referred to as an aviation facility being developed on empty land or previously undeveloped land and an airport whose commissioning, planning, and construction process is carried out from the scratch or grass route level,"" the plea stated.
Senior advocate Nigam also argued that said decision, proposal, and communication are against the Ministry's own consistent policies, starting with the Policy on Airport Infrastructure, 1997, which mandates that ""no greenfield airport will normally be allowed within an aerial distance of 150 kilometers of an existing airport.
He submitted that Hindon Air Force Station is within this limit.
The aforesaid 1997 policy of respondent no. 1 to not permit a new airport within an aerial distance of 150 kilometres of an existing airport has been consistently adhered to by respondent no. 1 in its subsequent policies, viz. the Greenfield Airports Policy, 2008, and the National Civil Aviation Policy, 2016 ('NCAP'), the plea stated.
It is also submitted that where it is allowed as a second airport in the same city or close vicinity, the parameters for the distribution of traffic between the two airports will be clearly spelt out."".
Further, the 1997 Policy also lays down the circumstances under which a greenfield airport will be allowed to develop, i.e. ""A greenfield airport may be permitted where an existing airport is unable to meet the projected requirements of traffic or a new focal point of traffic emerges with sufficient viability, it stated.
It can be allowed both as a replacement for an existing airport or for simultaneous operation. This aspect will have to be clearly spelt out in the notice inviting tenders, the plea stated. (ANI)"

""Everyone on board died,"" the Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on social media. The Russian army earlier said 65 Ukrainian captive soldiers were onboard.
Unverified videos on social media showed a large plane, purportedly in the Belgorod region, falling from the sky on its side before crashing in a fireball.
""At around 11 am Moscow time (0800 GMT), an IL-76 aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region during a routine flight,"" Moscow's defence ministry told Russian news agencies.
""On board were 65 captured Ukrainian army servicemen being transported to the Belgorod region for exchange, six crew members and three escorts,"" it said.
AFP was not able to immediately verify Russia's claims.
Vyacheslav Volodin, the top lawmaker in Russia's lower house of parliament, said the plane had been ""shot down"" by Kyiv and blamed Western missiles.
""They shot their own soldiers in the air. Their own,"" Volodin told lawmakers in a plenary session. ""Our pilots, who were carrying out a humanitarian mission, were shot down.""
The crash occurred in the Korochansky district, northeast of the region's capital, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram.
""Now an investigation team and emergency services are working on the site. I have changed my working schedule and travelled to the district,"" Gladkov said.
Gladkov had earlier announced a missile alert over the region, but it was not clear if the two events were connected.
In Kyiv, local media initially cited sources in the Ukrainian military as saying that its army downed the plane, and that it was transporting missiles.
But that claim was later retracted.
The issue of prisoners of war is sensitive in both countries.
In 2022, Russia and Ukraine accused each other of carrying out deadly bombardments on a jail holding dozens of captured Ukrainian servicemen in Kremlin-controlled Olenivka, in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region.
Both Moscow and Kyiv blamed each other for the incident, which President Volodymyr Zelensky called a ""Russian war crime"".
Strikes on Ukraine
Moscow and Kyiv have also recently accused each other of a sharp escalation in attacks on civilian areas over the past two months.
Russian strikes wounded nine people in the eastern Ukrainian region of Kharkiv, the region's governor said Wednesday.
Regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said Moscow's forces had fired S-300 surface-to-air missiles at the city, which lies next to Ukraine's border with Russia.
Russian forces had aimed to wrest control of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, early in their invasion, launched in February 2022.
But Ukrainian forces pushed back Moscow's army, which has been routinely shelling the city since.
Separately, the governor of the southern Kherson region said Russian forces had killed a total of five residents of his region over the course of the day before.
Six more people were wounded across the region, which the Kremlin claims is part of Russia, the governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, said on social media.
Both Russian and Ukraine have stepped up strikes on each others' cities and critical infrastructure.
Kyiv has urged its allies to help bolster its air defence systems to ward off Russian attacks.

The Minister stressed that the Global South, with its youthful demography and rapidly growing economies, holds the key to the world's future prosperity.

Lenin's cats & dogs
Lenin had a number of pets during his lifetime, both cats and dogs. Nothing is known about most of them, but a couple of pets did go down in history. Because of his passion for hunting, Lenin took in a red setter named Zhenka when it was a puppy. The revolutionary leader even sent off for a special instruction manual on the proper rearing of dogs and personally trained the puppy.
In the 1920s, when Lenin was already ill, he spent a lot of time with animals - he found them a help in relieving stress. The photo shows Lenin in 1922 at his estate in Gorki with a dog named Ayda.

Sputnik Joseph Stalin's dogs, squirrels & bears
It is known that Stalin also liked dogs. There is a popular tale about how, in exile in Siberia along with Yakov Sverdlov, Stalin befriended a dog and named it Yashka (and Sverdlov was not happy about it, 'Yashka' being an informal diminutive of 'Yakov'). Stalin let the dog lick his plate clean after meals.
Many animals were given to Stalin as gifts. For example, after the war, Nikita Khrushchev gave the Great Leader a squirrel and, subsequently, Stalin began breeding squirrels at his Blizhnyaya Dacha residence on the outskirts of Moscow and was said to have personally fed them nuts.
There is also a legend that a bear lived at Stalin's dacha - apparently a lost bear cub brought to the dacha by Stalin's guards (according to another account, it was a gift presented to Stalin that ended up being passed to the guards). Stalin came to look at it several times, but then forgot all about it, but they hesitated taking it to a zoo. The bear lived another few years in a special pen, until the Great Leader was reminded of it - and was greatly surprised. By all accounts, the animal, now fully grown, had to be sent to a zoo, after all.

On Stalin's birthday in 1949, the Queen of the Netherlands (another version of the story says it was a Belgian farmer or miner) presented Stalin with a red cocker spaniel called Milka. The Great Leader gave the dog to his son Vasily, a keen hunter. Milka has since been taxidermied and is on display at Moscow's State Darwin Museum.
Nikita Khrushchev's various dogs
It's claimed that Nikita Khrushchev was the first owner of a chihuahua in the USSR. Cuban leader Fidel Castro presented him with two small chihuahua puppies, after which dogs of this breed started appearing all over the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev also set a trend for another breed - the English poodle. He was given a snow-white specimen by none other than the Queen Elizabeth II.
In retirement, Khrushchev kept his cherished shepherd dog named Arbat at his dacha.

After his favorite pet died, the former general secretary got himself a mongrel and named it Belka (like the space dog). When his children asked him to get a pedigree dog, he refused, saying: ""Mongrels are cleverer, more loyal and less demanding. What need do I have of a dimwit dog with a fancy lineage?""
Brezhnev's clairvoyant cat
During an official visit to India in 1969, Brezhnev met the Tibetan Dalai Lama. The latter presented the Soviet general secretary with a black cat and told him that if it ever started behaving strangely, it meant that Brezhnev was in danger. Numerous legends, subsequently, circulated about the pet cat, which was named Lama, and how it allegedly ""saved"" its master's life three times.
On each occasion, just as Brezhnev was about to go out, the feline scratched at the door and jumped on his chest or tugged at his trousers with its teeth. Each time, Brezhnev, remembering the prophecy, made small adjustments to his plans or canceled them altogether - and three times he evaded disaster: two assassination attempts and also a bad accident.
Once, Brezhnev failed to heed the cat's ""advice"" and went out as normal, but it ran out and hurled itself under the wheels of a vehicle. According to legend, after this, the general secretary's health started to drastically deteriorate.
It might be added that, in the 1970s, U.S. President Jimmy Carter presented Brezhev with a Labrador dog. The general secretary named it Druzhok, but, according to various accounts, they didn't particularly take to each other.

""Congress treated Jagadish Shettar very well and gave him a suitable position while he was humiliated by BJP. We gave him the assembly ticket. Congress has given him a lot of respect by making him MLC for his success,"" said Siddaramaiah.
""No injustice has been done to Jagadish Shettar in the Congress party and neither was he disrespected. It was the BJP that insulted him by not giving him a ticket. Although we gave him the ticket, he lost the assembly election. We made him an MLC and treated him with respect. I don't know about his rejoining the BJP. He told me that I have been humiliated in BJP and will not go back again,"" he added.
Former Karnataka Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar, who had joined the Congress ahead of the 2023 legislative elections last year, returned to the BJP on Thursday.
""Today is a day of great happiness for us as Jagadish Shettar is making a return to BJP. We all welcome him,"" said Anil Baluni, a Rajya Sabha member and the national chief spokesperson of the BJP.
Shettar rejoined the BJP in the national capital in the presence of former Karnakata chief minister BS Yediyurappa, Union Minister Bhupender Singh Yadav, Karnataka BJP president Vijayendra Yediyurappa, Union Minister of State Rajeev Chandrasekhar.
After getting inducted into the BJP once again, Shettar said, ""The party gave me a lot of responsibilities in the past. Due to some issues, I went to the Congress party. In the last eight to nine months, there were a lot of discussions, also BJP workers asked me to come back to the BJP.""""Yediyurappa ji and Vijayendra ji also wanted me to come back to the BJP. I am rejoining the party with the belief that Narendra Modi ji has to become the PM again,"" he said.
Earlier in the day, Shettar met with Union Home Minister Amit Shah at BJP headquarters in Delhi.
There had been ongoing speculation about Shettar's return to the BJP for the past few days, to which the Congress leaders in Karnataka had responded by saying that the BJP's leadership crisis in the state prompted the party to head towards Shettar.
Shettar had quit BJP and joined Congress in April 2023, ahead of the Karnataka assembly elections.
During that time Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said, ""Though he was in RSS and Jana Sangha, he's a non-controversial person. We have worked together.""Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had mentioned that BJP president JP Nadda and Union Home Minister Amit Shah had promised Shettar a big post in Delhi.
""Jagadish Shettar has been a senior and an important leader in this region. JP Nadda and Union Home Minister had promised a big post in Delhi to Shettar. Everything would have been fine if the former CM had continued,"" Bommai told media persons in Hubballi.
Shettar, a six-time MLA from the constituency, was reportedly advised by the party to stand down and not seek a fresh term as MLA from the Hubli-Dharwad Central segment, following which his followers expressed their anguish against the party's high command.
After announcing his resignation from BJP, Jagadish Shettar also mentioned that there was a conspiracy against him, which is why he was denied a ticket. ""There is a conspiracy against me, will tell everything after resigning,"" Shettar told ANI.
However, former Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa had said that if Shettar comes back to BJP, the party would welcome him. (ANI)"

Jean Carroll defamation trial at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, local media reported.
Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, testified for less than five minutes and was cut off by Judge Lewis Kaplan.
Trump said Carroll's accusations were false though he was not allowed to testify that he didn't assault Caroll.
The jury in the current trial has been shown threats of murder and rape that Carroll has received since 2019 when she went public with her story through emails, texts and tweets, reported CBS News on Thursday.
Carroll, an American writer and former magazine columnist, accused Trump of raping her in the mid-1990s at a department store dressing room in Manhattan, New York City, and of later defaming her by denying her claims.
The trial is tasked to determine if Trump owns any more for defaming Caroll as another trial found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation with 5 million U.S. dollars in damages awarded to Caroll in May 2023.
The trial will continue on Friday for closing arguments and Trump is expected to return to the court then, according to media reports."

The Southern Ocean controls the uptake of human-generated heat and carbon into the ocean and helps keep Earth habitable. It also influences global ocean circulation and climate, and contributes to melting of the Antarctic ice sheet - the greatest uncertainty in projecting future sea level rise."

The Joint Chiefs of Staff in South Korea reported the missile launch, emphasizing that the details are under close analysis by intelligence authorities in both South Korea and the United States.
The capital, Pyongyang, already under strict United Nations sanctions due to its nuclear weapons program, has continued its series of weapons tests in recent months. These tests have included a solid-fueled hypersonic ballistic missile and the unveiling of a purportedly nuclear-capable underwater attack drone. While cruise missile tests are not explicitly prohibited by UN sanctions, they contribute to escalating tensions in the region.
Cruise missiles, propelled by jet engines and flying at lower altitudes compared to ballistic missiles, present a unique challenge. Their ability to evade radar detection heightens concerns for neighboring countries like South Korea and Japan. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff mentioned ongoing monitoring of North Korea for any further activities, as cruise missiles, though not subject to UN sanctions, could impact regional stability.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have been on the rise, with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un accelerating weapons development and issuing provocative threats of nuclear conflict with the United States and its allies. In response, Japan, South Korea, and the US have expanded joint military exercises, further intensifying the situation. The South Korean Navy's special warfare unit recently participated in a 10-day training near the border with North Korea, aimed at enhancing operational readiness in the wake of North Korea's recent military activities.
Adding to the concerns, Kim Jong Un has abandoned the goal of unification with South Korea, designating it as a ""primary enemy."" Reports also suggest that Kim may have ordered the demolition of a 30-meter-high Pyongyang monument symbolizing reconciliation with South Korea. The situation in the region remains fluid, and international observers closely watch for further developments.

Paris is copying London and abusing its powers at the UN to protect Kiev, Moscow's deputy envoy to the world body said on Wednesday, after the French ambassador refused Russia's request for an urgent session of the Security Council.
An IL-76 carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners scheduled to be exchanged was shot down on Wednesday morning over Russia's Belgorod Region. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who is currently in New York, told reporters that he had requested an emergency UNSC session over the incident.
Lavrov urged the French ambassador - who currently chairs the council - to avoid repeating the April 2022 situation, when the British presidency took three days to approve Russia's request to discuss the alleged massacre in Bucha.
""We have a shocking development in the Security Council today,"" Ambassador Dmitry Polyansky said on X (formerly Twitter) several hours later, noting that France ""declined our request for an urgent Council meeting.""
The French ambassador said he would schedule the meeting for 5pm on Thursday, ""in a clear attempt to shield their Kiev regime clients"" and buy President Vladimir Zelensky's government ""more time to come to its senses and invent some at least distantly plausible explanation of what it has committed,"" the Russian diplomat added.
Not only is France abusing its council presidency, Polyansky argued, it is also ""cosplaying the lowest standards of their British neighbors"" from April 2022. The once glorious French diplomacy has ""shrunk to miserable swindling and pathetic manipulations!"" he added.
Ukrainian media outlets initially claimed the plane had been transporting missiles, but scrubbed their stories when it emerged that their own POWs were among the 74 dead. The Ukrainian General Staff eventually released a statement saying that Russia had been flying in missiles used to attack Kharkov so the flights were a legitimate target.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Ukraine had been notified in advance that its prisoners, due to be exchanged later in the day, would be on board the flights headed for Belgorod. The second plane, with 80 POWs on board, turned around and landed safely after the first IL-76 was shot down.
Moscow has accused Kiev of ""terrorism"" and callous disregard for the lives of its own citizens. Commenting on a screenshot showing both the initial and revised Ukrainian reporting on the incident, Polyansky said that Kiev was once again ""inflating the bubble of lies"" to avoid blame, no matter how ridiculous its narrative may sound.

Libmeldy is a treatment for Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), an exceedingly rare and life-threatening genetic disorder that affects children's metabolic systems. MLD can cause severe damage to the brain and nervous system.
Initially priced at 2.8 million euros for a single dose, the breakthrough came through the Beneluxa initiative. This initiative involved joint negotiations with Orchard Therapeutics, the drug's manufacturer, by Ireland, Belgium, and the Netherlands.
Under the Beneluxa initiative, Libmeldy is prepared using stem cells collected from the patient's bone marrow or blood. These cells are then modified to create the drug, administered through an infusion via a vein drip.
It is estimated that over a five-year period, approximately three Irish children will receive treatment, and they will travel to Spain for this therapy. While the reduced cost for Libmeldy has not been publicly disclosed, it will vary depending on different patient subgroups.

The protest was held against the illegal arrest of the head and co-founder of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, Manzoor Ahmed Pashteen and the forced deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan.
Around 25 people from the Afghan community participated in this protest, which happened from 12:00 to 14:00 hours today.
Satori Khan, who is the head of the PTM wing in Austria, said that there is no justice for Pashtuns in Pakistan. Pashtuns are persecuted in Pakistan due to their ethnicity and are now forcefully deported.
Ghossudin Mir, the head of the Afghan Cultural Association in Vienna, said the Pakistani army and ISI are responsible for the ethnic cleansing in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He mentioned that Pakistan always acts against the interests of the Afghan people.
Protesters raised slogans and held posters against the Pakistani government.
Earlier, in December last year, PTM member Fazal-ur-Rehman Afridi lambasted the Pakistani military establishment for trying to stifle their freedom of expression and their right to peaceful assembly and asserted that they cannot stifle their freedom around the world. He said that PTM will continue its struggle until the release of PTM chief Manzoor Ahmed Pashteen, who he stressed was arrested arbitrarily and presented before the ""kangaroo courts"" of Pakistan.
In an interview with ANI dated December 11, 2023, Fazal-ur-Rehman Afridi said PTI activists around the world have organised protests after the arrest of Manzoor Ahmed Pashteen. He said that PTM does not believe in Pakistan's courts, which he stressed, ""are compromised under the boot of the Pakistani military establishment.""Fazal-ur-Rehman Afridi said, ""After the arrest of Manzoor Ahmed Pashteen, the PTM activists around the world organised global protests not only in Pakistan, but we organised the protests all around the world, including the United States of America, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Austria. And there are more in the pipelines until and unless Manzoor Pashteen is released. Manzoor Pashteen was arrested arbitrarily and presented before the Kangaroo courts of Pakistan, which are compromised under the boot of the Pakistani military establishment.""PTM chief Manzoor Ahmed Pashteen was arrested on December 4, 2023.
The PTM alleged that Pashteen's vehicle was fired at by law enforcement agencies (LEAs) while he was on his way from Chaman to Turbat, where protests were held against an alleged extrajudicial killing, Dawn reported. (ANI)"

The strikes targeted three facilities used by Iranian-backed 'Kataib Hezbollah' and other Tehran-affiliated groups in Iraq.
Austin said that the strikes ""are in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks against US and coalition personnel in Iraq and Syria"" by Iranian-backed militia groups. US Central Command also released a statement on Tuesday saying US forces ""conducted unilateral airstrikes"" targeting ""KH headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV capabilities,"" CNN reported.
According to a US defence official, the strikes were carried out at two sites in western Iraq, including Al-Qa'im near the Syrian border and Jurf al-Sakhar south of Baghdad.
""I am grateful for both the skill and professionalism with which our personnel planned and conducted these strikes and the continued efforts of our troops on the ground as they work with regional partners to further dismantle and degrade ISIS,"" Austin stated.
""The President and I will not hesitate to take the necessary action to defend them and our interests. We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region. We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities. We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks,"" he added.
The strikes come just days after US personnel at Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq were injured in a ballistic missile and rocket attack on the base. While most missiles and rockets were intercepted by the base's air defences, some projectiles made an impact, CNN reported, citing US Central Command.
As per the initial assessment, Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for the ballistic missile attack, the defence official said.
Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Tuesday that a total of four US troops were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury as a result of the attack, and all had since returned to duty.
The strikes on Tuesday are the first in Iraq since the beginning of the month, when the US targeted a member of an Iranian proxy group operating in the country who one US official said had ""US blood on his hands.""They also come after multiple strikes against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen over the last week and a half, as the US looks to rein in the aggressive actions of Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East amid heightened tensions in the region.
According to CNN, the US forces in Iraq and Syria have come under attack at least 151 times since attacks began on October 17, according to a US official -- 10 days after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7.
Although, the officials have not directly connected the two situations, the ongoing attacks on US forces have fed into heightened tensions and concerns about broader conflict breaking out in the region, particularly when coupled with the regular attacks on commercial shipping by the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.
""We've continued to see attacks on our forces since October 17 in Iraq and Syria. The attack that we saw over the weekend was just a larger scale attack,"" Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said Monday. ""But again, we don't seek conflict, we don't want to see this widen out to a regional war, we don't want ... to continue to see our forces being put at risk.""The US has carried out a number of strikes in Iraq and Syria in response to the attacks on coalition forces, placing blame squarely on Iran for supporting the militia groups carrying out the attacks, CNN reported.
Last October, following US airstrikes on facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias, a senior defence official said Tehran was ""the centre of gravity"" for the attacks and that ""Iranian fingerprints are all over this.""""Tehran and Iranian senior leaders are funding, arming, equipping, training and directing a whole plethora of militia groups across the region, and they have escalated attacks against US forces since October 17, which is why we took self-defense action,"" the official said.
While the attacks in Iraq and Syria have been ongoing, the US has also been managing regular attacks by the Houthis in Yemen on commercial shipping.
The strikes on Tuesday followed strikes on the Houthis on Monday, carried out by the US and UK, which a senior official said were successful in striking weapons storage sites, drone systems, and missiles.
It was the eighth round of strikes on the Houthis by the US military in roughly 10 days, as reported by CNN. (ANI)"
T5D99I1GD0_DEVQ3X6X9N15UU7,Why European Farmers Are Up in Arms,"Voice of America 24th January 2024, 17:05 GMT+11","Voice of America 24th January 2024, 17:05 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274104636/why-european-farmers-are-up-in-arms,"Paris - The European Commission is due on Thursday to begin 'strategic' talks with farmers' federations, agri-business firms, NGOs and experts on ways to assuage the ire on farms in several countries.
On the agenda are key issues including farming incomes, sustainable agricultural practices, technological innovations and competitiveness, which will be discussed in advance by the European Union's agriculture ministers at their meeting Tuesday in Brussels.
The initiative was not confirmed until late last week, even though Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had promised in September to start discussions, insisting that farming and environmental protection were not mutually exclusive.
Here is a look at some of the grievances that have sparked discontent in various parts of the 27-nation bloc ahead of this year's European Parliament elections.
The Netherlands
Grumblings in the Dutch farming sector bubbled to the surface in June 2022, when the government unveiled plans to cut nitrogen emissions by reducing the country's herd of 4 million cows by nearly a third, and possibly close some farms.
Farmers said the move would ruin their livelihoods.
Nitrogen compounds produced by manure and fertilizer used in farming can contribute to climate change and harm natural habitats.
The move followed a 2019 Dutch court ruling that the government was not doing enough on nitrogen, and that key house building and road projects that also produced the chemical would be on hold until it did.
But farmers in the country of 18 million, which is the world's second-largest food exporter after the United States, reacted furiously, dumping manure and rubbish on roads and blocking supermarket warehouses.
Their protests drew support from populists abroad, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, who claimed the Dutch farmers were fighting 'climate tyranny.'
Months of demonstrations triggered a wave of support at the ballot box for the recently founded BBB farmers' party, which made a significant breakthrough in Senate elections in March 2023.
It was less successful than predicted in the general election in November last year but continues to attract support from a rural community that feels urban elites in The Hague, Amsterdam and Brussels do not understand its concerns.
Poland and Romania
In recent months, there has also been an increase in exasperation in the east of the EU, namely in Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria, where food producers have complained of unfair competition from cut-price cereals from Ukraine, which is not part of the bloc.
FILE - A woman holds bread during a farmers protest in Bucharest, Romania, April 7, 2023.
After Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and blocked Ukraine from using the Black Sea to export its goods, the EU suspended customs duties on imports from Ukraine and set up corridors so Kyiv could transit its grains through the EU to world markets.
But because of logistical issues, the grain started piling up in EU countries and driving down local prices.
Tractor-riding farmers in Bulgaria and Romania jammed border crossings with Ukraine, and in Poland the anger triggered the resignation of the agriculture minister in April 2023.
That did little to calm tempers, and in November, Polish farmers and lorry drivers started blockading roads from Ukraine.
Farmers suspended their protest on January 6 after the government agreed to provide subsidies.
In Romania, the rural sector staged new demonstrations on January 14 over what they said were excessively high levies.
The customs exemptions granted to Ukrainian exporters expire in June, so the European Commission will need to tell EU farmers fairly soon whether it intends to prolong them or not.
Germany
In Germany, farmers have been up in arms since early January over a government plan to roll back tax breaks on fuel for agricultural machinery and other subsidies.
Tractors are lined up near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Dec. 18, 2023, as German farmers demonstrate against the planned abolition of subsidies for agricultural diesel.
On January 8, they launched a week of nationwide rallies, blocking several city centers and major road arteries with hordes of noisy tractors, and have vowed to push on with their demands.
The coalition government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz has agreed to stagger the cuts between now and January 2026 and reduce red tape.
But it may feel unable to offer more concessions, after a court ruling forced the government to find savings in the 2024 budget.
France
Farmers in France are also cross about increases in production costs and environmental regulations.
In the autumn, they turned signposts upside down to show the world itself was 'upside down.'
Since Thursday they have been blockading motorways in the southwest and rallying at roundabouts.
The powerful farming union FNSEA is planning other forms of protest, after a meeting with newly installed Prime Minister Gabriel Attal on Monday failed to produce a breakthrough.
Further afield
In former EU member Britain, fruit and vegetable farmers planted 49 scarecrows outside parliament on Monday to represent the 49% of farmers who say they are on the brink of leaving the industry due to 'unfair' treatment by the country's powerful supermarket chains.
Supermarkets are 'bringing British farming to its knees,' Guy Singh-Watson, founder of the fruit and vegetable box delivery firm Riverford Organic, told AFP, adding that government policies failed to adequately support the sector and were rarely enforced.
And there are predictions the rural unrest could spread to other parts of the EU, too.
'There is talk of protest in Italy and Spain,' said Christiane Lambert, head of Europe's leading farmers' union, the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organizations (COPA)."

Facing his first major crisis as prime minister, Gabriel Attal visited a cattle farm in the Haute-Garonne department in southwest France, scene of the first motorway roadblocks, to announce the measures.
""You wanted to send a message, and I've received it loud and clear,"" he told his audience. ""I have been listening.""
Attal said the government would ""put an end"" to the rising cost of diesel fuel used for farming machinery which has been a consequence of tax breaks on the fuel being phased out.
There would also be an emergency fund to help cattle farmers battle illnesses among their livestock.
""We have decided to place agriculture above everything else,"" Attal said.
The movement was split on how to react. The farmer who initiated the first blockade and has become a key figure in the protest movement, Jerome Bayle, said that having ""won"" on major points, he would reopen the freeways by midday Saturday.
But minutes later, Arnaud Rousseau, the head of the biggest farming union FNSEA, dashed hopes of a swift end to the crisis by calling for ""continued mobilisation"".
""What was said this evening doesn't calm the anger, we need to go further"", he told French broadcaster TF1, adding that the concessions ""didn't (meet) all expectations"".
The government has been trying to keep discontent among farmers from spreading months ahead of European Parliament elections, which is seen as a key test for President Emmanuel Macron's government.

Friday's encirclement of the capital followed days of disruption on motorways as well as tractor convoys through major cities and protests in front of government buildings.
Protesters on the A10 motorway west of Paris hung an effigy of a farmer in overalls from a mock gallows.
The A1 motorway heading north from Paris was blocked from Friday morning by tractors and hay bales, causing big jams.
In the south, around 400 kilometres (250 miles) of motorway were shut between the Lyon region and the Spanish border.
""We don't want any more words, we want acts,"" said Sebastien, a 21-year-old farmer at a blockade slowing traffic around the Blagnac airport outside Toulouse, ahead of Attal's announcements.
'Weighing us down'
Attal had gathered his economy, environment and agriculture ministers on Thursday, as the farmers' movement reached new heights with major protests and blockades.
The rallies mobilised around 55,000 people, according to the FNSEA.
Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau earlier Friday warned food manufacturers and supermarkets that they could face fines if they fail to obey laws on farmers' pay, after receiving an update on purchasing talks between retailers and their suppliers.
""We need operators who are economically responsible and patriotic about French agriculture,"" the minister said.
Farmers have fumed at what they say is a squeeze on purchase prices for produce by supermarket and industrial buyers, as well as complex environmental regulations.
But the last straw for many was the phasing out of a tax break on diesel for farm equipment.
The agricultural fuel tax ""is a real priority, a crucial cost reduction"", said Thierry Cazemajou, who grows corn and green beans for a major canned-vegetables brand.
""It's weighing us down,"" he said.
Others have called for binding minimum prices for their farm produce, speedier aid payouts or a pause on restrictions on pesticide use.
On Friday, Attal said the government would also seek to simplify administrative tasks for farmers, and inject subsidies into organic farming.
Some of the FNSEA's 140 demands could only be met with new legislation or tricky negotiations at the European Union level.
Demonstrators have thrown a spotlight on resented free trade agreements between the European Union and food exporters, especially a deal with South American bloc Mercosur that is still in the works.
Attal said France was ""against"" the deal which is up to the EU Commission to negotiate.
Farmers charge that their non-EU competitors abroad do not have to meet the same standards on issues such as pesticide use.
Police holding back
The authorities have held back from intervening by force against road blockades and other forms of protest, including defacement or break-ins at government buildings and food industry sites such as supermarkets and warehouses.
On Friday, an empty rural social insurance building was set ablaze in southern city Narbonne as farmers demonstrated nearby.
""There's no cause that can justify property damage or violence... (but) at present there are unfortunately farmers who feel desperate,"" Young Farmers (JA) union chief Arnaud Gaillot had earlier told broadcaster Sud Radio.
""The situation mustn't be allowed to turn sour. The government can't send a message that it doesn't care or isn't living up to its responsibilities,"" he added.
President Emmanuel Macron's government still bears the scars of the 2018-19 ""yellow vests"" movement, which mobilised huge numbers of people across French society and saw ugly clashes between demonstrators and police.

Borrell criticized the Western-centric approach of EU media and argued that it simply does not work.""We believe that everybody around the world speaks English or French,"" he said, adding that Brussels thus fails to reach millions of people who speak Arabic or Chinese.

The nation's banks refused to work with the channel, and regulators in Berlin threatened legal action when the network finally began broadcasting from Serbia in December 2021.The channel was eventually blocked by German regulators in February 2022, a month before the European Commission ordered a bloc-wide ban on all RT channels and websites.In 2022, Western media also sounded the alarm over Russian media expansion in the Global South. Last year, RT also made it onto Washington's list of security threats.In 2023, RT launched a major PR campaign in various regions around the world under the slogan: ""They think you believe.

Rajeev highlighted two key issues, namely the alleged curtailment of the state's borrowing limit and disparities in the distribution of taxes collected by the Union Government.
Referring to legal provisions, Rajeev stated, ""As per Article 293, in 2003, Kerala passed a bill to fix the debt limit of the state government. The government is working on the basis of this Act.""""But the Central Government is encroaching on the rights of the legislator and they have curtailed the borrowing limit of the State Government.

The Minister further pointed out the distribution of taxes, where he claimed that the state was being penalised for its advancements and strong position in the service sector.
""The government is punishing us due to our advancement and good position in the service sector. This issue should be addressed promptly,"" he asserted.
Earlier in May last year, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan alleged that the central government has been showing a sadistic attitude by cutting the borrowing limit of the state.

TP2XIA2AZG_PWDCD8B5QNQG5AV,Uganda issues CNOOC license to construct LPG facility,"Xinhua 24th January 2024, 04:30 GMT+11","Xinhua 24th January 2024, 04:30 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274104181/uganda-issues-cnooc-license-to-construct-lpg-facility,"KAMPALA, Jan. 23 (Xinhua) -- Uganda on Tuesday issued China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) Uganda Limited a five-year license to construct a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) facility on the shores of Lake Albert in the western part of the country.
Ruth Nankabirwa Ssentamu, minister of Energy and Mineral Development, while handing over the license to CNOOC Uganda Limited in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, said the oil giant is expected to produce more than 20,000 tonnes of LPG per year at a peak from the Kingfisher Development Area facility.
""LPG production is consistent with our national development objectives of energy use in Uganda. We expect that the increased supply, together with focused market penetration interventions, will stimulate increased consumption to the desired levels, necessary to cause a shift from high dependence on biomass, to the use of cleaner fuels,"" the minister said.
Data from the ministry show that Uganda has gas reserves estimated at 14.16 billion cubic meters. The raw gas is expected to be produced along with the crude oil.
According to the ministry, the gas produced will be used primarily for meeting the energy needs of the upstream projects and any excess will be converted into LPG.
In January last year, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni launched the drilling of oil for commercial production at the Kingfisher Oil Field, operated by CNOOC. Uganda in 2006 discovered 6.5 billion barrels of oil, of which 1.4 billion barrels are commercially viable, according to the ministry."

Senescent cells do not proliferate, but regrettably, they create an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of tumour cells that may have evaded the effects of the chemotherapy, which can lead to the ultimate regeneration of the tumour.
An international team of researchers led by Dr. Manuel Serrano at IRB Barcelona have described how cancer cells that have become senescent after chemotherapy activate the PD-L2 protein to protect themselves from the immune system while recruiting immune suppressor cells. The latter creates an inhibitory environment that impairs the ability of lymphocytes to kill cancer cells. Based on these findings, scientists wondered what would be the effect of inactivating PD-L2. Interestingly, senescent cells lacking PD-L2 are rapidly eliminated by the immune system. This intercepts the capacity of senescent cells to create an immunosuppressive environment and, as a result, lymphocytes retain their full capacity to kill those cancer cells that may have escaped the effects of chemotherapy.
""By blocking PD-L2 in mouse models, we have seen that chemotherapy is more effective against cancer. This finding paves the way to consider the use of a potential PD-L2 inhibitor as an adjuvant in the treatment of this disease,"" explains Dr. Manuel Serrano, currently at Altos Labs (Cambridge, United Kingdom).
The study has been done using cell lines and animal models of melanoma, pancreatic and breast cancer.
Senescence -- a common phenomenon in cancer therapiesCellular senescence is a process that occurs naturally during ageing and it is common in the context of cancer therapies. Most of these treatments (such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy) act by causing extensive cellular damage and, as a result, bring about senescent cells, particularly within the tumour. The team of scientists will now study whether senescent cells linked to the ageing of the organism also exhibit elevated levels of PD-L2.
""Although more experiments are needed to characterise the role of this molecule in different types of human cancers, this work has enhanced our understanding of the role of PD-L2 and the interaction of senescent cells with the immune system,"" explains Dr. Jose Alberto Lopez, a postdoctoral researcher from the same laboratory and first author of the work together with Dr. Selim Chaib. In 2024, Dr. Lopez will be starting a new laboratory at the Salamanca Cancer Research Center, a joint endeavour between the University of Salamanca and CSIC. Dr. Chaib is now at the Mayo Clinic, in Minnesota (United States).
This work has been carried out in collaboration with the groups led by Drs. Joaquin Arribas, Alena Gros and Maria Abad at the Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO). Dr. Arribas is now the director of the Hospital del Mar Research Institute (IMIM) and Dr. Abad works at Altos Labs. The team led by Drs. James Kirkland and Tamara Tchkonia at theMayo Clinic contributed important data to this study. This work has also involved the company Rejuveron Senescence Therapeutics, which is developing antibodies against PD-L2 for clinical use and has central offices in Zurich and Barcelona. (ANI)"

AAP councillor, Kuldeep Kumar had moved the High Court challenging the order rescheduling of the mayoral election ""illegally"" and seeking directions to conduct fair and transparent elections for the post of mayor, senior deputy mayor, and deputy mayor of Chandigarh Municipal Corporation immediately within 24 hours.
It was submitted that if the impugned order is not quashed and the elections are not scheduled and held immediately, then the whole election process will be jeopardised, and there will be horse trading and intimidation of councillors against the settled principle of free and fair elections.
As part of the alliance, AAP will be contesting for the mayor's seat, while Congress candidates are in the contests for the senior deputy mayor and deputy mayor posts. (ANI)"

These regulations include mandatory customs declarations and pre-notification of agri-food exports, some of which will require an Export Health Certificate. Businesses, importers, and hauliers involved in the GB-bound goods trade are urged to ensure that their staff are well-informed about these changes.
Full customs controls for Irish goods entering Great Britain will be introduced on January 31, whereas other European Union (EU) goods have been subject to this requirement since January 2022. Additionally, there will be pre-notification for agri-food products destined for Great Britain, with some products requiring Export Health Certificates, which confirm compliance with British health standards. These certificates will be issued by authorities such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.
Exporters of Irish agri-foods must determine the risk category of their products. Those classified as medium-risk or high-risk will require an export certificate. Products in the low-risk category will not need a certificate but must still be pre-notified. For example, meats and infant formula require health certificates, while certain cheddar cheeses and composite products do not.
Exporters must be registered on the EU Traces system to apply for these certificates. These changes do not affect goods from Northern Ireland and Irish products processed in Northern Ireland before reaching Great Britain.
The new regulations signify a significant shift in trade procedures, and small businesses and non-regular exporters are urged to be well-prepared. Pre-notification for agri-foods should be submitted between 30 days and 24 hours before travel. Trucks arriving at ports without an Export Health certificate will be required to return to their base, and the production premises will have to undergo a process with a certifying officer to obtain the certificate.
Businesses are encouraged to submit their customs declarations well in advance, including information such as the pre-notification reference number for agri-foods, container registration number, and ferry arrival details.
These changes are part of the United Kingdom (UK) Government's rollout of post-Brexit checks in 2024, and they will impact a significant portion of Irish exports that go to the UK, including food, drinks, and horticultural products.
Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Micheal Martin, said, ""The UK continues to be an important market for Irish exports so the smooth transition to these new UK requirements will be very important for us.
""I am encouraging all Irish companies to speak to everyone in their supply chain and make sure they are ready for the new UK processes starting January 31."""

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, held talks with Nauru's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Lionel Aingimea and signed the joint communique, effective as of this day.
This communique made Nauru the 183rd country which has diplomatic ties with China.
According to the joint communique, the Government of the Republic of Nauru recognizes that there is but one China in the world, the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal Government representing the whole of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.
The joint communique said that the Government of the Republic of Nauru shall sever ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan as of this day and undertakes that it shall no longer develop any official relations or official exchanges with Taiwan.
The two governments agree to exchange ambassadors as early as possible and to provide each other with all the necessary assistance for the establishment of embassies, said the joint communique.
""Today, the China-Nauru ties have opened a new chapter,"" said Wang during the talks.
Wang said that although China and Nauru are geographically separated by oceans, the friendship between the two peoples has a long history. As developing countries, both sides are faced with the common tasks of developing economy, improving people's livelihood and realizing modernization.
As members of the Global South, the two sides share the same will to safeguard their own sovereignty and independence, safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and promote an equal and orderly multi-polar world and economic globalization that benefits all. This is the fundamental logic that has brought the two countries closer to each other and will certainly bring broad prospects for cooperation, he said.
Wang stressed that the resumption of diplomatic ties between China and Nauru once again shows to the world that adherence to the one-China principle is an irresistible historical trend.
Wang pointed out that there are still a very few countries that maintain so-called ""diplomatic relations"" with Taiwan for various reasons, which not only goes against the interests of their own countries and their people, but also violates the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and infringes on China's national sovereignty. Such practices should be corrected sooner or later.
China urges these countries to recognize the trend of the times, said Wang, adding that China is ready to open a new chapter in its relations with these countries on the basis of the one-China principle."

Rahul Gandhi and several other Congress leaders also claimed that party MP Jairam Ramesh's car and camera persons accompanying the Yatra were manhandled by BJP workers in Assam's Sonitpur district on Sunday (January 21).
The Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra, which is travelling through the state from January 18 to 25, plans to cover 833km across 17 districts.

The Swedish clothing giant H&M has pulled one of its online school-season ads after being accused of sexualization of children.
The advertisement shown on social media in Australia featured two young girls in black-and-white school uniforms holding pink backpacks. The caption said, ""Make those heads turn in H&M's Back to School fashion.""
Some users criticized the company, arguing that the combination of the imagery and the tagline were ""highly inappropriate"" and amounted to ""shameful exploitation"" of children.
""Parents generally prefer [that] heads don't 'turn' when others see their daughters walking to school, on a bus or in class,"" Australian women's rights activist Melinda Tankard Reist wrote on X (formerly Twitter). ""Why would you want to fuel the idea that little girls should draw attention to their looks, bodies and 'style'?""
H&M took down the advertisement after the backlash. ""This ad has now been removed. We are deeply sorry for the offense this has caused and will look into how we present campaigns going forward,"" the company said in a statement to the media.
The founder of Mumsnet - a popular UK message board for parents - Justine Roberts said it was the right decision to ax the ad. ""While we're pleased that H&M have accepted their mistake and removed the advert, it should never have been created in the first place,"" she told the BBC.
It is not the first time H&M's marketing has caused outrage online. In 2018, the company was accused of racist messaging when its UK website featured a picture of a black boy wearing a green hoodie with the words ""coolest monkey in the jungle"" emblazoned on it. The company promptly pulled the ad and apologized, saying that ""even if unintentional, passive or casual racism needs to be eradicated wherever it exists.""

Azerbaijan may withdraw from the Council of Europe due to a dispute over the rule of law and human rights, the country's official news agency, APA, reported on Thursday. The news came after the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) voted to suspend Baku's delegation.
According to APA, Azerbaijan ""will not stand idle in the face of unfair and biased attitude"" and is considering ""not only leaving PACE, but the Council of Europe as a whole."" Baku may also decide to stop abiding by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights, the news agency said.
During Wednesday's session in Strasbourg, PACE passed a resolution arguing that Azerbaijan has ""not fulfilled major commitments"" in the field of democracy and the rule of law. ""Very serious concerns remain as to [Azerbaijan's] ability to conduct free and fair elections, the separation of powers, the weakness of its legislature vis-Ã -vis the executive, the independence of the judiciary and respect for human rights,"" the resolution read.
The delegates also accused Baku of failing to ensure ""free and safe access through the Lachin corridor"" connecting Azerbaijan's Nagorno-Karabakh region with Armenia. Last year, Azerbaijani troops re-established control over the region, expelling the authorities of the breakaway ethnically Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which had existed since the early 1990s. More than 100,000 Armenians - more than 90% of Karabakh's population - has since fled.
The Azerbaijani delegation to PACE released a statement, accusing the body of attempting to meddle in the country's elections. Officials described the decision to reject the credentials of the delegates as ""a serious blow to the credibility and impartiality of the Council of Europe.""
""Never before in the history of the PACE has this organization behaved in such a disgraceful manner,"" the statement read, as cited by the news agency Trend. Baku said that it is suspending all engagements with PACE until further notice.

Darya Trepova, who was found guilty of assassinating Russian military blogger Vladlen Tatarsky last spring, has been handed a 27-year prison sentence. It's the longest jail term for a woman in modern Russian history, with life imprisonment reserved exclusively for male convicts.
Vladlen Tatarsky was killed on April 2, 2023, when a bust gifted to him by Trepova exploded at an event in a St. Petersburg cafe, injuring some 52 people.
The court found the woman guilty on counts of terrorism, as well as illegal possession of explosive devices and a counterfeit driver's license. She pleaded guilty only to the latter charge.
Aside from the lengthy prison term, Trepova was also slapped with a fine totaling 600,000 rubles ($6,720). Her defense team said they would appeal the decision.
Trepova's accomplice, Dmitry Kasintsev, who is believed to have allowed her hide at his home after the assassination, was sentenced to almost two years behind bars.
Trepova was apprehended shortly after the bombing as she tried to change her appearance and flee Russia.
Following the arrest, she repeatedly insisted that she was unaware that the statuette had contained an explosive device and claimed that she had been duped.
At a court hearing in April, she said she ""deeply regretted"" what happened, adding that she herself had survived the explosion by accident.
Moscow described the assassination as an act of terrorism, pointing the finger at the Ukrainian government.
The FSB, the Russian security agency, identified a key accomplice of Trepova's as Ukrainian national Yuri Denisov. He allegedly provided the disguised bomb and collected intelligence on Tatarsky.

Lithuanian Economy Minister Ausrine Armonaite has issued a call for citizens to finance the country's defense industry, telling them to ""invest in tanks"" rather than keep hold of their savings.
Discussing her proposal with Lithuanian National Radio and Television (LRT), the minister claimed that the government needs to be more active in outlining what it expects from citizens - especially regarding support for Ukraine in its conflict with Russia.
""There are ways, for example, to borrow money from residents [for military spending],"" Armonaite stated, while stressing that citizens should not expect substantial returns on any investments.
""I have heard criticism of the idea of such bonds, but there is a lot of money that people still have. Maybe it's better stop keeping it in a sock, but to invest in a tank,"" she added.
The defense ministers of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia last week signed an agreement aimed at developing a joint air defense system in the Baltic.
At the same time, Estonia announced plans to build around 600 'concrete bunkers' on the border with Russia. Fellow NATO members Latvia and Lithuania have reportedly signed up for the project as well.
Earlier this month, the commander of the Lithuanian army, General Valdemaras Rupsis, argued that the Western defense industry needs to be restored to Cold War levels in order to deal with geopolitical shifts.

Addressing the gathering, the Prime Minister conveyed his best wishes on the occasion of Parakram Diwas which is celebrated on Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's birth anniversary.
Recalling hoisting Tricolour on the occasion of 75 years of INA at the same Red Fort, PM Modi said, ""that life of Netaji was the pinnacle of hard work as well as valour"".
Remembering Netaji's sacrifice, the Prime Minister said that he not only opposed the Britishers but also gave a suitable reply to the people who raised questions on Indian civilization. Netaji, PM Modi continued, showcased India's image as the mother of democracy before the world.
He said that Red Fort which was once a witness to the bravery and valor of Azad Hind Fauj has once again brimming with new energy.
Referring to the initial period of Azadi Ka Amrit Kaal as a celebration of accomplishment through resolution, the Prime Minister called this moment unprecedented as he recalled yesterday's event when the entire world witnessed a cultural consciousness awakening in India.
""The energy and belief of the Pran Pratishtha was felt by the entire humanity and the world"", the Prime Minister said as the celebrations of the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhash are underway today.
Since the announcement of the Prakram Diwas, the Prime Minister emphasized that it widens the Republic Day celebrations starting from the 23rd to the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on the 30th of January, and now the auspicious festivities of January 22 have also become a part of this festival of democracy.
""The last few days of January are inspirational to India's belief, cultural consciousness, democracy and patriotism"", the Prime Minister said as he conveyed his best wishes.
The Prime Minister praised everyone involved in the organization of the event. Earlier during the day, the Prime Minister interacted with the youths who were awarded Rashtriya Bal Puruskar. ""Whenever I meet the young generation of India, my confidence in the dream of Viksit Bharat gets further strengthened. Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose is a huge role model for this 'Amrit' generation of the nation"", PM Modi said.
Referring to Netaji's fight against the mentality of slavery, PM Modi said that Netaji would have been proud of the new consciousness and pride pervading the young generation of today's India.
This new awareness has become the energy for creating Viksit Bharat. Today's youth is adopting Panch Pran and stepping out of the mentality of slavery, he said.
""Netaji's life and his contributions are an inspiration for the youth of India"", PM Modi emphasized, hoping that this inspiration is always carried forward.
In this belief, the Prime Minister highlighted the efforts of the government in the last 10 years and mentioned giving the deserved respect by establishing Netaji's statue on Kartavya Path which reminds every citizen about his dedication to duty.
He also mentioned renaming the islands of Andaman and Nicobar where Azad Hind Fauj first hoisted the Tricolour, the ongoing development of a memorial dedicated to Netaji, a dedicated museum for Netaji and Azad Hind Fauj in Red Fort, and the declaration of a National Disaster Relief Award in Netaji's name for the first time.
""The present government has done more work dedicated to Azad Hind Fauj than any other government in independent India and I consider this to be a blessing for us"", PM Modi added.
Speaking about Netaji's deeper understanding of India's challenges, the Prime Minister recalled his belief about strengthening India's political democracy on the foundations of a democratic society.
However, the Prime Minister lamented the attack on Netaji's ideology post-independence as he mentioned the evils of nepotism and favouritism making inroads into Indian democracy which ultimately led to India's slow development.

""The results of the last 10 years can be seen by all"", PM Modi said expressing confidence about the ample opportunities present today for the sons and daughters of poor families.
The Prime Minister also drew attention to the confidence arising among the women of India about the government being sensitive to the smallest of their needs as he mentioned the passage of Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam after years-long wait.
He reiterated that Amrit Kaal has brought with itself the opportunity to showcase bravery and reshape the political future of the country.
""Youth power and Nari Shakti can play a big role in changing the politics of Viksit Bharat and your power can free the country's politics from the evils of nepotism and corruption"", the Prime Minister said stressing the need to show courage to end these evils in politics as well.
The Prime Minister also elaborated on the steps taken during the last 10 years for Indian defence self-reliant.
Mentioning the prohibition of hundreds of ammunition and equipment and creation of a vibrant domestic defence industry, the Prime Minister said ""India, which was once the world's largest defence importer, is now joining the world's largest defence exporters.""The Prime Minister highlighted the importance of the next 25 years for India and its people and stressed dedicating every moment of Amrit Kaal towards national interests.
""We must work hard, and we must be brave. This is critical to building a Viksit Bharat. Parakram Diwas will remind us of this resolution every year"", the Prime Minister added.

Speaking during the 19th National Dialogue Council, ""Umushyikirano,"" in the capital Kigali, Bizimana said that safeguarding Rwanda's achievements required an understanding of its journey and a commitment to unity.
""Fighting against divisionism does not necessitate historical expertise from the youth but an understanding of Rwanda's journey and a commitment to preserving its achievements,"" he said.
He stressed that after the 1994 genocide, the government has been focusing on rebuilding the nation through principles of unity, justice and stability, highlighting the success of initiatives like the Gacaca courts, which processed 1.9 million cases in a decade at a significantly lower cost than international alternatives.
In the Gacaca system, communities at the local level elected judges to hear the trials of genocide suspects. The courts gave lower sentences if the person was repentant and sought reconciliation with the community.
The impact of Gacaca on unity and reconciliation was evident, with a 2010 study revealing that 83 percent of those admitting guilt in the genocide apologized and distanced themselves from its ideology. Additionally, 85 percent of survivors demonstrated courage by forgiving and coexisting with perpetrators.
Bizimana presented statistics showing a substantial increase in unity and reconciliation rates, reaching 94.7 percent in 2020.
He underscored the vital role of youth in preserving Rwanda's progress, urging them to counter any threats to unity. The minister outlined strategies, including enhanced security, dispute resolution programs, and citizen involvement in development.
Acknowledging challenges, he encouraged the youth to be proactive in building on progress and resisting division.
""Umushyikirano"" is an annual event chaired by the Rwandan president, providing a platform for nationwide engagement on Rwanda's affairs. The two-day dialogue includes members of the cabinet, parliament the diplomatic community, and others."

Dmitry Peskov has revealed what might be behind the Ukrainian leader's rhetoric




Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky could only dream of the levels of popular support Russian President Vladimir Putin has, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.
Speaking to reporter Pavel Zarubin, Peskov commented on Monday's announcement by Zelensky that Ukraine had ""historical"" claims to six regions of Russia. According to Peskov, the statement was not merely ""stupid"" but rather an attempt to distract everyone from the problems that are piling up in Kiev.
""He is trying to get back the overwhelming [popular] support - he really wants to be like, for example, President Putin, so that the entire nation will support him - but it isn't working out that way,"" Peskov told Zarubin. ""More and more people in Ukraine are starting to think that maybe the Kiev regime is doing something wrong.""
Zelensky is also trying to go back to where he was nearly two years ago, when the West was sending him practically unlimited amounts of money and ammunition, but ""that won't happen"" either, Peskov added.Â
Instead of dealing with all of the problems that have accumulated, Zelensky is determined to continue the ""completely pointless bloodshed"" and is taking ""absurd steps"" such as laying claim to Russian territory, the Kremlin spokesman explained.



Zelensky claimed on Monday that the regions of Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod,Â  Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar have been ""historically inhabited by Ukrainians."" His deputy defense minister also told German media that the conflict will end on Kiev's terms and include Russia surrendering its nuclear arsenal.Â Putin is running for re-election in March as an independent candidate. Russia conducted parliamentary elections last September, including in the formerly Ukrainian regions admitted in 2022 following a popular vote.Â Meanwhile, Ukraine has postponed its parliamentary and presidential elections indefinitely, citing the ongoing state of martial law. Zelensky has also banned a dozen political parties on grounds that they were ""pro-Russian"" and placed all TV networks under state authority.Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko has recently criticized Zelensky's policies as having the ""smell of authoritarianism,"" singling out the ""monopoly on information"" as being bad for Ukrainian society. Many Ukrainians don't understand the situation on the battlefield, as the state media only talks about successes and ignores setbacks, Klitschko told the Canadian outlet Globe and Mail.According to Peskov, things will only keep getting worse for Kiev, while Moscow intends to continue its military operation until all of its objectives have been achieved.

U.S. Reps. Ami Bera, a Democrat from California, and Florida Republican Mario Diaz-Balart plan to ""engage with senior officials and business leaders,"" Bera's office said in a statement, without naming those with whom they would meet.
""The aim of the trip is to reaffirm U.S. support for Taiwan following their successful democratic elections, express solidarity in their shared commitment to democratic values, and explore opportunities to further strengthen the robust economic and defense relationship between the United States and Taiwan,' the statement said.
China, America's chief competitor for global influence, claims Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to use force to bring it under its control. Beijing strongly condemned the election of current Vice President Lai Ching-te as Taiwan's leader and appears set to continue its policy of refusing to engage with the island's government first set down following the election of the DPP's Tsai Ing-wen in 2016.
Beijing objects to any form of official contact between the U.S. and Taiwan and responded to a 2022 visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with some of its largest military maneuvers in years, including missile launches and a simulated blockade of the island. It views visits by foreign government officials as them recognizing the island's sovereignty.
President Joe Biden has sought to calm that complaint, insisting there's no change in America's longstanding ""one-China policy,"" which recognizes Beijing but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei.
Washington cut formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in order to recognize China, but U.S. law requires it to ensure the island has the means to defend itself and to treat all outside threats as a matter of grave concern.
While China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships to intimidate and harass Taiwan, there was no discernible spike in activity on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Defense Ministry reported seven Chinese warplanes and five naval vessels had been detected near the island over the previous 24 hours. It also said two Chinese balloons flew over the island's northern and southern regions. The nature of the balloons remains unclear."

The data review was completed by Kappes, Cassiday and Associates ('KCA') of Reno, Nevada, a global leader in metallurgical and process consulting. KCA reviewed metallurgical test work on oxide gold and silver mineralization completed by previous operators of the Santa Fe Mine as well as production data. Gold and silver recovery estimates were primarily based upon prior metallurgical test work for the Santa Fe Mine as described below. When recovery estimates of the individual deposits are applied to the Mineral Resource Estimate ('MRE') shown in the Santa Fe Mine Technical Report*, it results in weighted project-wide gold recoveries of 74.4% for gold and 29.0% for silver at a Â½-inch crush size from oxide mineralization.
Recovery estimates were primarily based upon prior metallurgical test work from the Project. This review included considerations from the following quantity of bottle roll and column leach tests:
It is typical to apply lab-to-field recovery discounts as a scale up factor when projecting commercial heap leach performance. This is generally a 2% to 5% deduction on the recovery, depending on the amount of available information. For the estimate, a 3% gold recovery deduction was applied to Santa Fe and 5% gold recovery deductions were applied to the other deposits. Five percent silver recovery deductions were applied to all the deposits.
Based on the review and applied discounts, the recovery estimates for oxide mineralization are as follows:
When recovery estimates of the individual deposits are applied to the Mineral Resource Estimate ('MRE') shown in the Santa Fe Project Technical Report*, it results in weighted project-wide gold recoveries from oxide mineralization of 74.4% for gold and 29.0% for silver at a Â½-inch crush size. Preliminary review of the data indicates little benefit to recovery from crushing finer than this.
The data reviewed included the results of a 1,860-ton crushed and agglomerated test heap of Santa Fe pit oxide mineralization. The heap was agglomerated with 5.5 kg/t cement addition yielding a 73.8% overall gold recovery, and 80.3% gold recovery on the flat surfaces for the Â¾' crushed test heap.
Operational data review indicates a total crushed oxide mineralization recovery of 65.5% over the life of the mine from 1988 to 1995. However, crush size seemed to vary throughout the life of the operation, ranging from 1-1/2 inches down to 5/8 inches towards the later stages of the mining operation. Consistent crushing at Â½-inch should improve precious metal recoveries.
Reagent consumption estimates were primarily based upon bottle roll information and are as follows:
KCA believes that there is sufficient data available to establish recovery ranges of oxide gold and silver mineralization for inclusion in a Preliminary Economic Assessment ('PEA'). This is a result of previous operational data, and the amount of column leach testing available on the component that makes up the bulk of the resource (the Santa Fe pit resource).
In order to reduce risk for the Project, KCA recommends that two more agglomerated column tests on each of Slab and Calvada East oxide mineralization at Â½' crush size be performed to confirm gold and silver recoveries for these areas where recovery data is sparse. KCA also recommends development of preg-robbing indices for the various types of mineralization in order to better understand metallurgical risks of the Project.
Kimberly Ann, Lahontan Founder, CEO, President, and Director commented: 'Lahontan truly appreciates the data review completed by KCA for the Santa Fe Mine Project. The conclusion by KCA that the existing Santa Fe metallurgical data is sufficient in quantity and detail to use for our planned PEA this year greatly benefits the Company and will help streamline the PEA process. The high heap leach oxide gold and silver recoveries estimated by KCA project-wide underscore the economic potential of restarting mining operations at Santa Fe'.

UWSVQDU28O_5Y8E2YSD8JYLT7E,Crude reality: Why has India ramped up imports of Russian oil,"RT.com 24th January 2024, 23:13 GMT+11","RT.com 24th January 2024, 23:13 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274104924/crude-reality-why-has-india-ramped-up-imports-of-russian-oil,"New Delhi has effectively managed its oil trade with Moscow without compromising its national security, sovereignty, or alienating other partners
India's oil trade with Russia has undergone a seismic shift in the last one and a half years, spurred by the Ukraine conflict. With India's refiners capitalizing on discounted Russian oil, Moscow swiftly became India's primary crude source, claiming 40% of imports as OPEC's share dwindled. Since April 2022, India's Russian oil imports have soared more than tenfold, surging significantly after the G7 imposed a $60-per-barrel cap on seaborne Russian crude.
As India, the world's fastest-growing major economy, ramped up purchases, it saved approximately $5 billion, accounting for 20% of annual crude imports compared to a mere 2% in 2021. This surge boosted bilateral trade with Russia to $50 billion in 2023, bolstering Indian energy security substantially.
In 2023, Russia dominated the Indian energy market as the primary crude supplier, contributing over 35% of total oil imports, leveraging substantial Moscow discounts amid Western sanctions. However, there was a significant import drop in December to 1.48 million barrels per day (bpd), down from a peak of 2.15 million bpd.
Reports have recently surfaced in Indian media suggesting potential payment issues between New Delhi and Moscow, with India registering zero imports of Sokol grade, which is produced in Russia's Far East region, in December - for the first time in the past 13 months. As sanctions against Moscow continued to expand, the government-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) reportedly ran into problems with payment for Sokol grade which was already on its way to India. As a result, six containers carrying oil idled close to Indian waters for weeks, unable to discharge the oil at their destination ports - Vadinar and Paradip. Some of these tankers may have been rerouted to China.
In an additional technical complication arising from sanctions, another Indian state-owned company, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which holds a 20% stake in Russia's Sakhalin-1 project, faced problems with receiving dividends, resulting in reduced profits. ONGC had earlier sold its share of oil from the project in the international markets, but this changed after Russia formed a new company to operate the Sakhalin-1 field.
Even then, according to the latest assessment by S&P Global Commodity Insights, India's demand for Russian crude remains resilient despite slowdowns in imports and the situation in the Red Sea. Russian oil imports are expected to stay robust, potentially accounting for 35-45% of India's total crude imports, the analysts say.
Indian-Russian oil trade has run into a number of challenges thus far. Firstly, the payment mechanism remains a concern for both sides. New Delhi has encountered significant obstacles in settling payments for oil imports with Moscow after Russia was disconnected from the SWIFT international payment system due to Western sanctions.
The rupee-ruble mechanism adopted by the countries faltered due to sanctions and the depreciation of the ruble, complicating crude trade.
Issues with UAE dirham payments arose from Russian exporters' UAE banking challenges. In pursuit of seamless oil trade, both Moscow and New Delhi aspired to eliminate the use of the US dollar to shield themselves from Western sanctions. In contrast, the UAE maintained a neutral stance and refrained from imposing sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, Indian refiners diversified transactions, settling some Russian oil payments in Chinese yuan.
Transporting and insuring oil shipments from Russia to India also poses a challenge, as shipping firms and insurers fear sanctions violations or legal entanglements. India's dependence on Russian vessels raised freight and insurance expenses, slashing oil discounts from Russia to $4/barrel from a peak of $30/barrel in the middle of last year.
However, when India's minister of petroleum and natural gas, Hardeep Singh Puri, delved into the nuances of India's imports of Russian crude in December, he clarified that the recent import dip stemmed from unfavorable pricing, not payment woes, saying, ""There is no payment problem. It is a pure function of the price at which our refiners will buy it.""
Nevertheless, India's growing oil trade with Russia is a diplomatic puzzle as it could impact its ties with nations such as the US and its allies, which urge India to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine. India has so far maintained neutrality, abstained from UN resolutions, and preserved its strategic autonomy and historical ties with Russia.
Balancing its interests with the US, a key ally and major source of defense, trade, and technology cooperation, India has effectively managed its oil trade with Russia without compromising its national security and sovereignty, or alienating other partners. India's ability to balance these interests is the key factor impacting this area of cooperation between the two countries.
Commenting on the oil trade with Russia, Hardeep Singh Puri stressed India's right to affordable energy and highlighted the economic advantages of increased imports of crude. Expanding oil imports from Russia has averted a potential spike in global crude prices, liberating Gulf oil for other nations' consumption.
Going forward, the oil trade between India and Russia will depend on overcoming these challenges, as well as how the global oil market evolves, given the ongoing geopolitical shifts. There are three potential scenarios of how the oil trade will evolve.
Continuation: Trade will remain at the current level or slightly lower, provided Moscow and New Delhi can resolve the payment and transportation issues, and maintain their strategic partnership despite the pressure from the US and its allies. India could also diversify its sources of oil by increasing its imports from other countries, such as the US, Iraq, Nigeria, or Saudi Arabia, to reduce its dependence on Russia and balance its relations with other partners.
Expansion: Trade can expand if the discounts offered by Russia are attractive enough to outweigh the costs and risks involved, and if India decides to deepen its energy and strategic ties with Russia, as a counterweight to China and a hedge against the US. India could also leverage its oil trade with Russia to enhance its cooperation in other areas, such as defense, nuclear, space, and technology, and to explore new opportunities in the Russian Far East and the Arctic regions.
Reduction: There could be a decrease in the oil trade if the issues related to payment and transportation remain unresolved or become too costly to overcome, and if the sanctions on Russia are tightened or extended. However, given India's commitment to strategic autonomy and maintaining strong ties with Russia, the prospect of deviating from its current position is not likely. The two nations are actively collaborating on a sustainable trade mechanism encompassing oil and other sectors.
India's complex oil trade with Russia, which is impacted by geopolitical challenges and strategic considerations, faces hurdles in payment, transportation, and global sanctions. Future scenarios therefore hinge on diplomatic finesse, resolving trade impediments and navigating global oil market dynamics amid an evolving geopolitical landscape. The intricate balancing act between India's energy security, strategic autonomy, and global alliances will shape the trajectory of this critical bilateral cooperation.

UWXL7ALLRZ_LUOLIYXY8TP2NIV,Supreme Court to examine rules drafted by BCI on issues related to lawyer strikes,"ANI 24th January 2024, 21:18 GMT+11","ANI 24th January 2024, 21:18 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274104829/supreme-court-to-examine-rules-drafted-by-bci-on-issues-related-to-lawyer-strikes,"New Delhi [India], January 24 (ANI): On Wednesday, the Supreme Court said that it will examine the rules drafted by the Bar Council of India (BCI) to address the issues related to strikes by lawyers.
A bench of justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and SVN Bhatti listed the matter for further hearing in February.
BCI had submitted a draft rule to address the issues related to strikes by lawyers. BCI Chairman Manan Kumar Mishra, a senior advocate, submitted before the court that the rules may be examined and if any suggestion comes from the court, the same shall be accepted without any condition.
""We will examine these rules. The rules therefore need to be examined in detail,"" the court said, listing the matter in February.
BCI Chairman Mishra also apprised the court that they have considered suggestions given by the petitioner's lawyer, Prashant Bhushan, while drafting the rules to address the issues related to strikes by lawyers.
The court was dealing with a contempt petition filed by the NGO Common Cause on the issue related to the lawyer strike. The petitioner sought action against lawyers who abstain from work and also urged the BCI to issue directions to incorporate appropriate rules, prohibiting strikes by advocates, in the 'Standards for Professional Conduct and Etiquette' framed under Section 49(1)(c) of the Advocates Act, 1961.
During the hearing, Prashant Bhushan suggested that if a requisition for a meeting to consider a strike is received, the committee members or a Bar Association or Bar Council should refuse to call a meeting for that purpose and if a strike call is given by any officeholder of the Bar Council or Bar Association, immediate disciplinary action should be initiated against him for professional misconduct by the concerned Bar Council.
Immediate action against professional misconduct should be initiated against such advocates who obstruct any advocates from appearing before any court, Bhushan recommended.
However, BCI Chairman Mishra urged for practicality, as they can't deny a lawyer for observing a strike protesting some incidents.
Justice Dhulia also recalled his initial days in Allahabad High Court and said that on the first day he entered Allahabad, there was a strike, but nothing happened. Justice Dhulia also said that things are better than in those periods.
Advocate Prashant Bhushan said that it is only because this court intervenes in this matter that it is slightly better off, but this problem will not go away unless there are very clear rules.
In the last hearing, the Bar Council of India sought to place on record the draft rules for consideration and submit them, saying that if this Court gives its impromptu, then the rules can be framed. The court had directed the respondents to hand over the draft copies to counsel for the petitioner so that the draft rules could be examined. (ANI)"
UXSWJ1BRNR_QVGR9OG54S59WM8,Pakistan Accuses India of Directing Cross-Border Assassinations,"Voice of America 26th January 2024, 05:05 GMT+11","Voice of America 26th January 2024, 05:05 GMT+11",20230125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106446/pakistan-accuses-india-of-directing-cross-border-assassinations,"ISLAMABAD - Pakistan alleged Thursday that a recent spate of assassinations of its citizens on Pakistani soil was orchestrated by India, claiming that the violent acts bear resemblance to cases that have occurred in other countries, including the United States and Canada.
Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Qazi told a news conference in Islamabad that his government had collected 'credible evidence' linking Indian intelligence operatives to the killings of two Pakistani citizens in September and October of last year.
'These were killings-for-hire cases involving a sophisticated international setup spread over multiple jurisdictions. Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan,' Qazi stated.
'They fit the pattern of similar cases, which have come to light in other countries, including Canada and the United States. Clearly, the Indian network of extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings has become a global phenomenon,' asserted the Pakistani official.
Qazi identified the slain Pakistani men as Shahid Latif and Muhammad Riaz, saying investigations were also underway into several other killings in recent months to determine if Indian agents also sponsored them.
Recent Indian media reports have said that Riaz and Latif were wanted by New Delhi for their roles in plotting 'terrorist' attacks against India and its administered part of the disputed Kashmir region.
The Indian foreign ministry spokesperson, in a statement, swiftly rejected Thursday's allegations by Islamabad as 'false and malicious' propaganda against India.
'As the world knows, Pakistan has long been the epicenter of terrorism, organized crime, and illegal transnational activities,' said Randhir Jaiswal.
'India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan, cautioning that it would be consumed by its own culture of terror and violence ... To blame others for its own misdeeds can neither be a justification nor a solution,' Jaiswal added.
The Pakistani allegations came nearly two months after U.S. federal prosecutors in late November accused a man, who claimed to be a 'senior field officer' for an Indian intelligence agency, of orchestrating a foiled assassination plot against an American citizen, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. He is the leader of the Sikh separatist movement in India.
Last September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told an emergency parliamentary session that his government had 'credible allegations' linking Indian agents to the slaying of exiled Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia last June.
New Delhi has rejected Trudeau's allegations and has launched an investigation into U.S. charges."

""This is a subject of ongoing discussions,"" Ambassador Ashraf said, highlighting the intricate nature of the negotiations.
""Now, the issue is really about arriving at a set of specifications that comply with our future fighter jet requirements,"" he said, explaining that the current discourse involves more than just the transfer of manufacturing technology.
According to the Indian envoy to France, the deal aims to delve into the actual design phase, metallurgical aspects, and other critical elements that contribute to the development of advanced jet engines.
""So this (deal) always features in the conversation between the President and the Prime Minister,"" Ashraf said, addressing a special briefing on Friday by the Ministry of External Affairs on the visit of French President Emmanuel Macron to India.
The Ambassador emphasised the need for a comprehensive approach, stating, ""What we are looking for is not just a manufacturing transfer of technology, which essentially keeps you going with the same crutches that you have been going on for the last six decades but to work in the actual design phase, metallurgical aspects, et cetera.""Safran, a key player in the aerospace industry, has expressed its willingness to engage in a 100 per cent transfer of technology across various phases of the project. This includes design development, certification, production, and more. However, Ambassador Ashraf acknowledged that navigating such complexities requires aligning the discussions with India's overall future defence requirements. ""So Safran is fully willing to do it with 100% transfer of technology, 100% transfer of technology in design development, certification, production and so on and so forth.""""It's obviously a very complex subject, and it has to fit in with the overall future requirements. So these discussions will continue to take place, and that's also part of the defense industry roadmap,"" he added.
In July 2023, in a significant decision, India and France decided to extend their ground-breaking defence cooperation in advanced aeronautical technologies by supporting the joint development of a combat aircraft engine.
They also decided to support industrial cooperation for motorisation of heavy-lift helicopters under the Indian Multi Role Helicopter [IMRH] programme with Safran Helicopter Engine.The announcement was made after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's talks with Macron in Paris.

However, cross-border hiring necessitates strategic planning to overcome regulatory hurdles between nations. This article provides a guide for developing customized global immigration strategies, empowering businesses to cast a wider net for in-demand skills.Â
From researching visa processes to supporting relocations, we'll explore best practices for navigating complex international employment laws and building a multicultural workforce with a global mindset.
Understanding Global Immigration Laws
The first step is understanding immigration laws and processes across prospective countries. Regulations surrounding work visas, residency permits, and hiring foreigners vary significantly. Doing research into specific requirements will save time and hassle later on.Â
Companies should also stay up-to-date on any policy changes that could impact existing employees or future hires. Having a firm grasp on global immigration enables businesses to draft customized plans according to local circumstances.
Recruit Internationally
With regulatory knowledge, companies can broaden their talent pool internationally. Posting job openings on global platforms increases the potential applicant pool. Businesses should highlight any visa sponsorship or relocation support available to attract qualified candidates who require work authorization. They may also recruit at overseas universities, conferences, or virtual career fairs to find top prospects. Participating in internships abroad can reveal future international employees as well. Through creative recruiting globally, immigration barriers can be overcome.Â
Supporting Work Visas and Relocation
For candidates requiring visas to work in another country, employers need to guide applicants through complex application processes. Sponsoring visas for skilled professionals demonstrates a long-term commitment.Â
Relocating employees presents additional considerations like arranging temporary housing, assisting with tasks like opening bank accounts or acquiring driver's licenses, and providing cultural orientation.
Â Comprehensive relocation packages smooth the transition and enhance retention of international hires who might otherwise find living abroad challenging alone.
Embrace Diverse PerspectivesÂ Â
Once foreign employees are on board, companies gain fresh perspectives to spark innovative solutions. With understanding and respect for varied backgrounds, managers can capitalize on employees' cultural expertise.Â
By creating an inclusive environment where all nationalities feel valued, businesses benefit from diverse problem-solving skills and market knowledge.Â  International employees may assist with expanding into new regions as well. With a global mindset and immigration strategies in place, companies have what they need to access worldwide talent.
Address Evolving Global Regulations
Immigration landscapes evolve, so flexibility remains key. Following regulatory changes like the US Public Charge Rule or Brexit requires adaptable strategies. Companies can future-proof with multiple geographic hubs and remote hiring programs allowing skills to support operations seamlessly wherever based. Further, global mindsets attuned to societal sensitivities help navigate each location's unique immigration norms respectfully.

V9RYAVA7DY_2KZQ3HB2YDR24P0,"Private sector, civil society collaborate to transform education, support NIPUN Bharat Mission","ANI 24th January 2024, 21:55 GMT+11","ANI 24th January 2024, 21:55 GMT+11",20240124,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274104857/private-sector-civil-society-collaborate-to-transform-education-support-nipun-bharat-mission,"Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], January 24 (ANI): On International Day of Education, leaders across the private sector and civil society came together to launch LiftEd (Learning and Innovation in FLN to Transform Education) an initiative that will impact the lives of four million children in India across five years.
With all partners working together to achieve these results, the diverse coalition that powers LiftEd is strengthening India's education ecosystem, unlocking young India's potential, and improving life chances for millions.
The central government has identified foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) as an 'urgent and necessary prerequisite to learning' and in 2021, launched the landmark NIPUN Bharat Mission to equip every child aged 4-10 with FLN skills by 2026-27.
Recognising that collaborative action from the private sector and civil society can act as an 'impact multiplier' to bolster the government's commitment to furthering India's education goals, LiftEd brings a vibrant and diverse mix of education experts together to improve FLN in India, raising up to USD 20 million (Rs 166 crore).
LiftEd is anchored by founding partners such as Atlassian Foundation, Bridges Outcomes Partnerships, British Asian Trust, the Maitri Trust, Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, Reliance Foundation, Standard Chartered Bank, UBS Optimus Foundation, and USAID.
The British Asian Trust is the programme leader and Central Square Foundation and Dalberg Advisors are design and technical partners.
Given that FLN is understood as the ability to read and understand basic text and solve basic mathematical problems by the end of grade three, it is the cornerstone on which a child's learning journey is built. Over five years, LiftEd's ambition is to strengthen these 'building blocks' of learning through a dual approach: on-ground and at-home interventions.
LiftEd's on-ground education partners are working with state governments and school facilitators in five geographies (Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi NCR, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar) to train them and build their capacity to improve FLN levels for public school children across grades 1-3.
To achieve results at scale, working with stakeholders who influence education is critical and helps the education partners - Kaivalya Education Foundation, Language and Learning Foundation, Peepul, and Pratham Education Foundation - take a 'systems change' approach.
As such, training block and district officers, school principals, and teachers enable LiftEd to positively impact more lives across a sustained period, as each person trained can have a ripple effect reaching several batches of students.
In parallel, LiftEd has also launched an EdTech Accelerator to develop digital solutions to improve FLN for low-income students in India. Eight innovative partners - Amira Learning, Chimple, Ei Mindspark, Pratham Education Foundation, Rocket Learning, Sesame Workshop, ThinkZone, and Top Parent - have been chosen to be a part of the EdTech Accelerator following a rigorous selection process.
They are working towards developing high-quality and contextually relevant solutions focused on the bottom of the pyramid, and are receiving dedicated support in the form of mentorship, capacity-building workshops, and funding through the Accelerator.
Since LiftEd is designed to incorporate principles of outcomes-based financing - collaboration, scale, innovation, and a razor-sharp focus on measurable outcomes - it puts transformational impact for children at the heart of its focus.
""We're inspired by LiftEd because it incorporates many of the elements we believe can have an incredibly positive impact on education outcomes: a focus on impact, rather than activity, active government involvement, and the scaling of proven approaches, delivered by a first-rate team. We look forward to LiftEd and its partner organisations delivering life-changing FLN outcomes for millions of children across India,"" Mark Reading, Head at Atlassian Foundation.
""We're hugely excited about the potential of LiftEd. By working to improve basic literacy and numeracy skills at a systems level, we believe it can have a transformative impact on the lives of millions of children in India over the next four years, while also helping to shape the future of education in the country,"" Amit Shah, Investment Director, Bridges Outcomes Partnerships, said.
""LiftEd is also a great example of the power of partnerships in creating and scaling effective solutions to some of our most pressing challenges. Bridges is delighted to be able to contribute what we've learned from over a decade of delivering outcomes-based projects, and we're really grateful to our partners on the SDG Outcomes initiative for helping us to bring this pioneering collaboration to life,"" Shah added.
""LiftEd will strengthen foundational learning skills for millions of children, setting them up for success later in life. By steering this initiative from conception to implementation and convening a coalition of experienced global partners, the British Asian Trust has created an opportunity to strengthen foundational learning in a scalable and sustainable manner. Applying our learnings from previous successes in education in India, we recognised the value of aligning with the Government of India's goals, embedding a systems-change approach and unlocking the power of technology early on,"" said Bharath Visweswariah, Executive Director India, British Asian Trust.
Luke Aspinall, CEO, of the Maitri Trust, said, ""LiftEd aligns closely with Maitri's strategic goals to improve primary school systems and foundational literacy and numeracy attainment, offering significant opportunity to make meaningful improvements in learner outcomes on a large scale. The initiative's focus on systemic shifts, tying changes within the education system back to their subsequent impact on the child, could prove game-changing for future systemic capacity-building programmes. With ambitious targets to positively impact 4 million children, we believe joining this collaborative initiative will accelerate progress far beyond what we could achieve in isolation.""Prachi Jain-Windlass, Senior Director, India Programs, The MichaelSusan Dell Foundation, said, ""The MichaelSusan Dell Foundation is proud to partner with LiftEd consortium, which is a bold ecosystem initiative to improve and mainstream foundational literacy and numeracy outcomes in government schools. This will be the first development impact bond where the nonprofit organisations involved are achieving outcomes by building capacities in the government school system rather than implementing interventions directly. The Dell Foundation has always been supportive of such innovative projects that help the system achieve an outsized impact on the lives of children. We look forward to the success of all the partners embarking on this journey.""Jagannatha Kumar, CEO, of Reliance Foundation, said, ""Providing children a strong start to their learning journey ensures them a bright future where they can fully realise their potential. Reliance Foundation shares this vision with all the consortium partners who have come together to launch LiftEd to foster learning and innovation in foundational literacy and numeracy. Bringing together the consortium's collective strength and experience and aligning with the Government of India's NIPUN Bharat, LiftEd could prove life-changing for millions of children across India.""Karuna Bhatia, Head of Sustainability, Standard Chartered Bank IndiaGlobal Business Services, said, ""As a company whose Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) ethos includes investment in the development of the regions where we operate, being a part of LiftEd is a clear pathway towards our goals. Through this unique initiative, we will strengthen foundational literacy and numeracy, identified as the highest priority of the education system by the Government of India, for millions of children across India, generating far-reaching, long-lasting impact.""Philanthropy, India and the Middle East said, ""In our experience, outcomes-based finance can be a powerful way to improve learning outcomes for millions of school children around the world, including India. Building on a strong track record of outcomes contracts in education in India, we are delighted to come together with our partners to launch LiftEd and strengthen basic numeracy and literacy skills using both classroom-based and home-schooling tools.""Veena Reddy, Mission Director, USAID/India, said, ""Around the world, USAID supports quality education and literacy programs, paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous global future. In India, USAID partners with the government, civil society, and private sector to promote innovative and scalable solutions that will have local reach and can have a global impact. USAID is pleased to support LiftEd to invest in the future of India and the world.
Shaveta Sharma-Kukreja, CEO and MD, of Central Square Foundation, said, ""LiftEd resonates closely with CSF's core mission to improve FLN outcomes at scale in India, both in schools and at home. A key component of LiftEd is nurturing the development of high-quality EdTech solutions through the EdTech Accelerator. Among the numerous EdTech organisations in India, only a small proportion focus on foundational learning, and even fewer are built for low-income users. The LiftEd Accelerator adopts a unique approach to solving this by catalysing the supply of diverse, innovative EdTech solutions and by galvanising demand for at-home learning, hence meaningfully contributing to achieving NIPUN Bharat's learning goals.""Dayoung Lee, Partner, Dalberg, said, ""While the pandemic exacerbated India's learning crisis, there is now an extraordinary window of opportunity to accelerate outcomes on foundational learning through the government's NIPUN Bharat Mission. LiftEd rides on this momentum to scale effective school-based solutions and innovative home-based EdTech solutions. Dalberg is excited to be a part of this ambitious initiative - unprecedented in raising the stakes for outcomes while working through government systems. I believe it is our best shot at achieving impact at scale."" (ANI)"

An Iraqi army officer told Xinhua on condition of anonymity that the drones were shot down in the evening while attacking the airbase near the town of al-Baghdadi, some 190 km northwest of the capital Baghdad, without causing casualties.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an Iraqi Shiite militia, claimed responsibility for launching two booby-trapped drones toward the airbase.
The militia said in an online statement that its fighters had launched ""two separate drone attacks"" on the Ayn al-Asad Airbase, stressing that it will continue its attacks on the U.S. bases.
The drone attack is the latest of the armed group's retaliation actions against the U.S. forces amid the ongoing conflict in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza Strip, according to the statement.
On Saturday, about 20 rockets were launched toward the Ayn al-Asad Airbase. Most of the rockets were shot down except for one rocket that landed on an empty area inside the base, according to an Iraqi military source.
A soldier was wounded by the shrapnels of the rockets that were intercepted by the air defense system and exploded in the air, according to the source."

One of the Ukrainian prisoners who died on Wednesday had spoken to RT in 2022 about why he surrendered. Konstantin Danilchenko was on the plane shot down by Ukrainian missiles over Russia's Belgorod Region, with no survivors.
According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the IL-76 was carrying 65 prisoners scheduled to be exchanged later in the day. It was struck by two missiles, launched from Ukraine's Kharkov Region, and went down on Wednesday morning. Everyone on board perished, including three Russian soldiers and six crew members.
RT found Danilchenko's name on the passenger manifest of the doomed flight, at number 11. It sounded familiar because of a 2022 video published by the Russian Defense Ministry, in which the recently captured Ukrainian soldier spoke about his reasons for surrendering.
""I wanted to live,"" Danilchenko said in the video. ""We are considered 'meat', and everyone understands why our leadership is so cold towards us.""
Ukraine has accused Russia of using ""human wave"" attacks on the battlefield. According to many Ukrainian POWs, it is Kiev that is actually doing so.

The Russian Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that Ukraine had been informed about the transport of the prisoners by air, accusing Kiev of shooting down the plane with their citizens on purpose in a ""terrorist act.""
Ukrainian media initially reported that a plane resupplying missiles to Russian troops targeting Kharkov had been shot down. Those reports were quietly deleted when it emerged that the IL-76 was transporting Ukrainian prisoners. The General Staff in Kiev issued a statement calling Russian transport flights a legitimate target because of attacks on Kharkov, but did not address the fate of the POWs.
The Ukrainian military has deliberately targeted its prisoners before, firing a volley of US-supplied HIMARS missiles on the stockade in Yelenovka in August 2022 and killing 50 members of the notorious neo-Nazi 'Azov' unit that had been captured in Mariupol.
Kiev has never officially confirmed how many troops it has lost over the past two years. Last month, President Vladimir Zelensky announced the need to mobilize 500,000 additional soldiers to replace battlefield losses and raise new units. Earlier this month, Ukraine's former prosecutor general Yury Lutsenko urged the government to reveal the true extent of combat casualties - which he estimated at 500,000 - to inspire people to enlist.

After the FAA's approval of inspection measures, Alaska began inspecting its fleet of 65 MAX 9s and announced the first few planes would return to service Friday.
Alaska's first MAX 9 flight on the aircraft since the blowout will travel from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to San Diego International Airport and is scheduled to depart at 2:20 p.m. Friday, according to Alaska's website.
More planes will be ""added every day as inspections are completed and each aircraft is deemed airworthy,"" the airline said.
United Airlines said it will begin returning its 79 Boeing MAX 9s aircraft to service on Jan. 28."

(TSXV:VLX) ('Velox' or 'the Company') is pleased to announce the drilling results from its Phase 1 diamond drill program at the Company's flagship Cambridge Vanadium deposit, its 100% owned North Queensland Vanadium Project ('NQVP') located in Queensland, Australia (Figure 1).
Highlights
Assay results received are very encouraging, with the mineralized zone identified at shallow depths, uniform thicknesses throughout the drilled area and consistent grades across the drilled area. Results include:
The overall Cambridge Deposit understanding has been enhanced due to:
Velox's President and CEO, Simon Coyle, commented:
'The drill program completed last year has significantly increased our understanding of the Cambridge Deposit. The latest diamond core assay results have exceeded our expectations and support our initial confidence in the deposit. The recent assay results also suggest that we have a laterally continuous high-grading layer within the mineralized zone, with V2O5 grades up to 0.60 % V2O5 over a 1.5 m thick interval.
'As our understanding of the deposit develops, we are seeing signs Cambridge is shallower and thicker than previous explorers had initially anticipated. Additionally, the potential in a newly identified high-grade zone and a REE enrichment zone has provided a welcomed upside, that will be further investigated.
'These encouraging assay results validate our planned next steps for the NQVP, which include metallurgical studies, a potential update to the existing resource and application of new geological knowledge over the entire project area to prioritize our target generation and development.'

Exploration Summary
A total of ten (10) infill large diameter (100mm) 4C diamond core drill holes totaling 333 m were completed at the Cambridge Vanadium deposit on EPM26494 located in central northern Queensland, Australia (Table 1). The drilling was designed to increase overall stratigraphic knowledge for the deposit and provide ample representative material for metallurgical testwork as well as additional data for future mineral resource definition.
The Cambridge Vanadium Deposit currently hosts a CIM compliant Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) consisting of an Indicated Mineral Resource of 61.33 Mt @ 0.34% V2O5 and 234.6 ppm MoO3 along with an Inferred Mineral Resource of 144.87 Mt @ 0.33% V2O5(cut-off grade of 0.25% V2O5) and 241.9 ppm MoO3 (Dufresne et al., 2022) and the recent program covered a representative portion of the currently defined deposit (Figure 2).
Drilling was undertaken by J&S Drilling Pty Ltd (Queensland) using a Fraste FS400 drill rig. Downhole gamma and density geophysical logs were completed by Weatherford International PLC using equipment to the American Petroleum Institute (API) standards Q1 and 14A, and logs recorded to international Logging Ascii Standards (LAS).
A detailed geological assessment, sample selection and Toolebuc Formation correlation was completed by John T Boyd Company. A total of 201 samples were selected for testing. Sample intervals were determined by stratigraphic lithological changes with sample intervals ranging from 0.10 m to 2.7 m thick (averaging 1.0 m).
Drill cores were dispatched to Mitra PTS Laboratory in Gladstone, Queensland for sample preparation and dispatched to Bureau Veritas, Perth, Australia, for analysis.

Figure 2: Drill Hole Location Plan
Assay Results Summary
Assay results for 201 samples have been received from the 10 diamond core drillholes drilled within the defined Cambridge deposit with the overburden depth ranging from 2.5 m to 21.0 m. Drillhole NQVP23_010 returned no significant vanadium results. The hole was collared in the basal section of the Toolebuc Formation and drilled into the underlying (barren) Willumbimba Formation.
In summary, the results are very encouraging and analysis of grade cut-offs at 0.40% V2O5 (current MRE used a 0.25% V2O5 cutoff) below demonstrates the potential for higher grade material to be selected from the overall mineralized unit (Table 2) and as shown in the cross-section below (Figure 3).

Sample Analysis and QA/QC Program
Velox uses a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program that monitors the chain of custody of samples and includes the insertion of blanks, duplicates, and reference standards in each batch of samples sent for analysis. The drill core is photographed, logged, and longitudinally cut, then Â¼ core sampled and shipped for analysis. The Â¾ retained sample is held in a secured location for verification purposes. Sample preparation (drying, crushing and pulverizing) is performed at Mitra PTS Laboratory, an independent (NATA Accreditation No 14525) laboratory, in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia. The entire sample is crushed to 70% passing -6 mm, and a riffle split of 250 grams is taken and pulverized to 75 microns. Pulps are sent to Bureau Veritas, in Perth, Australia (and other independent Laboratories) for analysis with the sample and pulp rejects stored as reserve.
Mitra PTS also complete density, moisture, carbon and sulfur testing on all samples.
Samples are analysed for vanadium and 50 other trace elements using Laser Ablation ICP-MS (LA101) from a 30-gram pulp. All samples are also subject the assay by XRF (XF202), testing 13 major element oxides with Umpire laboratory checks completed by ALS in Brisbane using lithium-borate fused digest ICP-MS (ME-MS81) at 1:10 sample ratio.
Blind duplicates were included in the (LA101/XF202) at a 1:10 sample ratio and certified reference standards (CRSs) and blanks were included in the assay program, including CRSs selected to represent the expected vanadium assay grades.
No QA/QC issues were noted with the results reported herein.

US and German lawmakers must finally realize that by sending weapons to Kiev, they are helping a ""Nazi regime"" that has stooped to knowingly killing dozens of its own prisoners of war, Russian State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin said on Wednesday.
The lawmaker's comments came shortly after the Russian Defense Ministry reported the crash of an IL-76 cargo aircraft carrying 65 captured Ukrainian service members, as well as several crew and accompanying personnel, in Belgorod Region bordering Ukraine. The soldiers were being transported to the area to be exchanged, officials said.
Russian MP Andrey Kartapolov claimed that Kiev knew about the impending exchange and the flight route, but attacked the plane anyway. He stated that the IL-76 had been downed by three missiles fired from either a US-made Patriot or German-made IRIS-T air defense system, and suggested that further prisoner exchanges were out of the question for the time being.
Commenting on the tragedy, Volodin advised the Russian parliament to draft an appeal to the US Congress and German Bundestag, so that those lawmakers could ""finally understand who they are funding.""
""This is a Nazi regime, nurtured by [US President Joe] Biden, [French President Emmanuel] Macron, [German Chancellor Olaf] Scholz... they must understand their responsibility,"" he added, urging Western legislators to impeach the aforementioned leaders.
Volodin claimed that Kiev had shot down its own troops in mid-flight: ""Their mothers, wives, and children were waiting for them. They also killed our pilots... defenseless, who were on a humanitarian mission, using American and German missiles.""
Russia has repeatedly condemned Western arms deliveries to Ukraine, arguing that they only prolong the conflict. Officials in Moscow have also said that Kiev is actively using Western-supplied munitions to target civilian infrastructure both in Donbass and elsewhere.

Both sides have intensified their violent tactics, resulting in a peak of civilian casualties not seen since the year 2000. Israel, supported by its Western allies, continues to assert its dominance in the narrative, suppressing alternative voices and distorting the reality of the situation. They turn a blind eye to the suffering of the Palestinian people, labeling their struggle and the international efforts to support Palestinian justice as ""anti-Semitism"" and ""terrorism"". However, there is a growing force advocating for justice for the disadvantaged in discussions about basic human rights in conflict zones. This force is challenging the traditional human rights discourse, which is heavily influenced by Western values and interests, and striving to construct a new human rights discourse centered around the concept of a global community with a shared future. The Rules of Engagement and Basic Human Rights ProtectionThe battle of ""the children of light against the children of darkness""?In October 2023, the Gaza conflict was ignited by a Hamas attack on Israel, leading to the bombing of numerous non-military targets in Israel and the kidnapping of Israeli civilians to areas controlled by Hamas. Israel quickly mobilized its armed forces for a counterattack and attempted hostage rescue. The Israeli Prime Minister's official Twitter account described the situation as a ""struggle between the children of light and the children of darkness, a struggle between human nature and the law of the jungle"". The international community, while maintaining a stance of fairness and objectivity, showed reserved support for Israel's response. By any standard, such indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets are considered acts of terrorism and are unacceptable in the international legal order. Nonetheless, the international community also recognizes the special circumstances of the Gazan people and hopes for an expedited end to the conflict to minimize further civilian casualties.During the prolonged conflict, millions of urban residents were forced to flee due to the actions of the Israeli military. A large number of civilians, including a significant proportion of women and children, died in indiscriminate bombings. Hospitals, mosques, and residential buildings were reduced to ruins under Israeli artillery. On December 11th, China's Ambassador to the United Nations, Zhang Jun, after surveying the humanitarian situation in Gaza, condemned Israel's actions as a ""humanitarian disaster,"" asserting they had crossed the limits of human conscience. Facing the severe humanitarian crisis created by Israel, it has become increasingly difficult to recognize its self-proclaimed role as the ""children of light"" and the ""representatives of humanity"".Violation of the Rules of Engagement and the Duty to Protect CiviliansThe modern international war law, exemplified by the Geneva Conventions, has always strictly limited unnecessary collateral damage in armed conflicts. Particularly emphasized is the ultimate taboo in the use of force: the prohibition against indiscriminately affecting civilians, hospitals, and women and children. What differentiates the armed forces of a modern civilized nation from the ""children of darkness"", or barbaric militants, is their conscious adherence to the rules of engagement (Rules of Engagement), limiting the scope of their force and making every effort to protect the basic human rights of civilians in the conflict zone. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense's rules of engagement for its forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, issued in 2003, explicitly state: ""Combatants and non-combatants must be clearly identified and strictly distinguished""; ""Attacks on civilians, hospitals, mosques, cultural and historical relics are prohibited, except for necessary self-defense""; ""Firing at civilian-populated areas or buildings is prohibited unless they have been used for military purposes by the enemy"", and so on.However, the Israeli military repeatedly carried out bombings and artillery strikes in densely populated civilian areas of Gaza. On October 17th, they even directly bombed the Gaza Baptist Hospital, causing significant civilian casualties, including numerous children. Regardless of how Israeli officials justify their actions, the bloody reality remains: in the current Gaza conflict, the actions of the Israeli military have resulted in an abnormally high number of civilian casualties, including an alarmingly high number of children. This indicates that in carrying out attacks, the Israeli military blatantly disregarded the traditional international law of armed conflict, showing indifference to the basic rights of civilians in the conflict zone, and directly violating the core principles of human rights protection in warfare.From Victim to Perpetrator: When the Dragon Slayer Turns Into the DragonRecently, Israeli delegation to the United Nations staged a bizarre drama. Each member wore a yellow Star of David, symbolizing the Nazi persecution of Jews, as if to suggest that anyone not siding with Israel was akin to the Nazis of World War II. Since the outbreak of the Gaza conflict, Israel has likened the attacks it faces to the Holocaust and branded all criticism as ""anti-Semitism"". This comparison is undoubtedly absurd. As Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated, all actions harming civilians should be condemned. While Israel has the right to exist and the Israeli people have the right to live securely, the Palestinian people also have the right to return to their homeland and establish their state, as well as the right to survival. Yet, the rights of the Palestinians have been continuously trampled upon, with little concern shown for their plight.In fact, a deeper examination of history reveals that many find striking similarities between Israel's actions towards the people of Gaza today and the Nazi persecution of Jews. This raises a thought-provoking question: When did the young dragon slayer, who once fought against tyranny, turn into the dragon itself?A closer examination of history reveals striking similarities between Israel's current treatment of the people of Gaza and the Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II, raising profound questions: When did the young dragon slayer turn into the dragon itself? During World War II, the Nazis implemented a policy of racial extermination against Jews, forcibly herding large numbers of them into Jewish ghettos, the most infamous being the Warsaw Ghetto. Enclosed by a 10-foot-high, 11-mile-long wall, the cramped ghetto housed up to half a million Jews struggling to survive amidst hunger and cold. From July 1942, the Nazi occupation authorities began mass deportations of ghetto residents to extermination centers and concentration camps. Within a few months, the population of the Warsaw Ghetto plummeted to less than 100,000. In 1943, in a desperate uprising, the Jews fought against the German army, but the revolt ended in failure, leading to the brutal massacre of about 13,000 Jews, with tens of thousands more sent to concentration camps for execution. The Jewish community in Warsaw ceased to exist thereafter.Following the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, the continuous encroachment on Arab lands led to a shrinking of the Palestinian-controlled areas, eventually confined to the small regions of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Gaza Strip, named for its narrow shape, spans only 365 square kilometers and originally had a population of only 340,000. Since its occupation by Israel in 1967, it has become home to around 3 million displaced Palestinians, making it one of the most densely populated areas in the world. In 2001, Israel destroyed the Gaza International Airport, effectively cutting off Gaza from the outside world. The region is enclosed by a barrier of concrete walls and barbed wire, with only two heavily controlled crossing points. Over 90% of Gaza's water and all its electricity are supplied by Israel, with more than half the population struggling with food supply and an unemployment rate exceeding 40%, leading to economic stagnation. For the Palestinians in Gaza, this is a form of racial segregation. In 1987, oppressed Palestinians in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza sparked the First Intifada, followed by a Second Intifada in 2000. These uprisings were brutally suppressed by Israel, leading to significant Palestinian civilian casualties: in 2008, over 1,440 Palestinians were killed in Israeli operations; in 2012, 167 Palestinian civilians, including 35 children and 14 women, were killed during an eight-day military offensive by Israel; and in 2014, Israeli soldiers killed 2,100 Palestinians in attacks on Gaza. In this latest Gaza conflict, the Israeli military has been even more relentless, with reports of 22,400 Palestinian civilian deaths, including over 3,000 children, as of the end of November. Some say today's Gaza Strip is the world's largest concentration camp, and ironically, its creators are the very survivors of the Nazi concentration camps.The tragic experience of the Nazi policy of exterminating Jews led Israel to place a high emphasis on building its armed forces. However, the Israel Defense Forces, intended for self-defense, have become a tool for hegemonic expansion and the brutal trampling of basic human rights. It is lamentable that the spirit of resilience and strength of the Israeli people has transformed into regional hegemonism and oppression of the weak. The young dragon slayer of the past has tragically become the dragon of today. The Plight of Free Speech and the Dusk of Hegemonic DiscourseThe Dilemma of University Presidents: The Sorrow of Free SpeechOn December 5th, the U.S. Congress, citing rampant ""anti-Semitism"" on university campuses, summoned the presidents of prestigious academic institutions to Washington D.C. for a hearing. Claudine Gay of Harvard University, Liz Magill of the University of Pennsylvania, and Sally Kornbluth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were called to provide explanations. The Congress members leading the hearing conflated the issue, interpreting the students' chants supporting the Palestinian people, ""Globalize Intifada,"" as genocidal rhetoric, and questioned why the universities did not punish these students. Faced with the politicians' overpowering narrative of political correctness, the university presidents seemed at a loss, striving to reframe the issue to its original complexity and delicately balance between free speech, moral boundaries, and ethnic rights. Their commendable courage to stand by their principles, however, came at a heavy cost: both Claudine Gay of Harvard and Liz Magill of Penn were forced to resign within a month following the hearing.On one hand, Israeli military actions, involving real bullets and bombs, transformed Palestinian homes into a living hell, yet these actions largely escaped scrutiny. On the other hand, a few impassioned slogans on campuses, which had negligible impact on the living environment of American Jews, were blown out of proportion, leading to a modern-day witch hunt and relentless suppression. This exposed the blatant double standards in the American public opinion environment, where only the government's actions were tolerated, but not the people's dissent. Consequently, even the academic freedom of university campuses fell victim to this hegemonic discourse. The freedom of speech, once a proud hallmark of the United States, was thus deflated and discarded, trampled underfoot with disregard.The Struggle and Frustration of Hegemonic Discourse of Major PowersUnder the indulgence of Western powers, Israel's behavior on various international platforms is also filled with paranoia and aggression. The Israeli permanent representative to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, even demanded an apology from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for not unconditionally supporting Israel, an attitude that defied diplomatic etiquette and was astonishing in its arrogance.Of course, justice resides in the hearts of the people. On November 22nd, representatives of UN Women, UNICEF, and the UNFPA were invited to report on the humanitarian situation in Gaza at a UN Security Council meeting. They highlighted the bleak situation of women and children's rights due to the ongoing conflict. When the Israeli representative Erdan made another disrespectful comment, calling the UN Women's agency ""shameful"", he was immediately interrupted and sternly admonished by the rotating chairman, Chinese Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun, who insisted on maintaining basic respect for the speakers at the meeting. Zhang further condemned the inhumane acts occurring in the Gaza Strip.Although a Security Council resolution urging a ceasefire in Gaza was delayed due to U.S. obstruction, the UN General Assembly convened an emergency meeting on December 12th, passing a special resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the Gaza Strip by an overwhelming majority. This clearly demonstrated the international community's unequivocal stance on the situation. At the beginning of 2024, South Africa filed a lengthy 84-page complaint with the International Court of Justice, directly accusing Israel of committing ""genocide"" in Gaza. Confronted with the international community's united condemnation, even U.S. President Joe Biden had to acknowledge that Israel, by blatantly violating human rights in Gaza, is losing the support of the international community. ConclusionAs we move into the third decade of the 21st century, the international human rights discourse is undergoing a significant transformation. The repeated display of moral double standards by Western countries has led to a severe credibility crisis. Increasingly, developing countries are asserting their voices independently, challenging the human rights discourse dominated by a few major powers. It is becoming evident that the international human rights discourse system, once monopolized by Western developed countries, is inevitably deconstructing. A new, multilateral international human rights protection discourse is emerging and gaining substantial influence. We believe that only a human rights discourse centered on justice, equality, independence, dialogue, and mutual respect can construct an international order that leads to genuine national reconciliation and enduring regional peace and stability.
The sudden outbreak of the Gaza conflict at the end of 2023 marks the most intense surge in the wave of violence between Palestine and Israel in recent years. Both sides have intensified their violent tactics, resulting in a peak of civilian casualties not seen since the year 2000.

Some say today's Gaza Strip is the world's largest concentration camp, and ironically, its creators are the very survivors of the Nazi concentration camps.
The tragic experience of the Nazi policy of exterminating Jews led Israel to place a high emphasis on building its armed forces. However, the Israel Defense Forces, intended for self-defense, have become a tool for hegemonic expansion and the brutal trampling of basic human rights. It is lamentable that the spirit of resilience and strength of the Israeli people has transformed into regional hegemonism and oppression of the weak. The young dragon slayer of the past has tragically become the dragon of today.

The Plight of Free Speech and the Dusk of Hegemonic Discourse

The Dilemma of University Presidents: The Sorrow of Free Speech
On December 5th, the U.S. Congress, citing rampant ""anti-Semitism"" on university campuses, summoned the presidents of prestigious academic institutions to Washington D.C. for a hearing. Claudine Gay of Harvard University, Liz Magill of the University of Pennsylvania, and Sally Kornbluth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were called to provide explanations. The Congress members leading the hearing conflated the issue, interpreting the students' chants supporting the Palestinian people, ""Globalize Intifada,"" as genocidal rhetoric, and questioned why the universities did not punish these students. Faced with the politicians' overpowering narrative of political correctness, the university presidents seemed at a loss, striving to reframe the issue to its original complexity and delicately balance between free speech, moral boundaries, and ethnic rights. Their commendable courage to stand by their principles, however, came at a heavy cost: both Claudine Gay of Harvard and Liz Magill of Penn were forced to resign within a month following the hearing.
On one hand, Israeli military actions, involving real bullets and bombs, transformed Palestinian homes into a living hell, yet these actions largely escaped scrutiny. On the other hand, a few impassioned slogans on campuses, which had negligible impact on the living environment of American Jews, were blown out of proportion, leading to a modern-day witch hunt and relentless suppression. This exposed the blatant double standards in the American public opinion environment, where only the government's actions were tolerated, but not the people's dissent. Consequently, even the academic freedom of university campuses fell victim to this hegemonic discourse. The freedom of speech, once a proud hallmark of the United States, was thus deflated and discarded, trampled underfoot with disregard.
The Struggle and Frustration of Hegemonic Discourse of Major Powers
Under the indulgence of Western powers, Israel's behavior on various international platforms is also filled with paranoia and aggression. The Israeli permanent representative to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, even demanded an apology from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for not unconditionally supporting Israel, an attitude that defied diplomatic etiquette and was astonishing in its arrogance.
Of course, justice resides in the hearts of the people. On November 22nd, representatives of UN Women, UNICEF, and the UNFPA were invited to report on the humanitarian situation in Gaza at a UN Security Council meeting. They highlighted the bleak situation of women and children's rights due to the ongoing conflict. When the Israeli representative Erdan made another disrespectful comment, calling the UN Women's agency ""shameful"", he was immediately interrupted and sternly admonished by the rotating chairman, Chinese Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun, who insisted on maintaining basic respect for the speakers at the meeting. Zhang further condemned the inhumane acts occurring in the Gaza Strip.
Although a Security Council resolution urging a ceasefire in Gaza was delayed due to U.S. obstruction, the UN General Assembly convened an emergency meeting on December 12th, passing a special resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the Gaza Strip by an overwhelming majority. This clearly demonstrated the international community's unequivocal stance on the situation. At the beginning of 2024, South Africa filed a lengthy 84-page complaint with the International Court of Justice, directly accusing Israel of committing ""genocide"" in Gaza. Confronted with the international community's united condemnation, even U.S. President Joe Biden had to acknowledge that Israel, by blatantly violating human rights in Gaza, is losing the support of the international community.

Conclusion

As we move into the third decade of the 21st century, the international human rights discourse is undergoing a significant transformation. The repeated display of moral double standards by Western countries has led to a severe credibility crisis. Increasingly, developing countries are asserting their voices independently, challenging the human rights discourse dominated by a few major powers. It is becoming evident that the international human rights discourse system, once monopolized by Western developed countries, is inevitably deconstructing. A new, multilateral international human rights protection discourse is emerging and gaining substantial influence. We believe that only a human rights discourse centered on justice, equality, independence, dialogue, and mutual respect can construct an international order that leads to genuine national reconciliation and enduring regional peace and stability."

Unidentified gunmen kidnapped five individuals from Punjab province in Dandar village, on the outskirts of Hoshap sub-tehsil of Kech on Wednesday.
The detainees have been identified as Nazir Ahmed, Muhammad Tariq, Safdar Ali, Farooq, and Hasnain.
Reportedly, the detainees were working there to install a new tower for the ""state-run"" telecom company Ufone, the Balochistan Post reported.
According to the local administration, Assistant Commissioner Turbat has sent a team of Levies forces to the area on the instructions of Deputy Commissioner Kech.
However, no further reports have been received about the abductees yet.
Meanwhile, two people were allegedly detained by the Pakistani forces in the Jhal Magsi area of Balochistan and subsequently moved to an undisclosed location.
The missing persons were identified as Akbar Khan and Jamil Ahmed, The Balochistan Post reported.
According to reports, Akbar was earlier detained by Pakistani forces along with his brother Yusuf.
His brother Yusuf was killed by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in an alleged fake encounter in Dera Murad Jamali. At the same time, Akbar himself was released but has now again been forcibly disappeared.
According to the local forces, Akbar was released by the Pakistani forces in a handicapped condition; his legs were paralysed when he recovered and now he has been detained again in a disabled condition.
Moreover, his family members expressed concern over the abduction and urged human rights organisations for the safe recovery of Akbar.

According to government sources, Prime Minister Modi voiced concern over the heavy rush of devotees and the inconvenience caused to the public by VVIP and VIP visits to the temple town along with elaborate security details.
He proposed that Union ministers plan or defer their Ayodhya visits in March to ensure a smoother and more organised experience for everyone involved, sources said.

Security was tightened in the holy city after the first day of darshan on Tuesday drew an estimated 5 lakh devotees.
Speaking to ANI on Wednesday, Rapid Action Force (RAF) Deputy Commandant Arun Kumar Tiwari said, ""We will ensure that devotees are not inconvenienced. About 1,000 jawans have been deployed inside and outside the temple. The deployment will continue for the next few days.""The huge influx of devotees was not just seen at the Ram Temple but at the adjoining Hanuman Garhi Temple as well. The devotees, in their thousands, were seen offering laddus to Lord Hanuman and distributing the 'prasad' among themselves.

""Forced labor and human trafficking are abhorrent crimes that have no place in our society, and I am grateful to our team of prosecutors, agents, and support staff for ensuring that justice was done in this case,"" attorney said.
""The defendants exploited the victim's trust and his desire to attend school in the United States, and then inflicted physical and mental abuse against him, all so they could keep him working for their profit,"" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.
He added, ""Human trafficking is a disgraceful and unacceptable crime, and this verdict should send the very clear message that the Justice Department will investigate and vigorously prosecute these cases to hold human traffickers accountable and bring justice to their victims.""""These convictions demonstrate the FBI's commitment to seeking justice for victims of human trafficking and should also serve as a reminder to those who seek to engage in this illegal activity,"" said Special Agent in Charge Stanley M. Meador of the FBI Richmond Field Office.
He added, ""We will continue working with our local, state and federal partners to aggressively identify, investigate and bring those responsible to justice.""In 2018, the defendants enticed the victim, then a minor, to travel to the United States with false promises of helping enrol him in school, federal prosecutors alleged. After arriving in the United States, the defendants took his immigration documents and immediately put him to work.
They also left the victim at the store to sleep in a back office for days at a time on multiple occasions, limited his access to food, refused to provide medical care or education, used surveillance equipment to monitor the victim both at the store and in their home, refused his requests to return to India, and made him overstay his visa.
According to court documents, the evidence further showed that Singh pulled the victim's hair, slapped and kicked him when he requested his immigration documents back and tried to leave, and on three different occasions threatened the victim with a revolver for trying to take a day off and for trying to leave.
A sentencing hearing is scheduled for May 8. Singh and Kaur face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, up to five years of supervised release, a fine of up to USD 250,000, and mandatory restitution for the forced labour charge. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. (ANI)"

Everyone worships this Lord Ram, who belongs not to one but to the entire country and the world.""He outlined a post-Ram Mandir agenda that could be seen as both politically aspirational and potentially divisive.

""We will give the house to those who have lost it. We will employ the youth. We will light the lamp of knowledge. After that, we will build the country's largest temple in Bihar. That temple will be for all castes and religions,"" Bihar Minister Said.
""First, let us achieve just one success: providing jobs to all the youth of the country. We will give houses to the poor and awaken the world of education."" added the Bihar Agriculture Minister.

Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib has warned West Jerusalem against engaging in a war with his country, after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff claimed that the possibility of a conflict with Beirut has grown.
On Monday, Bou Habib held talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the UN headquarters in New York. The latter stressed that the involvement of other countries, including Lebanon, in the fighting between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas would be ""unacceptable.""
Following the meeting, Lebanon's top diplomat was asked by journalists about the possibility of a conflict with Israel. ""I hope they [the Israelis] understand that a war with Lebanon won't be a picnic for them,"" he replied, as cited by TASS.
Last week, the IDF chief of staff, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, claimed that the possibility of a conflict with Beirut ""in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past."" Israeli forces are ""increasing readiness for fighting in Lebanon, we have a lot of lessons from the fighting in Gaza,"" Halevi said while attended IDF drills simulating an offensive against the Jewish state's northern neighbor.
IDF commanders have made similar statements since the start of the operation in Gaza in response to the incursion into Israel by Hamas on October 7, Bou Habib noted, stressing that ""we don't welcome such rhetoric.""
There have been almost daily exchanges of fire between the Israeli military and Lebanon's Hezbollah in the border area in recent months, with the group saying that its actions are aimed at tying up IDF forces to prevent their deployment to Gaza. In early January, Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri was killed in an alleged Israeli drone strike in Beirut, and Hezbollah vowed revenge for his death.
On Tuesday, the Lebanese foreign minister also gave an interview to Russia 1 TV, expressing hope that Russia would ""play an important role"" in reducing the growing tensions in the Middle East.
""A war is currently being waged [between Israel and Hamas], and armed clashes with the Israeli army in Southern Lebanon are taking place. But I know that, if there is any opportunity for peace, Russia will work toward establishing peace in any case,"" Bou Habib said.

Russia has not held any talks with former US president and now GOP frontrunner Donald Trump about settling the Ukraine conflict, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.
In recent months, Trump has on several occasions promised to bring an end to the fighting between the neighboring states - which is about to enter its third year - within just 24 hours if he gets back into the Oval Office.
He also claimed that he would be able to quickly end the crisis by sitting down with both Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and exploiting what he called both their weaknesses and strengths. The ex-president also did not rule out the possibility that Ukraine might have to cede some territory to Russia in order to reach a peace deal.
Asked about what the Kremlin thought of Trump's campaign promises to end the conflict, Peskov noted that Moscow ""has no idea how this could be accomplished."" ""There have been no contacts on this issue.""
Meanwhile, Zelensky also weighed in on Trump's comments last week, admitting that his promise sounded ""a little scary."" He noted that the former US leader did not provide any details about his initiative, and also expressed concern that potentially it could ignore Ukrainian interests.
Peskov and Zelensky's comments come after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Sunday became the latest Republican presidential candidate to drop out of the White House race. DeSantis, who was widely seen as the 45th US president's main rival in the GOP primary, has now publicly endorsed Trump.
The only GOP contender besides Trump still in the race remains Nikki Haley, who served in his administration as US ambassador to the UN, although she is trailing her former boss in polls.
Meanwhile, according to the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill polling aggregator, which takes into account numerous surveys, Trump leads incumbent Joe Biden by 1% in a potential 2024 re-match (44% vs. 43%). At the same time, a November New York Times/Siena poll found that Biden was trailing the GOP frontrunner in five out of six swing states.

The strikes targeted three facilities in western Iraq used by Kataib Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy groups.
U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warned that Washington is not ruling out additional strikes, if necessary.
'We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region,' Austin said in a statement, adding, 'We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities.'
'We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks,' he said.
The new U.S. strikes came shortly after Iranian-backed militants attacked Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq with one-way attack drones.
The base was also targeted on Saturday by a barrage of ballistic missiles launched from inside Iraq. While most of the missiles were shot down, Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said those that landed on base caused traumatic brain injuries in four U.S. personnel.
More than 150 attacks on US forces
There have been more than 150 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the October 7 Hamas terror attack against Israel, injuring at least 83 Americans in Iraq and Syria, a U.S. defense official tells VOA. All but two have returned to duty.
Earlier Tuesday, the United States military stuck an anti-ship missile in a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen that was prepared to launch and posed an imminent threat to maritime vessels, according to Ryder.
This image provided by the U.S. Navy shows an aircraft preparing to launch from USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) during flight operations in the Red Sea, Jan. 22, 2024. (U.S. Navy via AP)
The attack followed a series of strikes into Yemen by U.S. and British warplanes, backed by surface ships and submarines, that aimed at further degrading the capabilities of the Iranian-backed Houthi militants who have sought to carry out attacks against key shipping lanes in the Middle East.
U.S. defense officials said the strikes hit multiple targets across eight locations, including an underground storage facility as well as missile launch sites and other locations linked to Houthi surveillance capabilities.
The strike locations were intentionally selected to target weapons systems, not to amass casualties, a senior military official told reporters. The official assessed the underground storage facility had 'more advanced conventional weaponry' in it than sites hit in the first round of strikes on January 11.
UN leader urges 'all parties to step back'
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday urged 'all parties to step back from the brink and to consider the horrendous human cost of a regional conflict.'
Ryder told reporters in response to a question from VOA that the U.S. was 'not at war' in the Middle East.
'Our goal here is to ensure the Red Sea is safe and secure for international shipping. That is our only goal,' he added.
The Red Sea route carries about 15% of the world's maritime traffic. Major shipping companies have responded to the attacks by rerouting vessels on the longer and more expensive route around Africa.
A U.S. defense official said Monday the decline in the number and the ferocity of the Houthis' maritime attacks was directly attributed to the reduction in their capabilities.
'That does not mean they have no more capability, but we definitely believe that has had an impact,' another U.S. official said.
Since mid-November, the Houthis have launched 33 attacks on international shipping lanes, according to the Pentagon. The Houthis say their attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza under attack from Israel.
Many of the Houthi attacks have targeted ships that are not associated with Israel."

The precious regalia will be displayed in the city of Kumasi, once the capital of the powerful Asante Empire.
More than 30 pieces will be loaned back to their place of origin, two of the UK's biggest museums announced on Thursday.
The Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) will lend 17 items, while the British Museum will send 15 pieces - with ornaments, jewellery and talismans among the treasures.
They will be loaned to the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi on a three-year basis, with an option to extend for the same amount of time.
A joint statement by all three museums acknowledges that the objects seized had ""cultural, historical and spiritual significance to the Asante people"".
The seizures are also ""indelibly linked to British colonial history in West Africa, with many of them looted from Kumasi during the Anglo-Asante wars of the 19th century"".
The loan was negotiated not between governments but by the museums and Otumfo Osei Tutu II, the current Asante king known as the Asantehene.
The items will go on display to celebrate the Asantehene's silver jubilee later this year.
'Crown Jewels'Tristram Hunt, director of the V&A, said the items taken from the court of the Asante royals were the equivalent of the UK's Crown Jewels.Many are crafted in gold, the source of Asante kings' wealth and a symbol in their culture of the sun, life force and royal authority.The objects were mostly taken during wars between the British and Asante empires, including a sword of state, a gold peace pipe, a ceremonial headdress worn at coronations, and gold ""soul washers' badges"" worn by royal attendants charged with reinvigorating the king.Speaking to the BBC, Hunt said that when it came to objects acquired through war, ""we have a responsibility to the countries of origin to think about how we can share those more fairly today"".""It doesn't seem to me that all of our museums will fall down if we build up these kind of partnerships and exchanges,"" he added.Hunt stressed the items had not been permanently returned to Ghana, saying the new cultural partnership ""is not restitution by the back door"".New legislation opens door for French museums to return ancestral human remainsPost-colonial cultural battle Under a UK heritage law, national museums including the V&A and the British Museum are not permitted to give away objects in their collections, including returning them to their country of origin.The Asante ruler had sent a request to the British Museum to return gold items held in their collection to his country last year.Many European museums are facing pressure to return artefacts and artworks acquired during colonial conquests.Nigeria has formally asked the British Museum to return 900 Benin bronzes that were seized by the British when they captured Benin City in 1897 and are now spread between museums in the UK, France and Germany.Blood and Bronze: unveiling the British Empire's brutality in NigeriaBenin and Egypt have already received back artefacts formerly exhibited in Europe.And Ethiopia wants the British Museum to return a number of items taken from a village in the north of the country, formerly known as Maqdala, during British military action in 1868.Originally published on RFI

In a new interview, the 'Argylle' and 'Barbie' actor said that he is on the verge of retirement from WWE.
""That's not a maybe. That time is gonna come and it's gonna come soon,"" the 46-year-old actor and wrestler told ET on the possibility of retiring.
He continued, ""I made a promise to the consumer early on, to WWE fans, 'cause I know how tough it is to be a fan. You gotta come out of pocket -- and WWE has a ton of content -- it takes a lot to be a passionate fan and our fanbase is passionate and global. I never wanted to go out there just for the sake of going out there.""Cena entered the WWE in 2002 and pondered on his age, saying, ""I'm gonna be 47 this year. I feel great. So inside, I feel great, but I know what it takes to be a WWE performer night in and night out, and I don't ever wanna just go out there and do it to do it. I wanna have the passion -- the same passion as the fanbase -- and I wanna give them exactly what they give me.""""The miles on the odometer say, 'Hey, that's gotta be done before 50,'"" he ended.
This is not the first time Cena has suggested he is done with wrestling. During last year's writers and actors strike, Cena returned to WWE and stated that his final match was near.
""As I said out there in the ring, the last one is not tonight, but I know it's soon,"" he said in September 2023.
""Every single chance I get to go out there becomes more and more special. There is no denying the fact that I'm 46 and staring down 47. I've been here for over two decades. As I said out there in the ring, the last one is not tonight, but I know it's soon. To speak candidly, when you're involved in this every day in a full-time capacity, you just think about what's next."" (ANI)"

The ICJ's ruling, while stopping short of endorsing South Africa's call for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, emphasizes that Israel must implement effective measures to safeguard the civilian population.
President Joan Donahue, during the announcement, highlighted South Africa's procedural right to bring the case and underscored the court's jurisdiction to rule on emergency measures concerning the claims against Israel. While avoiding a direct appeal for an immediate Gaza ceasefire, the majority of the 17 judges stressed that Israel must take substantial actions to minimize civilian casualties, particularly focusing on the vulnerable situation of Palestinian children.
In response, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki expressed contentment with the ruling, stating that the judges had upheld principles of humanity and international law.
The Gaza offensive, initiated in response to attacks by Hamas on October 7, has resulted in over 26,000 casualties, according to figures from the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Authority.

WWOPC5PBDQ_EMWN7DOB4GB0047,Turkish Parliament to Vote Tuesday on Sweden's NATO Membership,"Voice of America 23rd January 2024, 17:06 GMT+11","Voice of America 23rd January 2024, 17:06 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103571/turkish-parliament-to-vote-tuesday-on-swedens-nato-membership,"After more than a year of delays, the Turkish parliament is set to approve on Tuesday Sweden's entry into NATO. The decision comes after the Turkish Foreign Affairs Commission approved the country's bid for membership last month.
In 2022, Sweden and Finland applied for NATO membership. And although Finland eventually joined the organization in April 2023, Turkey refused to ratify Sweden's bid, a decision that has frustrated its Western allies.
Initially, Turkey refused to endorse Sweden's membership under claims that the country protected members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is recognized as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the European Union and the United States.
Sweden has since introduced an anti-terrorism bill that makes membership of a terrorist organization illegal.
Furthermore, Sweden, Canada, Finland and the Netherlands have relaxed arms-export policies for Turkey. However, Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan has linked the upcoming ratification with the delayed U.S. approval of the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey. The White House backs the sale of these jets, but the timeline for congressional approval is not clear.
Despite this barrier, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said after talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan this month that Turkey is likely to soon ratify Sweden's bid for membership, leaving Hungary as the next barrier to Sweden's entry to NATO.
Despite Turkey's likely approval of Sweden's bid, Hungary has been delaying a decision on the country's membership.
Hungary says Sweden has had an 'openly hostile attitude' toward Budapest for years and is angry about Sweden's criticism of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban over the perceived erosion of the rule of law. Orban denies any erosion.
Orban's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, noted last Thursday a lack of 'confidence-building steps' from Stockholm to improve relations with Budapest, which might aid in ratifying Sweden's accession.

Any groups in Syria that are looking to the US for protection will eventually understand that they have misplaced their confidence, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said.
Speaking at a press conference in New York on Wednesday, where he was attending a UN meeting on Ukraine and the Middle East, Lavrov responded to reports that Washington is considering a complete withdrawal of its troops from Syria, which has been in the throes of a civil war since 2011. The Pentagon has denied any such plans.
The US - which has consistently backed opposition forces fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad's government - first intervened in the conflict in 2014, declaring that one of its aims was to defeat the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) terrorist group.
Commenting on Wednesday, Lavrov recalled that the US had previously announced the withdrawal of troops from Syria under then-President Donald Trump back in 2019. Washington later backtracked and continued to maintain a military presence illegally, despite a backlash at home and abroad.
Shortly after Trump's announcement, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), comprised mainly of local Kurds, ""started to ask the Russian military to help them to establish contacts with Damascus,"" Lavrov said.
However, when the US ""changed its mind,"" these groups soon retracted their requests and ""immediately returned under the American wing,"" the minister added.
The US currently has about 900 troops in Syria. Washington insists their main goals are to contain IS, reduce violence, and address the humanitarian crisis in the region. The government in Damascus insists that the US presence is ""illegal,"" and has repeatedly accused Washington of stealing oil in the northeastern part of the country.

The forecast suggests a surge in right-leaning movements across several countries. According to ECFR, Bulgaria is expected to welcome three newcomers to the EP: Vazrazhdane (Revival), There Is Such a People (TISP) and the Levitsata (the Left).
On a broader European scale, ECFR predicts that nearly half of the EP seats will be held by MEPs outside the centrist coalition, and a potential populist right coalition could emerge with a majority, marking a considerable shift in European policies. This shift may impact foreign policy decisions, particularly in areas like climate change, where the new majority might resist ambitious EU actions.
The forecast for Bulgaria indicates that of the 17 expected MEPs, five may align with the European People's Party (EPP), three with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), three with the Identity and Democracy group (ID), five with Renew Europe (RE), and one with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ERC).
The political landscape in Bulgaria has witnessed significant instability with five parliamentary elections since 2021. The rapid rise of anti-system votes, particularly in favor of the far-right and pro-Russia party, Revival (Vazrazhdane), has been notable. Winning 14% of the vote in the last election in 2023, Revival became the third-largest party. If the forecast holds, with three seats in the EP, Revival would gain institutional legitimacy, posing challenges for mainstream parties grappling with a loss of public trust.
analysts highlight Bulgaria's struggle to form a stable government after five national elections in two years, emphasizing the potential impact on the country's political landscape.

The NPC in a letter, urged the capital police.
Baloch protesters are currently demonstrating a sit-in in front of the NPC by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.
The camp has been installed since December 22 last year and continues to attract more participants despite the bitter cold weather and pressure from law enforcement agencies, Dawn reported.
Moreover, the organisers of the sit-in have accused the police of harassing their supporters and profiling them, as well as registering first information reports (FIR) against them.
Reportedly, the NPC wrote a letter to the Kohsar police station house officer on Tuesday and urged them to make a plan to relocate the protesters to a different location so ""the difficulties for the press club and all residents and the business community can be reduced.""The letter explained that the press club's sole means of income were press conferences and seminars held at the premises.
However, the sit-ins and their related issues, such as security requirements, have been affecting not only the club's members but also the events, as well as the local business community and residents, according to Dawn.
Baloch activist Mahrang Baloch expressed dismay at the letter and stressed that the journalist and media community ""have an obligation to stand with people whose voices are neglected."".
""It is painful to see that even now, the Islamabad Press Club is uncomfortable with our staging a sit-in outside the press club, protesting against enforced disappearances. We understand why they are doing this. There is pressure on us, too, and through various means, we are being harassed and threatened, with the police circulating false information,' she added.
Moreover, Mahrang further emphasised that the Islamabad administration's response to the protesters was ""deeply disappointing"" and that the movement would announce its next step in a press conference on Tuesday at 2 pm.
Another organiser, Sammi Deen Baloch, highlighted, ""Earlier, our protests were not covered, but now the journalists are becoming a party and they are angry and disgusted with our protests.""""I don't need to tell you what journalistic responsibilities are, but I must say that if there are strong on one side and weak on the other side, then we should take care of the weak instead of the strong,"" she said.
Meanwhile, journalists further expressed disapproval and strong condemnation towards the letter, as reported by Dawn.
""Now press club offering its shoulders against human rights activists...Nothing could be more disappointing,"" said Dawn correspondent Khaleeq Kiani.
Recently, urging for global support against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan, Mahrang Baloch has said that the movement of Baloch protesters, which has entered its fourth phase, aims to raise awareness nationally and internationally.
Notably, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) camp has continued to hold sit-ins outside the National Press Club in Islamabad for more than 50 days.
Moreover, the BYC said that even though the state tried to use every force to sabotage the peaceful movement, the participants of the march faced each tactic with resilience. (ANI)"

The meeting was called by the Bihar Deputy Chief Minister.
The political suspense in Bihar has heightened after speculations about JDU rejoining the BJP-led NDA picked pace.
Union Minister Giriraj Singh said that people come and go but currently, he has no idea on how the current situation will unfold in Bihar.
On the question of whether Nitish Kumar-led JDU will tie up an alliance with BJP, Giriraj Singh said, ""People come and go. We will have to wait to see how the current political landscape turns out. I have no idea.""Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Friday arrived at the Raj Bhavan in Patna to attend Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar's 'At Home' reception event in Patna.
Tejashwi Yadav, Deputy Chief Minister and RJD leader, skipped the event while RJD leader Alok Mehta, a cabinet minister was present at the event.
When asked why Deputy CM Tejashwi Yadav did not come for the official event at Raj Bhavan, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said, ""Ask those who did not come.""Earlier today, LJP leader Chirag Paswan said that the NDA is keenly watching the political scenario in the state, and is conducting meetings to discuss the situation and act upon it.
""LJP (Ram Vilas) is monitoring every second of the political scenario in the state. We even held a meeting yesterday to discuss the prevailing situation.

Also when Former Bihar Chief Minister and RJD President Lalu's daughter Rohini Acharya took a swipe at RJD's ruling ally, JDU, on X posting that while the 'socialist party' (JDU) styles itself as progressive, its ideology shifts with the changing wind patterns, a statement which triggered cracks within the ruling alliance.
However, a few hours later, all three posts by Lalu's daughter were deleted.
The INDIA bloc is largely a creation of Nitish Kumar, who crisscrossed the country to pull together opposition parties, including those not always friendly with the Congress.
If Nitish crosses over, this would be the fourth time he would be switching sides.
In the Bihar Assembly of 243, the RJD has 79 MLAs; followed by the BJP's 78; the JD(U)'s 45' the Congress's 19, the CPI (M-L)'s 12, two each of the CPI(M) and CPI, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular)'s four seats, and the AIMIM's one, plus one Independent legislator.
Amid talk of a deepening rift, the RJD and JD(U), on Thursday, held separate meetings while BJP state president Samrat Choudhary left for Delhi to hold discussions with top BJP leaders.
Sushil Modi was Deputy Chief Minister in the NDA government in Bihar in 2022, before Janata Dal (United) supremo Nitish Kumar severed ties with the ally BJP and partnered with the RJD and the Congress again.

Speaking to the reporters here, Yadav also expressed his hope that Nitish will strengthen the INDIA alliance, formed to take on the BJP-led central government in the upcoming general elections.
""There is no such sign. We hope that Nitish Kumar will not go to NDA. He will strengthen the INDIA alliance,"" Yadav said.
Notably, the unity of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) appeared in jeopardy amid growing speculation that Nitish Kumar, a key figure in the bloc may exit the 28-party Opposition bloc, formed to take on the BJP-led Central government.
Also when Former Bihar Chief Minister and RJD President Lalu's daughter Rohini Acharya took a swipe at RJD's ruling ally, JDU, on X posting that while the 'socialist party' (JDU) styles itself as progressive, its ideology shifts with the changing wind patterns, a statement which triggered cracks within the ruling alliance.
However, a few hours later, all three posts by Lalu's daughter were deleted.
If Nitish crosses over, this would be the fourth time he would be switching sides.
In the Bihar Assembly of 243, the RJD has 79 MLAs; followed by the BJP's 78; the JD(U)'s 45' the Congress's 19, the CPI (M-L)'s 12, two each of the CPI(M) and CPI, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular)'s four seats, and the AIMIM's one, plus one Independent legislator.
Amid talk of a deepening rift, the RJD and JD(U), on Thursday, held separate meetings while BJP state president Samrat Choudhary left for Delhi to hold discussions with top BJP leaders.
Giving more weight to the possible entry of Nitish Kumar into NDA, Bharatiya Janata Party MP and former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, Sushil Kumar Modi on Friday said that doors are never closed ""permanently"" in politics.
""In yesterday's meeting, strategies for (the upcoming) Lok Sabha elections were discussed. But as far as Nitish Kumar and JD(U) are concerned, doors are never closed permanently in politics. Now our central leadership will decide whether the door will open or not,"" Sushil Modi told reporters before returning to Patna.
Nitish Kumar defeated the BJP in the 2015 assembly elections, in alliance with the RJD. However, two years later, he dumped Lalu Yadav's party and joined the NDA.
Sushil Modi was Deputy Chief Minister in the NDA government in Bihar in 2022, before Janata Dal (United) supremo Nitish Kumar severed ties with the ally BJP and partnered with the RJD and the Congress again.
Armed with the support of the 'Mahagathbandhan' (Grand Alliance) Kumar quit the BJP in August 2022 and stripped the party out of power. (ANI)"

The court adjourned the hearing till January 31. While hearing the case at Adiala Jail, the Accountability Court judge, Muhammad Bashir, postponed the framing of the charge against Khan and his wife in the Al-Qadir Trust case after Bushra Bibi did not attend today's proceedings.
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) deputy prosecutor general, Sardar Muzzafar Abbasi, prosecutor Amjad Perviz, and Irfan Bola appeared before the court, according to ARY NewsThe National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had started an investigation against Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi and others for the alleged gain of hundreds of canals of land in the name of Al Qadir University Trust, which reportedly caused a loss of 190 million pounds to the national exchequer.
According to the charges, Imran Khan and others accused allegedly adjusted 190 million pounds sent by UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) to the government. Notably, PTI founder lodged Trust for Al-Qadir University Project on December 2019.
On Tuesday, Imran Khan has questioned the transparency of the elections set to be conducted on February 8 and added that the 'preferential treatment' meted out to a single political party had turned these polls into the 'mother of all selections', Pakistan-based Dawn reported.
He asked Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) members to engage in electioneering with full force. Imran Khan made these remarks during his routine interaction with reporters after the hearing of the cypher case being held at Adiala Jail. However, his interaction was abruptly ended after the jail superintendent, Asad Warraich, asked Khan not to speak to reporters in the makeshift courtroom.
In response, Khan said that it was his right to speak to reporters. However, Warraich reminded him that journalists were only allowed to cover the case proceedings, not highlight his political statements. At this, Imran Khan said he would only speak about his trial. The jail superintendent asked him to get permission from the judge if he wanted to speak to media persons.
Eventually, DIG Prisons Rana Rauf reached the courtroom and asked journalists to leave the premises as the proceedings had already been concluded. The prison staff escorted the media persons out of the court premises while Khan was protesting the 'censorship,' according to Dawn report.
Khan also asked Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf to hold a protest next Sunday. Notably, Imran Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, Zulfi Bukhari, Farah Gogi, Malik Riaz and his son are facing a reference in the National Accountability Bureau since Malik Riaz sent money to purchase the property through money laundering.

Read our blog to see how the day's events unfolded.
This blog is no longer being updated. Click here for more on the Israel-Hamas war.
Summary: The ICJ ordered Israel to take measures to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza in an initial ruling in a case South Africa brought against Israel over its military offensive in the Palestinian territory, a landmark ruling closely watched in the Middle East and around the world. The director of the CIA will meet in Europe with his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts plus the Qatari prime minister, aiming to negotiate a truce and hostage release in the Israeli-Hamas war, US media reported Thursday. Hamas released a video showing three Israeli women held hostage in Gaza. Two said they were soldiers and the third identified herself as a resident of an Israeli community near the Gaza border. The UNRWA fired a number of its staffers in Gaza suspected of taking part in the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas and other militants on southern Israel, its director said Friday. This prompted the US, the agency's biggest donor, to temporarily halt its funding. The health ministry in Gaza said at least 20 people were killed and some 150 others were wounded after Israeli fire hit a crowd of people waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza City. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza says at least 26,083 people have been killed, mostly women and children, and 64,487 have been injured in Israeli strikes on the enclave since October 7. Israeli officials say 1,139 people were killed in the Hamas-led October 7 attacks in southern Israel. Militant fighters took some 240 hostages during the attack and 136 are still in Gaza, according to Israeli figures. The Israeli military says 217 soldiers have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the start of its ground operations in the Palestinian territory. Yesterday's key developments: The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said the Israeli army has ordered people taking refuge in a shelter hit by deadly tank fire in southern Khan Younis on Wednesday to leave by Friday afternoon. The death toll in the shelter rose to 12 from a previous nine, a UNRWA official said, with more than 75 people injured.
Hamas said on Thursday that if the International Court of Justice issues a ruling calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian movement will abide by it as long as Israel reciprocates. Hamas will release all the Israeli hostages in Gaza if Israel releases all of its Palestinian prisoners, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said at a news conference in Beirut.
About casualty figures from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry:
Gaza's health ministry collects data from the enclave's hospitals and the Palestinian Red Crescent.
The health ministry does not report how Palestinians were killed, whether from Israeli airstrikes and artillery barrages or errant Palestinian rocket fire. It describes all casualties as victims of ""Israeli aggression"".
The ministry also does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.
Throughout four wars and numerous skirmishes between Israel and Hamas, UN agencies have cited the Hamas-run health ministry's death tolls in regular reports. The International Committee of the Red Cross and Palestinian Red Crescent also use the numbers.
In the aftermath of war, the UN humanitarian office has published final death tolls based on its own research into medical records. The UN's counts have largely been consistent with the Gaza health ministry's, with small discrepancies.

Speaking at the Sinn Fin Ard Fheis in Athlone, she criticized the EU's approach to the Gaza conflict, saying, ""When the European Commission gives Israel carte blanche to massacre Palestinians, we say, no, never. They don't speak for us.
She added, ""The world sees Israel's actions for what they are. Barbaric. Hateful. Cowardly. ""War crimes.""
Several times, the party distanced itself from European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, who controversially supported Israel following the October 7 Hamas attack.
Ms McDonald's speech came after an earlier address by Palestinian ambassador Dr Jilan Abdalmajid, who thanked the audience ""for being so vocal on the side of justice"" to rapturous applause.
The party has also called for the expulsion of Israel's ambassador to Ireland, Dana Erlich, ahead of a Dil vote on the issue next week.
On housing, Ms McDonald told delegates that the party would impose a three-year ban on rent increases if elected.
She said she would lower the rent and return a month's rent to each tenant.
Ms McDonald promised to renovate thousands of vacant homes and use new technologies in housing construction.
She said, ""The stark choice at the next election is between a worsening housing crisis under this government or a new government, led by Sinn Fin, that will fix housing once and for all."""

The Foreign Office (FO) confirmed the unprecedented action in a statement issued shortly after.
""Thursday morning, Pakistan carried out a series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes against terrorist hideouts in Iran's Sistan-o-Baluchistan province. Several terrorists were killed during the intelligence-based operation, codenamed 'Marg Bar Sarmachar,'"" according to the FO statement.
A day earlier, Pakistan recalled its ambassador from Iran and expelled Tehran's envoy in response to the Iranian missile strikes while extensive consultations were taking place to determine the next steps.
It was the first time Pakistan had to recall its envoy from Iran, despite the two countries' previous strained relations. This demonstrates the level of tension between the two neighbors.
The rapid deterioration in relations was precipitated by Iran's missile and drone strikes inside Pakistan on Tuesday. Iran claimed the strikes targeted two 'terrorist bases' of Jaish-al Adl, a terrorist group based in Iran's Sistan-Baluchistan province.
Pakistan strongly condemned Iran's ""unprovoked violation of its airspace"" and issued a warning of severe consequences. Islamabad denied the Iranian claims, saying the strikes killed two innocent children and injured three girls.
Thursday, the FO stated, ""Over the last several years, in our engagements with Iran, Pakistan has consistently shared its serious concerns about the safe havens and sanctuaries enjoyed by Pakistani-origin terrorists calling themselves Sarmachars in Iran's ungoverned spaces. Pakistan also shared multiple dossiers containing concrete evidence of the terrorists' presence and activities.
""However, due to a lack of response to our serious concerns, these so-called Sarmachars continued to spill the blood of innocent Pakistanis without consequence. This morning's action was taken in response to credible intelligence indicating impending large-scale terrorist activities by these so-called Sarmachars.""
Pakistan stated that today's action was ""a manifestation of Pakistan's unwavering determination to protect and defend its national security against all threats."""

The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, through his counsel, filed two separate pleas against an accountability court verdict that dismissed his post-arrest bail in both cases.
In the pleas, Khan has requested the Islamabad HC to set aside the accountability court's decision and grant him bail. It was pleaded in the pleas that the accountability court had rejected bail after the arrest pleas of the PTI founder in both cases, ARY News reported.
The PTI founder has maintained that the cases against him aimed at ""political victimisation"" and are based on ""mala fide intentions"".
Earlier on January 9, the Accountability Court in Islamabad rejected the bail applications of Imran Khan in Toshakhana and the 190 million-pound Al-Qadir Trust cases.
Judge Muhammad Bashir, presiding over the Toshakhana and 190-million-pound scandal case references, announced the verdict on petitions filed by deposed prime minister, ARY News reported.
Earlier on Tuesday, Lahore High Court restored Imran Khan's bail in seven cases related to the protests held on May 9, Pakistan-based Geo News reported.
Notably, protests erupted across Pakistan after Imran Khan was arrested on May 9, 2023.
The protests were held in remote and major cities as the PTI workers were angry after Imran Khan's arrest. Army installations, including the Corps Commander's house in Lahore, were also attacked during the protests by PTI workers.
Imran Khan and the PTI's top leaders have been facing several cases ahead of the elections set to be held on February 8. PTI lost the case in court to get back its electoral symbol ""bat"" and the legality of its intra-party elections.
As the embattled PTI faces uphill tasks, its major rivals, the Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), have already started campaigns across the nation and distributed tickets for national and provincial constituencies, as reported by Geo News. (ANI)"

Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari told reporters 21 of the soldiers were preparing to demolish two buildings with explosives when a militant fired a rocket at a tank nearby and the explosives in the buildings went off, collapsing the structures onto the Israeli soldiers. Three other Israeli troops died in a separate attack.
Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant wrote early Tuesday on X that it was a ""difficult and painful morning.""
""This war will determine the future of Israel for decades to come, and the fall of soldiers is a requirement to achieve the goals of the war,"" Gallant said.
Israeli forces carried out intense bombing in southern Gaza, while health officials accused Israel of attacking health facilities.
Palestinians who flee from Khan Younis from Israeli ground and air offensive on the Gaza Strip arrive in Rafah, southern Gaza, Jan. 22, 2024.
The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli shelling struck the group's headquarters in Khan Younis, ""coinciding with intense gunfire from Israeli drones, resulting in injuries among internally displaced individuals who sought safety on our premises.""
Reuters reported Gaza health ministry spokesman Ashraf al Qidra telling the news agency that Israeli forces stormed a hospital and arrested medical staff in Khan Younis.
Israel did not immediately comment on the situation, but in the past the Israeli military has accused Hamas of operating in and around hospitals, which Hamas denies.
The United States on Monday called for Israel to protect civilians in hospitals.
White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that while Israel has a right to defend itself, 'We expect them to do so in accordance with international law and to protect innocent people in hospitals, medical staff and patients as well, as much as possible.'
Israel vowed to destroy Hamas, which governs Gaza, after the militant group sent fighters rampaging into Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli tallies. Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and others, also took about 240 people hostage.
The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza says at least 25,295 Palestinians have been killed in the war, many of them women and children. The ministry does not specify the number of civilians and Hamas fighters among the dead.
The war has been devastating for Palestinian civilians, with the United Nations saying 85% of the population has been forced from their homes and a quarter of the people are facing starvation.

It reported, quoting the order, that the high court restrained the authorities from suspending internet services and directed the respondents to submit their responses on January 29, while hearing the petition filed in the SHC by advocate and human rights activist Jibran Nasir against the frequent suspension of internet services in the country.
As the political canvassing picks up pace ahead of next month's elections, users have experienced internet outages multiple times in recent days.
The outage of social media platforms including Facebook, X, Instagram and YouTube was the second in two weeks on January 20.
Following an hours-long disruption last week, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) blamed a ""technical fault"" in its optic fibre network for the nationwide internet outage.
Taking to X, the PTA said, ""The recent disruption in internet services was caused by a technical fault, which has been promptly rectified. Internet services have been fully restored nationwide.""Geo news reported citing downdetector.pk, Google services as well as internet service provider PTCL also faced disruption.
According to a report, the relationship between the state and media freedoms deteriorated during the past two years due to growing instances of censorship, violence against journalists, and government disdain for critical media.
The report titled ""Under Siege: Legislative, Judicial and Executive Actions Stifling Freedom of Expression and Right to Information"" was published by the Institute of Research, Advocacy and Development (IRADA) as part of its annual state of digital journalism series.
During the period under review, the PTA blocked as many as 1.1 million URLs including 187 mobile applications. Out of these blocked or removed URLs and content, around 200,000 were alleged to be related to the contempt of court, against the defence of Pakistan or glory of Islam, defamatory and sectarian/hate speech content, the report stated.
The report also uncovers a significant number of content removal requests from the Pakistani government to big tech platforms such as Google, Meta, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter).

In spring 2020, Jahzeel Smith was a high school senior looking forward to giving the speech he was scheduled to deliver at graduation. But closures and cancellations forced by the COVID-19 pandemic did away with those plans.
""Anything senior year and freshman year of college, I was robbed,"" says Smith, 21, of Baltimore. ""I didn't experience any of that. No graduation, no prom, no senior week, no freshman week [in college], no campus living, no dorms. It was bad.""
Smith is a member of so-called Gen Z, the generation of young people born between 1997 and 2012, who range in age from 11 to 26. Sociologist Pamela Aronson says Gen Z has experienced a lot of disruption in their lives.
""These folks are the ones who came of age during the peak of the pandemic, and we've had a lot of financial insecurity, economic insecurity, social political insecurities, that have emerged since then,"" says Aronson, a professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. ""And so, a lot of these factors have shaped the world views, the opportunities, and also the insecurities, of Gen Z.""
Older adults have a lot to say about Gen Z. A recent survey found that 40% of employers prefer not to hire Gen Z workers because they find them to be ill-prepared for the workforce. Another poll found Gen Z is having more difficulty achieving work milestones than their parents did.
""I get stressed about uncertainties but, overall, I'd say I'm pretty optimistic,' says Gabby DeAbreu, 22, (pictured far left).
Studies show that the issues Gen Z is most concerned about include health care, reproductive rights, the economy, environment and climate change, according to Mirramezani.
""We're seeing a lot more profound effects of climate change. We had the COVID pandemic, and now generative AI is changing things in a profound way. So, this is a generation that's just kind of constantly going through changes,"" he says. ""And I think it speaks to their resilience that they've been able to go through these changes and are still adapting.""
The 2023 ""Stress in America"" report by the American Psychological Association finds that Gen Z adults report higher stress levels than older adults. Lynn Bufka, a clinical psychologist affiliated with the APA, says part of the reason is that younger people are more comfortable identifying and acknowledging distress than people in previous decades.
""People have a language for describing how they're doing emotionally, mentally, psychologically in ways that we haven't always had as part of our day-to-day culture,"" Bufka says. ""But also, when we think about this particular cohort of individuals, I think we should not underestimate the impact of the pandemic.""
The pandemic forced today's Gen Z adults to stay home with their parents during a time when they were supposed to be gaining age-appropriate independence, separating from their family, developing friend networks and their sense of self, according to Butka.
""Many of these things were not possible for individuals during the pandemic, so some of that normal developmental growth that we would expect may have been delayed for individuals in that time period,"" she says.
The pandemic closures hit during DeAbreu's freshman year of college.
""It was during my first freedom from my parents ... and during that year, I blossomed socially, and that was a big thing for me,"" she says. ""That social aspect was taken away. I felt like I reverted back a little bit to how I was when living with my parents.""
File -- COVID-19 restrictions disrupted the lives of millions of Gen Z high school students, depriving many of them of milestone celebrations like prom and graduation ceremonies.
Gen Z also feels abandoned by older adults on a number of issues, according to Aronson.
""They felt that older adults didn't provide leadership through the pandemic. I think this also is reflected in climate change and the concern of young people feeling like many older adults are ignoring the problems of climate change and don't really see how things like gun violence in schools impact them.""
Aronson says mentoring programs and having clear expectations in both the classroom or workplace could be critical to helping young people who are struggling. She also suggests that companies offer training in both hard technical skills as well as soft skills, like teamwork, to help college graduates adjust.
Another factor that could be adding to Gen Z struggles, is social media, which previous generations did not have growing up. These popular online platforms can make distant world problems feel close to home.
""What's going on in the world is very much embedded in their life. And that's very different from in the past ... how news was consumed. And that obviously has a dramatic effect on how people experience their lives,"" says Mirramezani. ""They see the big events in the world, and it feels very personal to them.""
Social media can also put pressure on young people who might feel they aren't living up to what they see online.
""Social media is the bar. Social media sets the bar,"" Smith says. ""It used to be OK to be normal. Now, normal isn't OK after social media."""
XR3H0UZA6B_ZPE7YOH3DD255UJ,Biden to Host Japan PM Kishida for Official Visit in April,"Voice of America 26th January 2024, 10:05 GMT+11","Voice of America 26th January 2024, 10:05 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106674/biden-to-host-japan-pm-kishida-for-official-visit-in-april,"ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE - U.S. President Joe Biden will host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for an official visit to the United States on April 10, the White House said Thursday.
The formal event, which will include a state dinner and a policy meeting, follows a promise by Biden to host the closely allied nation key to the United States' strategy toward China, North Korea and other Asian security issues.
Biden and Kishida will discuss 'efforts to strengthen our political, security, economic and people-to-people ties' to improve Indo-Pacific security, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said.
The visit comes at a challenging time for both leaders, who have low public approval ratings at home. Biden is likely facing a close-fought November election against Republican Donald Trump, and Kishida is managing the fallout from a fundraising scandal, economic difficulty and a major earthquake this month.
'2024 will be a pivotal year for Japan-U.S. relations,' Japan's ambassador to Washington, Shigeo Yamada, said in prerecorded remarks to an event hosted by the Wilson Center think tank on Thursday.
'The Japan alliance is indispensable to the peace, stability and prosperity not only of our two countries, but also of the international community,' he said.
Mieko Nakabayashi, a professor at Japan's Waseda University, told Washington's Wilson Center there was growing concern in Japan about the prospect of a second presidency for Trump, who has questioned the value of alliances and complained about cost of U.S troop deployments in Japan and South Korea.
'We are very, very worried, and we are thinking about a variety of scenarios of whoever becomes the president of the United States,' she said.
Nakabayashi also said factional rivalries inside Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party raised questions about whether Kishida could hold on to power long enough to make the visit.
Frank Jannuzi, president and chief executive officer of Washington's Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation, told the think tank the U.S.-Japan alliance was long-standing but not unbreakable.
'The easiest way to break it ... would be for the United States to in the future somehow compromise the extent of our commitment to the security of our allies in Northeast Asia,' he said.
U.S. deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said the Biden administration took a 'very different' view from that of Trump.
'America's network of alliances ... are a force multiplier for U.S. interests,' he told an Asia Society event. 'They are a unique advantage that the United States has among our nearest peer competitors, not a burden on the country.'
While the security relationship between the U.S. and Japan has been growing ever stronger and they are looking to make a deal for Japanese shipyards to overhaul and maintain U.S. Navy warships, Nippon Steel's proposed purchase of U.S. Steel is a source of controversy.
Democratic and Republican U.S. senators have criticized the deal, citing national security concerns or raising questions about why the companies did not consult U.S. Steel's main union ahead of the announcement.
Brian Deese, a key player in Biden's reelection bid, said last month that the proposed purchase was concerning and that the administration should look closely at it.

The situation has prompted the declaration of a flu epidemic in various regions, intensifying public health concerns.
Effective immediately until February 2, Pazardzhik has officially entered a state of flu epidemic. The Sofia region, as well as Varna and Burgas, joined the list as of yesterday. For the coastal areas, the epidemic status extends until month-end, while the Sofia region observes measures until February 1.
Anti-epidemic measures are also in place in Smolyan and Pleven until January 31, while the Gabrovo region enforces them until the week's end. In the Plovdiv region, where measures were initially slated for removal this week, a surge in cases has prompted authorities to convene and discuss an extension.
Today's meeting of the Regional Headquarters in Plovdiv is expected to lead to a proposal from the Regional Health Inspectorate to extend the flu epidemic for an additional week. Additionally, recommendations may include declaring a flu vacation for students starting next Monday.
Latest data reveals that over 19% of students in the Plovdiv region are currently absent from school due to illness, underscoring the severity of the flu's impact on the community.

XU6DAUWQVL_4CBUG8U2RVJKBL3,Africa needs permanent seat on Security Council UN chief,"RT.com 23rd January 2024, 21:13 GMT+11","RT.com 23rd January 2024, 21:13 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103757/africa-needs-permanent-seat-on-security-council-un-chief,"Antonio Guterres has described the continent's lack of representation as a ?flagrant injustice?
The fact that Africa lacks a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is an injustice, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Sunday.
The UN chief insisted that the present structure of the UNSC is paralyzed by geopolitical divisions and does not reflect the reality of today's world. The Security Council has 15 members, five of which are permanent - Russia, China, the US, UK, and France - and which have the right to veto any resolution.
Guterres made the remarks during an engagement with reporters after addressing the Third South Summit of a group of developing countries known as the G77 plus China in Uganda's capital, Kampala.
He said that while most African countries were not independent when UN institutions were established, the fact that the continent does not have a single permanent member of the Security Council constitutes a ""flagrant injustice.""
According to Guterres, all five permanent members of the council have been ""favorable"" to the demand for Africa to have proper representation in the body.
""So for the first time, I'm hopeful that at least a partial reform of the UN Security Council could be possible for this for this flagrant injustice to be corrected, and for Africa to have at least one permanent member in the Security Council,"" he said.
""It is not guaranteed... it depends exclusively on member states, on the General Assembly, but for the first time I think there are reasons to be hopeful.""
The 55-nation African Union (AU) has long sought permanent representation in the UNSC. In 2005, the bloc established the C-10 group, whose primary mandate is to present, advocate for, and canvass support for the common African position on Security Council reforms. It seeks two permanent seats on the council but is currently represented by Algeria, Mozambique, and Sierra Leone as non-permanent members.
Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared his support for calls for the AU to have a seat at the UNSC and the G20, saying it would reflect the desire of African nations to have their voices strongly heard.
In September, the AU was formally admitted into the G20 group of leading economies at the bloc's summit in New Delhi, India. South Africa had been the only African country with membership in the G20.

According to reporting, some guests paid $2,500 each, but it must have been a select few. There are 22 people in the fundraising photo taken from the PHON Facebook page. Exclude Gina, Pauline and James, who all presumably got a freebie, that leaves 19.

This momentous visit by President Macron culminates the 25th-anniversary celebrations of the Strategic Partnership between India and France. The two leaders have engaged in a series of high-profile meetings throughout 2023, underscoring the strength and depth of the bilateral relationship.
Their interactions have spanned various global platforms, including the COP 28 Summit in Dubai, the G20 Leaders' Summit, and the G7 Summit in Hiroshima. Notably, President Macron was also the Guest of Honour at the Bastille Day Celebrations in France in July 2023.
This visit by President Macron marks the sixth time a French leader, and the fifth President, has been invited as the Chief Guest at India's Republic Day. This tradition began with President Jacques Chirac in 1976, followed by Valery Giscard d'Estaing in 1980, Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, and Francois Hollande in 2016.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's last visit to France for Bastille Day in July 2023 was a spectacle of symbolism and substance. The visit showcased the strong bonds between the two nations, with a tri-services Indian armed forces contingent marching at Champs-Elysees and a spectacular flypast by Rafale jets.
During the visit, Prime Minister Modi was honoured with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, a prestigious recognition in France. A State Banquet at the Louvre Museum and a private dinner at Elysee highlighted the grandeur of the occasion. The Prime Minister also addressed the Indian community at La Seine Musicale.
On the substantive front, two key roadmaps, namely the India-France Horizon 2047 Roadmap and the Indo-Pacific Roadmap, were adopted. A total of 12 crucial documents were signed, covering areas such as UPI on Eiffel, museum cooperation, digital technologies, civil aviation, space (Trishna IA), and MDA (STP).
Furthermore, 11 announcements were made, including the establishment of the French Bureau in Hyderabad, cooperation in sports, increased CEFIPRA funding, a 5-year Schengen visa for Indian degree holders from French universities, visa exemption on official passports, and collaboration in launch services between NSIL and ArianeSpace.
Upon his arrival at the Jaipur International Airport today, the French President was received by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra and Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma.
He later toured the Amber Fort and interacted with artisans and students. Thereafter, he was received by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the two leaders together visited Jantar Mantar in the Pink City. The two leaders are later scheduled to hold in-depth bilateral talks.
Macron will attend the Republic Day parade in New Delhi as Chief Guest. He will attend the At Home reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan and, later, the State Banquet, at the invitation of the President Droupadi Murmu.
President Macron has previously been in India on a State Visit in March 2018 and on an official visit in September 2023 for the Delhi G20 Summit. He has welcomed Prime Minister Modi in France on four occasions. (ANI)"

Clyburn and Vision to Learn Founder Austin Beutner Address National Vision Care Crisis Among School Children,"ACCESSWIRE 26th January 2024, 01:17 GMT+11","ACCESSWIRE 26th January 2024, 01:17 GMT+11",20240125,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274106172/congressman-james-e-clyburn-and-vision-to-learn-founder-austin-beutner-address-national-vision-care-crisis-among-school-children,"More than 3 million children across the country go to school every day without the glasses they need. The need is most acute in low-income communities, where 90% of children who need glasses do not have them. Vision To Learn helps address the issue by providing vision screenings, eye exams and glasses to children at schools in low-income communities. 5,000 children in South Carolina have been provided with glasses by Vision To Learn.
NORTH CHARLESTON, SC / ACCESSWIRE / January 25, 2024 / Congressman Clyburn and Vision To Learn Founder Austin Beutner joined teachers, school staff and students of Eagle Nest Elementary School to recognize Charleston and North Charleston's efforts to provide eye care to students.
In September 2021, Charleston Public Schools launched an effort together with non-profit charity Vision To Learn which has since provided vision screenings to more than 14,000 students and glasses to almost 5,000. Vision To Learn brings the services to where children are almost every day, their local neighborhood school. A Vision To Learn mobile clinic, staffed with licensed eye care professionals, has visited 40 schools in the Charleston area since the program started. Vision To Learn recently added a second mobile clinic with support from Margaret and John Thornton, the Kristof Impact Prize, and Boeing.
'More than 3 million children across the country go to school every day without the glasses they need,' said Vision To Learn Founder Austin Beutner. 'Every child in every school, everywhere in the country, should have the glasses they need to succeed in school and in life.'
'When a child lacks access to glasses, that can mean the difference between them thriving at school or struggling to keep up,' said Rep. Clyburn. 'Every child deserves to have the resources they need to succeed. Vision To Learn is making real progress in eliminating this inequity here in Charleston, but we need additional Federal and State government support to ensure no child is left behind.'
Dorchester School District 2 Superintendent Dr. Shane Robbins said, 'We are thrilled that Vision To Learn's program is expanding to Dorchester. The need for student vision services is great. Bringing eye doctors directly to school sites is a wonderful way to make sure every student who needs glasses is helped.'
'Every child should have the opportunity to realize his or her potential and not be held back by issues that are easily addressed,' said Margaret Thornton, who grew up in Charleston, and wants to support school children in South Carolina.
Vision To Learn's effort in South Carolina has found a large unmet need among students in the state. About 1/3 of students provided with a vision screening by Vision To Learn needed an eye exam, 85% of students who received an eye exam needed glasses and over 80% of them did not have them.
Experts estimate three to four million children across the country go to school every day unable to see the board or pages of a textbook clearly. About one in four children will naturally need glasses. Children who need glasses and don't have them are more likely to be misdiagnosed with behavioral issues in kindergarten, be labeled 'slow' learners by 5th grade, and to drop out of high school. Unfortunately, in low-income urban and rural communities, most children who need glasses don't have them due to financial constraints, language barriers, unresponsive health bureaucracies or the simple fact there are no eye care professionals in their neighborhood.
Over the last decade, nonprofit charity Vision To Learn has worked to address the 'glasses gap' by providing vision screenings, eye exams and glasses to kids where they are most days - at their neighborhood school. With a fleet of mobile clinics staffed with trained and licensed eye care professionals, Vision To Learn has helped ensure 2.8 million students across the country received vision screenings and provided more than 425,000 with glasses, all at no cost to the child or their family.
The impact of providing glasses to children at schools is shown in a study published in JAMA Ophthalmology by researchers from the Center for Research and Reform in Education and the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins University.
The researchers conducted the largest and most rigorous study in the U.S. about the connection between glasses and academic achievement by comparing students' standardized test scores before and after receiving glasses from Vision To Learn. Thousands of children from more than 100 schools in Baltimore participated in the study. The children who received glasses did much better in school and the impacts were greater than more costly measures such as lengthening the school day, providing computers, or creating charter schools. The children who showed the biggest gains, the equivalent of an additional four to six months of learning, were those who are often the hardest to help - students in the bottom quarter of their class academically and students with learning differences and disabilities.

He called himself ""fortunate"" to witness the auspicious and majestic event.
He told ANI, ""It was a historic event and I am very fortunate.""Rajinikanth added that he will be coming again, ""Will definitely come to Ayodhya every year,"" he said.
The Pran Pratishtha of Ram Lalla at Ram Temple in Ayodhya was held on Monday.
The Ram Lalla idol was unveiled at the Pran Pratishtha ceremony after the hour-long rituals in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who led the ceremony.
The Shri Ram Janmbhoomi Mandir is constructed in traditional Nagara style. Its length (east-west) is 380 feet; width 250 feet and height is 161 feet; and is supported by a total of 392 pillars and 44 doors. The pillars and walls of the temple showcase intricately sculpted depictions of Hindu deities, Gods, and Goddesses. In the main sanctum sanctorum on the ground floor, the childhood form of Bhagwan Shri Ram (the idol of Shri Ramlalla) has been placed.
As the 'Pran Pratishtha' ceremony unfolded, army choppers were pictured showering petals on the temple. PM Modi also showered petals on workers, who were a part of the construction team that shaped the grand Ram Temple.
He was also seen sprinkling flowers on the idol of Jatayu at the Ram Temple premises and also offered prayers to Lord Shiva in Ayodhya Dham.
While addressing the dignitaries invited to the Pran Pratishtha ceremony, PM Modi said the unveiling of the Ram Lalla idol is not only a moment of triumph after a prolonged struggle but also one of humility.
""This is not just a moment of celebration for us all but also one to reflect the coming of age of the Indian society. This occasion is as much about triumph as it is about humility. The world is replete with instances of countries that faced a lot of difficulties resolving historic wrongs and injustices. However, the way we untied the knots and resolved all outstanding issues gives us hope that our future is going to be more beautiful and fulfilling than our past,"" PM Modi said.
The PM said that the construction of the temple, which some feared would set off a firestorm, now stands as a symbol of peace, patience, harmony and integration.
""There was also a time when some people used to say 'Ram Mandir bana toh aag lag jaegi' (the making of the Ram Temple would set off a firestorm). Such people lacked an understanding of the purity of our society, the spirit that binds us all. This majestic abode of Shri Ram Lalla will now stand as a symbol of peace, patience, mutual harmony and social unity. The construction of this temple did not set off a fire but exuded a positive energy that has been infectious for us all,"" he added.
He added that the Ayodhya temple also testifies to a renewed national consciousness of Lord Ram and his place in our everyday lives.
The Ram Lalla idol was unveiled during the grand 'Pran Pratishtha', which involved hour-long rituals led by Prime Minister Modi. (ANI)"

With multiple options already available in 350cc and 650cc segments, the company will now step-up focus on its new 450cc platform. After Himalayan 450, the next bike in this range is expected to be Hunter 450. Launch is expected later this year, around the festive season.
Hunter 450 - What to expect?
With Hunter 450, Royal Enfield will be looking to replicate the success it has achieved with Hunter 350. With its compact design, a seamless neo-retro profile and agile performance, Hunter 350 had emerged as the second best selling Royal Enfield bike. It is currently ranked third, trailing Classic 350 and new Bullet 350. Hunter 450 will have the same USPs as highlighted with the smaller sibling. Enthusiasts looking for enhanced performance will probably choose the larger capacity Hunter 450.
In terms of design, a number of features will be borrowed from the smaller Hunter 350. A test mule spotted recently was seen with round headlamp and rear-view mirrors, a circular instrument console, single-piece seat and engine bash plate. The fuel tank design is similar to that of Hunter 350. It is completely different from the one used with Himalayan 450. Rear lighting setup has been copied entirely from Himalayan 450. The bike has the tail lamps installed within the indicators. It helps declutter the rear view and reduce weight as well to some extent. Use of LEDs improves visibility and reliability.
No USD forks
Unlike Royal Enfield Himalayan 450 that has USD forks at front, Hunter 450 can be seen with standard telescopic forks at front. Fork gaiters have been used for a sporty look and feel and to improve the bike's off-roading capabilities. Just like the smaller sibling, Hunter 450 has a comfortable, upright riding stance. The bucket rider seat should ensure a seat height of around 800 mm. This will allow improved control and handling and make the bike suitable for even shorter users.
The circular instrument console appears similar to the one used with Himalayan 450. The 4-inch TFT dash complements the bike's profile and displays a range of information using a simple and intuitive UI/UX. Users can also access Google-powered turn-by-turn navigation.
Hunter 450 specs, performance
At rear, Hunter 450 has a monoshock suspension. Braking setup comprises disc brakes at both ends. Dual-channel ABS is expected to be offered as standard. Powering the bike will be the 452cc liquid cooled, single cylinder Sherpa engine. It generates 40.02 PS of max power and 40 Nm of peak torque. It is mated to a 6-speed gearbox. Royal Enfield could introduce some changes to the engine in line with the needs of a roadster.
In the company's lineup, Hunter 450 will be positioned below the Himalayan 450. Hunter 450 will be the most affordable bike in Royal Enfield's 450cc portfolio. While a name hasn't been finalized, 'Hunter 450' doesn't sound bad at all.

""The sanction operation, which is especially directed against (Sudan's) national institutions, will not help achieve peace,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The ministry further said that justifying targeting the three economic institutions for their affiliation with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) is ""surprising and deplorable.""
""The right and duty to defend the country necessitate the SAF to seek to achieve sufficiency in defensive equipment, and all laws guarantee the right to self-defense,"" the ministry added.
On Monday, the European Council adopted sanctions against six entities affiliated with the SAF and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), including asset freezes and prohibition of the provision of funds or economic resources, directly or indirectly.
It said in a statement that the six entities were responsible for ""supporting activities that undermine the stability and political transition of Sudan.""
Sudan has been witnessing deadly clashes between the SAF and the RSF since April 15, 2023.
More than 12,000 people had been killed, and over 7.4 million had been displaced inside and outside Sudan since the fighting broke out, according to earlier estimates by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs."

French President Macron will land in Rajasthan's capital, Jaipur, in the afternoon, after which he will head towards Amber Fort.
At Amber Fort, he will receive a cultural welcome and will also witness a small exhibition of local artefacts at Amber Fort's Diwan-i-Khas.
Post his visit to Amber Fort, the French President will dash towards Jantar Mantar, where he will be greeted by Prime Minister Modi and shown the ancient Indian astronomical prowess.
At Jantar Mantar, PM Modi and President Macron will board a vehicle designed for a road show called Shobha Yatra, which will terminate near Hawa Mahal, where both leaders will also have photo opportunities.
At Hawa Mahal, both leaders will shop at local shops, and transactions are likely to be done through UPI.

Y60H91RGFT_5AF1OH0X2C6DEIH,German rail operator pays record in compensation to passengers for delays,"Xinhua 27th January 2024, 07:55 GMT+11","Xinhua 27th January 2024, 07:55 GMT+11",20240126,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274107670/german-rail-operator-pays-record-in-compensation-to-passengers-for-delays,"BERLIN, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Deutsche Bahn, the German rail operator, paid a record 132.8 million euros (144.2 million U.S. dollars) in compensation to passengers in 2023 due to train delays.
""Rail passengers benefit from the most generous regulations of any mode of transportation in terms of passenger rights,"" said a statement released Friday by the company. In 2022, Deutsche Bahn paid out 92.7 million euros in compensation.
As required by German law, Deutsche Bahn refunds passengers a quarter of the fare for delays of one hour or more, and half the fare for delays of two hours or more on its services. In the case of train cancellations due to strikes, passengers in Germany can claim a full refund of the ticket price.
Last year, unpunctuality rates went up further, with only 64 percent of long-distance destinations being reached on time. The company attributed this mainly to short-term construction activities when presenting the figures. Delays of less than six minutes were not factored in.
Deutsche Bahn has just begun a comprehensive overhaul of the country's rail network. By 2030, 40 particularly busy sections of track will be closed, some for months at a time. The German government is investing 40 billion euros in this project over the next years.
Following four strikes in the rail sector last year, train drivers stopped work this Tuesday evening. The strike, which will last a total of 136 hours over six days and 144 hours in freight transport, is the longest strike Deutsche Bahn has ever seen.
The core demand of the GDL, the smaller of two rail unions in Germany, is a reduction in the working week from 38 to 35 hours without loss of pay, which is deemed by Deutsche Bahn too high.

In announcing the sanctions, U.S. Treasury official Brian Nelson said, ""Hamas has sought to leverage a variety of financial transfer mechanisms, including the exploitation of cryptocurrency, to channel funds to support the group's terrorist activities. Treasury, in close coordination with our allies and partners, will continue to leverage our authorities to target Hamas, its financiers and its international financial infrastructure.""
British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said, 'These sanctions send a clear message to Hamas [that] the [United Kingdom] and our partners are committed to ensuring there is no hiding place for those financing terrorist activities. To reach a sustainable cease-fire in Gaza, Hamas can no longer be in power and able to threaten Israel.""
The U.S. said the sanctions target key financial officials in Gaza who have handled millions of dollars in Iranian transfers to Hamas in recent years.
The newest sanctions follow earlier ones imposed in the weeks after the shock October 7 Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza that Hamas health officials say has killed more than 25,000 people.
In a statement, Treasury said, ""Since at least 2020, Hamas has also used cryptocurrency to transfer some funding in support of operational costs in the West Bank as a means of mitigating the risks of physically moving cash, circumventing border crossings, and evading monitoring by authorities.""

The confiscation of Russia's frozen assets could lead to massive financial losses on part of the US and its allies, the news agency RIA Novosti reported over the weekend. A number of Western nations, including the US, UK, France, and Germany, still have significant investments in Russia that could be lost.
Total foreign direct investments (FDI) in the Russian economy by the EU, G7, Australia, and Switzerland amounted to $288 billion at the end of 2022, the news agency said, citing statistics gathered from the countries themselves. This roughly equals the size of the Russian funds that are frozen and that Western nations are now considering confiscating.
Some $300 billion in Russian reserves remain frozen in the West, more than $200 billion of which are held by the EU, while the rest are in the US. The bulk of the assets the US and its allies might lose if they go on with the confiscation plan are also held by EU nations, the data cited by RIA shows.
In total, the bloc's members had $223.3 billion of assets in Russia as of late 2022, the news agency said. More than $98 billion was formally held by Cyprus, with the Netherlands coming in second with $50.1 billion in assets.
Germany had $17.3 billion invested in the Russian economy, while France and Italy had $16.6 billion and $12.9 billion, respectively, the news agency said. As of the end of 2021, the UK's investments in Russia amounted to $18.9 billion.
Switzerland appeared to be another major investor in the Russian economy with $28.5 billion, while the US itself had $9.6 billion worth of Russian assets, according to the news agency. RIA did not disclose how it derived its estimates.
The Russian central bank provided slightly different FDI figures as of January 1, 2022. It estimated the figure for Cyprus at more than $182 billion and named the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany, and France among the top EU investors, with assets worth between $23 billion and $36 billion.
The bank also put Ireland's investments at $34 billion, and said that the UK had more than $53 billion invested in Russia as of that date. It estimated US investments at $6 billion.
Moscow has warned the West about potential retaliation over any confiscation of its frozen reserves. ""Of course, we analyzed possible retaliatory steps in advance,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in late December. He added, however, that the confiscation of foreign assets in Russia could only be considered in theoretical terms at that time.
Russia has repeatedly warned that a seizure of its assets by the US and its allies would amount to ""theft"" and that it would violate international law and undermine reserve currencies, the global financial system, and the world economy.
The US and other Western nations slapped Russia with unprecedented sanctions over the conflict with Ukraine but had largely balked at the idea of seizing Moscow's substantial reserve holdings that were frozen in Belgium and other EU countries soon after the start of the conflict.
In December, the Financial Times reported that Washington had proposed that working groups from the G7 explore ways to confiscate the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets on February 24, 2024, the second anniversary of the start of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. Earlier this month, meanwhile, Bloomberg also reported that the idea had received the support of the administration of US President Joe Biden.

This significant increase is largely due to China's intensified protection efforts, said Zhang Yue, an official with the administration.
The Giant Panda National Park was established in October 2021, covering a total area of over 22,000 square kilometers and providing around 72 percent of wild giant pandas with significant protection, Zhang said.
Protected areas of the giant panda habitat have grown from 1.39 million hectares to 2.58 million hectares since 2012, effectively maintaining the safety and sustainable development of the wild panda population, data from the administration showed.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature has adjusted the threatened status of giant pandas from ""endangered"" to ""vulnerable.""
""This indicates that China's giant panda conservation efforts have been recognized by the international wildlife conservation community,"" Zhang said.
Apart from the wild population, the global captive population of giant pandas has now reached 728, with 46 pandas successfully bred in captivity last year, administration data revealed.
The genetic diversity of captive giant pandas has also improved. The current captive population of giant pandas can maintain 90 percent genetic diversity for up to 200 years, which means they are a healthy, dynamic and sustainable population, Zhang said, citing scientific assessment.
As for giant pandas living abroad, Zhang said the administration has organized field inspections and assessments of 23 overseas cooperation institutions in 19 countries since 2023, in a bid to strengthen the protection of overseas giant pandas.
""The cooperation institutions generally meet the requirements in terms of venue construction, feeding and nursing, and disease prevention and control measures,"" Zhang said, adding that pandas living abroad are generally ""in good health.""
China will further improve the international cooperation management mechanism for giant pandas, carry out regular daily health monitoring and field inspection and assessment, and continue to strengthen cooperation with international partners for the protection of endangered species and biodiversity, he said."

Cameroon launched a child immunization program for malaria on Monday, using the world's first vaccine for the disease. Late last year, the Central African country became the first on the continent to receive doses of Mosquirix, manufactured by British drugmaker GSK.
Officials have described the campaign as a milestone in the decades-long effort to combat the mosquito-borne illness on the continent, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says accounts for 96% of the world's malaria deaths.
According to the global health agency, Cameroon records over six million malaria cases each year, with the disease killing an estimated 13,839 people in 2021 alone, the majority of whom were children under the age of five.
""The vaccination will save lives. It will provide major relief to families and the country's health system,"" said Aurelia Nguyen, chief program officer at the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), which is helping Cameroon secure the shots.
The WHO approved Mosquirix - the trade name for the RTS,S vaccine - in autumn 2021, following a pilot program in 2019 that provided doses to over 800,000 children in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi.
Cameroon took delivery of 331,200 shots in November, and plans to vaccinate approximately 249,133 children aged 0-24 months across 42 health districts in all ten of its regions.
The vaccine offers only about 36% immunity and must be administered in four doses, according to GAVI.
The alliance said 19 other African countries - some of which have received shipments of Mosquirix - intend to roll out vaccination programs this year, targeting more than three million children.
Last year, GAVI, WHO, and UNICEF announced that a dozen African countries would receive 18 million doses of the vaccine by 2025.
While GSK has stated that it can only produce around 15 million doses of the shots per year, WHO officials have expressed hope that the roll-out of a second vaccine developed by Oxford University will help meet ""high demand"" and reach millions more children.
The low-cost R21/Matrix-M vaccine has reportedly been clinically tested in the UK, Thailand, and several African countries, including a 4,800-child phase III trial in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Mali, and Tanzania. Earlier last year, Ghana became the first country in the world to grant regulatory approval for the use of malaria shots in children aged five to 36 months.

YTF8YAFBAT_630N92WXXBTWNRG,Ukraine Aid-Border Security Deal in Congress Likely a Week Away,"Voice of America 24th January 2024, 09:35 GMT+11","Voice of America 24th January 2024, 09:35 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274104412/ukraine-aid-border-security-deal-in-congress-likely-a-week-away,"Capitol HillÂ  - U.S. lawmakers said Tuesday a deal on border security in return for Republican votes to send nearly $60 billion in aid to Ukraine is nearing completion but likely will not be announced this week.
'The whole world is watching and asking a simple question: Does the United States stand up for its friends?' Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, one of the lead negotiators on the deal, told reporters Tuesday. 'Does the United States stand up for democracy? Does the United States stand up for the preservation of the post-World War II order? Or do we turn our back on our friends, on democracy and on international norms?'
The White House's $106 billion national security supplemental request also includes funding for border security as well as nearly $14 billion in aid to Israel and funding for Taiwan to combat the threat posed by China.
'This is a unique opportunity where divided government has given us an opportunity to get an outcome,' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. 'Virtually all of my members have said to their constituents for a long time, 'We need to fix the border.' This administration is not going to do it unless we force him to.'
Biden asks for $60 billion
The United States has dedicated more than $100 billion to arming and supporting Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, and President Joe Biden has asked Congress to approve another $60 billion. Republicans in Congress have become increasingly skeptical about the need to continue underwriting Ukraine's defense.
The Pentagon announced on December 27 a new $250 million security assistance package for Ukraine that included additional munitions for surface-to-air missiles systems, artillery rounds and more air defense components. The Pentagon still has $4 billion available to provide Ukraine with military aid, but no funds are available to replenish the U.S. military's stockpiles.
'We have heard reports from the Ukrainian government, from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense and their general staff, that they are concerned, as they believe that units do not have the stocks and stores and ammunition that they require,' said Celeste Wallander, assistant U.S. secretary of defense for international security affairs, on Tuesday.
'And that is one of the reasons we have been focusing on the need to answer Congress's questions so that they are able to move forward with that decision to pass the supplemental.'
Republicans set conditions for approving aid
Republicans in the Senate have conditioned approval of any additional money for Ukraine on the simultaneous strengthening of immigration rules aimed at reducing the number of people illegally entering the United States at its southern border and expelling some who are already in the country.
According to multiple news organizations, an estimated 300,000 people crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in December 2023. That estimate marks the highest-ever recorded number of U.S.-Mexico border crossings.
Even if an agreement passes in the Senate, it might not survive in the House, where Republicans hold a very narrow majority. A significant group of Republican House members oppose additional aid to Ukraine, and the party in early October voted out a speaker who partnered with Democrats to pass legislation.
Earlier this month, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson led a delegation of 60 House Republicans to visit the U.S.-Mexico border at Eagle Pass, Texas.
'If President Biden wants a supplemental spending bill focused on national security, it better begin with defending America's national security,' Johnson told reporters at a news conference on the border.
Republicans have proposed their own legislation, H.R. 2, which would resume construction of a border wall as well as impose new restrictions on asylum-seekers.

""You never mention Sita. Without Sita, Ram is incomplete. You only talk of Lord Ram but not Sita; are you anti-women?"" Mamata Banerjee said.
Banerjee said this while addressing a gathering of people who took part in the all-faith rally (Sanhati rally) in Kolkata.
The rally, which was held by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Monday, culminated at the Park Circus Maidan.
""When the Babri Masjid was destroyed, more than a thousand people died, but everyone seems to have quickly forgotten about it. Yesterday, Abhishek Banerjee stated that he cannot uphold his religion by standing over the corpses of so many. I feel the urge to pay tribute to the deceased. Regardless of their religion, we pay homage to these departed souls.""Earlier, about the all-faith rally (Sanhati rally), the Trinamool Congress (TMC) party said that the Sanhati rally showcased solidarity for all religions.
""Unity lies at the heart of all faiths! Today, at the Sanhati rally, massive crowds gathered to express support for the unity of diverse beliefs alongside Mamata Banerjee and Abhishek Banerjee. It was a breathtaking sight as people from various backgrounds marched together, showcasing solidarity for all religions,"" TMC posted on X.
Earlier, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee informed that the Sanhati rally will cover mosques, temples, churches, and gurdwaras along the way.
""Everybody is welcome to join the rally. People of all faiths will be there at the rally,"" she said.
Meanwhile, the Pran Pratishtha ceremony, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for the new idol of Lord Ram was completed in Ayodhya today.
The Prime Minister, while attending the grand event in the temple town of Uttar Pradesh, said that the moment of the unveiling of the Ram Lalla idol is an occasion not merely of triumph but of humility too.
""This is a moment of celebration as well as a reflection of Indian society's maturity. It is an occasion of not merely triumph but humility too. The history of the world is itself proof that many countries get strangled in their own history and such countries faced difficulties when they tried to solve their problems, but the way our country untied the knots of history is proof that our future is going to be more beautiful than our past,"" he said.
The PM said that the construction of the temple, which was supposed to 'set off a firestorm', is a symbol of peace, patience, harmony and the integration of the country.
""There was also a time when some people used to say, 'Ram Mandir bana toh aag lag jaegi' (the construction of the temple will set off a firestorm). Such people could not understand the purity of India's social spirit. The construction of this temple of Ram Lalla is also a symbol of peace, patience, mutual harmony and coordination in Indian society. We are seeing that this construction is not giving birth to any fire, but to energy,"" he added.
The PM also said that Ayodhya's temple is a temple of national consciousness in the form of Ram. (ANI)"

It's shocking to note that on an average every day nine persons have died due to cold on Delhi roads under open sky in January 2024 due to criminal negligence of Arvind Kejriwal government, said Sachdeva in a statement on Tuesday.
The data released by the NGO tells that 180 homeless have died due to cold on Delhi roads evidently establishing that people are forced to sleep on roads due to lack of shelter homes or denial of admission, added the statement.
Delhi BJP President has said that early in December 2023 we had raised the issue of growing numbers of deaths of homeless due to cold and urged Delhi Government to ensure that homeless do not have to sleep on roadsides and get proper shelter homes.
Unfortunately Delhi Government's nodal body Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) has totally failed in its objective duty of providing shelter homes and the concerned Minister Atishi remains involved in petty political blame game paying no attention to the humanitarian duty.
The corruption in Delhi Government is so high that those who somehow get space in Shelter Homes are denied basic amenities like two square meal and medical check up, read the statement from Virendra Sachdeva. (ANI)"

At the same time, in the centre of the Gaza Strip, fighters of the reserve 11th Infantry ""Yiftach"" Brigade eliminated an armed terrorist who was watching the forces from a nearby building, intending to shoot at them.
Also, the Israel Air Force assists the ground forces with attacks to thwart threats to them in real time and with rapid circuit closures to destroy terrorist infrastructure.
In the last day, the battlegroup (combined infantry and armoured forces) fighters of the 89th ""Oz"" Commando Brigade carried out raids on terrorist targets in the heart of the Kahn Yunis refugee camp and encountered many terrorists, among them terrorist squads that were prepared to fire anti-tank missiles on the forces. They were eliminated.
Still in the area of the camp, the fighters of the 7th Brigade Battle Group expanded the attacks, raided combat compounds where they located weapons and eliminated terrorists.
The fighters of the combat team of the Paratrooper Brigade eliminated a large number of terrorists in a series of attacks.

Having been diagnosed, treated and cleared of prostate cancer, Geingob was again found to have cancerous cells after undergoing colonoscopy, gastroscopy and biopsy procedures earlier this month.
The CEO of the Cancer Association of Namibia, Rolf Hansen, told VOA the president has been open about his cancer diagnosis in the past. He said early detection and treatment played a big role in Geingob's past treatment and recovery.
""The scope that was done indicates that there might be cancerous cells in the soft tissue, perhaps the gut, the stomach, something like this,"" Hansen said. ""But until there is a formal prognosis by a doctor that has been publicly released, it's all speculation.""
Political analyst James Makuwa said Namibians would like to know more about what the latest diagnosis means.
""What are the reasons and motives of the president's office sharing a diagnosis which has no prognosis?"" Makuwa asked. ""They are basically putting the country in a state of panic ... because you are telling us the person's diagnosis, but we have no clue what condition he's in, how he is doing, what is going to happen to him. We have no clue.""
According to the statement issued by the president's office, Geingob accepted an offer from scientists and doctors in Los Angeles to undergo a novel therapy for the cancerous cells.
Dr. Elizabeth Kamati lauded Geingob's openness in a country where men are known not to take their health seriously until too late.
""We applaud the president for being very open to us,"" she said. ""He can encourage other men who are also going through the same disease of cancer, which is somehow taboo in our society, to come out and tell them a diagnosis with cancer is not a death sentence.""
The president has come under harsh criticism in the past for seeking medical treatment abroad. However, Namibian doctors acknowledge that cancer treatments are relatively specialized and that the country does not have the equipment and medical expertise to treat the disease effectively."

Sophie was discovered murdered outside her West Cork home near Schull on the morning of December 23, 1996.
Mr. Bailey's solicitor, Frank Buttimer, has confirmed his death.
Mr. Bailey, 66, reportedly collapsed Sunday afternoon in Bantry, where he lived.
Emergency services were summoned, but he remained unresponsive.
Mr. Buttimer expressed his deep sadness upon hearing of Mr. Bailey's death.
He claimed to have known him for 27 years and had had extensive professional interaction with him while representing him in a number of legal proceedings.
Garda arrested Mr. Bailey, a former journalist, twice during their investigation into Ms. Toscan du Plantier's death.
However, the Director of Public Prosecutions decided that no charges would be brought against him concerning her murder.
In 2020, a French court convicted him of murder in his absence and sentenced him to 25 years in prison.
However, the High Court of Ireland ruled that he should not be extradited to France to serve that prison sentence.
It was one of several attempts by the French government to extradite him to face charges in French courts.
Mr. Bailey has been associated with the murder of Ms. du Plantier since it occurred 28 years ago, an association he could not shake no matter how many times he protested his innocence over the years.
Several documentaries have been made about her death.
Netflix produced a three-part series about the murder in 2021. Irish film producer and writer Jim Sheridan produced a documentary called 'Murder At The Cottage: The Search for Justice for Sophie.'"

""We have been demanding this for a long time. We are really happy that our former CM has been awarded with Bharat Ratna. Its impact will also be seen politically. Govt of India was forced to take this decision after we conducted the caste census...Whether this decision was taken right before Lok Sabha elections or not is not important, what is important is that our demand has been fulfilled..."" said Tejashwi Yadav.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed happiness over the center's decision to confer the Bharat Ratna on former Bihar Chief Minister and social justice icon Karpoori Thakur.
""I am delighted that the Government of India has decided to confer the Bharat Ratna on the beacon of social justice, the great Jan Nayak Karpoori Thakur Ji and that too at a time when we are marking his birth centenary.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his tweet posted on X on Tuesday, highlighted that Karpoori Thakur was committed to uplifting the downtrodden.
""This prestigious recognition is a testament to his enduring efforts as a champion for the marginalised and a stalwart of equality and empowerment. His unwavering commitment to uplift the downtrodden and his visionary leadership have left an indelible mark on India's socio-political fabric.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised that Karpoori Thakur served as an inspiration to attain the goal of social justice.
""This award not only honours his remarkable contributions but also inspires us to continue his mission of creating a more just and equitable society.""While welcoming the decision to confer Bharat Ratna on Karpoori Thakur, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi took a dig at the centre for not releasing the Social and Economic Caste Census and said that the country now needs real justice, not symbolic politics.
Congress General Secretary Jairam Ramesh took a dig at the BJP and said, ""Even though it reflects the Modi government's desperation and hypocrisy, the Indian National Congress welcomes the award of the Bharat Ratna posthumously to the champion of social justice, Jannayak Karpoori Thakurji.""Ramesh also slammed the Centre for not releasing the Socio-Economic Caste Census 2011.
""Bhagidari Nyay is one of the five pillars of the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra. It will need a nationwide caste census as a starting point. Rahul Gandhi has been consistently advocating this but the Modi government has all along refused to release the results of the Socio-Economic Caste Census 2011 and also refused to commit itself to conducting an updated nationwide caste census, which will be the most appropriate tribute to Jannayak Karpoori Thakurji.""This prestigious award is a tribute to Karpoori Thakur's lifelong dedication to the upliftment of the underprivileged sections of society and his relentless fight for social justice. Known affectionately as 'Jan Nayak' (People's Leader), Thakur's simplicity in his conduct was highly inspiring and his contribution to Indian politics has been monumental.
The former Bihar CM was born on January 24, 1924, and passed away on February 17, 1988. Thakur was born in 1924 in one of the most backward sections of society, the Nai Samaj. He was a remarkable leader whose political journey was marked by his unwavering commitment to the marginalised sections of society.
He served as the Chief Minister of Bihar and was a key figure in the struggle against social discrimination and inequality. His commitment to affirmative action gave representation and opportunities to the poor, oppressed, exploited and deprived sections of the country.
Embarking on his political career with the Praja Socialist Party, he later joined forces with the Janata Party during his initial tenure as the chief minister of Bihar from 1977 to 1979. Over time, he established connections with the Janata Dal, marking a significant shift in his political affiliation. (ANI)"

Between Dec. 1 last year and Jan. 23 this year, CDC was notified of 23 confirmed U.S. cases of measles, including seven direct importations of measles by international travelers and two outbreaks with more than five cases each, according to a report of the agency.
Most of these cases were among children and adolescents who had not received a measles-containing vaccine.
Measles cases often originate from unvaccinated or undervaccinated U.S. residents who travel internationally and then transmit the disease to people who are not vaccinated against measles, according to CDC.
The increased number of measles importations seen in recent weeks is reflective of a rise in global measles cases and a growing global threat from the disease, said CDC."

""The (Hungarian) government is unwilling to bear any financial burden"" of arms shipments, Szijjarto said at a press conference in Brussels during the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting.
Szijjarto also criticized a new proposal by the European External Action Service (EEAS), aimed at setting up a five-billion-euro (5.4 billion U.S. dollars) framework within the European Peace Facility (EPF) for military aid to Ukraine.
Szijjarto said that while in his opinion ""it is completely unacceptable for Hungary to give further momentum to arms shipments,"" he also respects the sovereignty of other EU members.
With regard to sanctions against Russia, he said that ""this strategy has failed, there is no battlefield solution"" to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. (1 euro = 1.09 U.S. dollar)"

Ukraine is constantly suffering a lack of munitions to fight Russia because Western policymakers are struggling to provide Kiev with the necessary support as they get bogged down in internal debates, Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba has said.
In an interview with German daily Die Welt on Wednesday, Kuleba admitted that an insufficient amount of artillery ammunition had been a problem for Kiev since the very start of the conflict in February 2022.
He went on to complain that while Ukraine was doing its utmost to ramp up its ammo production, its Western partners were struggling to do the same.
At the political level, the minister continued, both NATO and EU countries are in favor of increasing production. ""But when it comes to making concrete decisions, we see how our partners sometimes drown in endless discussions. The problem is that we don't have time for that. We have to swim.""
Kuleba noted that while he had confidence in the nation's military, a lack of ammunition meant that more Ukrainian soldiers would die repelling Russian attacks. At the same time, he cited frontline troops as saying that Moscow seemed to be ""superior in the amount of artillery ammunition available.""
In the spring of 2023, the EU pledged to deliver one million shells to Ukraine over the next 12 months, but by late November had shipped only one-third of that amount, with German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius warning that the bloc was highly likely to miss the target. Against this backdrop, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov last week described the ammo shortage as ""a very real and pressing problem.""
At the same time, EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton promised last week that the bloc would have the capacity to produce one million shells a year by this spring, with a further 30-40% increase by the end of 2024.
Meanwhile, the Washington Post reported last month, citing Ukrainian troops, that Kiev's gunners could only fire 10-20 shells a day, down from 50, adding that Russian forces did not appear to have a similar problem.
The Russian Defense Ministry said earlier this month that the country's defense base had ramped up artillery shell production by 17.5 times since the start of the conflict. Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu has said that frontline troops are being provided with quantities of ammunition adequate ""to the scope of the tasks they perform.""
Kuleba remarks come after Kiev's much-hyped counteroffensive that failed to breach Russian defenses. The Russian military has estimated Ukrainian losses since the start of the push in early June at around 160,000 troops.

CM Yadav made the remark while addressing the second State Mining Ministers' Conference in Kushabhau Thackeray Auditorium in the state capital Bhopal on Tuesday.
The conference was presided over by Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi. During the program, CM Yadav also received a certificate for Madhya Pradesh securing the first position in the country for the best performance in the auctioning of mineral blocks. Notably, the state stood first in the country by auctioning 29 mining blocks.
The Chief Minister and Union Minister Joshi also visited the exhibition organised by the union ministry of mines. The exhibition showcases the achievements of the country's leading mining companies, private agencies and start-ups, including the Geological Survey of India, District Mineral Establishments.
Speaking on the occasion, CM Yadav said, ""Our state is not only rich in forest wealth, mineral wealth and natural resources but also advanced and prosperous in terms of rituals, culture and religion. The state government is grateful to Union Minister Joshi for giving Madhya Pradesh the opportunity to host the State Mining Ministers' Conference. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and guidance of Union Minister Joshi, the reforms and innovations being made in the mining sector will help in the economic strengthening of all the states.""The initiative taken under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi to discover and utilise the mineral wealth of the land as well as the marine area of the country is commendable. The increasing availability of accurate information about the mineral wealth existing in different geographical parts of the country is opening the doors for the progress of the country. Activities like the auction of mining blocks have made it possible to utilise the mineral wealth in the interest of people. The people's lives are being transformed using the Mining Fund, the Chief Minister said.
He also said that this conference would definitely prove to be a milestone for the progress in the mining sector and it would also pave the way for resolving the inter-departmental difficulties being faced in the mining sector. Besides, special initiatives would be taken to solve the problems related to the environment and forest department in the mining sector.
Meanwhile, Union Minister Joshi appreciated the work done by Madhya Pradesh under DMFT (District Mineral Foundation Trust) for the development and livelihood of the people affected by mining activities.
Congratulating CM Yadav for Madhya Pradesh securing the first position in the successful auction of mineral blocks, Joshi said, ""Mineral resources have an important role in strengthening the country's economy. The auction of mineral blocks and innovations have increased the revenue. Other states should also take initiative towards auctioning mineral blocks. States can bring significant improvement in their economy through sustainable mining. The Central Government is ready to provide all possible cooperation to all the states in the mining sector.""Under the leadership of PM Modi, the country is now moving towards mining of critical minerals and rarest minerals. Data repository availability has increased and licencelease clearances are also being simplified and expedited, Union Minister Joshi added. (ANI)"

Zimbabwean Health Minister Douglas Mombeshora told reporters in Harare on Wednesday that the country had recorded 20,121 suspected cholera cases and 376 deaths - six of them since Tuesday. He said the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund had secured 2.3 million cholera vaccine doses for the country, with nearly 900,000 of them to be administered next week.
""The vaccination campaign is expected to start from the 29th of January in [a] phased approach to the hot spots,"" he said. ""This is because the doses are not enough to cover the whole country. And then roll on to the other affected districts as we receive more vaccines. The challenge is that there is a shortage of vaccine in the world because cholera is not in Zimbabwe alone. So, all other countries that have reported cholera are also getting the same vaccine from the same source. So, it's now controlled by the WHO. Otherwise only the rich countries will wipe out the vaccines before others get them.""
Mombeshora said 37 African countries had confirmed cases of cholera. The WHO's Africa office did not confirm the number Wednesday.

In a statement to VOA, Dr. Paul Ngwakum, regional health adviser for UNICEF in eastern and southern Africa, said the cholera outbreak ""remains a serious public health concern and continues to impact children's lives in the region. An unprecedented surge in cholera cases is being recorded in the region due to many factors, including extreme climatic events such as droughts, cyclones and flooding ... With porous borders and high population movements, cholera is spreading fast.""
Mombeshora is urging Zimbabweans to accept the cholera vaccine.
'This is not a new vaccine and it has been used all over the world,"" he said. ""The only reason why we do not have it enough is because it is only manufactured on demand. Therefore, it's the same vaccine and it's very, very safe. We did not receive an adverse report in our past use of it. I have had a cholera vaccine before, years ago, nothing to worry about.""
Dr. Prosper Chonzi, Harare's director of health services, says now that there is vaccine, people must not ease up on hygienic practices. Chonzi said he was not happy that Harare is still full of vendors selling uninspected fruits and vegetables.

""I think the general economy is playing against us,"" he said. ""We have been doing these hide-and-seek games, chase after vendors, it has not been working. At least if we clean up for now, then we come up with medium- to long-term plans to maintain the clean environment that is there. As the director of health, I am not happy with the vending situation in the city. It is playing against what we want to achieve as we try to contain the outbreak. If you buy food from uninspected premises, the chances of you contracting not only cholera, but typhoid, dysentery and other diarrhea, are very high.""
Zimbabwe's moribund economy is forcing citizens to venture into vending as a source of income as jobs are hard to come by, with some estimates putting unemployment at about 85%. Experts say that is making the fight against a cholera outbreak difficult with the country recording 1,000 new cases every week since the beginning of the year, according to the United Nations."

The biopic of Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist behind the atomic bomb that was air-dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the film won nominations in 13 categories, including 'Best Film', 'Best Director' and 'Best Adapted Screenplay'.
Reacting to the Oscar nominations, Nolan told The Hollywood Reporter, ""We've clearly caught a wave with the film and that's something we're very grateful for. We never imagined this level of success. But we did have faith that it was a great story. You know, certainly audiences going to it in the summer, I think it was the strength of the story itself, this great piece of American history that was driving things for us. Also, for a film that came out in the summer to be recognized by the Academy at the end of the year or beginning of next year, it's just a very rewarding thing to wake up to. Frankly, it's not really what we expected when we set out with this project and it's a wonderful surprise.""Significantly, the movie marks Nolan's first time landing both directing and writing nominations for one of his films and is also his most nominated film ever. (2008's The Dark Knight, 2010's Inception and 2017's Dunkirk each received eight.)The 2024 Oscars will be held on Sunday, March 10 at the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood in Los Angeles.

Zambian Minister of Health Sylvia Masebo said the ministry has received the remaining vaccines from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, through the United Nations, bringing the total vaccines to 1.7 million doses.
She said in a statement on the cholera situation that plans are underway to procure additional vaccines from alternative sources to be administered to people in cholera-prone areas.
The minister, however, expressed concern that some sections of society are refusing to take the vaccine, adding that this is unfortunate as vaccines are meant to secure the lives of people.
Zambia commenced the administration of the vaccine in five cholera hotspots in the capital of Lusaka last week after receiving 1.4 million doses.
According to the minister, about 1.2 million people have received the vaccine so far, representing 69 percent coverage.
Meanwhile, the minister said the government is concerned about the number of people dying in communities due to presenting themselves late at health facilities.
""We encourage our people to visit their nearest health post or community health worker as a point to access oral rehydration therapy as they make their way to the centers,"" she said.
Zambia has been battling a cholera outbreak since last October, with 12,719 cases and 498 deaths recorded since then.
A total of 11,399 people have been discharged, according to the Ministry of Health."

Earlier in the day, Duda announced the decision to pardon the two politicians convicted of abuse of power and ordered their immediate release.
In March 2015, Kaminski and Wasik were sentenced to three years in prison for orchestrating a sting operation while heading the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau in 2007. But in November 2015, after the Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power, Duda, a PiS ally, pardoned them both, allowing Kaminski to become interior minister.
After being sentenced to two years in prison last December, they were both taken into custody in early January, and have since been on hunger strikes.
Duda has insisted that his pardon in 2015 was valid, while some legal experts have argued that it was ineffective as it had been granted before the verdict was reached."

ZMQH7I4MFJ_79TJSFUD1CRRFHJ,Serum Institute of India joins CEPI global network to boost production of affordable outbreak vaccine,"ANI 24th January 2024, 00:03 GMT+11","ANI 24th January 2024, 00:03 GMT+11",20240123,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103903/serum-institute-of-india-joins-cepi-global-network-to-boost-production-of-affordable-outbreak-vaccine,"By Shalini BhardwajPune (Maharashtra) [India], January 23 (ANI): The world's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India Private Ltd (SII), is joining a growing Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) network of vaccine producers in the Global South to support more rapid, agile, and equitable responses to future public health disease outbreaks.
The addition of SII to the CEPI manufacturing network will be a significant boost to vaccine production efforts in Global South regions and will mean the world is better prepared to achieve the 100 Days Mission to develop new vaccines against known or novel infectious diseases within three months of a pandemic threat being recognised.
To prepare for such a scenario, CEPI is investing up to 30 million dollars to build upon SII's proven track record of rapid response to outbreaks of infectious disease, expanding the company's existing ability to swiftly supply investigational vaccines in the face of epidemic and pandemic threats.
This would then enable CEPI-backed vaccine developers to quickly transfer their technology to SII within days or weeks of an outbreak to begin rapid production and equitable distribution of affordable vaccines to affected populations.
Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI, said, ""As part of CEPI's global manufacturing network, SII's world-renowned manufacturing and rapid response capabilities are poised to play a critical role in enabling swift and equitable access to affordable outbreak vaccines for the Global South. Living in an era of heightened epidemic and pandemic risk, evidenced by the increasing prevalence, speed, and spread of outbreaks of infectious disease, we must prepare to confront these threats head-on to avoid another COVID-like catastrophe in the future.""Created by CEPI to expand the global footprint of vaccine production, the manufacturing network focuses on vaccine makers in the Global South near areas at high risk of outbreaks caused by deadly viral threats like Lassa Fever, Nipah, Disease X, and other pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential prioritised by CEPI. Given SII's already proven production capabilities, in the event of an outbreak, the company may be called upon to promptly supply investigational vaccines for preclinical and clinical testing as well as large-scale supply.
Shortening the time taken to manufacture and validate the first batches of experimental vaccines will be key to enabling a response to an escalating outbreak within just 100 days - a goal created by CEPI and embraced by the G7, G20 and industry leaders - and could help stop a future pandemic in its tracks.
Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India, said, ""As a leading vaccine manufacturer, we're committed to utilizing our well-established manufacturing and rapid response capabilities to strengthen epidemic preparedness and increase access to life-saving vaccines for those who need them most at an affordable price. This collaboration will enable us to respond more rapidly and equitably to public health disease outbreaks, particularly in Global South countries where access to life-saving vaccines can be limited.""With CEPI's funding, SII will also support the development, stockpiling and licensure of new vaccines against CEPI's priority pathogens. CEPI and SII are exploring which CEPI-backed vaccines SII will support.
SII becomes the fourth member of CEPI's global manufacturing network. Other members include Aspen in South Africa, Institut Pasteur de Dakar in Senegal, and Bio Farma in Indonesia.
SII, which supplies vaccines to more than 170 countries, has a proven track record of rapid response to outbreaks of infectious diseases. In 2022, the company responded swiftly to an outbreak of Sudan ebolavirus in Uganda by delivering doses of the investigational ChAdOx1 SUDV vaccine in just 80 days. (ANI)"

The majority of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council are from the Global North, which has created ""a serious problem"" for the balance of power at the organization, Namibian Deputy Prime Minister Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah has told RT in an exclusive interview.
International institutions should more equitably support the development needs of low- and high-income countries alike, she said.
""In fact, now the Security Council is paralyzed,"" she stated. For this reason, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) will continue ""to demand the reform of the UN Security Council.""
Nandi-Ndaitwah also pointed out that the financial institutions haven't helped many of the developing countries.
According to her, Namibia is classified by the World Bank as an upper-middle-income country, making it very difficult for the African nation of over 2.5 million people to access financial resources. The rates should be the same regardless of country classification, she added.
Nandi-Ndaitwah believes that the NAM and all developing countries' progressive forces ""will be able to succeed, will develop and take our people out of poverty.""
Namibia has ""young people who are unemployed and it's (up to) us to create jobs for them,"" she concluded.

Pretoria called for a preliminary ruling to compel Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza as part of two days of hearings earlier this month. The allegations have been strongly denied by Israel, which has called for the case to be dismissed.
Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, launching rockets and taking hostages. The Israel Defense Forces responded with a massive bombing campaign and ground invasion of Gaza, as well as cutting off the water and electricity supplies. Palestinian health officials report that since the war began, more than 25,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in Gaza. According to official Israeli statistics, at least 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed, and 248 hostages were taken in the initial assault by Palestinian armed groups.

ZYUBDZC7QE_3XEQWIO2HF778TZ,Gay emojis must be banned Russian MP,"RT.com 23rd January 2024, 05:14 GMT+11","RT.com 23rd January 2024, 05:14 GMT+11",20240122,bignewsnetwork.com,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/274103145/gay-emojis-must-be-banned-russian-mp,"Some of the pictograms used in smartphones promote LGBTQ values in violation of the country's laws, Aleksey Zhuravlev has said
At least two dozen emojis found in smartphones promote nontraditional sexual relations and should be banned in Russia, the first deputy chairman of the parliamentary defense committee, Aleksey Zhuravlev has stated.
Some pictograms depict ""same-sex couples with children, kissing men, kissing women, a pregnant man, a male-bride with a mustache, bearded women"" and others, the lawmaker told Rossiyskaya Gazeta on Friday. Zhuravlev is the leader of the Rodina (Motherland) party and a member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) in the State Duma.
Emojis are mainly employed in instant messengers and social media sites, which are the most popular platforms among users, he noted.
""All this is seen by kids, who constantly send those emojis to each other,"" Zhuravlev said.
The MP pointed out that a law banning LGBTQ propaganda in Russia is already in force, insisting that the pictograms represent ""exactly the type of propaganda"" that it's supposed to tackle.
""Measures must be taken to remove those emojis and block their use in Russia,"" he declared.
A ban on disseminating LGBTQ material among those aged under 18 was introduced in Russia in 2013.
In 2022, the legislation was expanded to include both minors and adults. The law on the ""protection of traditional values"" made it illegal to promote LGBTQ, pedophilia, and sex changes in advertising, books, movies, and media.
In November last year, Russia's Supreme Court outlawed the ""international LGBTQ public movement,"" designating it an extremist organization.
