3CK16LVUSU_YN0EIDR95KW74TI,"Death toll in Gaza rises above 25,000, Palestinian officials say",By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24063970.death-toll-gaza-rises-25-000-palestinian-officials-say/,"The Palestinian death toll in Gaza from more than three months of war between Israel and the territory‚Äôs Hamas rulers has soared past 25,000, the Health Ministry has said.
Spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said on Sunday at least 178 bodies were brought to Gaza‚Äôs hospitals in 24 hours, along with nearly 300 injured people.
The war began with Hamas‚Äôs surprise attack into Israel on October 7, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostages.
Israel responded with a three-week air campaign and then a ground invasion into northern Gaza that flattened entire neighbourhoods.
Gaza‚Äôs Health Ministry said 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since October 7, and another 62,681 have been injured. Mr al-Qidra said many casualties remain buried under the rubble from Israeli strikes or in areas where medics cannot reach them.
The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its death toll but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and children.
Israeli ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel‚Äôs creation.
Some 85% of Gaza‚Äôs population have fled their homes, with hundreds of thousands packing into UN-run shelters and tent camps in the southern part of the tiny coastal enclave.
UN officials say a quarter of the population of 2.3 million is starving as only a trickle of humanitarian aid enters because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it fights in dense, residential neighbourhoods.
The military says 195 of its soldiers have been killed since the start of the Gaza offensive.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep up the offensive until Hamas is dismantled and all the hostages are returned.
Nearly half of the captives were released during a week-long ceasefire in November in exchange for the release of scores of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.
Israel says some 130 remain in captivity, but only around 100 are believed to still be alive."
3GQD09ZB5F_ATSUZFLMVUYND01,Dozens killed in shelling on market in Russian-occupied Ukraine,By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064122.dozens-killed-shelling-market-russian-occupied-ukraine/,"Moscow-installed officials have said Ukrainian shelling killed at least 27 people and wounded 25 at a market on the outskirts of Donetsk, a Russian-occupied city in the eastern part of the country.
Among the injured in the suburb of Tekstilshchik were two children, said Denis Pushilin, the local leader.
Ukrainian officials in Kyiv did not comment on the incident, and the claims could not be independently verified by The Associated Press.
Both sides have increasingly relied on longer-range attacks this winter amid largely unchanged positions on the 1,500-kilometre (930-mile) front line in the nearly two-year-old war.
The artillery shells that hit the area had been fired from the area of Kurakhove and Krasnohorivka to the west, Mr Pushilin said, adding that emergency services responded to the scene.
UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres ‚Äústrongly condemns all attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including today‚Äôs shelling of the city of Donetsk in Ukraine‚Äù, according to a UN spokesperson, adding that all such attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law.
Donetsk is one of four regions in Ukraine that Russia annexed illegally in 2022, months after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion.
Russia‚Äôs Foreign Ministry also blamed Ukraine and described the strike as a ‚Äúterrorist attack‚Äù.
Also on Sunday, a fire broke out at a chemical transport terminal at Russia‚Äôs Ust-Luga port following two explosions, regional officials said.
Local media reported the port had been attacked by Ukrainian drones, causing a gas tank to explode.
The blaze was at a site run by Russia‚Äôs second-largest natural gas producer, Novatek, 100 miles south-west of St Petersburg.
In a press statement to Russian media outlet RBC, the company said the fire was the result of an ‚Äúexternal influence‚Äù. It also said it had paused operations at the port.
Yuriy Zapalatskiy, the head of Russia‚Äôs Kingisepp district where the port is based, said in a statement there were no casualties, but the district has been placed on high alert.
News outlet Fontanka reported two drones had been detected flying towards St Petersburg on Sunday morning, but they were redirected towards the Kingisepp area.
The Russian Ministry of Defence did not report any drone activity in the Kingisepp area in its daily briefing. It said four Ukrainian drones had been downed in Russia‚Äôs Smolensk region, and two more had been shot down in the Oryol and Tula regions.
Russian officials previously confirmed a Ukrainian drone had been downed on the outskirts of St Petersburg on Thursday."
43EESBYTY7_KOJQ4TO0EUUO19Z,Harry recalls John Travolta‚Äôs dance with Diana as he seeks to ‚Äòfly together‚Äô,By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24063856.harry-recalls-john-travoltas-dance-diana-seeks-fly-together/,"The Duke of Sussex told John Travolta it would be fitting for them to fly together after recalling how the actor famously danced with his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, more than three decades ago.
Harry made the comments in his speech at the Living Legends of Aviation ceremony in Los Angeles hosted by aviation ambassador Travolta, 69, hours after the duke withdrew his High Court libel claim against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday.
During the event, where he was recognised for his work as a British Army veteran and pilot, Harry told Travolta: ‚ÄúI was just a one-year-old when you danced with my mum at the White House, and now look at us. The only thing left to do is‚Ä¶ not dance together but fly together.‚Äù
Diana, who died following a car crash in 1997, took to the dance floor with Grease star Travolta during a dinner at the White House in 1985.
Harry began his speech by expressing his gratitude and said: ‚ÄúI am proud to be recognised among such a dynamic and inspiring group of individuals.
‚ÄúFor me, flying has been a transcendent experience, a close encounter with magic, an invitation to both protect freedom‚Ä¶ and to feel free ‚Äì and, funny enough, an opportunity to ground oneself, without actually being grounded.
‚ÄúI found my flight training ‚Äì which was over the course of three years ‚Äì to be one of life‚Äôs greatest lessons. In this lesson, it triggered a vast array of feelings.
‚ÄúI remember the anticipation before my first solo flight in a Firefly.
‚ÄúThe disbelief that my instructor would dare to have the confidence in sending me up by myself.
‚ÄúI remember feeling surprised and relieved when I returned to terra firma in one piece.
‚ÄúTo the average person it would‚Äôve looked like the most mundane flight in the history of aviation.
‚ÄúBut to me, it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.
‚ÄúNext was the Squirrel helicopter. In the take-off I felt excitement as the rotor blades beat the frothy clouds and pulled us up into God‚Äôs playground.
‚ÄúI felt immense frustration in perfecting the hover, then immense satisfaction in doing so.
‚ÄúI felt pride in receiving my flight wings at the end of our course, and then nervousness about flying the Apache.
‚ÄúI experienced collective bemusement about our windowless classroom. And then collective happiness to have finally finished ground school, after three months, in that same windowless classroom.
‚ÄúI struggled to comprehend how long it took to start up the aircraft in the first weeks.
‚ÄúI had respect for the Apache in a hover. And was in awe of it flying at night. So many moments as a pilot where you feel like you‚Äôre walking on air.
‚ÄúAnd throughout each flight during my military career, the one constant was always trust.
‚ÄúTrust in the aircraft, trust in my fellow comrades, trust in my many mentors, and above all else: trust in myself.‚Äù

A post shared by Living Legends of Aviation (@livinglegendsofaviation)

He ended the speech: ‚ÄúThank you again for this incredible honour.‚Äù
The duke‚Äôs speech came after he dropped a libel claim against Associated Newspapers Limited over a February 2022 Mail on Sunday article about his challenge against the Home Office, following a decision to change his publicly funded security arrangements when visiting the UK.
His lawyers filed a notice of discontinuance at the High Court in London on Friday, while a spokesperson said the duke‚Äôs focus remains ‚Äúon the safety of his family‚Äù and on his legal action against the Home Office.
Hours after the announcement, Harry appeared at the 21st annual Living Legends of Aviation ceremony, honouring those who make significant contributions to aviation and aerospace.
The Duchess of Sussex, who had been expected to attend the event, was not present as one of their children became unwell, the PA news agency understands.
The duke completed two tours of Afghanistan as a forward air controller and an Apache helicopter pilot, having flown countless training missions in the UK, US and Australia.
He served for 10 years in the military, rising to the rank of Captain, and later founded the Invictus Games ‚Äì a sporting event for wounded military personnel and veterans."
7ORNHYO9DD_XGK5UF2FDU5XEIB,All ScotRail services to stop early as Storm Isha rages through Scotland,By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064482.scotrail-services-stop-early-storm-isha-rages-scotland/,"Scotland‚Äôs railway operator has said that all of its services will cease early on Sunday due to the effects of Storm Isha.
ScotRail has said there will also be no Monday morning rush-hour services, with an amber weather warning for wind set to come into force on Sunday at 6pm.
Network Rail says it has ‚Äútaken the decision to close the network to all freight and passenger trains from 22:00 tonight until Monday morning‚Äù, and services will begin being withdrawn at 7pm.
The warning was previously scheduled to come into effect at 9pm, but has been pushed forward by the Met Office as the weather worsens.
A yellow warning for rain is also in place.
A flight travelling from Sharm El Sheikh to Glasgow Airport has declared an emergency due to Storm Isha.
A spokesperson for Glasgow Airport said the TUI flight was ‚Äúdiverted to Manchester due to current weather conditions‚Äù.
They added: ‚ÄúThis is happening across many UK airports due to Storm Isha.‚Äù
TUI was contacted for comment.
Network Rail made the decision to close the railway to passengers in the interest of public and staff safety.
Customers have been advised that any trains set to depart before 7pm will complete their journey as planned.
Repair teams are responding to reports of a tree which has fallen on overhead wires on a train track in Gartcosh, Cumbernauld.

The Met Office has also warned that damage to properties and businesses is possible.
Power cuts, poor mobile phone coverage and flying debris can also be expected.
Train lines on Monday will undergo a safety inspection, meaning trains will run later than usual.
Customers whose journey has been cancelled or disrupted due to adverse weather can travel two days after the date on their ticket, or also apply for a refund on any unused tickets.
Customer are advised to check the ScotRail website or app before travelling on Monday.
Phil Campbell, ScotRail customer operations director, said:¬† ‚ÄúThe heavy wind and ongoing rain hitting most parts of the country mean that it will not be safe for our customers and our staff, and all ScotRail train services will be suspended from 19.00 tonight.
‚ÄúWe know the impact that the withdrawal of train services will have on customers, but our first priority is always to ensure the safety of staff and passengers ‚Äì and this is a necessary step to ensure everyone‚Äôs safety during the severe weather.
‚ÄúOur colleagues at Network Rail Scotland will be working flat out through the night and into the morning to carry out safety checks, and assess what repairs are required to reopen the railway.
‚ÄúHowever, customers will be unable to travel early Monday morning, as trains will not be able to operate until the infrastructure has been made safe.
‚ÄúWe will update our website, mobile app, and social media feeds when we have more information, and customers should check for the latest updates before they attempt to travel tomorrow.‚Äù
Ashleigh Robson, head of transport resilience at Transport Scotland said: ‚ÄúStorm Isha will create difficult travelling conditions across Scotland today and tomorrow.
‚ÄúHigh winds are expected across much of Scotland, with significant rain from the central belt up towards Inverness, alongside another area of heavy rain anticipated for the south of Scotland.
‚ÄúMet Office yellow warnings have been in place from midday ‚Äì with the more severe high-impact amber warnings for wind in place from 6pm through until Monday morning.
‚ÄúSurface water will reduce visibility when driving, high sided vehicles are at risk and the strength of winds could also pose a risk to pedestrians.‚Äù
She added: ‚ÄúTo ensure passenger safety, rail services are concluding from 7pm this evening across the network.
‚ÄúRail services will also be impacted tomorrow morning until the tracks are visually inspected for any damage or debris.
‚ÄúFerry services are already impacted ‚Äì and flights may be impacted also, so it‚Äôs important you check with your public transport operator for the latest updates.‚Äù
The railway operator also said a tree has struck a train at Crosshill on the Cathcart Circle.
No injuries have been reported and response teams were on their way when Network rail reported the incident at around 7.15pm on Sunday.

The bodies of two young girls, a 36-year-old woman and a 45-year-old man were found at an address in Costessey, Norfolk, on Friday morning.
A man called 999 from the property on Allan Bedford Crescent at around 6am that day, but police were not dispatched there.
Officers made the discovery around an hour and 15 minutes later after a member of the public alerted them at around 7am.
Norfolk Constabulary has referred itself to the police watchdog over the delay.
Detective Chief Inspector Chris Burgess said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve spoken to witnesses and neighbours, carried out house-to-house inquiries, examined local CCTV and completed initial scene investigations.
‚ÄúAs a result of this, we‚Äôre not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.‚Äù
A force spokesperson said: ‚ÄúA second referral has been made to the IOPC today following the identification of a 999 call made yesterday morning at 6am by a man at the address and police resources were not deployed.
‚ÄúThe IOPC will assess the circumstances of the call and determine the appropriate level of investigation required.
‚ÄúAs a result, no further information relating to the circumstances of this call will be released at this time.‚Äù
The force had already referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct on Friday over police contact about a missing person inquiry at the address last month.¬†Detectives said the man and two children lived at the address, but the woman was visiting and lived elsewhere. All four were found with injuries.
The man has been named in reports as Bartlomiej Kuczynski.
A post-mortem examination for the adult victims will take place on Sunday, while the girls will be formally identified on Wednesday.
Detectives said they they will not reveal the identities of the victims before they have been formally identified.
A cordon remains in place and specialist officers are supporting relatives of the victims.
Officers in uniform will continue patrols in the area on Sunday.
Churches opened on Saturday so people could pay tribute to the victims.
Bishop of Norwich Graham Usher said local clergy were offering support in the communities they serve and would be opening churches over the weekend for those who wish to pay tribute.

DVAJAITV51_ALY44GTPS1OUOUU,Ron DeSantis ends struggling presidential bid and endorses Donald Trump,By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064660.ron-desantis-ends-struggling-presidential-bid-endorses-donald-trump/,"Florida governor Ron DeSantis has suspended his Republican presidential campaign, ending his 2024 White House bid just before the New Hampshire primary while endorsing his bitter rival Donald Trump.
The decision leaves Mr Trump and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley as the last major candidates remaining in the race ahead of Tuesday‚Äôs New Hampshire primary.
This is the scenario Mr Trump‚Äôs foes in the Republican Party have long sought, raising the stakes for this week‚Äôs contest as the party‚Äôs last chance to stop the former president who has so far dominated the race.
But as some Trump critics cheered, Mr DeSantis nodded towards Mr Trump‚Äôs primary dominance ‚Äì and attacked Ms Haley ‚Äì in an exit video he posted on social media.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,‚Äù Mr DeSantis said in the straight-to-camera video, delivered in a cheerful tone, through forced smiles.
He continued: ‚ÄúI signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honour that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can‚Äôt go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.‚Äù
Ms Haley spoke at a campaigning stop in Seabrook, New Hampshire, just as Mr DeSantis announced his decision.
‚ÄúHe ran a great race, he‚Äôs been a good governor, and we wish him well,‚Äù she told a room packed with supporters and media.
‚ÄúHaving said that, it‚Äôs now one fella and one lady left.‚Äú
Mr DeSantis‚Äôs decision, while perhaps not surprising given his 30-point blowout loss last week in Iowa, marks the end of an extraordinary decline for a high-profile governor once thought to be a legitimate threat to Mr Trump‚Äôs supremacy in the Republican Party.
He entered the 2024 presidential contest with major advantages in his quest to take on Mr Trump, and early primary polls suggested Mr DeSantis was in a strong position to do just that.
He and his allies amassed a political fortune well in excess of 130 million dollars (¬£102 million), and he boasted a significant legislative record on issues important to many conservatives, such as abortion and the teaching of race and gender issues in schools.
Such advantages did not survive the reality of presidential politics in 2024.
From a high-profile announcement that was plagued by technical glitches to constant upheavals to his staff and campaign strategy, Mr DeSantis struggled to find his footing in the primary.
He lost the Iowa caucuses ‚Äì which he had vowed to win ‚Äì by 30 percentage points to Mr Trump.
Mr DeSantis‚Äôs allies said that private discussions began shortly after Iowa to decide how to bow out of the race gracefully.
They ultimately decided that he needed to endorse Mr Trump, despite the deeply personal feud between them.
‚ÄúWhile I‚Äôve had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear,‚Äù said Mr DeSantis, who is in his second and final term as Florida‚Äôs governor, which ends in January 2027.
The endorsement was a stunning tail-between-his-legs moment for Mr DeSantis, whom Mr Trump has mercilessly and relentlessly taunted in deeply personal terms for the better part of a year now.
For Mr Trump, whose team includes many former DeSantis staff members, the attacks have often felt more like sport than political strategy.
Mr Trump and his aides have blasted the governor as disloyal for running in the first place, mocked his eating habits and his personality and accused him of wearing high heels to boost his height.
Mr DeSantis‚Äôs team joined Mr Trump in attacking Ms Haley as news of his departure rippled across the political landscape.
Some doubt Ms Haley, who was seen as splitting Republican votes and preventing a head-to-head match up with Mr Trump, would benefit from Mr DeSantis‚Äôs decision.
‚ÄúShe will not be the nominee,‚Äù key DeSantis supporter Representative Chip Roy (Republican-Texas) told The Associated Press.
‚ÄúShe will not be the president of the United States.‚Äù
Mr Trump had already shifted his focus to Ms Haley in recent weeks, but minutes after Mr DeSantis‚Äôs announcement, the former president‚Äôs campaign released a new memo highlighting the pressure on Ms Haley to win New Hampshire.
‚ÄúNow that we are a mere 48 hours from the primary, the tone has shifted mightily. We see it, you see it, but make no mistake, if Nikki Haley loses in New Hampshire ‚Äì there are only two options,‚Äù wrote senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles.
‚ÄúOption A: Nikki Haley drops out, unites behind President Trump, and commits to defeating Joe Biden,‚Äù they wrote.
‚ÄúOption B: Nikki Haley prepares to be absolutely DEMOLISHED and EMBARASSED in her home state of South Carolina,‚Äù which votes on February 24.
‚ÄúNow, for some important advice,‚Äù they continued.
‚ÄúChoose wisely.‚Äù
Mr Trump himself addressed Mr DeSantis‚Äôs departure shortly after it was announced during a stop at Manchester campaign headquarters, according to a video shared by his staff.

ESLCH5VGOQ_2C2187RN4XXIZJR,North Korea agrees strategic and tactical co-operation with Russia,By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24063878.north-korea-agrees-strategic-tactical-co-operation-russia/,"North Korea‚Äôs Foreign Ministry said it has agreed to further strategic and tactical co-operation with Russia to establish a ‚Äúnew multi-polarised international order‚Äù.
In describing foreign minister Choe Son Hui‚Äôs meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow last week, the North‚Äôs Foreign Ministry said Mr Putin reaffirmed his willingness to visit Pyongyang and said that could come at an ‚Äúearly date‚Äù.
North Korea has been actively strengthening its ties with Russia, highlighted by leader Kim Jong Un‚Äôs September visit to Russia for a summit with Mr Putin.
In a separate statement on Sunday, the North‚Äôs Foreign Ministry condemned the UN Security Council for calling an emergency meeting over the country‚Äôs latest ballistic test, which state media described as a new intermediate-range solid-fuel missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead.
The ministry said the test firing on January 14 was among the country‚Äôs regular activities to improve its defence capabilities and that it did not pose a threat to its neighbours.
South Korea urged the Security Council on Thursday ‚Äúto break the silence‚Äù over North Korea‚Äôs escalating missile tests and threats.
Russia and China, both permanent members of the council, have blocked US-led efforts to increase sanctions on North Korea over its recent weapons tests, underscoring a divide deepened over Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine.
The alignment between Pyongyang and Moscow has raised international concerns about alleged arms co-operation, in which the North provides Russia with munitions to help prolong its fighting in Ukraine, possibly in exchange for badly needed economic aid and military assistance to help upgrade Mr Kim‚Äôs forces.
Both Pyongyang and Russia have denied accusations by Washington and Seoul about North Korean arms transfers to Russia.
North Korea‚Äôs Foreign Ministry, in comments published by state media, said Ms Choe and the Russian officials in their meetings expressed a ‚Äústrong will to further strengthen strategic and tactical cooperation in defending the core interests of the two countries and establishing a new multi-polarized international order‚Äù.
Russia expressed ‚Äúdeep thanks‚Äù to North Korea for its ‚Äúfull support‚Äù over its war on Ukraine, the North Korean ministry said."
GS4YU5AL3N_UQW6YRUK025ZBRX,Yousaf invites Starmer for talks to ‚Äòestablish working relationship‚Äô,By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064044.yousaf-invites-starmer-talks-establish-working-relationship/,"Scotland‚Äôs First Minister has invited Sir Keir Starmer to Bute House to put ‚Äúpolitical differences‚Äù aside to work together following the general election.
In a letter to the Labour leader, Humza Yousaf said differing political views should not ‚Äúprevent us being able to work together‚Äù.
He wrote: ‚ÄúI hope you will accept this invitation to meet and that we can establish a working relationship in the interests of the people we represent.‚Äù
Speaking on the BBC‚Äôs Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Yousaf appealed to Sir Keir to work with the SNP on reducing child poverty and strengthening relations between the UK and Scottish governments.
He told the programme Sir Keir will ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù be the next UK prime minister, and said he must tackle child poverty by committing to scrap the two-child benefit cap ‚Äì which the Labour leader has previously not committed to.
The policy prevents parents from claiming child tax credits or universal credit for a third or subsequent child born after April 2017. A so-called rape clause, which requires women to declare their child was conceived as a result of rape in order to maintain the benefits, should also be scrapped, the First Minister said.
Previously, Mr Yousaf said the SNP‚Äôs conditions of working with Labour would be Sir Keir paving the way for a future Scottish independence referendum.
In his letter, published on Sunday, the First Minister made clear independence is still a priority.
‚ÄúMy Government is clear that Scotland‚Äôs future is as an independent country in the European Union, and that there is a democratic mandate for a referendum on independence which should be respected,‚Äù he said.
He later told Kuenssberg: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to speak to Keir Starmer as the man who will undoubtedly be the next prime minister.‚Äù
In a direct appeal to the Labour leader, he said: ‚ÄúSNP MPs will work with you.
‚ÄúWhen it comes to Keir Starmer being the next prime minister of the United Kingdom, which I think he absolutely will be, I should say I‚Äôm very willing to work with an incoming Labour government.
‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs plenty that we can work on. There will be disagreements ‚Äì the constitution perhaps being the obvious one.‚Äù
It was put to Mr Yousaf on the programme that independence is unlikely to be offered by Sir Keir. Asked whether he accepts independence is unlikely to happen anytime soon, he said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt accept that.‚Äù
Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar later said he does not believe the independence debate will end if his party wins the election.
In an appeal to SNP voters, he told BBC Radio Scotland‚Äôs The Sunday Show: ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs still a raging debate in the country around the constitution, but that is not what this general election is going to be about.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been really clear that I‚Äôm not going to turn my back, close my eyes, or shut my ears to any voter in the country, whether they voted Yes or No (to independence).
‚ÄúI want to reach out to people across the country to say ‚ÄòI understand why so many people have wanted to run a million miles from this rotten Tory Government‚Äô.‚Äù
Asked whether his party will use a Labour win to ‚Äúendorse the Union‚Äù, Mr Sarwar said: ‚ÄúNo, because I want to persuade people that we can make Scotland work within a devolved settlement.‚Äù
A Labour spokesperson said Scots are ‚Äúcrying out for change not just from the tories but from the SNP‚Äù.
They said: ‚ÄúFrom a culture of secrecy and cover-up to life-threatening failures in our NHS, Humza Yousaf‚Äôs party is failing working people.
‚ÄúHumza Yousaf should spend less time commenting on elections and more on fixing the mess the SNP have made.
‚ÄúNot a single vote has been cast ‚Äì Labour has no complacency over the coming election.
‚ÄúOnly a Labour government can deliver the change that Scotland and all of the UK needs.‚Äù"

The London Mayor supports either a bespoke new scheme to allow young people to move freely to and from European countries or changes to post-Brexit visa rules.
He criticised the Tory Government‚Äôs ‚Äúextreme hard Brexit‚Äù and even appeared to hit out at Labour‚Äôs ‚Äúomerta‚Äù, or pact of silence, preventing the party from discussing potential economic reintegration with Brussels.
Mr Khan, who is seeking a third term in May‚Äôs mayoral election, said re-entering the customs union should be on the table when the Brexit deal with the EU comes up for review in 2024.
The capital has been particularly harmed by Brexit, he said in a statement first reported by the Observer.
‚ÄúThe Government‚Äôs hard Brexit has done damage right across London, and it is young people who have been hardest hit in so many ways.
‚ÄúNot only is it more difficult for young people to move abroad for work but the Government‚Äôs wrongheaded decision to leave the Erasmus scheme has made it much harder for students to study abroad too.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm clear that I‚Äôd be supportive of a youth mobility scheme, which would benefit us economically, culturally and socially.
‚ÄúWhile the UK may no longer be part of the EU, London is and always will be a European city.‚Äù
The mayor wants young people to be able to study, travel and fill vacancies in key sectors of the economy such as hospitality, which has historically relied on EU workers and has faced staff shortages.
Earlier on Saturday, Mr Khan said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs have the conversation‚Äù about steps to align with the bloc.
He told the Fabian Society conference in London: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying today we should rejoin the European Union. What I‚Äôm saying is that (shadow foreign secretary) David Lammy is on to something when he‚Äôs saying we should have a closer relationship with the European Union.‚Äù
He then suggested there is a code of silence meaning ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt talk about being close to the European Union, joining the single market, joining the customs union‚Äù.
He said ‚Äúthe economic cost of this extreme hard Brexit is huge‚Äù, pointing to a Cambridge Econometrics study which found that it has already cost the UK economy ¬£140 billion and London ¬£30 billion.
Mr Khan also said Rishi Sunak‚Äôs Government is using its Rwanda deportation plan ‚Äúin the same way they used Brexit ‚Äì as a deflection of all the problems they‚Äôve caused to our country‚Äù.
He called for the Labour Party to ‚Äúspeak up‚Äù on the benefits of immigration and diversity.
Also at the think tank‚Äôs gathering, shadow Northern Ireland secretary Hilary Benn touted the benefits of a stronger alliance with the bloc amid growing geopolitical uncertainty.
He said the EU will breathe an ‚Äúaudible sigh of relief‚Äù if Labour wins the general election later this year.
‚ÄúI think eventually there is going to be a moment when we look at each other across the Channel and say ‚Äòyou know what, we‚Äôre still big and important trading partners, we‚Äôre still friends and allies, we are co-operating on foreign policy and security and we need to do more of that ‚Ä¶ so wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to have a closer relationship?‚Äô‚Äù
He said this is important for the economy and for ‚Äúbuilding alliances in a dangerous world‚Äù.
The Labour frontbencher pointed to conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan, tensions over Taiwan, the threat of climate change and the risk of a second Donald Trump presidency.
‚ÄúWe should come together with those who share our common values to defend those values in the face of these threats,‚Äù he concluded.
‚ÄúThe best way to protect your sovereignty is to work with others.‚Äù"

LPHIFH8OB1_7ULV1SWGJWV4DBI,Burglar Liam Goddard targeted cafes and takeaways in York,By Megi Rychlikova @CourtYorkPress Court Reporter,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/24062795.burglar-liam-goddard-targeted-cafes-takeaways-york/,"A burglar has been jailed after raiding cafes, takeaways and a guesthouse¬†in two nights of crime across¬†York.
Liam Goddard, 27,¬†stole cash from safe boxes and the premises, alcohol and a tablet worth more than ¬£400 during the crime spree, said¬†Adam Walker, prosecuting.
On one night he broke into three premises in different parts of the city in five hours.
Arrested for the first two burglaries, he was abusive to a¬†police officer and told her that someone could wait outside the police station and follow her home.
Through his barrister Anastasis Tasou, Goddard claimed the crime spree¬†was due to taking crack cocaine after finding his parents dead from heroin overdoses.
The Recorder of York, Judge Sean Morris told him: ‚ÄúEverybody has tragedies in their lives though none as bad as yours, but that doesn‚Äôt give you the right to make other people‚Äôs lives a misery.‚Äù
Goddard, of no fixed address, was jailed for 27 months. He pleaded guilty to five burglaries, one charge of making threatening and abusive comments and theft of a bicycle.
A map of most of¬†¬†Goddard's crimes with the city centre shaded in orange

Mr Tasou said Goddard¬†had never worked for a living.
Mr Walker said Goddard‚Äôs crimes started with attempted robbery in 2008 when he was still a juvenile and included a 30-month prison sentence in 2016 for conspiracy to supply Class A drugs.
In total he had 64 previous convictions including theft, criminal damage and threats to kill.
On September 14 this year, Goddard broke into Pepperoni Palace in Clifton Moor at 3am where he took cash, the tablet and alcohol worth together nearly ¬£700 and Rose Caf√© in Haxby Road, where he took cash and an iPhone.
Released while police investigated the crimes, he carried out more raids on October 7, said Mr Walker.
Goddard raided a guesthouse in north York, stealing more than ¬£200 from its safe box, between midnight and 3am.
At 3.45am he was at Mrs Greedy‚Äôs Caf√© in Burton Stone Lane where he stole cash and a bike.
At 4.45am he stole a separate bike from the city centre, which he used to get to Naz Spice in Heworth, which he raided at 5.10am.
He kicked in its¬†door and stole various items. The takeaway lost several hours‚Äô takings because it was closed awaiting scenes of crime officers.
Mr Tasou said Goddard had¬†had mental health problems most of his life and had started smoking cannabis as a child.
While in prison on remand, he had taken courses to better himself, including a qualification enabling him to work on building sites.
He had been offered a hostel place and could probably get a job.
‚ÄúMaybe this defendant could start leading a productive life,‚Äù said Mr Tasou."

MTG99T7NA1_URM6TE4J6ZTLQJS,"Death toll in Gaza soars above 25,000 as Netanyahu seeks ‚Äòcomplete victory‚Äô",By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064362.death-toll-gaza-soars-25-000-netanyahu-seeks-complete-victory/,"The Palestinian death toll from the war between Israel and Hamas has soared past 25,000, the Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip has said, while the Israeli government appears far from achieving its goals of crushing the militant group and freeing more than 100 hostages.
The level of death, destruction and displacement from the war is without precedent in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Israeli officials say the fighting is likely to continue for several more months.
The conflict and the plight of hostages held in Gaza have divided ordinary Israelis and their leaders, while the offensive threatens to ignite a wider war involving Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen that support the Palestinians. In Lebanon, Hezbollah forces have engaged in near-daily clashes with Israeli troops along the border.
An Israeli air strike on Sunday hit a car near a Lebanese army checkpoint in the southern town of Kafra, killing at least one person and injuring several others, Lebanese state media reported. The identities of those killed and injured were not immediately clear.
The United States, which has provided essential diplomatic and military support for Israel‚Äôs offensive, has had limited success in persuading Israel to put civilians at less risk and to facilitate the delivery of more humanitarian aid.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected US and international calls for post-war plans that would include a path to Palestinian statehood.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the refusal to accept a two-state solution ‚Äútotally unacceptable‚Äù.
Speaking on Sunday, he added: ‚ÄúThe Middle East is a tinderbox. We must do all we can to prevent conflict igniting across the region.
‚ÄúThat starts with an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to relieve the suffering in Gaza.‚Äù
The war began with Hamas‚Äôs surprise attack into Israel on October 7, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostages.
Israel‚Äôs military announced the death of 19-year-old Sergeant Shay Levinson, who was among the hostages.
His date of death was given as October 7, but there were no further details.
According to Israeli media, his body is still in Gaza.
Israel responded with a three-week air campaign and then a ground invasion into northern Gaza that flattened entire neighbourhoods.
Gaza‚Äôs Health Ministry said 25,105 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since October 7, and another 62,681 have been injured.
The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its death toll but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and children.
The toll included the 178 bodies brought to Gaza‚Äôs hospitals since Saturday, ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qidra said. Another 300 people were injured in the past day, he added.
Israeli ground operations are now focused on the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel‚Äôs creation.
‚ÄúThe plumes of smoke from tanks, artillery and the planes of the air force will continue to cover the sky over the Gaza Strip until we will achieve our goals,‚Äù defence minister Yoav Gallant said.
Israel‚Äôs military said the demolition last week of a key building at Israa University in Gaza was under review, and asserted that preliminary findings indicated Hamas had used the compound for military purposes.
The university has said the ‚Äúattack‚Äù came weeks after Israeli forces occupied the building.
Israel continues to carry out air strikes throughout the besieged territory, including areas in the south where it told civilians to seek refuge. Many Palestinians have ignored evacuation orders, saying nowhere feels safe.
UN officials say a quarter of Gaza‚Äôs population of 2.3 million is starving as only a trickle of humanitarian aid enters because of the fighting and Israeli restrictions.
The Israeli military says it has killed around 9,000 militants, without providing evidence, and blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it positions fighters, tunnels and other militant infrastructure in dense neighbourhoods, often near homes, schools or mosques.
The military released footage of a tunnel under a residential neighbourhood in Khan Younis where the army believes at least 20 hostages were kept at different times.
Mr Netanyahu has vowed to keep up the offensive until Israel achieves ‚Äúcomplete victory‚Äù over Hamas and returns all remaining hostages. But even some top Israeli officials have begun to acknowledge those goals might be mutually exclusive.
Hamas is believed to be holding the captives in tunnels and using them as shields for its top leaders. Israel has managed to rescue just one hostage, and Hamas says several have been killed in Israeli air strikes or during failed rescue operations.
A member of Israel‚Äôs war cabinet, former army chief Gadi Eisenkot, said last week the only way to free the hostages is through a ceasefire. In an implicit criticism of Mr Netanyahu, he said claims to the contrary amount to ‚Äúillusions‚Äù.
Hamas has said it will not free more hostages until Israel ends its offensive. The group is expected to make any further releases conditional on securing freedom for thousands of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, including high-profile militants involved in attacks that killed Israelis.
Israel‚Äôs government has ruled that out for now, but it faces growing pressure from families of the hostages, who are pushing for an exchange like the one that took place during a week-long ceasefire in November.
Some Israelis are also frustrated by the security failures that preceded the October 7 attack and by Mr Netanyahu‚Äôs handling of the war. Thousands of people gathered in Tel Aviv over the weekend to call for new elections.
But Mr Netanyahu‚Äôs far-right coalition partners are pushing him to step up the offensive, with some calling for the ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù emigration of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza and the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there.
Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from the territory in 2005, two years before Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces."
NFH6BSTUB0_F082NLQVZVOAI5M,DUP Stormont boycott seriously scarring Northern Ireland ‚Äì Alliance MP,By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24064177.dup-stormont-boycott-seriously-scarring-northern-ireland---alliance-mp/,"The DUP‚Äôs boycott of powersharing institutions is ‚Äúseriously scarring Northern Ireland‚Äù, the Alliance Party‚Äôs deputy leader said.
Stephen Farry said if there is no return, a ‚Äúplan B‚Äù could see greater involvement of the Irish Government.
The devolved institutions at Stormont have been collapsed for almost two years as a result of the DUP protest against the post-Brexit trade barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Senior DUP figures held discussions on Friday on potentially ending the boycott.
It is understood DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is facing significant opposition from some party officers on whether to accept the UK Government‚Äôs offer and return to Stormont.
Talks were ongoing between the UK Government and the DUP on how to change the Windsor Framework to the DUP‚Äôs satisfaction; Westminster has suggested the talks are over, with Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris saying ‚Äúit is time for decisions to be made‚Äù.
On Thursday, thousands of public sector workers took part in strike action, where calls were made for Mr Heaton-Harris to release ¬£3.3 billion in funds for pay claims amid the power vacuum.
SDLP MP Claire Hanna said in response to the DUP‚Äôs meeting that Northern Ireland‚Äôs people are in a ‚Äúcrazy waiting room‚Äù.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad we‚Äôve got most of the kind of Game Of Thrones stuff out of the way because it is maddening for people that we‚Äôre all in this crazy waiting room and that the DUP‚Äôs internal psychodramas are allowed to set the pace,‚Äù Ms Hanna told the BBC‚Äôs Sunday Politics programme.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know exactly what happened ‚Äì I‚Äôll defer to the experts ‚Äì but I do know that we have enormous pressing concerns in public services and in people‚Äôs faith and belief in politics.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important that the Secretary of State sets out where this goes; he was due to give a statement tomorrow, I think the DUP carry on will probably push that back slightly but they should not be given the power. I think it suits ditherers to have the power to keep everybody in a holding pattern.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is seriously scarring Northern Ireland,‚Äù Mr Farry said of the suspension of devolved government on the same programme.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not simply parking issues ‚Äì real damage is been done every single day as this situation goes on.‚Äù
Mr Farry said Mr Heaton-Harris is likely to invoke a ‚Äúfairly light touch intervention‚Äù when he announces his next move.
‚ÄúI think he will take on an increased level of powers to intervene in terms of decision making in Northern Ireland,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúThat raises all sorts of issues around scrutiny, accountability, and indeed, what sort of Irish dimension will come to play in that regard.‚Äù
He added that there will be a greater role for the Dublin Government in any ‚Äúplan B‚Äù that is enacted if Northern Ireland‚Äôs powersharing institutions are not restored.
Asked if there needs to be an increased voice for the Irish Government, he said ‚Äúyes, absolutely‚Äù, adding that it would be a consultative role rather than an ‚Äúexecutive‚Äù one.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt actually think, especially in terms of the current state of relations between London and Dublin, that we‚Äôre necessarily going to see an Irish dimension straight away, but there will be pressure applied in that particular respect,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúThere are structures there already in terms of the British Irish Council, where that can be taken forward. I don‚Äôt see it being at a very granular level, it will be at a high level in terms of those engagements.
‚ÄúBut that is the direction of travel. And for those who are seeking direct rule as a fallback, they have to be extremely aware of where this is going to go. And it‚Äôs bizarre, illogical, in terms of the position they‚Äôre taking.‚Äù"
NJU6YN8GP5_JM1THKD7PLK3G72,Reformed mobster went after ‚Äòone last score‚Äô by stealing Wizard Of Oz slippers,By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24063900.reformed-mobster-went-one-last-score-stealing-wizard-oz-slippers/,"A reformed mobster who has admitted stealing a pair of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore in The Wizard Of Oz gave into the temptation of ‚Äúone last score‚Äù after an old associate led him to believe the famous shoes must be adorned with real jewels to justify their insured value.
Terry Jon Martin‚Äôs defence lawyer finally revealed the 76-year-old‚Äôs motive for the 2005 theft from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in a new memo filed ahead of his sentencing later this month.
The FBI recovered the shoes in 2018 when someone else tried to claim an insurance reward on them, but Martin was not charged with stealing them until last year.
He pleaded guilty in October to using a hammer to smash the glass of the museum door and display case to take the slippers.
He had hoped to harvest real rubies from the shoes and sell them. But a fence, a person who deals in stolen goods, informed him the rubies were glass and Martin got rid of the slippers less than two days after he took them, he said.
Lawyer Dane DeKrey said in his memo that an unidentified former mob associate tempted Martin to steal the shoes, even though he had not committed a crime in nearly 10 years after his last prison stint.
Mr DeKrey said: ‚ÄúAt first, Terry declined the invitation to participate in the heist. But old habits die hard, and the thought of a ‚Äòfinal score‚Äô kept him up at night.
‚ÄúAfter much contemplation, Terry had a criminal relapse and decided to participate in the theft.‚Äù
Mr DeKrey and prosecutors are recommending the judge sentences Martin to time served because he is physically incapable of presenting a threat to society.
Martin is in hospice care with a life expectancy of less than six months. He needs oxygen at all times because of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and was in a wheelchair for his most recent court appearance. Even if he was sentenced to prison, his poor health might be grounds for a compassionate release.
Mr DeKrey said Martin had no idea about the cultural significance of the ruby slippers and had never seen the movie.
Instead, his lawyer said, he was just looking for one last big score, and the ‚Äúold Terry‚Äù with a lifelong history of crimes like burglary and receiving stolen property beat out the ‚Äúnew Terry‚Äù who seemed to ‚Äúfinally put his demons to rest‚Äù after being released from prison in 1996 and became ‚Äúa contributing member of society‚Äù.
Mr DeKrey urged the judge to consider the major events of Martin‚Äôs life when deciding whether a lenient sentence is appropriate.
Martin suffered under a cruel stepmother who mistreated him and his three brothers so badly for several years that he left home at the age of 16 and began drinking and stealing.
While on parole from prison, Martin‚Äôs girlfriend became pregnant with twins, but he missed their birth after his parole was revoked. Right after his girlfriend brought the one-month-old twins to prison to meet him, they died after a train struck her vehicle.
‚ÄúThis was truly the turning point in Terry‚Äôs life ‚Äì his villain origin story ‚Äì and the reason he not only went down his dark path but accelerated towards it,‚Äù Mr DeKrey wrote.
‚ÄúHis son said it best: ‚Äòthe twins‚Äô death made (my dad) just give up on life; he decided on a life of crime.‚Äô‚Äù
Garland wore several pairs of ruby slippers during filming of the classic 1939 musical, but only four authentic pairs are known to remain. They were key props in the film, with Garland‚Äôs character, Dorothy, having to click the heels of the slippers three times and repeat ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no place like home‚Äù, to return to Kansas.
The stolen slippers were insured for 1 million US dollars (¬£790,000), but federal prosecutors put the current market value at about 3.5 million (¬£2.7 million).
The FBI said a man approached the insurer in 2017 and claimed he could help recover them but demanded more than the 200,000 US dollar (¬£157,000) reward being offered.
The slippers were recovered during an FBI sting in Minneapolis. The FBI has never disclosed how it tracked down the slippers, which remain in the agency‚Äôs custody.
Martin will be sentenced in Duluth, Minnesota, on January 29."

Michaela Community School in Brent, north London, argues allowing such practices risks ‚Äúundermining inclusion and social cohesion between pupils‚Äù, with its ban coming after a ‚Äúvitriolic campaign of abuse, harassment and threats‚Äù against staff.
The high-achieving free school, previously dubbed Britain‚Äôs strictest, is facing a High Court legal challenge from a Muslim student who claims its approach to prayer on the premises is discriminatory and ‚Äúuniquely‚Äù affects her faith due to its ritualised nature.
Headteacher Katharine Birbalsingh has said the school decided ‚Äúto stop prayer rituals when some pupils started them, against a backdrop of events including violence, intimidation and appalling racial harassment of our teachers‚Äù.
The two-day hearing in London before Mr Justice Linden ended on Wednesday with the judge saying he would deliver his ruling ‚Äúas quickly as possible‚Äù.
Ms Birbalsingh, the founder of the free school of some 700 pupils, about half of whom are Muslim, told The Sunday Times the process was ‚Äútaking a massive toll‚Äù.
‚ÄúI go to school and am worried,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI am at Michaela at 6.45am every day.
‚ÄúAll my teachers and I are trying to do is run a successful school and make the world a better place.‚Äù
Ms Birbalsingh said the ban was necessary to fulfil her school‚Äôs mission to promote integration between pupils of different ethnic backgrounds and religions.
‚ÄúIf a school is secular, it ought to be allowed to be secular,‚Äù she said.
Ms Birbalsingh told the paper the school will ‚Äúdefinitely appeal if we lose‚Äù, adding: ‚ÄúI will not divide children according to race and religion; it will not happen under my watch.‚Äù
The pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, alleges the school‚Äôs stance on prayer ‚Äì one of the five pillars of Islam ‚Äì was ‚Äúthe kind of discrimination which makes religious minorities feel alienated from society‚Äù, a judge was told.
Her lawyers said she is making a ‚Äúmodest‚Äù request to be allowed to pray for around five minutes at lunch time, on dates when faith rules required it, but not during lessons."
QSU9VDEPRD_BS5F4XJW00V91AV,Roman armour to go on display after experts complete ‚Äòancient jigsaw puzzle‚Äô,By PA News Agency,_,20240121,yorkpress.co.uk,https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/national/24063908.roman-armour-go-display-experts-complete-ancient-jigsaw-puzzle/,"An ‚Äúincredibly rare‚Äù piece of Roman armour from the second century has been reconstructed from dozens of fragments.
The brass arm guard, owned by National Museums Scotland, will be seen for the first time in its entirety in nearly 2,000 years when it goes on loan next month to the British Museum in London for its exhibition, Legion: Life In The Roman Army.
Conservators spent weeks reconstructing the arm guard, which is the most intact example of its kind and is one of only three known from the whole Roman Empire.
The armour was previously in more than 100 pieces when it was discovered at the Trimontium fort site near Melrose, Scottish Borders, in 1906.
The fragments have been in National Museums Scotland‚Äôs collection for more than a century, with the upper section previously on display for 25 years.
Now that all fragments have been reassembled, the arm guard will go on permanent display in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh after the British Museum exhibition ends.
Fraser Hunter, principal curator of prehistoric and roman archaeology at National Museums Scotland, said: ‚ÄúThis is an incredibly rare object, and it‚Äôs great that this exhibition gave us the opportunity to rebuild it.
‚ÄúThe transformation is striking. Now that it‚Äôs been reconstructed, you can picture the legionary who once wore it.
‚ÄúIt was both protection and status symbol ‚Äì brass was expensive and would have gleamed like gold on his sword arm.
‚ÄúIt offers a vivid connection to this important period when Scotland sat on the Roman Empire‚Äôs northern frontier.‚Äù
Bethan Bryan, assistant artefact conservator at National Museums Scotland, added: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a privilege to work on such an extraordinary piece of Scotland‚Äôs history.
‚ÄúApproaching this ancient jigsaw puzzle required careful consideration and it was important to make sure we could display the piece in a manner as near as possible to how it would have looked 2,000 years ago.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm thrilled that it can now be seen by audiences in a new light and has been preserved for generations to enjoy.‚Äù
Richard Abdy, curator of roman and iron age coins at the British Museum, said hosting the exhibition is a ‚Äúsplendid privilege‚Äù.
He said: ‚ÄúThe flexible arm guard is an iconic piece of equipment for Roman gladiators, so it is unusual to see it as a sword arm protection for Roman soldiers too.
‚ÄúIts display, posed with classic legionary segmental body armour, is stunning. The latter is also possibly derived from gladiator kit and we even think that the training regime for the amphitheatre originally inspired combat training of the professionalising Roman army.
‚ÄúThe image of Roman soldiers and gladiators appropriately unite in one artefact ‚Äì two characteristic strands of the dark side of Roman civilisation that have long fascinated public imagination.‚Äù"

The Scottish First Minister has been outspoken in his calls for a ceasefire and more aid to the region amid the ongoing conflict with Israeli forces.
He has regularly shared updates on his own family‚Äôs situation, after his mother and father-in-law were trapped in the Middle Eastern region while visiting family.
They spend several weeks there with limited supplies before fleeing through the Rafah crossing into Egypt, and home to Dundee.
Mr Yousaf‚Äôs wife, Nadia El-Nakla said her sister-in-law and her four children, aged between six months and nine years old are now taking refuge in Turkey.
But the Dundee councillor‚Äôs brother Mohammed, an emergency doctor, and their elderly grandmother remain in war-torn Gaza.
Ms El-Nakla and her First Minister husband have repeatedly called for a refugee resettlement scheme for Gazans, similar to that offered to Ukrainians.
Speaking on BBC One‚Äôs Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Yousaf was asked if he believed people placed a ‚Äúdifferent value‚Äù on the lives of Muslims and Palestinians.
He replied: ‚ÄúWithout a shadow of a doubt.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou take to anybody who is Palestinian, people in the Muslim community, they feel that the Palestinian blood is very cheap.‚Äù
Mr Yousaf then took aim at Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer who he said has not shown leadership in demanding a ceasefire.
‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs just a lack of leadership and moral courage, if I‚Äôm being frank,‚Äù Mr Yousaf added.
‚ÄúThis is a classic example of where, I think, nobody understands what Keir Starmer stands for.
‚ÄúWhy has he not shown the appropriate leadership on the issue of Gaza?
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how anybody can see that level of death and destruction and not call for an immediate halt and immediate ceasefire.‚Äù
UK Labour has been asked for comment."
