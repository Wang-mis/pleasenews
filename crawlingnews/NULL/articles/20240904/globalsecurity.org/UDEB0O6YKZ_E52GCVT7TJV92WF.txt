Two people have been killed in an Israeli drone strike targeting a vehicle in south Lebanon, the health ministry says.
The ministry said the attack hit the car in the border town of Naqoura early Monday, but did not provide information about the identity of the victims.
Separately, the Israeli army claimed that it had carried out overnight airstrikes on "military buildings" belonging to the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah in Yaroun, Ayta al-Shab, Hanine, Tayr Harfa and Blida in southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging deadly fire since early October last year, shortly after the regime launched a genocidal war against the Gaza Strip following a surprise operation by its resistance groups.
Hezbollah has vowed to keep up its retaliatory attacks as long as the Israeli regime continues its Gaza war, which has so far killed at least 40,786 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured 94,224.
Hezbollah officials have repeatedly said they do not want a war with Israel while stressing that they are prepared in case it occurs.
The Lebanese resistance movement on August 25 conducted a large drone and rocket attack "accurately and effectively" against Israel in retaliation for the assassination of Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander, in an Israeli airstrike on a building in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahieh on July 30.
Hezbollah Secretary General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah called the retaliatory strikes "Arbaeen Operation," reiterating that the main targets were the spy bases and the air defense bases.
