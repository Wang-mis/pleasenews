Washington's sanctions outrage knows no limits. In their typical neocolonialist zeal, the US authorities have seized the jet used by the Venezuelan president, which was undergoing maintenance in the Dominican Republic. Once again, they have shown an utter disregard for international legal norms, relying on the rule of force to send yet another signal that the United States, as they see it, can dispose of another state's sovereign property.
Incidentally, this is not the first time Washington has seized Venezuelan aircraft: earlier this year, a Venezuelan transport plane was detained in Argentina upon an order from the US.
However, this seizure of property was conducted in an imperial and arrogant manner, with a claim to moralising. It was done to show everyone that no one and nothing is immune to sanctions and robbery, be it business assets, bank reserves, real estate, or vehicles. The lack of legal norms is at the top of the list of notorious rules used by the collective West to build a world order model in the vein of the global Monroe Doctrine.
Washington's actions are reminiscent of those by the evil and ruthless criminal boss Bill Sykes, the main antagonist in Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens, a renowned English author of the 19th century (hopefully, the people in the White House have read his works or are at least familiar with the name). We consider it extremely important for this mode of thinking not to prevail in global affairs.
We support our Bolivarian friends in their legitimate demands to have the stolen property returned to the Venezuelan state, and we stand in solidarity with them in their determination to further defend their independence and sovereignty.
