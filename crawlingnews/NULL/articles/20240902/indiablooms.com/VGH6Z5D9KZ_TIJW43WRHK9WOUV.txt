The top court held the relief granted by the Calcutta High Court was justifiable.
The Nabanna march was called by Paschim Banga Chhatra Samaj demanding justice for the 31-year-old trainee doctor who was raped and murdered at Kolkata's RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.
The Chief Minister's resignation was also one of the demands by the organisation, which is yet to be registered.
Granting him bail, Justice Amrita Sinha had observed Sayan is not an influential person or does not hold any position or power to influence, hence he is liable to be released from jail.
The court has also restrained police from taking any coercive action against Sayan, who was arrested while he was leaving a local television channel earlier this week.
Sayan's mother Anjali had filed a plea seeking her son's bail and quashing all proceedings against the Chhatra Samaj leader.
People clashed with police, water cannons and tear gas shells were fired on several roads leading to Howrah, where state secretariat Nabanna is located, last Tuesday.
Though the RG Kar case is now being probed by the CBI, the state administration is facing public anger over its slow progress in the case until it was handed over to the premier investigating agency under the central government.
One person, a civic volunteer, has been arrested in connection with the case but protesting students as well as the victim's parents suspect more people are involved in the case.
