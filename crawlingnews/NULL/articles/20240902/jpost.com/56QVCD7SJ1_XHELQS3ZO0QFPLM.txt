A far-left politician asked the Paris Public Prosecutor to take legal action against the French chief rabbi for his comments on the Israel-Hamas war.Ecological Revolution for the Living party head Aymeric Caron charged that Chief Rabbi Haim Korsia had defended “war crimes in Gaza” during a BFMTV interview, the La France Insoumise ally said on social media.Sources familiar with the story expect it unlikely that the issue will result in the opening of an investigation against the chief rabbi.  Korsia had defended the IDF, arguing that the military had conducted itself properly during the war. He has argued that the loss of Palestinians was the fault of Hamas, and if the terrorist organization had released all hostages there would be no war. He noted that Israel was not engaging in military action on October 6.

Korsia’s office declined to comment on the issue.
