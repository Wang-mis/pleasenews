057I71ED84_HXDXGYUXTF77G8A,Cambodia’s leader says arrested protesters were trying to overthrow the government,By SOPHENG CHEANG,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/hun-manet-cambodia-vietnam-laos-development-protests-fed8f3ef7320fd87413f66e1125cf63f,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodia’s leader on Thursday condemned international human rights groups for criticizing the arrest of nearly 100 people for protesting against a decades-old regional development agreement with neighboring countries.
London-based Amnesty International and New York-based Human Rights Watch issued a joint statement of concern last week over what they called the arbitrary arrests since late July of at least 94 people for publicly criticizing the agreement that the Cambodian government signed with neighboring Laos and Vietnam.
“At least 59 of those arrested, which include environmental, human rights and other activists, remain unlawfully detained and charged for peacefully expressing their views, including several children,” said the statement.
“These wrongful detentions and charges show Prime Minister Hun Manet’s disrespect for the rights of Cambodians and the country’s international human rights obligations,” the statement quoted Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, saying.
Hun Manet, speaking at a ceremony for law school graduates, defended the crackdown, saying the authorities must protect the social order and security for the sake of all Cambodians, and accused the protesters of seeking to overthrow his government.
The Cambodia-Laos-Vietnam Development Triangle Area — or CLV-DTA — agreement is a development plan intended to facilitate cooperation on trade and migration in four northeastern provinces of Cambodia and border areas in Laos and Vietnam. It was signed in 1999 and formalized in 2004.

Critics on social media have focused on land concessions, charging that the pact privileges foreign interests, and particularly that it would cede land and sovereignty to Vietnam, a highly sensitive issue because of Cambodia’s historical antagonism toward its larger eastern neighbor.
Some opposition politicians have in the past used inflammatory anti-Vietnamese rhetoric, but the government also prosecutes politicians and others who are merely critical of its policies toward Vietnam.
Debate over the agreement was revived on social media in July, especially among Cambodians living abroad, where the political opposition is popular. Expatriate Cambodians held protests in Japan, South Korea, France, Australia and the U.S., urging the government to withdraw the agreement.
Opponents of the pact established a group on the Telegram social platform, urging Cambodians to rally in the capital, Phnom Penh, on Aug. 18.
That triggered a massive crackdown with arrests and the deployment of thousands of security personnel, especially in Phnom Penh.
“Local human rights groups alleged that government officials across the country were putting land rights and civil society activists under surveillance, including ordering several not to travel outside of their communities and threatening their family members,” said the statement from the human rights groups. “The authorities have also imposed roadblocks on highways entering Phnom Penh, and have been arbitrarily searching vans and taxis entering the capital.”
Hun Manet said Thursday he had seen the statement but did not mention the groups by name.
“I say that you should see the facts clearly because there is a lot of evidence to charge them (the protesters). Before Aug. 18, they gathered and bought weapons in, aiming to burn down buildings and intending to overthrow the government,” he said.
He accused the rights groups of glossing over the illegality of the protesters’ activities.
“You are silent, but when the authorities enforce the law, you say it is a violation of human rights.” Hun Manet said.
Hun Manet said that 66 people were arrested for involvement in organizing the planned Aug. 18 protest in Phnom Penh, but 57 were released after questioning and only nine masterminds have been sent to court and formally charged."

LOUIS PARK, Minn. (AP) — A man drove his car through a restaurant patio where a group of medical workers were celebrating in a Minneapolis suburb on Sunday, killing two people and injuring at least four, police and hospital officials said.
Surveillance footage captured a man, whom police did not name, driving into the outdoor patio of the Park Tavern in St. Louis Park, a city immediately west of Minneapolis. The footage shows the man entering the restaurant parking lot on Sunday evening but not going inside. He attempted to park, then drove into the outdoor patio, police said.
The driver was arrested for criminal vehicular homicide. Police did not offer additional details on a potential motive. They also did not identify the victims. But in a written statement on Monday, Annelise Heitkamp, a spokesperson for Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park, said one of the people who died and the four who were injured worked at the facility.
“Following the tragic incident at Park Tavern, we’re grieving the loss of a loved and respected colleague and friend to many here at Methodist Hospital and HealthPartners,” Heitkamp said. “Our thoughts are with our colleague’s family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.”
The statement did not disclose the deceased people’s names. It said all four of the injured hospital workers were nurses. Dr. Thomas Stark, who works at Methodist Hospital, told KSTP-TV that the group of colleagues went to Park Tavern, which is near the hospital, on Sunday night to celebrate with one of the nurses, who was leaving her role for a new position.

“On to the next chapter of her life and everyone was out celebrating, having a good time and saying good-bye,” Stark said.
That nurse is now hospitalized with severe injuries, according to the news station.
One person who witnessed the episode told KARE-TV that the driver struck the back of his vehicle before mowing directly into a crowd of about 30 people on the patio. Park Tavern owner Phil Weber told the news station that the second person who died is Kristina Folkerts, a server at the restaurant.
Folkerts, 30, had a longstanding connection to the Park Tavern, Weber said. Before Folkerts’ mother died, she was also a server at the restaurant. She passed when Folkerts was 14, and restaurant employees came to the teenager’s aid and would occasionally babysit her. Folkerts is survived by three young daughters.
The Park Tavern is a “family-friendly destination offers bowling lanes and arcade games, plus a restaurant and bar,” according to its website. In a written statement published online, the restaurant said it would remain closed until further notice.
“Thank you for your understanding and kindness during this incredibly difficult time,” the statement said.
The Minnesota State Patrol conducted an accident reconstruction, and a law enforcement investigation into the episode is ongoing, authorities said.
This story has been updated to correct the number of medical workers killed. Only one of the people killed was a medical worker, not two."
0I8CKKD3M4_VE3F28IVHKVCK4Q,Palestinian militants kill 3 Israeli police in the West Bank,_,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-west-bank-raids-bc3383024400ee42518e41f3660acbd4,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Palestinian militants killed three Israeli police officers on Sunday when they opened fire on a vehicle in the occupied West Bank, where Israel has carried out large-scale raids in recent days.
The attack took place along a road in the southern West Bank. The raids have mainly been focused on urban refugee camps in the northern part of the territory, where Israeli forces have traded fire with militants on a near-daily basis since the outbreak of the war in Gaza.
The police confirmed that all three killed were officers and said the assailants slipped away.
One of the officers killed was Roni Shakuri, 61, from the southern town of Sderot near the Gaza border, police said. His daughter, Mor, who was also a police officer, was killed in a battle with Hamas militants when they tried to take over the Sderot police station during the Oct. 7 attack.
A little-known militant group calling itself the Khalil al-Rahman Brigade claimed responsibility for the shooting on Sunday. Hamas praised the attack as a “natural response” to the war in Gaza and called for more.
Later on Sunday, Israeli forces encircled a home in the nearby city of Hebron where the army said the suspected attacker was believed to be hiding. At least six soldiers moved in on the structure, repeatedly opening fire and tossing a grenade inside. Soldiers later removed the body of a man from inside on a stretcher, at one point turning toward Palestinian journalists and firing several rounds toward them.
The army later said the dead man was the gunman from the morning attack, and that an M-16 automatic rifle was found with him. It said the man had formerly served in the Palestinian Authority’s security forces.

The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there.
Over 650 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, mainly during Israeli military arrest raids. Most appear to have been militants involved in gunbattles with Israeli forces, but civilian bystanders and rock-throwing protesters have also been killed.
The last 10 months have also seen an uptick in settler violence directed at Palestinians and in Palestinian attacks on Israelis.
Israel captured the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state, but the last serious peace talks collapsed more than 15 years ago.
Israel has built well over 100 settlements across the West Bank, some of which resemble suburbs and small towns, Over 500,000 settlers with Israeli citizenship live in the settlements, which most of the international community considers illegal.
The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority exercising limited autonomy in population centers.

0QIHK313LB_3NXYQU2X5CCQUHD,Germany’s leaders pay tribute to victims of the Solingen knife attack,_,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/germany-solingen-knife-attack-memorial-101f5c43d4c009e33770478c1436f155,"BERLIN (AP) — German leaders paid tribute Sunday to the three people killed in the Aug. 23 knife attack by a suspected Islamic extremist, which has pushed immigration back to the top of the country’s political agenda.
Eight people also were wounded in the attack at a “Festival of Diversity” marking the 650th anniversary of the city of Solingen in western Germany. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said at a memorial event in a city theater that he was “relieved and thankful” that none of them is now in serious danger.
The 26-year-old Syrian suspect, who was arrested a day after the attack, was supposed to be deported to Bulgaria last year but reportedly disappeared for a time and avoided deportation.
In recent days, Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government has announced new restrictions on knives and new measures to ease deportations. On Friday, it deported Afghan nationals to their homeland for the first time since the Taliban returned to power in 2021, following up on a pledge made in June after a previous attack.
“It is a horrifying crime that brings us together today, carried out by a man who, according to everything we know, sought and and found protection here, and abused this protection so terribly,” Steinmeier said at the memorial, also attended by Scholz and other top officials. “That is also intolerable.”
Steinmeier said that “we are for good reason a country that takes in people who seek protection from political persecution and war.” He added that “we want to remain that country, but ultimately we can only do so if the number of those who are not entitled to this special protection does not overburden us.”

“We must make every effort to implement the entry rules that exist and the ones that are now being drawn up,” he said, adding that “this must be a priority in the coming years.”
The attack in Solingen also has reawakened painful memories of a racist firebomb attack on a Turkish family’s home there in which five women and girls were killed in 1993. Four young Germans were later convicted.
“There was already one shocking Solingen attack, now a second,” Mayor Tim Kurzbach said. “Why always Solingen?”"
1IIOU0C0MG_RYWWE2OCX7ORDBM,New Hampshire GOP gubernatorial hopefuls debate a week ahead of primary,By HOLLY RAMER,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/new-hampshire-governor-debate-ayotte-morse-c753385191a2e950f958870f756e9b97,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A question about reducing anger and division in politics sparked one of the harshest exchanges of the night Tuesday when candidates seeking the Republican nomination for governor met for a debate.
Former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte and former state Senate president Chuck Morse are competing for a chance to succeed Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who is not seeking reelection. While four other names will be on the GOP primary ballot Sept. 10, only Ayotte and Morse were invited to debate on WMUR-TV.
Some of their most pointed criticisms of each other came when they were asked whether they were bothered by increasing polarization and anger in politics and how they would bridge the divide. Morse touted his work in the fall of 2016 to override then-Gov. Maggie Hassan’s veto of the state budget and then criticized Ayotte for losing her U.S. Senate to Hassan, a Democrat, that November.
“We didn’t unite because Kelly was running for the U.S. Senate again, and she lost that seat to Gov. Hassan,” Morse said. “She couldn’t support Donald Trump, and we lost the U.S. Senate seat for 12 years.”
“That’s really rich, coming from someone who has never won a race outside of his hometown,” Ayotte shot back, referring to Morse’s failed campaign for U.S. Senate in 2022 and an earlier loss when he ran for Executive Council.
Ayotte answered the question by saying she would bring people together with a positive vision for the state and pointed to having served as state attorney general under both Republican and Democratic governors. But she also had to answer questions about her complicated relationship with Trump.

Ayotte rescinded her endorsement of Trump in 2016 over his lewd comments about women but now supports him again. She said Tuesday her shift is based on how his record stacks up to what she called the failed policies of the Biden administration.
“The record speaks for itself. Were you better off under the Trump administration? The answer is yes, and so I have to do what’s right for Americans,” she said.
Trump also came up when the candidates were asked about whether the state has done enough to address its opioid crisis. Ayotte praised the state’s Doorway program that connects people struggling with addiction with services and said she’d focus on partnering with communities on prevention and recovery programs. Morse focused on Trump.
“What hasn’t worked is the federal government. That’s why when I got into this race, I endorsed Donald Trump because I believe the first thing we need to do in New Hampshire is stop the drugs,” he said. “We need to close our borders.”
That led to criticizing Ayotte for voting for an immigration reform bill in the Senate that included a path to citizenship for people who entered the country illegally.
“I voted for more border security, doubling the amount of ICE agents and shipping back the criminals,” Ayotte said. “I’m a former murder prosecutor. We should have the toughest penalties for fentanyl dealers in the country here in New Hampshire.”
Morse also tried to hold Ayotte accountable for abuse at the state’s youth detention center, which has been engulfed in scandal for the last five years. Nine former state workers have been arrested and more than 1,100 former residents have sued the state alleging abuse spanning six decades.
What to know about the 2024 Election
“Where the hell was she when she was attorney general when the Sununu Center was having problems with kids being raped and molested? Because those reports that came out said it was during her watch,” Morse said.
But the 2009 report Morse’s campaign points to involves an investigation into a single incident of two workers using excessive force in restraining a teenager, a far cry from the allegations that have emerged in the lawsuits and the ongoing criminal investigation.
Ayotte said she did not know about those allegations at the time.
“As governor, I will make sure that we stay safe and that children are protected,” she said."

(AP) — An Arkansas woman has pleaded guilty to felony charges after she threatened in a phone call to bomb the office of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Sebastian County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Shue said Susan Scott, a 66-year-old Fort Smith woman, pleaded guilty Friday to threatening a catastrophe and second-degree battery of a police officer.
Scott was sentenced to the 78 days she had already served in the Sebastian County jail and a $2,500 fine. Sebastian County Circuit Judge R. Gunner DeLay also ordered Scott to have no contact with Sanders and her family or the officer who arrested Scott. The judge ordered Scott to complete an anger management class within the next 6 months.
Investigators said Scott made the threat on June 14 and continued to make threats against Sanders when officers arrested her at home. She was charged with battery because police said Scott resisted arrest, including kicking and head-butting an officer, and had been held in jail since then.
Shue said in a news release that sentencing guidelines recommended against prison time for Scott and that both Sanders and the police officer approved of the plea that didn’t require further incarceration. He said the officer wasn’t seriously injured and Scott “has no present ability to manufacture an explosive device, much less place and detonate an explosive device in the Office of the Governor.”"
2G7DE5SBMZ_JNZSEZ0OICUSIXY,Canada’s NDP leader says end of agreement with Liberals makes election timing uncertain,By JIM MORRIS,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/canada-ndp-trudeau-politics-election-3668848d5bd40d5c7aaaf3b4c881a12e,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — The leader of Canada’s leftist New Democratic Party said Thursday that policies supported by liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre hurt Canadians, although he didn’t say if he was willing to trigger a snap federal election soon.
Jagmeet Singh had said a day earlier in a video posted on social media that he had “ripped up” a key agreement with Trudeau’s Liberal government, that helped keep the minority government in power.
During a news conference in Toronto on Thursday, Singh acknowledged that his surprise decision to pull support from the supply and confidence agreement could move up the date of Canada’s next general election, expected to be held in October 2025.
“I ripped up the supply and confidence agreement with Justin Trudeau, and we know that makes the election timing more uncertain,” Singh said.
Singh declined to provide a specific timeline about when he could vote against the Liberals in a no-confidence vote.
“I will look at any vote that comes before us and we will make a decision in the best interests of Canadians, as any minority government normally operates,” he said.
The Liberals currently have 154 seats in the 338 Canadian House of Commons. The Conservates hold 119 and the NDP 24. The Bloc Québécois, a party based only in Quebec and devoted to Quebec sovereignty, has 32 seats.

Singh and Trudeau reached the supply and confidence agreement in March 2022, committing the Liberals to implement several NDP priorities such as dental care and pharmacare in exchange for the NDP caucus supporting the Liberals on key votes.
Sanjay Jeram, a political science professor at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C., said the agreement always “had more bark than bite” and didn’t give the NDP any official representation in the federal government, like some coalitions in other countries.
Most polls show the Conservatives well ahead of the Liberals with the NDP sitting third, making it difficult to see what the New Democrats could gain from a quick election.
“Where the polls are now, there is no realistic option of them forming government,” said Jeram. “It’s hard to really understand what they’re aiming for,” he said, adding, “Do they want to become the official opposition?”
Jeram said there may be concerns in the party that the Conservatives have been trying to appeal to working class voters, which could drain away support from the centre-left NDP. An early election may halt this erosion of support.
Libby Davies, who spent 18 years as an NDP member of Parliament, said ending the agreement puts pressure on the Liberals.
“Will it increase the likelihood of an election sooner? That’s part of the risk,” said Davies. “It’s the tension of a potential election that keeps the Liberals on their toes and allows the NDP to have a lot more leverage.”
With the Liberals trailing badly in the polls, and Trudeau very unpopular, she doubts they want an election.
“I don’t think they want an election right now,” she said. “It really puts the pressure on the Liberals to decide; are they going to listen to whatever demands come from the NDP?”
In a campaign style speech, Singh criticized both Trudeau and Poilievre.
“Justin Trudeau has let Canadians down,” said Singh. “Trudeau’s Liberals can’t deliver change. They are too weak and too selfish to stop Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives.”
As for the Conservatives, Singh accused them of wanting to reduce health care benefits and encourage corporate greed.
“Conservative cuts would take things from bad to worse,” he said.
He pitched the NDP as the party of hope.
“There’s a battle ahead of us, the fight for the Canda of our dreams,” said Singh. “The fight to restore hope and the promise that working hard gets you a good life.”
Davies, the former member of parliament, said if the NDP forces an early election they must explain their reasoning.
“Mr. Singh needs to present an NDP vision and what that looks like for the country,” she said. “The longer he (was) tied to that agreement, the harder it is in some ways because all the good things that happened, the Liberals will take credit for.”"
2HA36RIVZI_TJMAX9PSP9JM1Y2,Xi offers African leaders more aid as China challenges US-led global order,By KEN MORITSUGU and MONIKA PRONCZUK,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/china-africa-focac-forum-summit-xi-fef65ceff06876a1acd578cfe6c1798a,"BEIJING (AP) — Dozens of African leaders gathered Thursday in Beijing for a summit that signals China’s influence in a continent that it hopes will be a key ally in pushing back against a U.S.-led global order.
Chinese President Xi Jinping promised the leaders billions of dollars in loans and private investment over the next three years, and proposed that relations with all African countries that have diplomatic ties with China be elevated to the “strategic” level.
“We stand shoulder to shoulder with each other to firmly defend our legitimate rights and interests,” he said at the opening ceremony of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.
China has become a major player in Africa since the forum was founded in 2000. Its companies have invested heavily in mining for the resources Chinese industry needs, and its development banks have made loans to build railways, roads and other infrastructure under Xi’s Belt and Road program.
African leaders have welcomed China’s assistance but are pushing for a closer alignment of aid with the continent’s development goals. They are seeking to industrialize their economies and expand agricultural exports to reduce a trade deficit with China, which has become sub-Saharan Africa’s largest bilateral trading partner.
“In the context of our industrialization effort, the portfolio of private investments in Africa should be sufficiently diversified to extend beyond the traditional field of mining and energy resources,” Moussa Faki Mahamat, the chair of the African Union Commission, said, addressing the forum in French.

In a reflection of China’s broadening relationship with Africa, Xi outlined 10 “partnership actions” that included training for African politicians and future leaders, further opening of Chinese markets, agriculture demonstration areas, vocational and technical training, green energy projects and 1 billion yuan ($140 million) in military assistance grants.
Xi said China would eliminate tariffs on products from most of the world’s poorest countries, including 33 in Africa, in an expansion of existing exemptions.
“While commending the overall progress so far achieved, we also appreciate the announcement of further areas of partnership actions,” said Tanzania’s President Samia Suluhu Hassan, speaking on behalf of eastern Africa. “We salute a new characterization of China-Africa relations.”
China is training more military professionals in Africa than anyone else, and its widespread leadership and governance training gives the country an extra layer of influence by putting it in touch with consecutive generations of politicians, said Paul Nantulya, who specializes in relations with China at the African Center for Strategic Studies in Washington.
The relationship has moved beyond trade and investment to take on political overtones.
“Modernization is an inalienable right of all countries,” Xi said. “But the Western approach to it has inflicted immense sufferings on developing countries. Since the end of World War II, Third World nations, represented by China and African countries, have achieved independence … and have been endeavoring to redress the historical injustices of the modernization process.”
China has tried to position itself as a leader of the Global South, a catchphrase for the developing world. While others don’t necessarily see China as the leader, its message of rewriting the international order resonates with African nations that feel frustrated and abandoned by their traditional Western partners.
Many African nations have been openly critical of the U.S. role in the war in Ukraine and refused to condemn Russia’s invasion, taking a non-aligned stance that has led to political frictions with the U.S.
“As our history demands, South Africa will continue to pursue progressive internationalism,” South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa said during talks with Xi earlier this week. “Building on the firm foundation of solidarity, we continue to provide support in promoting our interests, those of the African continent and the Global South.”
China’s development loans to Africa have fallen sharply from a 2016 peak, though they bounced back from COVID-era lows to $4.6 billion last year, according to the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University.
The drop-off came partly in response to government budget crises in several recipient countries that are unable to repay their loans from multiple lenders.
Many heavily indebted African countries cannot meet the basic needs of their populations, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres told the forum.
“This situation is unsustainable and a recipe for social unrest,” he said, highlighting the need for deep reform to what he called an “outdated, ineffective and unfair international financial system.”
Kenya is seeking financing to finish a partially built rail project that was meant to connect the port city of Mombasa to neighboring Uganda, but it is unclear whether China would agree.

2Q0RRAJTFW_MGVZNVM7Y6I2BI9,"Trial begins in Florida for activists accused of helping Russia sow political division, chaos",By CURT ANDERSON,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/russia-meddling-political-chaos-trial-florida-activists-844476562dd85c6c353a079a5ebd4c1c,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Trial began Tuesday in Florida for four activists accused of illegally acting as Russian agents to help the Kremlin sow political discord and interfere in U.S. elections.
All four are or were affiliated with the African People’s Socialist Party and Uhuru Movement, which has locations in St. Petersburg, Florida, and St. Louis. Among those charged is Omali Yeshitela, the 82-year-old chairman of the U.S.-based organization focused on Black empowerment and the effort to obtain reparations for slavery and what it considers the past genocide of Africans.
In an opening statement, Yeshitela attorney Ade Griffin said the group shared many goals of a Russian organization called the Anti-Globalization Movement of Russia but was not acting under control of that nation’s government.
“Ladies and gentlemen, that simply is not true,” Griffin told a racially mixed jury. “This is a case about censorship.”
Yeshitela and two others face charges of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and failing to register with the Justice Department as agents of a foreign government. The fourth defendant, who later founded a separate group in Atlanta called Black Hammer, faces only the conspiracy charge. They have all pleaded not guilty.
Three Russians, two of whom prosecutors say are Russian intelligence agents, are also charged in the case but have not been arrested.
Although there are some echoes of claims that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, U.S. District Judge William Jung said those issues are not part of this case.

“This trial will not address Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election,” Jung said in an order dated Monday.
In his opening statement, Justice Department attorney Menno Goedman said the group’s members acted under Russian direction to stage protests in 2016 claiming Black people have been victims of genocide in the U.S. and took other actions for the following six years that would benefit Russia, including opposition to U.S. policy in the Ukraine war.
“This is about dividing Americans, dividing communities, turning neighbor against neighbor,” Goedman told jurors. “The defendants acted at the direction of the Russian government to sow division right here in the U.S.”
That included support for a St. Petersburg City Council candidate in 2019 that the Russians claimed to “supervise,” according to the criminal indictment. The candidate lost that race and has not been charged in the case.
Much of the alleged cooperation involved support for Russian’s invasion of Ukraine. In March 2022, Yeshitela held a news conference in which he said the “African People’s Socialist Party calls for unity with Russia in its defensive war in Ukraine against the world colonial powers.” He also called for the independence of the Russian-occupied Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine.
The defense attorneys, however, said despite their connections to the Russian organization, the actions taken by the African People’s Socialist Party and Uhuru Movement were aligned precisely with what they have advocated for more than 50 years. Yeshitela founded the organization in 1972 as a Black empowerment group opposed to vestiges of colonialism around the world.
“They shared some common beliefs,” said attorney Leonard Goodman, who represents defendant Penny Hess. “That makes them threatening.”
Yeshitela, Hess and fellow defendant Jesse Nevel face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the conspiracy and foreign agent registration charge. The fourth defendant, Augustus Romain, could get a maximum of five years if convicted of the registration count.
The trial is expected to last up to four weeks."

Ade Salim Lilly’s telephone harassment campaign included approximately 12,000 telephone calls over the span of 19 months to more than 50 offices for members of Congress, according to prosecutors. They said Lilly threatened to kill a congressional staff member during one of the calls.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly sentenced Lilly to 13 months of incarceration followed by three years of supervised release, according to online court records.
Prosecutors recommended sentencing Lilly to 18 months of incarceration, arguing for a need to deter others from engaging in similarly threatening behavior. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger testified last year that threats against members of Congress had increased by approximately 400% over the previous six years.
“This is an election year, and more and more often, criticism of a political position or viewpoint crosses the First Amendment line and leads to true threats of violence,” prosecutors wrote. “The pervasive rise in threats against elected officials creates a real risk that expressions of violence will become normalized.”
Lilly pleaded guilty in May to two charges: one count of interstate communications with a threat to kidnap or injure and one count of making repeated telephone calls.
Lilly moved from Maryland to Puerto Rico during his harassment campaign, which lasted from roughly February 2022 until November 2023. He called one lawmaker’s Washington office more than 500 times over a two-day period in February 2023, prosecutors said."

In a rebuke to critics, López — who has spent six tumultuous years in office —demanded a show of hands in a symbolic vote on one of his most criticized initiatives: the proposed judicial reform plan that opponents warn would weaken democratic checks and balances.
A sea of hands rose in favor of one proposal: having judges elected by popular vote.
“Let our friends and neighbors in the United States internalize it,” López said, referring to one of the proposal’s biggest critics.
Opponents have warned such a change could lead to politically biased judges with limited experience, and protesters took to the streets again on Sunday, some with signs reading, “There’s no future without justice.” Demonstrators also rallied on Aug. 25.
Mexico’s Congress, where the governing coalition has the majority, is expected to soon vote on the controversial constitutional reforms that López has proposed. Among the proposals is eliminating seven autonomous bodies, including the National Institute of Transparency.
The Chamber of Deputies was scheduled to meet Sunday afternoon following the mass rally in the morning for its first session since June elections when the president’s Morena party and its allies clinched big victories.
Critics had complained in the courts about what they describe as an unusual and fast-track procedure of the proposed reforms, with a judge ruling that a discussion and vote on the issue could not be held Sunday. The issue also will go before the Senate after the deputies vote on it."

The battle against a wildfire also got a boost in South Dakota thanks to cooler weather and lighter winds. Residents of the state’s second-largest city have been on edge, ready to flee if flames from a nearby blaze moved dangerously close.
Estimated containment of the Northern California fire burning about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Lake Tahoe remained at 0%. But fire officials said it grew only a few hundred acres on Wednesday as more than 400 firefighters successfully attacked the flames directly on the ground and with retardant drops from the air.
Greg Lowdermilk, a sections operation chief for the inter-agency team, said they were continuing to build new fire lines by hand and with bulldozers and began laying additional hose “so we can continue to increase containment.”
The Sierra County sheriff’s office said evacuation orders for more than 500 residents of the mountain community of Sierra Brooks, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Reno, Nevada, would remain in place “until a safe containment level is achieved.”
In South Dakota, officials were optimistic homes in Rapid City would remain safe from the First Thunder Fire.

The blaze was reported Monday just a few miles (kilometers) from Rapid City, a community of 80,000 residents near Black Hills National Forest. Mount Rushmore National Memorial, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) away, is far out of harm’s way.
The fire burning nearly 160 acres (65 hectares) was fueled by uncommonly hot and dry weather. Tuesday’s high in Rapid City was 96 degrees Fahrenheit (35.6 Celsius), well above the normal early-September high of 75 (23.9 Celsius). Winds gusted to 45 mph (72 kph).
As late as Tuesday evening, residents in an evacuation warning area of Rapid City were being told to pack their bags, gather vital belongings and be prepared to leave at a moment’s notice. By Wednesday morning, the temperature was far cooler, the winds calmer and the air more humid.
“Firefighters got a good handle on the wildfire last night,” an update from the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office said. “It’s currently at 157 acres. Weather conditions are very favorable today. They are mopping up a large portion on the west side and are hoping to get everything contained and under control today.”
Officials don’t yet know what caused the fire, which has burned across a steep, rocky area. No structural damage has been reported.
In central California, meanwhile, firefighters working in triple-digit temperatures were battling a blaze that scorched more than 17 square miles (44 square kilometers) of dry brush in mostly open space. A handful of homes were evacuated outside of Coalinga in Fresno County. The Boone Fire was 5% contained Wednesday.
Across the state, red flag warnings for increased wildfire risk were issued. The desert communities of Palm Springs, Twentynine Palms, Needles and Barstow were heating up, with highs of up to 118 F (47.7 Celsius) in Death Valley’s Furnace Creek expected at week’s end.
In Southern California’s Santa Barbara County, officials issued a health alert due to spiking temperatures in inland areas. The health department urged residents to stay indoors during the day and take other measures to avoid heat-related illnesses. Cooling centers were set up across Los Angeles County.

Authorities said the virus known as bluetongue serotype 3, or BTV-3, has been crawling up through Europe in the past weeks. It’s spread by midges that carry the virus and that are typically found in warmer weather.
It has been reported on the island where Copenhagen is located. Cases have also been reported in Germany, the Netherlands and France, Danish authorities said.
The first case in Denmark was recorded in early August, on a Danish farm with sheep and cows near the German border. Danish authorities have also informed the European Commission about the case and animals have since been vaccinated to try and contain the spread.
The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said tests results are upcoming from the island of Funen in central Denmark, where it is also suspected.
“The probability of the virus spreading via mites to the whole country is therefore considered to be high,” the administration said in a statement.
Major signs in animals include high fever, mouth ulcers and swelling of the face and tongue — as well as a blue color of the tongue, known as cyanosis, stemming from a lack of oxygen. Sheep, cattle and goats also tend to have breathing difficulties.
Infected animals yield less milk, though the milk is safe for human consumption, authorities said."
3WVA6FEM53_YX89GO1VLM4JB6R,South Korea’s president skips opening ceremony of parliament as strife with opposition deepens,By KIM TONG-HYUNG,_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-national-assembly-boycott-57e59e7f262c7a4721f11b0add3f49eb,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — President Yoon Suk Yeol  boycotted the formal opening of South Korea’s parliament on Monday as his squabbles with the opposition deepen over allegations of wrongdoing by top officials and his wife.
It’s a tradition for South Korean presidents to deliver a speech at opening ceremonies for National Assembly sessions, and Yoon is the first to skip the event since the country’s transition from a military dictatorship to democracy in the late 1980s.
Yoon, a conservative who narrowly won the election in 2022, has struggled to navigate a parliament controlled by liberals who have stymied his agenda and called for investigations into allegations of corruption and abuse of power involving his wife and government officials.
Yoon also faces declining approval ratings as concerns grow over his government’s ability to deal with a worsening job market, soaring household debt and a prolonged strike by thousands of doctors that is straining medical services.
Asked about his decision to skip the legislature’s opening ceremony, Yoon’s office said lawmakers must first “normalize the National Assembly, which overissues demands for special prosecutor investigations and impeachments,” before inviting Yoon.
A senior presidential official, who spoke on condition of anonymity during a background briefing, said it was difficult for Yoon to attend when lawmakers were expected to greet him with “verbal abuse and picketing demonstrations.”

“They aren’t hesitating to call the president’s family member a murderer and conspiracies about martial law are continuing to circulate in the National Assembly,” she said.
Jo Seoung-lae, spokesperson of the main opposition Democratic Party, said Yoon’s refusal to attend the ceremony displayed his “arrogance” and disregard for the assembly’s role to check and balance the executive branch.
“It’s impossible to produce results in national governance without having respect for the National Assembly,” assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik said during the opening ceremony as he lamented Yoon’s absence.
Following parliamentary elections in April in which the liberals  extended their majority, the current assembly began meeting in May. But its official opening ceremony was delayed for months because of political bickering.
Opposition lawmakers are pushing for an investigation by special prosecutors into allegations that top government and military officials tried to cover up the circumstances surrounding the death of a marine who drowned during a search for flood victims in 2023.
They want another independent investigation into allegations that Yoon’s wife, Kim Keon Hee, was involved in stock price manipulation and violated the country’s antigraft law by receiving a luxury handbag from a Korean American pastor. Yoon has denied any legal wrongdoing by his wife.
In August, Yoon’s office angrily demanded an apology after Democratic Party lawmaker Jeon Hyun-heui labeled Kim as a “murderer” over the death of a senior official from the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission, who was reportedly involved in the commission’s review of the handbag scandal.
Opposition lawmakers had raised suspicions on whether the commission was pressured into closing the review in June, when it concluded that the antigraft law provides no grounds for punishment for the spouses of public officials. The death of the former commission official, who was reportedly found with a note, is still being investigated.
Yoon in May and July rejected consecutive bills calling for special prosecutors to investigate the marine’s death, describing the allegations as groundless and politically motivated.
Yoon and his party also criticized the opposition’s move to hold a parliamentary hearing in July to address online petitions signed by tens of thousands calling for his impeachment. South Korea’s Constitution limits a president to a single five-year term, so Yoon cannot seek reelection."
4OSN2BFYJX_25T1XZHE8C4PYDJ,Harris calls Trump’s appearance at Arlington a ‘political stunt’ that ‘disrespected sacred ground’,By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-arlington-national-cemetery-afghanistan-403925774d9ca65034b7a3281701d7f6,"Vice President Kamala Harris said former President Donald Trump “disrespected sacred ground” in his recent appearance at Arlington National Cemetery, where the Republican nominee took and distributed images despite a federal prohibition on campaign activity on the grounds.
Harris, in a statement posted Saturday on the social media platform X, cited reports that Trump’s campaign aides created an altercation with a cemetery staffer and proceeded to take photographs and film the former president, including at the graves of Afghanistan war veterans, after being warned about rules at the site.
“Let me be clear: the former president disrespected sacred ground, all for the sake of a political stunt,” Harris said, calling Arlington a “solemn place where we come together to honor American heroes ... not a place for politics.”
The original incident stemmed from Trump’s and Republicans’ continued criticism of President Joe Biden and now Harris for the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. At the invitation of some family members of service members killed during the withdrawal, Trump laid wreaths last Monday in honor of Sgt. Nicole Gee, Staff Sgt. Darin Hoover and Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss. They were among 13 U.S. service members and more than 100 Afghans who died in an Aug. 26, 2021, bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport.
Trump’s campaign was warned about not taking photographs before an altercation at the cemetery, according to defense officials. Officials have said since that an Arlington employee whom two Trump campaign staff members allegedly “verbally abused and pushed” aside has declined to press charges. The Trump campaign has since lashed out at Pentagon officials, with a top campaign adviser, Chris LaCivita, referring to military spokespersons as “hacks.” Trump campaign officials say it had permission to bring someone to take video.
Since Biden ended his reelection bid, Trump has been zeroing in on Harris and her roles in foreign policy decisions. He has specifically highlighted the vice president’s statements that she was the last person in the room before Biden made the decision on Afghanistan.

Biden’s administration was following a withdrawal commitment and timeline that the Trump administration had negotiated with the Taliban in 2020. A 2022 review by a government-appointed special investigator concluded decisions made by both Trump and Biden were the key factors leading to the rapid collapse of Afghanistan’s military and the Taliban takeover.
Harris on Saturday alluded to Trump’s history of picking fights with veterans and repeated allegations that he has “called our fallen service members ‘suckers’ and ‘losers’ and disparaged Medal of Honor recipients.”
“This is a man who is unable to comprehend anything other than service to himself,” Harris said. “I will always honor the service and sacrifice of all of America’s fallen heroes. ... And I will never politicize them.”"
5677HS320H_D9O1PP7127C62S3,"US charges Hamas leader, other militants in connection with Oct. 7 massacre in Israel",By ERIC TUCKER,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-hamas-sinwar-87674285aa9b066392953db1310312ca,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department announced criminal charges Tuesday against Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and other senior militants in connection with the Oct. 7, 2023, rampage in Israel, marking the first effort by American law enforcement to formally call out the masterminds of the attack.
The seven-count criminal complaint filed in federal court in New York City includes charges such as conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization resulting in death, conspiracy to murder U.S. nationals and conspiracy to finance terrorism. It also accuses Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah of providing financial support, weapons, including rockets, and military supplies to Hamas for use in attacks.
The impact of the case may be mostly symbolic given that Sinwar is believed to be hiding in tunnels in Gaza and the Justice Department says three of the six defendants are believed now to be dead. But officials say additional actions are expected as part of a broader effort to target a militant group that the U.S. designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 1997 and that over the decades has been linked to a series of deadly attacks on Israel, including suicide bombings.
The complaint was originally filed under seal in February to give the U.S. time to try to take into custody then-Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and other defendants, but it was unsealed Tuesday after Haniyeh’s death in July and other developments in the region lessened the need for secrecy, the Justice Department said.
“The charges unsealed today are just one part of our effort to target every aspect of Hamas’ operations,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a video statement. “These actions will not be our last.”

The charges come as the White House says it is developing a new cease-fire and hostage deal proposal with its Egyptian and Qatari counterparts to try to bring about an agreement between Israel and Hamas to end the nearly 11-month war in Gaza.
A U.S. official, who was not authorized to talk publicly about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press there was no reason to believe the charges would affect the ongoing negotiations.
National security spokesman John Kirby said the recent “executions” of six hostages, including one American, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, by Hamas underscore “the sense of urgency” in the talks.
“We are investigating Hersh’s murder, and each and every one of the brutal murders of Americans, as acts of terrorism,” Garland said in the statement. “We will continue to support the whole of government effort to bring the Americans still being held hostage home.”
Sinwar was appointed the overall head of Hamas after the killing of Haniyeh in Iran and sits atop Israel’s most-wanted list. He is believed to have spent most of the past 10 months living in tunnels under Gaza, and it is unclear how much contact he has with the outside world. He was a long-serving Palestinian prisoner freed in an exchange of the type that would be part of a cease-fire and hostage release deal.
Haniyeh was also charged.
Other Hamas leaders facing charges include Marwan Issa, deputy leader of Hamas’ armed wing in Gaza, who helped plan last year’s attack and who Israel says was killed when its fighter jets struck an underground compound in central Gaza in March; Khaled Mashaal, another Haniyeh deputy and a former leader of the group thought to be based in Qatar; Mohammed Deif, Hamas’ longtime shadowy military leader who was thought to be killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Gaza in July; and Lebanon-based Ali Baraka, Hamas’ head of external relations.
The charges are “yet another tool” for the U.S. to respond to the threat Hamas poses to the U.S. and its ally Israel, said Merissa Khurma, Middle East program director at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington.
“If Sinwar is found and brought to justice for planning the October 7 attacks, it would be a significant win for the U.S. and for all those who lost loved ones,” she said by email.
However, with Sinwar in hiding, Khurma doesn’t see the charges adding more pressure on Hamas. She noted that the chief prosecutor of the world’s top war crimes court sought arrest warrants for Hamas leaders like Sinwar and it didn’t change their behavior or weaken them in the cease-fire negotiations.
She said the case was still important for the U.S. because many of those killed or kidnapped were Americans and because the country doesn’t recognize the International Criminal Court.
During the Oct. 7 attacks, militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 people hostage. Roughly 100 hostages remain, a third of whom are believed to be dead.
The criminal complaint describes the massacre as the “most violent, large-scale terrorist attack” in Hamas’ history. It details how Hamas operatives who arrived in southern Israel with “trucks, motorcycles, bulldozers, speedboats, and paragliders” engaged in a brutal campaign of violence that included rape, genital mutilation and machine-gun shootings at close range.
Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The war has caused widespread destruction, forced the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents to flee their homes, often multiple times, and created a humanitarian catastrophe.
Hamas has accused Israel of dragging out months of negotiations by issuing new demands, including for lasting Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor along the border of Egypt and a second corridor running across Gaza.
Hamas has offered to release all hostages in return for an end to the war, the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including high-profile militants — broadly the terms called for under an outline for a deal put forward by President Joe Biden in July.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged “total victory” over Hamas and blames it for the failure of the negotiations.

(AP) — A family believes a body found in a Florida nursing home’s closet is a 71-year-old man who went missing from the facility nearly two weeks earlier.
The family of Elin Etienne believes it was his decomposing body that was found Monday in a closet at the North Dade Nursing & Rehabilitation Center, 11 days after he went missing. He had been a patient at the facility after suffering a brain aneurysm earlier in August, the family said. North Miami Police issued a missing person alert for him Aug. 23, a day after he disappeared.
Ruth Keisha Etienne, his granddaughter, told WTVJ-TV that nursing home administrators never notified them a body had been found. She said an anonymous caller told them, so they contacted administrators.
“They said they found him in a closet and he was already decomposing, and they refused to let us see the body,” Etienne told the station. “And we tried to speak to the nursing home people, but they refused to speak to us. They don’t want to talk to us. I wonder why?”
The nursing home declined comment Wednesday. The Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner’s Office said Wednesday that the body still had not been identified. Police said they are conducting a death investigation.
State nursing home regulators did not immediately return a call Wednesday seeking comment."

She packed up and left China for the Mexican capital last year, with dreams of a new adventure.
The 30-year-old woman from Chengdu, the Sichuan provincial capital, hopes one day to start an online business importing furniture from her home country.
“I want more,” Li said. “I want to be a strong woman. I want independence.”
Li is among a new wave of Chinese migrants who are leaving their country in search of opportunities, more freedom or better financial prospects at a time when China’s economy has slowed, youth unemployment rates remain high and its relations with the U.S. and its allies have soured.
EDITOR’S NOTE: This story is part of the China’s New Migrants package, a look by The Associated Press at the lives of the latest wave of Chinese emigrants to settle overseas.
While the U.S. border patrol arrested tens of thousands of Chinese at the U.S-Mexico border over the past year, thousands are making the Latin American country their final destination. Many have hopes to start businesses of their own, taking advantage of Mexico’s proximity to the U.S.
Last year, Mexico’s government issued 5,070 temporary residency visas to Chinese immigrants, twice as many as the previous year — making China third, behind the United States and Colombia, as the source of migrants granted the permits.

A deep-rooted diaspora that has fostered strong family and business networks over decades makes Mexico appealing for new Chinese arrivals; so does a growing presence of Chinese multinationals in Mexico, which have set up shop to be close to markets in the Americas.
“A lot of Chinese started coming here two years ago — and these people need to eat,” said Duan Fan, owner of “Nueve y media,” a restaurant in Mexico City’s stylish Roma Sur neighborhood that serves the spicy food of Sichuan, his home province.
“I opened a Chinese restaurant so that people can come here and eat like they do at home,” he said.
Duan, 27, arrived in Mexico in 2017 to work with an uncle who owns a wholesale business in Tepito, near the capital’s historic center, and was later joined by his parents.
Unlike earlier generations of Chinese who came to northern Mexico from the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, the new arrivals are more likely to come from all over China.
Data from the latest 2020 census by Mexico’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography show that Chinese immigrants are mainly concentrated in Mexico City. A decade ago, the census recorded the largest concentration of Chinese in the northernmost state of Baja California, on the U.S.-Mexico border across from California.

The arrival of Chinese multinationals is leading an influx of “people from eastern China, more educated and with a broader global background,” said Andrei Guerrero, academic coordinator of the Center for China-Baja California Studies.
In a middle-class Mexico City neighborhood, Viaducto-Piedad, near the city’s historic Chinatown, a new Chinese community has been growing since the late 1990s. Chinese immigrants have not only opened businesses, but have created community spaces for religious events and children’s recreation.
Viaducto-Piedad is recognized by the Chinese themselves as Mexico City’s true “Chinatown,” said Monica Cinco, a specialist in Chinese migration and general director of the EDUCA Mexico Foundation.
“When I asked them why, they would tell me because we live here. We have stores for Chinese consumption, beauty shops and restaurants just for Chinese,” she said. “They live there, there is a community and several public schools in the area have a significant Chinese population.”
In downtown Mexico City, Chinese entrepreneurs have not only opened new wholesale stores but have also taken over dozens of buildings. At times, they have become a source of tension with local businesses and residents, who say the expansion of Chinese-owned enterprises is displacing them.

At a mini-market in a bustling downtown neighborhood selling Chinese products such as dried wood ear mushrooms and vacuum-packed spicy duck wings, 33-year-old Dong Shengli said he moved to Mexico City from Beijing a few months ago to help manage the shop for some friends.
Dong — who has since found a job with a wholesaler importing knockoff designer sneakers and clothing — said he had worked at China’s National Energy Commission, but was persuaded by his friends to come here.
He plans to explore business possibilities in Mexico, but China still has a pull for him. “My wife and my parents are in China. My mother is elderly, she needs me,” he said.
Others are leaving China in search of greater freedoms. That’s the case for 50-year-old Tan, who gave only his surname out of concern for the safety of his family, who remain in China. He arrived in Mexico this year from the southern province of Guangdong and got a job for a few months at a Sam’s Club. Back home, he got by doing various jobs, including at a chemical plant and writing magazine articles during the pandemic.
But he chafed under what he described as a repressive atmosphere in China.
“It’s not just the oppression in the workplace, it’s the mentality,” he said. “I can feel the political regression, the retreat of freedom and democracy. The implications of that truly make people feel twisted and sick. So, life is very painful.”
What caught his attention in Mexico City were the protests that often pack the city’s main avenues — proof, he said, that the freedom of expression he longs for exists in this country.
At the restaurant where she still helps out in the trendy Juárez neighborhood, Li said Mexico stands out as a land of opportunity for her and other Chinese who don’t have relatives in the U.S. to help them settle there. She said she left China partly because of the competitive workplace culture and high home prices.

“In China, everyone saves money to buy a house, but it’s really expensive to get one,” she said.
Self-confident with a contagious smile, Li said she’s hopeful her skills working as a sales promoter for Chinese tech giant Tencent Games will help her get ahead in Mexico.
She says she has not met many Chinese women like herself in Mexico City: newcomers, young and single.
Most are married and are moving to Mexico to reunite with their husbands.
“To come here is to face something unknown,” she said.
Li doesn’t know when she’ll be able to carry out her ambitious business plans, but she has ideas: For example, she imagines that in Henan province she could get chairs, tables and other furniture at a good price. Meanwhile, she is selling furniture imported to Mexico by a Chinese friend on the e-commerce platform Mercado Libre.
“I’m not married, I don’t have a boyfriend, it’s just myself,” she said, “so I’ll work hard and struggle.”

5O03AFPJY3_600I8C3TOXOUWRI,US envoy to Taiwan declares ties ‘rock solid’ amid military threats from China,By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/china-taiwan-security-fb074d932801e5c6d2a3b77b2ac5e88e,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — The top U.S. envoy to Taiwan on Wednesday said American support for the island is “rock-solid, principled, and bipartisan,” and said Washington will continue to follow through on its commitments to ensure the island can defend itself against threats from China.
Raymond F. Greene’s remarks Wednesday come at a time of uncertainty over China’s intentions toward the island it claims as its own territory — to be taken by force if necessary — and amid conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East that threaten to draw the U.S. in further.
Greene made clear Taiwan was a top priority, especially the security of shipping in the crucial Taiwan Strait that divides the island and China.
The U.S. will “continue to maintain the capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion against Taiwan,” Greene said, referencing the Taiwan Relations Act that ensured such backing following the breaking of formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979, when Washington normalized relations with the Communist government in Beijing.
Greene said the Executive Branch has notified Congress of approximately $38.4 billion in Foreign Military Sales to Taiwan since 2010, including over $6.4 billion under the Biden administration, along with the equivalent of $345 million in transfers of arms from existing U.S. stocks.
Upgraded and new F-16 jet fighters, Abrams tanks and other equipment have arrived or are in the pipeline, while Taiwan is expanding its production of domestic arms including submarines and anti-landing and ground to air missiles.

A senior American diplomat, Greene arrived two months ago to serve as director of the American Institute in Taiwan, making him America’s de-facto ambassador on the island of 23.5 million people that has long retained strong commercial, cultural and political links with the U.S.
Taiwan was a main issue when U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan visited China last week, aiming to keep communications open in a relationship that has become increasingly tense in recent years.
Sullivan, on his first trip to China as the main adviser to President Joe Biden on national security issues, met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Foreign Minister Wang Yi and a top general from the Central Military Commission.
Danny Russel, a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York and who served on the national security council in the Obama administration, said the meeting between Sullivan and Xi was particularly important because Sullivan was seen by the Chinese leadership as “a direct extension” of the U.S. president and that Sullivan’s messaging was viewed as “coming straight from (President Joe) Biden.”
Sullivan also met one of China’s vice chairs of the Central Military Commission, Gen. Zhang Youxia, last week — a rare meeting with a visiting U.S. official.
“China demands that the United States stop military collusion between the U.S. and Taiwan, stop arming Taiwan and stop spreading false narratives about Taiwan,” a Chinese Defense Ministry statement said, without elaborating on what the false narratives are.
A White House statement said the two had “recognized the progress in sustained, regular military-military communications over the past 10 months.” On Taiwan, the U.S. statement said only that Sullivan had raised the importance of cross-Strait peace and stability.
China suspended communication between the two militaries after senior U.S. lawmaker and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022. Talks only gradually resumed more than a year later, after Xi and Biden met outside San Francisco in November.
The U.S. has long been a cheerleader for Taiwan’s lively democracy, which stands in stark contrast to China’s authoritarian state. However, Greene said Washington would not comment on allegations of corruption and abuse of power that have enveloped former Taipei mayor and presidential candidate Ko Wen-je over recent months."
61ULMUUFF9_9WNNE805MJOB6IU,Mexico offers escorted rides north from southern Mexico for migrants with US asylum appointments,_,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-us-immigration-migrants-d101ba44f9a9eb33e2143520bc430b92,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico will offer escorted bus rides from southern Mexico to the U.S. border for non-Mexican migrants who have received a United States asylum appointment, the government announced Saturday.
The National Immigration Institute said the buses will leave from the southern cities of Villahermosa and Tapachula. It appeared to be an attempt to make applying for asylum appointments from southern Mexico more attractive to migrants who otherwise would push north to Mexico City or the border.
The announcement came a week after the U.S. government expanded access to the CBP One application to southern Mexico. Access to the app, which allows asylum seekers to register and await an appointment, had previously been restricted to central and northern Mexico.
The Mexican government wants more migrants to wait in southern Mexico farther from the U.S. border. Migrants typically complain there is little work available in southern Mexico for a wait that can last months. Many carry debts for their trip and feel pressure to work.
The migrants who avail themselves of the buses will also receive a 20-day transit permit allowing them legal passage across Mexico, the institute’s statement said.
Previously, Mexican authorities said they would respect migrants who showed that they had a scheduled asylum appointment at the border, but some migrants reported being swept up at checkpoints and shipped back south, forced to miss their appointments.

Local, state and federal law enforcement will provide security for the buses and meals will be provided during transit, the institute said.
The rides could also help discourage some migrants from making the arduous journey north on foot. Three migrants were killed and 17 injured this week when a vehicle barrelled into them on a highway in the southern state of Oaxaca.
Mexico had pressured the United States to expand CBP One access in part to alleviate the build up of migrants in Mexico City. Many migrants had opted over the past year to wait for their appointments in Mexico City where there was more work available and comparatively more security than the cartel-controlled border cities.
Those with the resources buy plane tickets to the border crossing point where their appointments are scheduled to reduce the risk of being snagged by Mexican authorities or by the cartels, which abduct and ransom migrants."
62S078D7E0_Z68EI9CEWEUGAVB,Behind the nonprofit helping a diverse new generation of culinary professionals heat up New York,By JAMES POLLARD,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/food-education-fund-sean-feeney-lilia-misi-198de6e55a3b25e2e591ae1516d6d88c,"NEW YORK (AP) — A side of beef bigger than a classroom desktop sat before high school students huddled around a kitchen on New York’s Lower East Side. “Anyone wanna jump in?” asked the butcher teaching the Tuesday afternoon class. One student dared, grabbing a sawblade about as long as his arm and sweating to successfully separate the short rib from the rib eye.
These demos are regularly hosted by the Food Education Fund. The local nonprofit seeks to make culinary careers more accessible through hands-on experiences and mentorship for low-income students of color at ten high schools. More than half of participants are Hispanic, over one third are Black and the vast majority live below the poverty line.
The hope is that stronger support for young cooks in one of the world’s top food destinations will bring much-needed diversity to the industry’s highest rungs. Chefs of color lead just a fraction of the North American restaurants awarded a coveted Michelin star and research shows non-white fine dining employees are less likely to be promoted, according to the tire company behind the guidebook that has become a gastronomical bible of sorts.
As restaurants rebound from pandemic stressors that sent many burnt-out staff looking for new careers and upended customer behavior around in-person dining, the nonprofit wants to instill a new generation with the love of feeding others. Hospitality magnate Sean Feeney said he’s found that New York’s youth still want to rebuild that culture.
“They never had tasted an ingredient that made their mouth move,” said Feeney, a board member whose company owns Lilia and Misi, two highly praised Italian restaurants in Brooklyn. “They never had witnessed an experience of dining that changed their lives. And many of the students hadn’t been supported in a way that it made sense for them to want to make days better for others.”

The Food Education Fund’s workforce development programs reached more than 800 public high school students during the 2023-2024 school calendar. Leadership plans to increase the number of seniors and schools participating in its internship course in this upcoming school year.
Lessons by “visiting chefs” ranging from chocolatiers to farmers exposed participants to the wide range of culinary arts careers. Participants can get up to 150 hours of experience at internships — including School Grounds, a Barclays Center food stand where students run marketing and are developing a signature hot sauce. The nonprofit also doled out over $82,000 in scholarships to graduates over the past two years, according to publicly available tax filings.
Observers note that Food Education Fund has really formalized its operations in recent years. Tax forms show that annual contributions more than quadrupled from 2018 to 2022.
And in New York City, where bankers, entertainers and chefs alike have cut their teeth in their respective dog-eat-dog fields, the organization’s mission has recently attracted attention from the deep-pocketed financial services giants and stars in its backyard.
Big backers include investment firm Goldman Sachs and Steve Cohen, the billionaire hedge fund manager who owns the New York Mets. The board includes hip-hop icon Questlove and comedian Desus Nice has hosted a fundraiser.
The broad interest reflects the diversity of New York and the community building power of food, according to board member Jehan Ilahi, the global head of investor relations at Goldman Sachs.
“Food binds us all. Culturally, as people, you sit with somebody, you have a good meal and it exposes your mind to different cultures and experiences,” he said. “That’s what I think is really special about the city. A lot of the kids that live here, study here, want to be part of that ecosystem.”
Anthony Trabasas wanted to work in the world’s best restaurants when his family moved from the Philippines five years ago. Through Food Education Fund internships, he was able to cook under a James Beard award-winning pasta chef. The opportunities instilled a sense of professionalism that he credits for his early success in high-caliber kitchens.
Trabasas, 21, is now a “floating” chef in a lower Manhattan kitchen he described as “not like any other:” the Michelin-starred, farm-to-table restaurant One White Street. He spends his shifts running up and down the stairs of the four-story townhouse, filling in gaps, whether it’s searing fish or flipping a dozen burgers.
He dreams of opening his own place one day, but he’s still figuring out what kind. What he does know is that he wants to create a more positive culinary industry with sustainable work environments.
And the Food Education Fund, he said, is “probably one of the most important drivers” of that objective.
“If you have happy people within the organization, you just make better food,” Trabasas said.
It’s a far cry from the cutthroat culture that Ayesha Nurdjaja came up through. Mentoring did not exist, she said, and reality shows glamorized the grueling hours.
For that reason, she said, she keeps in touch with all three Food Education Fund students who have interned at her Middle Eastern restaurant on the West Side. She said she doesn’t do it “as a charity thing.” She instead hopes to act “like a small chef on their shoulder,” helping them understand the business and get a leg up in a difficult industry.
“Although we’re giving to the students, it’s really them giving to us because you get to see the hunger in their eyes,” she said. “They’re actually starting from fresh. And I think it gives us a restart to say, ‘Let me be as honest as I can.’”
The same part of town where Nurdjaja’s Shukette serves up labneh and baba ganoush has recently filled up with expensive real estate. The neighborhoods now house major tech companies and investment firms including Google and BlackRock.
Coming out of the pandemic, the West Side Community Fund formed to guide these global giants’ philanthropy toward their underserved neighbors. Drawn to the Food Education Fund’s job training for young students of color, the consortium’s grants have supported the nonprofit’s internships and a food-focused magazine.
“There’s a lot of buildings and businesses popping up around here,” said Jalen Lisbon, a member of WSCF’s grant administration team. “But we do want to make sure the longtime residents who don’t have all of those resources are not swept under the rug.”
It’s all part of a continuum, according to Kathy Wylde — the president of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit membership organization founded by David Rockefeller that mobilizes top business leaders to support development projects.
Wylde said the city has a culture of corporate philanthropy dating back to the late 19th century Gilded Age — a period marked by rapid industrialization, wealth inequality and political corruption when monopolies generated billions for families like the Rockefellers.
“There’s no place that has the level of corporate engagement that New York City has,” Wylde said. “It’s in their interest, and their business interest, to keep the city strong.”

6BY47ABRIC_0GTAE5E7IZCX62Q,Real estate magnate who came close to winning Colombia’s presidential election dies from cancer,By MANUEL RUEDA,_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/colombia-politician-rodolfo-hernandez-death-80ff13da1e14a375f81a4208e56c802b,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Rodolfo Hernández, a controversial real estate magnate and anti-corruption crusader who came close to winning Colombia’s presidential election two years ago, has died from colon cancer at a hospital near the city of Bucaramanga, his doctors said Monday in a statement. He was 79.
Hernández, a civil engineer and former mayor of Bucaramanga, surprised Colombians in 2022 when he made it to the second round of the nation’s presidential election with a low-cost, self-financed campaign that eschewed the clientelist networks that political parties in Colombia usually rely on.
Instead he relied on confrontational messages on X and snazzy social media videos to get his message out. He got 28% of the vote in the May 2022 election, which was enough for him to advance to a runoff against the leading candidate, Gustavo Petro.
Hernández was barely known among most Colombians when campaigning began. But he built a loyal following among conservative voters who were fed up with the nation’s traditional politicians. He lost in a hotly contested runoff to Petro, a life-long activist and former senator, who led a large coalition of left-wing parties, unions and social movements.
During his campaign, Hernández depicted himself as an anti-corruption crusader who would cut down public spending, and even turn some government buildings into museums. His message contrasted greatly with that of Petro, a leftist who argued that Colombia needs more government spending and regulation of the economy to rein in social and economic inequalities.

Hernández’s impact on Colombian politics faded after the election as he became mired in several investigations that undermined his credibility.
In June, a judge in Bucaramanga sentenced Hernández to five years in prison for steering a multimillion dollar sanitation contract towards a company led partially by his son, when he was the city’s mayor. He claimed he was innocent and had said he would appeal the ruling.
Due to his deteriorating health, the judge put Hernández under house arrest, but the politician spent much of his time in hospital. ___

6ODDZWNU3F_GQZ17Y9NSMX5QDG,Indonesia deports an ex-Philippine town mayor accused in Manila of cybercrimes,By EDNA TARIGAN and NINIEK KARMINI,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-philippines-fugitive-arrest-c4efd0410a1756f65295df339fb6430a,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Indonesia on Thursday deported a dismissed Philippine town mayor accused in Manila of helping establish an illegal online gaming and scam center and evading an investigation by the Philippine Senate.
Alice Guo, 34, will continue her legal process in Manila, according to a written statement from Indonesia’s Law and Human Rights Ministry’s Directorate General of Immigration.
Indonesian police arrested Guo Tuesday in the outskirts of Jakarta. In exchange, Indonesian authorities hope that the Philippines will repatriate Australian Gregor Johann Haas, one of Indonesia’s most-wanted drug suspects, who was arrested in central Philippines in May.
Guo was scheduled to undergo a medical checkup at the police headquarters before being handed to the Philippine Senate.
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. thanked Indonesia Wednesday for the arrest of Guo, who was accused in the Philippines of helping establish an illegal online gaming and scam center catering mostly to clients in China.
Guo was also accused of being a Chinese spy and of faking her Filipino citizenship, which allowed her to be elected in 2022 as mayor of the rural town of Bamban in Tarlac province north of Manila.
Guo, who denied wrongdoing, was dismissed from her post for grave misconduct by the Ombudsman, a Philippine agency that investigates and prosecutes government officials accused of crimes including graft and corruption.

After Guo fled the Philippines in July, she was tracked in Malaysia and Singapore before turning up in Indonesia. Two companions, who reportedly slipped out of the Philippines with her, were recently arrested in Indonesia and immediately deported to the Philippines.
In July, Marcos ordered a ban on widespread and mostly Chinese-run online gaming operations, accusing them of involvement in human trafficking, torture, kidnappings and murder.
Khrisna Murti, chief of the international division of the national police, said Wednesday in Jakarta that “exchange efforts are still being negotiated” over the return of Haas.
Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos and Philippine National Police chief Gen. Rommel Francisco Marbil flew to Jakarta Thursday to hold talks with their Indonesian counterparts.
Asked about the reported detainee swap, Indonesian Ambassador to Manila Agus Widjojo told the state-run People’s Television Network that “the talks have only just started” Thursday.
Haas, reportedly the father of a rugby star in Australia, has been described by the Bureau of Immigration in Manila as a “a high-profile fugitive for being an alleged member of the Sinaloa cartel, a large international organized crime syndicate based in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico that specializes in drug trafficking and money laundering activities.”
Indonesian authorities alleged that in December Haas tried to smuggle into Indonesia a shipment of floor ceramics filled with more than five kilograms (11 pounds) of methamphetamine, a highly addictive stimulant which is prohibited in Indonesia and the Philippines.
Australia, which had abolished the death penalty, is concerned that Haas may potentially face capital punishment if he’s repatriated to Indonesia, a Philippine official told the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.
Under Indonesia’s strict drug law, Haas could face the death penalty by firing squad.
Australia’s extradition law doesn’t allow anyone to be extradited to a country that would execute that person regardless of nationality.

6R4B2IWJDH_CXCBAVG3906GFVT,Race for Alaska’s lone US House seat narrows to final 4 candidates,By BECKY BOHRER,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-alaska-house-primary-results-522fac47756ab1bda0c90cb4a9dcf8b9,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Two candidates who combined received just over 1% of the vote in Alaska’s U.S. House primary last week can advance to November’s ranked choice general election.
Matthew Salisbury, a Republican, and John Wayne Howe, who is chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party, can advance, according to results released late Friday by the state Division of Elections. The narrowed field already includes two frontrunners, Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola and Republican Nick Begich.
Alaska’s open primary system advances the top four vote-getters, regardless of party, to the general election. Peltola finished with the most votes in a field of 12 in the Aug. 20 primary, followed by Begich and Republican Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, who was backed by former President Donald Trump. Far behind them were Salisbury and Howe, who led the remaining candidates.
Dahlstrom announced her withdrawal last week, and elections director Carol Beecher said this allowed for the fifth-place finisher to qualify for the November ballot.
Elections officials were targeting Sunday to certify the primary results, and Monday is the deadline for candidates to withdraw from the general election.
Peltola, Begich and Dahlstrom were the only candidates in the race to report raising any money.
Peltola became the first Alaska Native in Congress in 2022 following the death of Republican U.S. Rep. Don Young, who had held the seat for 49 years. The elections that year were the first held using the new voting process.

Begich, who has spoken against ranked choice voting, has said conservatives need to unite to defeat Peltola in November.
Dahlstrom, in announcing her decision Aug. 23, said that throughout her career she’s done “what’s right for Alaska. And today is no different. At this time, the best thing I can do for our state and our Party is to withdraw my name from the general election ballot and end my campaign.”
An initiative that seeks to repeal the open primary and ranked vote general election system also will appear on the fall ballot.
Salisbury, in his candidate statement filed with the Division of Elections, said the culture in Washington “has allowed the citizen to be forgotten. I have joined the race for our solo seat in the house, to make sure the voices of the people are heard and in turn amplified throughout D.C. and the country.”
Howe, in his statement, said Alaskans are “imprisoned by Government” and called the federal government “an oppressing master.”
There are nearly 18,900 registered voters with the Alaskan Independence Party, making it the third largest of the four recognized political parties in the state, according to Division of Elections statistics. But the majority of registered voters aren’t affiliated with a party."
702PH4G49G_LNJUYEC34Q7IMY5,Taiwan investigators to rule on further detention of former presidential candidate amid graft probe,By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/taiwan-ko-corruption-politics-ba92413072f7399f60d0c3c047a884ef,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Investigators were in talks early Monday on whether to further detain a former Taiwan presidential candidate amid graft allegations that have sparked minor street protests by his supporters.
Ko Wen-je, chairman of the Taiwan People’s Party, was held in custody overnight Saturday and questioning resumed with no announcement as of early Monday morning. Supporters gathered outside the prosecutors office in Taipei, holding signs and chanting slogans demanding Ko’s release and alleging judicial oppression. Investigators refused Ko’s request to return home out of concern he would collude with others involved in the case.
Ko, who trained as a doctor and also served as mayor of Taipei, and his TPP emerged as a third force in a sometimes rambunctious democracy. The country has been dominated by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the remainder of the Nationalist Party that fled to Taiwan after the Communist Party’s takeover of mainland China in 1949.
Ko and others were named in May in a scandal in which the developer of the downtown Core Pacific Center shopping center was given permission to massively expand the floor space available for lease during Ko’s 2014-2022 term as mayor. Ko’s home and TPP offices were raided before he was called in for questioning on Friday. The shopping center is still under construction and DPP politicians have called for a suspension of work or even demolition.
Ko finished third with about a quarter of the vote in this year’s election, which was won by the DPP’s William Lai Ching-te, whose party favors continued de-facto independence from China. The TPP won just under 3% of the seats in the legislature.

Ko did particularly well among young people despite having no clear political platform. He flirted briefly with both the DPP and Nationalists but was unable to come to terms on an alliance, leaving him with few political allies outside his own supporters.
Once a major problem, political corruption has declined as a top concern amid a strengthening of the power of independent investigators.
Lai has not publicly commented on the specifics of the case, saying only that “if there is law breaking, if there is evidence, then the law must be upheld regardless of the person or their party affiliation,” according to the government’s Central News Agency."
7JLKAC3ZXR_AEZ0YPUFKR7RMGB,District attorney’s progressive policies face blowback from Louisiana’s conservative Legislature,By JACK BROOK,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/new-orleans-district-attorney-controversy-e767b867a696dd078bf6c01271b1547e,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — New Orleans District Attorney Jason Williams promised to address the city’s history of prosecutorial and police misconduct when he was elected four years ago, but now he’s facing an investigation by Republican politicians who are concerned he is abusing his power.
Williams, a Black Democrat in an overwhelmingly conservative state, replaced a hard-nosed, tough-on-crime incumbent when he was elected in 2020. Since then, he’s focused on responding to what he describes as the “sins of the past” in New Orleans, and in a state which has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country. Conservative lawmakers and officials are concerned he is arbitrarily putting people convicted of violent crimes back on the streets given the state’s high homicide rates in recent years.
Over the past three years, Williams’ office reports having voided convictions or reduced sentences in several hundred cases via a process known as post-conviction relief that allows the court to consider new evidence after all other appeals have been exhausted. The landmark civil rights division of Williams’ office has reviewed old cases, leading to exonerations and plea-deal releases based on constitutional violations or legal practices his office considers unjust. Critics point out post-conviction relief was employed sparingly in the past by the district attorney’s office.
Williams has agreed to appear before a state senate committee on Sept. 5 over his office’s use of post-conviction relief.
A new law passed by a Republican-dominated Legislature earlier this year went into effect in August, effectively stripping Williams of his ability to engage in post-conviction relief without the approval of the Republican Attorney General. But state legislators had previously enacted a law in 2021 allowing district attorneys to amend sentences, even in cases without clear legal error, through post-conviction plea agreements with approval from judges.

Since 2021, Williams’ office reports as of late May having voided more than 140 convictions and reduced sentences in at least 180 cases, often re-sentencing them to lesser charges.
Conservative lawmakers have expressed concern that Williams’ office has been acting without transparency. Attorney General Liz Murrill said she is taking a “close look” at these cases and warned that convictions should not be changed “simply because the district attorney has a difference of opinion” from the courts and Legislature.
Williams is part of a wave of more than 50 progressive prosecutors who in the past decade have sought to reduce incarceration rates and review past cases where constitutional violations or excessive sentencing may have occurred. These prosecutors have more often faced blowback from ideological opponents at the state level than from the voters who elected them, typically in liberal cities with large Black populations, said Rebecca Goldstein, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
The concerns raised by Louisiana officials are largely in response to a social media campaign driven by Laura Rodrigue, a former prosecutor and daughter of the previous district attorney. Her advocacy group Bayou Mama Bears has warned Williams is endangering public safety and highlighted instances where his office resentenced or released people convicted of violent crimes.
Williams has said there has been no misconduct in his office’s use of post-conviction relief and that he is simply following through on his campaign promises.
“This is not just waking up and saying, ‘Hey, let’s try something new,” Williams said. “This is listening to the community and answering and trying to deliver.”
Williams has focused in particular on reviewing non-unanimous jury convictions. A 2020 Supreme Court ruling had declared these convictions unconstitutional. While the ruling did not automatically apply retroactively, Williams has not blocked people convicted prior to 2020 by non-unanimous juries from applying for post-conviction relief on these grounds.
The state has been in the process of reckoning with law enforcement practices rooted in white supremacist history such as non-unanimous jury convictions, said Colin Reingold, legal director of New Orleans-based advocacy group Promise of Justice.
Louisiana has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country, locking up 1,067 per 100,000 of the state’s residents, according to a recent report from the Prison Policy Initiative.
“If incarceration actually provided public safety we’d be the safest place in the country, but we’re not,” said Will Snowden, a law professor at Loyola University and former New Orleans public defender.
Following the election of a Republican-dominated state government last year, Louisiana’s Legislature convened a special session on crime in February and passed new laws, including expanding methods to carry out the death penalty and eliminating parole for most people in the future.
Republican Governor Jeff Landry has stated these laws are necessary to “deliver true justice to crime victims” and “enact real change that makes Louisiana a safer state for all.”
Williams has maintained that rebuilding trust in the criminal justice system helps increase public safety and said his office engages with victims and their families as they consider post-conviction relief cases.
Despite the ongoing clash over post-conviction relief, Williams and the Attorney General’s office have said they are working productively together in other areas such as addressing juvenile crime.
This story has been updated to correct that Williams is a Democrat in a conservative state, not a district.

7M8FSOA36V_OIDN3IE5JZLCGD3,Orano USA to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility in eastern Tennessee,_,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/tennessee-uranium-orano-usa-66ba64f8f22b99528914126b97ac6c93,"OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) — A France-based company that specializes in nuclear power and renewable energy has selected a site in eastern Tennessee to build a multibillion-dollar centrifuge uranium enrichment facility, Gov. Bill Lee announced.
The project was unveiled Wednesday in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the 750,000-square-foot center for Orano USA will be built.
“Tennessee is the number one state for nuclear energy companies to invest and thrive, and we are proud to partner with Orano to lead America’s energy independence and drive continued economic growth and greater opportunity for Tennesseans,” Lee said in a statement.
State officials did not release how much Orano USA will invest in the new site, but the project is expected to bring in 300 jobs.
Jean-Luc Palayer, CEO and president of Orano USA, said the next steps would involve securing “available federal support and customer commitments” and also obtaining a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
“Today we celebrate this major milestone towards bringing a new enrichment facility online to help meet our country’s need for an increased, secure domestic nuclear fuel supply,” Palayer added.
According to Knox News, the city of Oak Ridge, Roane County and the state’s nuclear fund will each contribute $5 million to help cover the cost of the utility preparations for the site.
The announcement in Tennessee comes after President Joe Biden signed off on legislation in May designed to end the import of enriched uranium from Russia. The new law also released around $2.7 billion to expand the domestic uranium fuel industry.

About 12% of the uranium used to produce electricity at U.S. nuclear power plants is imported from Russia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
“Energy independence will be critical to our nation’s success,” said Senate Speaker Randy McNally, a Republican from Oak Ridge who also serves as lieutenant governor. “The development and expansion of clean and efficient nuclear power is the path to that independence.”"
7N4OBBH4OG_OBTS9YFRRQ4A4EW,Hunter Biden’s tax trial carries less political weight but heavy emotional toll for the president,By ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and COLLEEN LONG,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-tax-trial-justice-department-california-beb51f4a830f4ed87e520dcd1920a5a6,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Hunter Biden’s continued legal problems may no longer be a political concern for the president, but they’re still very much a personal concern.
President Joe Biden’s son is already facing the prospect of prison time after his conviction on felony gun charges and is now confronting a second criminal trial in the case accusing him of dodging taxes on millions of dollars in income from foreign business entities.
The trial could put a spotlight on Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings that Republicans have spent years scrutinizing to accuse the Democratic president — without evidence — of corruption in connection with his son’s work overseas.
The potential political ramifications of the trial just weeks before the presidential election may have faded somewhat since President Biden’s July decision to drop out of the 2024 race. But the president is deeply concerned with the well-being of his son, so the trial is likely to weigh heavily on him in the final months of his five-decade political career.
It’s unclear whether the Biden family will attend the trial, which begins Thursday with jury selection in a Los Angeles federal court. First lady Jill Biden sat in the courtroom nearly every day of Hunter Biden’s trial in Delaware, flying home from France to be there only to turn around and return for an elaborate state visit at Élysée Palace.
The Bidens watched some of Hunter’s darkest moments relived in public during that trial, which ended with his conviction on three felony gun charges in June. The tax case could air more salacious evidence about what prosecutors say was lavish spending on things like escorts, drugs and exotic cars in the years Hunter Biden is accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes.

President Biden, for his part, has said he will not pardon his son nor commute any sentence. But the 81-year-old made those pledges while he was still actively campaigning. It’s not clear whether his mindset has changed now that he has only a few more months in the White House.
Neither trial was supposed to happen in the first place.
Hunter Biden had agreed last year to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax charges in a deal with special counsel David Weiss, the Delaware U.S. attorney who began investigating him during President Donald Trump’s administration.
Under the deal, Hunter Biden could have avoided prosecution in the gun case if he stayed out of trouble for two years. But the deal blew up after the Delaware judge raised concerns about unusual aspects of it, and Weiss subsequently indicted him on the gun charges in Delaware and tax charges in California.
The gun case resurfaced tawdry and embarrassing details surrounding Hunter Biden’s spiral into a crack cocaine addiction before becoming sober in 2019. Jurors saw personal text messages and photos of Hunter Biden with drug paraphernalia or partially clothed as prosecutors worked to convince them that he lied when he swore on a federal form to buy a gun in 2018 that he wasn’t a drug user.
It took just about three hours of deliberations for jurors to find him guilty on all three counts. The first lady clutched Hunter Biden’s hand as they strode from the courthouse, got into the waiting SUVs and drove off.
Weiss’ team has not yet said whether it will seek prison time when Hunter is sentenced in that case on Nov. 13 — the week after the election. The charges call for up to 25 years in prison, though as a first-time offender he would likely receive far less or potentially no prison time at all.
President Biden stayed away from the courthouse during the Delaware trial and said little about the case while it was ongoing to avoid the appearance that he was interfering in a criminal matter brought by his own Justice Department.
Shortly after Hunter’s conviction, the president and first lady issued a statement expressing love for their son and pride in his addiction recovery. Hours later, the president landed in Wilmington to spend the night at his Delaware home and embraced Hunter, who was waiting for him on the tarmac.
Hunter has remained by his father’s side in the months since the gun trial. He and other relatives watched from the Oval Office as the president gave his address to the nation explaining why he decided to quit the presidential race. And he joined his father on stage last month at the Democratic National Convention after the president’s speech endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris.
The tax indictment brought last year details what prosecutors allege was a four-year scheme to avoid paying taxes while spending wildly on things like drugs, strippers and luxury hotels. The back taxes have since been paid.
Hunter Biden’s lawyers have indicated they will make the case that he did not act “willfully,” or with the intention to break the law, arguing that alcohol and drug abuse impaired his decision-making and judgment.
Prosecutors have pressed the judge to allow them to tell jurors about Hunter’s spending habits, including payments to people to clean up drug paraphernalia for him, so they can evaluate whether he intentionally or mistakenly listed those items as business expenses.
“He’s not on trial because he hired people to clean out drug paraphernalia,” prosecutor Leo Wise said during a recent court hearing. “But then he went on and claimed it was a business expense.”
It’s unclear how many of the lurid details jurors will hear. U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi said he will maintain “strict control” over the presentation of potentially salacious evidence after the defense pressed the judge to keep it out of the case.
“They want the character assassination,” Mark Geragos, a celebrity lawyer leading Hunter’s defense in the California case, said during the hearing last month. “They want to slime him because that is the whole purpose.”
Prosecutors have also said they want to bring in evidence about Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings to prove his state of mind during the years at issue in the case.
That includes testimony about a Romanian businessman who prosecutors say hired Hunter Biden and a business associate to influence the U.S. government while his father was vice president. The Romanian was under criminal investigation in his home country at the time and had hoped the U.S. government could help end his legal woes, according to prosecutors.
Defense lawyers have accused prosecutors of trying to insert “politically-charged” and irrelevant details about his foreign business affairs into the trial. The judge deferred a ruling on the matter until trial but warned lawyers last month to keep focused on the tax allegations.

He will remain under house arrest,By STEPHEN McGRATH and NICOLAE DUMITRACHE,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/andrew-tate-appeal-trafficking-romania-87b33084d199adb233dfa5f47cdc452f,"BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — A court in Romania’s capital on Thursday rejected an appeal by prosecutors to jail divisive internet influencer Andrew Tate, who will remain under house arrest amid a second human trafficking investigation against him that allegedly involves minors.
The Bucharest Court of Appeal also ruled to keep Tate’s brother, Tristan Tate, under judicial control, which typically involves restricting communication with certain people and reporting periodically to the police. The brothers’ spokesperson, Mateea Petrescu, said that the judge also lifted certain restrictions regarding the brothers’ communication with alleged victims in the new case.
“They are free to meet and communicate with these alleged victims based on the close relationships they share and the children they have together,” she said, adding they “vehemently deny all allegations” against them.
After the court’s decision, Andrew Tate posted on X that the prosecutors had made a “desperate attempt to put us in jail with no evidence.”
The ruling comes weeks after Romania’s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, launched raids on four homes, including the Tates’ in Bucharest and nearby Ilfov county. After being briefly detained, prosecutors lost a request to keep the brothers in custody for 30 days, but appealed the decision.
Andrew Tate, 37, and brother Tristan Tate, 36, both former kickboxers and dual British-U.S. citizens, are already awaiting trial in Romania in a separate human trafficking case along with two Romanian women. Romanian prosecutors formally indicted all four last year.

In the new case, DIICOT said that it was investigating allegations of human trafficking, including the trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor, forming an organized criminal group, money laundering and influencing statements. The alleged crimes date between 2014 and 2024.
The agency said the defendants used the coercive “loverboy” method to exploit 34 vulnerable victims who were forced to produce pornographic materials for a fee online, and that more than $2.8 million (2.5 million euros) it generated was kept by the defendants.
An unnamed foreign man also sexually exploited a 17-year-old foreigner, DIICOT alleges, and said he kept all of the $1.5 million (1.3 million euros) made from the criminal activity. The same man “repeatedly had sexual relations and acts” with a 15-year-old, the agency alleges.
After the court’s decision, Andrew Tate wrote in a post on the social media platform X that the prosecutors had made a “desperate attempt to put us in jail with no evidence.”
Andrew Tate, who has 10 million followers on the social media platform X, is known for expressing misogynistic views online and has repeatedly said that prosecutors have no evidence against him and that there is a political conspiracy to silence him. He was previously banned from various social media platforms for misogynistic views and hate speech.
One of the brothers’ lawyers, Eugen Vidineac, responded to the court’s decision Thursday by saying that it shows that Romania “is a country where the judicial system is diligent and impartial and does not succumb to sensationalism.”
“We are looking forward to clearing my clients’ names and proving their innocence,” he added.
After the Tate brothers’ arrest in December 2022, they were held for three months in police detention before being moved to house arrest. They were later restricted to the Bucharest municipality and nearby Ilfov county, and then to Romania.
In April, the Bucharest Tribunal ruled in that case that prosecutors’ case file against them met the legal criteria and that a trial could start but didn’t set a date for it to begin.
In July, a court overturned an earlier decision that allowed the Tate brothers to leave Romania as they await trial.

8062S9ZHDJ_NKPBP0URMBAOIW4,Poland marks the 85th anniversary of Nazi Germany’s invasion at the start of World War II,By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/poland-world-war-2-anniversary-germany-westerplatte-90ff68e7592e9f2e0688a33a788507ff,"WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s leaders stressed the need for a strong defense in the face of war in neighboring Ukraine and redress as they led solemn ceremonies early Sunday to mark the 85th anniversary of German Nazi forces invading and bombing Polish territory at the start of World War II.
Sirens wailed and a memorial bell tolled as President Andrzej Duda and deputy ambassador of Germany, Robert Rohde, attended an observance in the town of Wielun, the first civilian target of German bombing in the small hours of Sept. 1, 1939. Some 1,200 people were killed in the attack which witnesses say began at 4:40 a.m.
“We can say that we have forgiven even though we remember, even though the pain is persisting and even though there are still tens of thousands of those who have been directly hurt by the Germans,” Duda said. He also called on Berlin to make amends.
Meanwhile, at a monument on the Baltic Sea’s Westerplatte peninsula, where a military outpost was shelled by a German warship just minutes after Wielun was attacked, Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz laid wreaths and attended a memorial roll call for fallen soldiers. At the time, the outpost’s outnumbered troops fought for seven days before surrendering to the Germans, becoming a symbol of heroism and patriotism.
Tusk said war was present again in the region as the Russian invasion of Ukarine, which began in 2022, grinds on.

He said, in a clear reference to Germany, it wasn’t enough to speak about “reconciliation” or to “bend your head in a sense of guilt,” adding that the best sign of lessons learned from the past is “the readiness to organize the entire western world, Europe and NATO for the defense against aggression that we are witnessing today in the battlefields of Ukraine.”
“Today we will not say ‘Neven Again.’ Today we must say ‘Never Again Alone’,” the prime minister said.
Tusk also said Poland was building “the most modern army in Europe, one of the strongest in Europe” to actively contribute to the unity and strength of the NATO defense alliance and the European continent and “to defend our civilization” and “never again expose our homeland to any risks.”
German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock posted on X, saying she wished Poles and Germans become “completely normal” toward one another, adding it was the desire of former Polish foreign minister Władysław Bartoszewski who survived the German invasion.
She also wrote that it was their responsibility, “while bearing our past in mind,” to constantly work to keep their friendship alive.
In more than five years of World War II and the brutal German occupation, Poland lost 6 million citizens, or a sixth of its population, of which 3 million were Jewish. The country also suffered huge losses to its infrastructure, industry and agriculture.
Poland’s previous right-wing government demanded $1.3 trillion in damages from Germany. Tusk’s current Cabinet has toned the demand down to some form of compensation that could serve to strengthen the ties between the two neighbors. Germany insists the matter is closed as it had paid damages to the Moscow-led East Bloc after the war. Warsaw says it did not get any share of it.
Addressing attendees at the Wielun observance, the Polish president said: “Forgiveness and the admission of guilt is one thing, but compensation for the damage caused is another thing. And this issue has not been settled yet.”

8AMWV857IC_L3KJZ1CD1SPHMN8,"As Iran threatens Israel, the danger of Tehran’s long-vaunted missile program remains in question",By JON GAMBRELL,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/iran-ballistic-missiles-israel-retaliation-gaza-war-edccddf7a871b78cd5528e265e1e7317,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran threatens to attack Israel over the assassination of a Hamas leader in the Iranian capital, its long-vaunted missile program offers one of the few ways for Tehran to strike back directly, but questions loom over just how much of a danger it poses.
The program was behind Iran’s unprecedented drone-and-missile assault on Israel in April, when Iran became the first nation to launch such a barrage since Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein lobbed Scud missiles at Israel in the 1991 Gulf War.
But few of the Iranian projectiles reached their targets. Many were shot down by a U.S.-led coalition, while others apparently failed at launch or crashed while in flight. Even those that reached Israel appeared to miss their marks.
Now a new report by experts shared exclusively with The Associated Press suggests one of Tehran’s most advanced missiles is far less accurate than previously thought.
The April assault showed “some ability to strike Israel,” said Sam Lair, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies who worked on the analysis. But “if I were supreme leader, I would probably be a little disappointed.”
If Iranian missiles are not able to hit targets precisely “that recasts their role,” Lair added. “They’re no longer as valuable for conducting conventional military operations. They may be more valuable simply as terror weapons.”


As an example, he recalled the harassing missile fire seen on cities in the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, when Iran could fire a variety of missiles at a large city and hope some got through.
Iran has repeatedly said it will retaliate for the killing of Ismail Haniyeh. Israel is widely suspected of carrying out the assassination, though it has not claimed it.
The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment. But Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tacitly acknowledged the country’s failure to strike anything of importance in Israel.
“Debates by the other party about how many missiles were fired, how many of them hit the target and how many didn’t, these are of secondary importance,” Khamenei said. “The main issue is the emergence of the Iranian nation” and the Iranian military “in an important international arena. This is what matters.”
Retaliation had been expected for days after a suspected Israeli strike on April 1 hit an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, Syria, killing two Iranian generals and five officers, as well as a member of the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah.
Footage aired on state television showed that Iran’s April 13 assault began with Revolutionary Guard commander Gen. Hossein Salami speaking by telephone with Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the commander of the Guard’s aerospace division.
“Start the ‘True Promise’ operation against Zionist regime’s bases,” he ordered.
As the missiles headed skyward, people across Iran stopped what they were doing and pointed their mobile phones at the launch noise from their cars and the balconies of their homes. Videos analyzed by the AP showed multiple launch sites, including on the outskirts of Arak, Hamadan, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Shiraz, Tabriz and Tehran.
Grainy footage later released through pro-Iranian military social media accounts showed missiles thundering off truck-based mobile launchers. Iran’s bomb-carrying Shahed drones, widely used by Russia in its war on Ukraine, leaped off metal stands, their engines whirring like lawnmowers through the night sky. Some were launched by pickup trucks racing down runways.
The triangle-shaped drones went first, taking hours to reach their targets. Then came the Paveh cruise missiles, taking a shorter time, and finally the Emad, Ghadr and Kheibar Shekan ballistic missiles, which needed only minutes, according to an analysis by the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. Drones and missiles also came from Yemen, likely fired by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.
Israeli officials estimated that Iran launched 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles and 120 ballistic missiles. In Jordan, an AP journalist filmed what appeared to be a ballistic missile being intercepted above the Earth’s atmosphere, likely by an Israeli Arrow 3 missile, with the blast radiating out like a circle.
The U.S., the United Kingdom, France and Jordan all shot down incoming fire. The Americans claimed to have downed 80 bomb-carrying drones and at least six ballistic missiles. Israeli missile defenses were also activated, though their initial claim of intercepting 99% of the projectiles appeared to be an exaggeration.
The attack “was very clearly not something symbolic and not something trying to avoid damage,” said Fabian Hinz, a missile expert and research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies who studies Iran. It was “a major attempt to overcome Israeli defenses.”
U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, told the AP they assessed that 50% of the Iranian missiles failed at launch or crashed before reaching their target.
In the aftermath, analysts at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies examined the strike on the Nevatim Air Base some 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Jerusalem in the Negev Desert. The center’s experts long have studied Iran and its ballistic missile program.
The base came into immediate focus after the suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian diplomatic mission in Syria. Iran’s ambassador to Syria, Hossein Akbari, claimed that the strike was conducted by Israeli F-35Is, which are based at Nevatim.
The air base also figured into Iranian military propaganda. Iranian state television aired footage in February of a Revolutionary Guard test that targeted a mock-up resembling F-35I hangars at Nevatim. Ballistic missiles, including some of the kinds used in the April attack on Israel, destroyed the mock-up.
In the attack, at least four Iranian missiles struck Nevatim, as seen in satellite images and footage released by the Israeli military.
The only debris found in the area — collected from the Dead Sea — suggests Iran used Emad missiles to target Nevatim, the analysts said. The liquid-fueled Emad, or “pillar” in Farsi, is a variant of Iran’s Shahab-3 missile built from a North Korean design with a reported range of 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles). That indicates the Emads were likely fired from the Shiraz area, which is within the estimated limits of the missile’s likely capabilities, the analysts said.
Based on Iran’s focus on the F-35I, the James Martin analysts assumed the likely target point for the Iranian fire would be a cluster of aircraft hangars. The position also serves as a near-central point within the Nevatim base itself.
That offers “a much more valuable target” than just “poking holes in the runway,” Lair said. But none of the Iranian missiles directly hit those hangars.
Assuming Iran targeted the hangars, the James Martin analysts measured the distance between the hangars and the impact zones of the missiles. That gave an average of about 1.2 kilometers (0.75 miles) for the “circular error probable” — a measurement used by experts to determine a weapon’s accuracy based on the radius of a circle that encompasses 50% of where the missiles landed.
That’s far worse than a 500-meter (1,640-foot) error circle first estimated by experts for the Emad. After a U.N. weapons ban on Iran ended in 2020, Iran separately advertised the Emad to potential international buyers as having a 50-meter (164-foot) circle — a figure that is in line with top missile specifications for systems deployed elsewhere, said Hinz, the IISS missile expert.
The results from April’s attack were nowhere near that precise.
“This means the Emad is much less accurate than previous estimates indicated,” Lair said. “This indicates the Iranians are a generation behind where previous assessments thought they were in accuracy.”
The poor performance may be attributable to electronic warfare measures designed to confuse the missile’s guidance system, as well as potential sabotage, poor missile design and the distances involved in the attack.
In the past, Iranian threats to retaliate against Israel generally took the form of either attacks by Iranian-backed forces in the Mideast or assaults aimed at Israeli targets elsewhere, such as embassies or tourists aboard.
Geography limits the options for a direct Iranian military attack. Iran shares no border with Israel, and the two countries are some 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) apart at the shortest distance.
Iran’s air force has an aging fleet led by F-14 Tomcats and Mikoyan MiG-29 fighter jets from the Cold War, but they would be no match for Israel’s F-35Is and its air defenses. That means Iran again would need to rely on missiles and long-range drones.
It could also enlist help from allied militias such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels to overwhelm Israel’s defenses. Israel and Hezbollah exchanged heavy fire on Aug. 25.
Always present in the background is the risk that Tehran could develop a nuclear weapon, a threat that Iranian officials have repeated in recent months. While Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, Western intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency say Tehran had an organized military nuclear program until 2003.
U.S. intelligence agencies said in a report in July that Iran has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.” However, building a weapon and miniaturizing it to put on a ballistic missile could take years.
“Iran has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the region and continues to emphasize improving the accuracy, lethality and reliability of these systems,” the report from the director of national intelligence said. “Iran probably is incorporating lessons learned” from the April attack.

8NDFQEGYHO_I63T48ROJEEENZG,"Civil rights activist Sybil Morial, wife of New Orleans’ first Black mayor, dead at 91",By REBECCA SANTANA,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/sybil-marc-dutch-morial-new-orleans-f525600587b6cb0e5bab44b8c8fa9cbd,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Sybil Haydel Morial, a civil rights activist, widow of New Orleans’ first Black mayor, Ernest “Dutch” Morial, and mother to former Mayor, Marc Morial, has died at age 91.
Her family announced her death Wednesday in a statement issued by the National Urban League, which Marc Morial serves as president and CEO. Details on the time and cause of death were not released.
“She confronted the hard realities of Jim Crow with unwavering courage and faith, which she instilled not only in her own children but in every life she touched,” the statement said.
Morial was born Nov. 26, 1932, and raised by her physician father and schoolteacher mother in a deeply segregated New Orleans. She later met the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Boston and returned home inspired to do her part in the civil rights movement.
In her 2015 memoir, “Witness to Change: From Jim Crow to Empowerment,” Morial described how she and her friends, including the future mayor of Atlanta, Andrew Young, were chased out of New Orleans’ City Park by a police officer because of their skin color.
She attended Xavier University, one of the city’s historically Black higher learning institutions, before transferring to Boston University, where King was pursuing a divinity degree and guest-preaching at churches.
Later, while traveling home, she and other Black passengers had to move to the baggage car when the train crossed the Mason-Dixon line.

“The barricade that kept us out of schools, jobs, restaurants, hotels, and even restrooms would have to be dismantled brick by brick, law by law,” she wrote.
She was in Boston in 1954, the year the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision overturning racial segregation in schools.
“Those of us from the South ... We wanted to go back home because we wanted to be a part of change. We knew change was coming,” she said during a 2018 interview with Louisiana Public Broadcasting.
That summer, she tried to integrate New Orleans’ other leading universities -- Tulane and Loyola. She signed up for summer sessions at both, and attended classes for nearly a week at Tulane while they waited for her transcript to arrive from Boston, but was eventually told that she could not enroll because of her race.
At Loyola, she was told that “according to state law, Negroes cannot attend the same school as whites.”
Her return home in 1954 also brought her face-to-face with the man she would marry: Ernest Nathan “Dutch” Morial. The two fell into an intense discussion about the court’s recent desegregation decision during a summer vacation book club.
They wed the next year and she supported her husband thereafter, raising five children and teaching school while he ran for the state Legislature in 1968 and for mayor in 1978.
She was often the one who had to shield their children from the resulting racist threats, racing for the phone to answer it first.
During Morial’s first mayoral term, National Guard troops were stationed at their house to protect the family during the 1979 police strike that led to the cancellation of Mardi Gras parades.
Sybil Morial also became a city power player in her own right.
She founded the Louisiana League of Good Government, which helped Black people register to vote at a time when they still had to pass tests such as memorizing the Preamble to the Constitution. She also was a plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging a Louisiana law that barred public school teachers from being involved in groups fighting segregation, according to the LSU Women’s Center.
She held various administrative positions over 28 years at Xavier and served on numerous boards and advisory committees across the city.
“Few women have played such an outsized role in the recent history of New Orleans,” former Mayor Mitch Landrieu said in a social media post. Current Mayor LaToya Cantrell called Morial “a New Orleans treasure and trailblazer” and said the city’s flag would fly at half-staff in her honor.
As part of the 1984 World’s Fair in New Orleans, she championed the building of a pavilion dedicated to African American contributions and experiences in American history, and in 1987 she was the executive producer of “A House Divided,” a documentary about desegregation in New Orleans.
After her husband died unexpectedly in 1989 at age 60, Morial wrote that she briefly flirted with the idea of running for mayor in 1994. Instead, her son Marc, then 35, ran and won, launching a second generation of Morial mayors.
Funeral plans have not been announced. Sybil Morial is survived by her five children, seven grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.

8NVHLET61V_GLAQCZQD31S7LUZ,Fictional sleuth Sam Spade will be back on the job in upcoming novel by Max Allan Collins,By HILLEL ITALIE,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/sam-spade-sequel-max-allan-collins-d631c96ed06969250c47700746241b0f,"NEW YORK (AP) — The story of one of the great fictional sleuths, Dashiell Hammett ‘s Sam Spade, will be continued by prize-winning crime writer Max Allan Collins.
The publisher Hard Case Crime announced Thursday that Collins’ “The Return of the Maltese Falcon” will be released in January 2026, when the Hammett classic featuring Spade, “The Maltese Falcon,” enters the public domain. “The Maltese Falcon,” published in 1930 and known to movie fans for the 1941 adaptation starring Humphrey Bogart, is widely regarded as a model for the hard-boiled detective novel.
“It has been an inspiration to authors and filmmakers, actors and illustrators and musicians — and to me, for the entire 50-plus years I’ve been a novelist,” Collins said in a statement. “Not that writing about the world Hammett created, and those immortal, sometimes immoral characters isn’t challenging — Hammett’s best mystery also happens to be one of the greatest American novels, period.”
When copyright protection ends for a book, anyone is free to use the characters and story line. After F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “The Great Gatsby” entered the public domain, in 2021, new creations included a Tony-winning musical of the same name and a prequel novel, “Nick,” by Michael Farris Smith.
According to Hard Case Crime, Collins’ new book will bring back Spade and Joel Cairo among other Hammett characters, and “a mysterious new femme fatale.” Collins, whose “Road to Perdition” was adapted into a film starring Tom Hanks and Paul Newman, has a long history of working with famous literary detectives. He took over the Dick Tracy comic strip in the late 1970s after creator Chester Gould retired, and he was later authorized to continue Mickey Spillane’s Mike Hammer series.

“I’m something of an old hand at walking in the shoes of the giants who came before, though I never claim to filling them,” Collins told The Associated Press.
Various authorized Spade projects have been released, including a 2009 prequel, Joe Gores’ “Spade & Archer,” a novel about Spade and his professional partner, Miles Archer. Spade was featured this year in an AMC miniseries, “Monsieur Spade,” starring Clive Owen in a sequel that finds the detective retired and living in the South of France."
8RDUCAZ0H9_FF9XO0JRR3O35KF,How a narrow strip of scrubland has become an obstacle to a cease-fire in Gaza,By JOSEPH KRAUSS,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-egypt-philadelphi-corridor-cd15c27cecffe70322becd933cf38909,"A narrow strip of scrubland and sand dunes on the Gaza side of the border with Egypt has emerged as a major obstacle in talks aimed at halting the Israel-Hamas war and freeing scores of hostages.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must maintain control over the so-called Philadelphi corridor to prevent Hamas from replenishing its arsenal through a network of smuggling tunnels in the area. He says that’s necessary to ensure the group can never again launch an attack into Israel like the one on Oct. 7 that ignited the war.
But many Israelis, including the defense minister, say Israel should relinquish the corridor, at least for a short period of time, in order to secure an agreement to bring back around 100 hostages still held in Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.
The debate reached a fever pitch this weekend after Israel recovered the bodies of six hostages that the military says Hamas killed as troops closed in. Critics say they could have been returned alive in a cease-fire deal and accuse Netanyahu of sabotaging the talks for his own political interests.
Hamas has demanded a full withdrawal from Gaza and says Netanyahu only raised the demand for the Philadelphi corridor in recent weeks to derail the talks.
Netanyahu blames Hamas for the lack of a deal and says the demand is not new.
Egypt, which has served as a key mediator, is also opposed to any Israeli presence along the Gaza side of its border and says it would threaten the decades-old peace treaty between the two countries, a cornerstone of regional stability.

The Philadelphi corridor is a strip — only 100 meters (yards) wide in some places— that runs the 14-kilometer (8.6-mile) length of the Gaza side of the border with Egypt. It includes the Rafah crossing, which was Gaza’s only outlet to the outside world not controlled by Israel until the army captured the entire corridor in May.
Israel says Hamas used a vast network of tunnels beneath the border to import arms, allowing it to build up the military machine it deployed on Oct. 7. The military says it has found and destroyed dozens of tunnels since seizing the corridor.
At a news conference on Monday, Netanyahu pointed to a map of the region depicting weapons flowing into Gaza from across the border, saying the corridor provided “oxygen” for Hamas.
Egypt released a statement Tuesday rejecting Netanyahu’s allegations, saying they misled the Israeli public and obstructed cease-fire efforts. Egypt says it destroyed hundreds of tunnels on its side of the border years ago and set up a military buffer zone of its own that prevents smuggling.
For weeks, Israeli media have quoted unnamed security officials lambasting Netanyahu, saying the corridor is not essential to Israel’s security and should not hold up a deal to return hostages. Some have suggested an international force could patrol the border, perhaps with remote Israeli sensors.
The dispute sparked a shouting match at a security Cabinet meeting last week, in which Defense Minister Yoav Gallant accused Netanyahu of favoring border arrangements over the lives of the hostages, according to an Israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting. Gallant was the lone dissenting voice in a subsequent vote in favor of maintaining control over the Philadelphi corridor and has since called on the government to reverse it.
Families of hostages have led months of mass protests calling on Netanyahu to make a deal with Hamas to return their loved ones. The biggest demonstrations yet erupted over the weekend after the killing of the six hostages, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, one of the best-known captives.
Netanyahu’s supporters say that conceding the Philadelphi corridor now would reward Hamas for killing the captives. They maintain that only relentless military pressure can defeat Hamas, return the hostages and bring about a deal that ensures Israel’s long-term security.
Any Israeli presence inside Gaza would be widely seen as a military occupation, likely prolonging the conflict.
It could also extend, perhaps indefinitely, the closure of the Rafah crossing, which has been a lifeline for Gaza since Egypt and Israel began imposing various degrees of a blockade on the territory after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007.
For 16 years, it was the only way for most Palestinians to exit or enter Gaza. During the first seven months of the war, it was also the only route available for medical evacuations and the main entry point for desperately needed humanitarian aid.
Israel captured Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, territories the Palestinians want for their own state. It withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but continued to control the territory’s airspace, coastline, and all of its border crossings except Rafah.
Hamas has adamantly rejected any Israeli presence in Gaza, including in the Philadelphi corridor and the Netzarim corridor, a buffer zone carved out by Israel separating northern from southern Gaza. Israel says it needs that corridor to search Palestinians returning to their homes in the north to keep militants from slipping in.
Israel denies its demands regarding the two corridors are new, referring to them as “clarifications” of an earlier proposal endorsed by President Joe Biden in a May 31 speech and by the U.N. Security Council.
Israel also accuses Hamas of making unacceptable demands since then, and says the militant group is hindering a deal, including by killing hostages who would be part of it.
Biden’s speech and the Security Council resolution referred to a complete Israeli withdrawal. Egyptian officials and Hamas say the demands regarding the corridors were not included in subsequent versions of the U.S.-backed proposal, including one that Hamas said it accepted in early July.
Egypt is deeply opposed to any Israeli military presence along the Gaza border and has refused to reopen its side of the Rafah crossing unless the Gaza side is returned to Palestinian control.
It has accused Israel of violating annexes to the landmark 1979 peace treaty pertaining to Israel’s 2005 withdrawal from Gaza that regulate the deployment of forces along the border. Israeli officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The United States, which is providing crucial military support to Israel while also serving as a mediator, has not taken a position on the corridors, at least publicly, while Hamas has accused it of trying to impose Israel’s demands on the militant group.
Biden said Monday that Netanyahu was not doing enough to bring about a cease-fire, without elaborating.

8UH9YD3F2Y_RYWUMKDRKHN7VLV,EU officials pledge to develop more water-saving technologies in farming as droughts worsen,By MENELAOS HADJICOSTIS,_,20230904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/climate-drought-water-conservation-d9d39953061011f58dfc87b9dc677ec7,"AYIA NAPA, Cyprus (AP) — Officials from nine southern European Union countries pledged Tuesday to work together to develop more water-saving technologies in agriculture as the prospect of worsening droughts puts additional strain on farmers and threatens food security.
The promises came during a gathering in Cyprus of the so called MED9 countries — France, Greece, Italy, Croatia, Portugal, Malta, Spain and Slovenia — to address growing water scarcity as a result of climate change, especially in the Mediterranean region, which they say is being affected to a greater degree than other parts of the 27-member bloc.
The officials also pledged to share technical and practical data and launch joint research programs to make water use as efficient as possible.
“Climate change is a real threat to food production worldwide, and this risk is even more severe in the Mediterranean area,” Spain’s Agriculture Minister Luis Planas told the meeting. “We must both fight climate change and, at the same time, adapt the working conditions of our farmers to this new climate situation.”
Cyprus Agriculture Minister Maria Panayiotou warned that Europe last year faced its worst drought in 500 years and cited local examples of “smart” irrigation systems and solar power-related technologies that help protect crops, generate electricity and save water use by 30%.
Portuguese Agriculture Minister Jose Manuel Fernandes urged for more EU funding to help finance new water-saving technologies and create new incentives to attract younger people to revitalize an aging farming population.

French Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau highlighted latest techniques that help create new crops, able to thrive in harsher climate conditions while Fernandes said so-called genomic research is “totally different” from genetically modified crops that have stirred controversy within the bloc in the past.
The MED9 officials also urged the EU to come up with a common approach to water conservation while taking into account regional requirements.

9D9Y6BGEXO_W7YY1J4TNYJLDIM,What to know about Israel’s major weeklong raid in the West Bank city of Jenin,By JACK JEFFERY and JULIA FRANKEL,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-west-bank-jenin-hamas-militants-c1618cc024d8a5269486e266593b5434,"For more than a week, hundreds of Israeli forces have carried out the deadliest operation in the occupied West Bank since the war in Gaza began. Their focus has been the Jenin refugee camp — a bastion of Palestinian militancy that has grown more fervent since the Hamas attack on Israel that launched the war.
The fighting in Jenin accounts for 18 of the 33 Palestinians health officials say have been killed, most of whom the military says have been militants. Israel says its soldiers are dug in for battle with Hamas and other groups, meaning the death toll is likely to rise.
Israeli military officials say the operation targeting militants in Jenin, Tulkarem and the Al-Faraa refugee camp is necessary to curb recent attacks against Israeli civilians they say have become more sophisticated and deadly. One Israeli soldier has been killed in the operation.

The Jenin raid has been devastating for Palestinian civilians, too. Water and electric service have been cut, families have been confined to their homes and ambulances evacuating the wounded have been slowed on their way to nearby hospitals, as Israeli soldiers search for militants.
Here’s what we know about the raid on Jenin:
Jenin has long been a flashpoint in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
It was originally established to house Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes during the war surrounding Israel’s creation in 1948. But over time the refugee camp morphed into a crowded, urban neighborhood that — like the rest of the West Bank — has been under Israeli military occupation since 1967.

In 2002, during the height of the second intifada, or uprising, Israeli forces flattened large sections of the impoverished city. The gunfighting that ensued killed 52 Palestinians and 23 Israeli soldiers, according to the United Nations.
In recent years, the Palestinian Authority, which administers urban pockets of the West Bank, has had a diminishing influence in Jenin. It is seen by many Jenin residents as a subcontractor of the occupation because it coordinates with Israel on security matters. On occasion, the authority’s forces have clashed and exchanged fire with Palestinian militants.
The militant groups Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas operate freely across Jenin, and fight together in Gaza, too. Jenin’s streets are regularly lined with posters depicting slain fighters as martyrs to the Palestinian struggle, while young men carrying walkie-talkies patrol the alleys.
Since war broke out on Oct. 7, Israeli forces have stepped up their raids on Jenin, often launching drone strikes on targets there. But until the most recent raid, most had only lasted several hours, or at most a few days.
Also since Oct. 7, there has been a surge of violence by settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, and an increase in the construction of settlements in the occupied territory.
More than 680 Palestinians in the West Bank have been killed since October, most by Israeli troops and some by settlers, according to local health officials. The Israeli army did not immediately respond to a query seeking the number of Israelis killed in the West Bank over the same period.
In Jenin, armored vehicles have blocked entrances and exits, and bulldozers have plowed roads. Soldiers set up positions inside abandoned buildings, searched homes and traded fire with militants. Israeli forces surrounded hospitals, stopping ambulances carrying in waves of wounded to check if they were sheltering militants.
Israeli aims in Jenin are more modest than in Gaza, where it publicly pledged to wipe out Hamas’ military capabilities in the enclave for good through a months-long campaign
In the West Bank, Israel is not aiming to entirely wipe out the militant activity concentrated in several of the territory’s refugee camp’s, said a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military restrictions. Instead, the raids are intended to thwart pending attacks on Israeli civilians — such as an attempted bombing in Tel Aviv claimed by Hamas in August and a shooting of an Israeli civilian in the Palestinian town of Qalqilya in June.
The military official said the operation across the West Bank involves fewer soldiers than a major raid on the Jenin camp before the war that killed 12. But he could not say when the raid would end.
Some analysts are skeptical the latest raid in Jenin would have any dramatic long-term impact, in terms of making Israel less vulnerable to West Bank militancy.
“The current escalation relies on intense efforts of Hamas and Iran and deep weakness of the PA — which are not going to be changed,” said Michael Milshtein, a former Israeli army intelligence officer who is now an analyst of Palestinian affairs at Tel Aviv University. “Another operation is a matter of time.”
Jenin’s residents have described scenes of destruction. They said some Israeli soldiers are moving from house to house, while others are digging up roads with armored bulldozers.
When asked, the army said its troops are clearing militant command centers scattered across the city and uprooting explosive devices buried underneath streets.
“They cut off the water, they cut off the electricity, they cut off the internet. We are ready to live by candlelight,” said Jenin resident Mohannad Hajj Hussein.
Oroba al-Shalabi said she fled her family home in the heart of Jenin last Saturday after being briefly detained by Israeli forces and separated from her male relatives.
“They (the Israeli soldiers ) locked us in a room at the beginning, and when we went out (of the room) the men were tied to the floor,” she said. Soon after she was allowed to leave, but without her male family members.
The Israeli military official said there is no curfew in Jenin and that the army is allowing civilians to leave different areas of the city if they wish.
But many districts of the city remain near impossible to access, said Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, whose ambulances must coordinate with Israeli authorities before they can be dispatched. Over the past week, she said the humanitarian organization has received hundreds of calls from residents in Jenin asking for food, medications and baby formula.
“People are trapped now in Jenin refugee camp.....we’re still getting dozens of calls,” she said."
9OABAEZHD1_O2WSJWOHKZZ9OEF,"Trump boasted he’d open all JFK files, but now says he can’t",By DEB RIECHMANN,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/trump-boasted-hed-open-all-jfk-files-but-now-says-he-cant-2f48d57f9ee045d98eb784d2295288ef,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump boasted last fall that he would open all remaining John F. Kennedy assassination records. So far, Trump hasn’t made good on the “great transparency” he promised then.
Trump announced on Thursday that the public must wait another three years or more before seeing material that must remain classified for national security reasons — more than five decades after Kennedy was killed Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas.
The National Archives released its last batch of more than 19,000 records on Thursday. But an undisclosed amount of material remains under wraps because Trump said the potential harm to U.S. national security, law enforcement or foreign affairs is “of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in immediate disclosure.”
He ordered the CIA and other agencies to take yet another look at each blacked-out section of their documents during the next three years to see what more can be released.
CIA spokesman Nicole de Haay said the agency has already released more than 99 percent of CIA information that was in the Kennedy assassination records collection. “CIA narrowly redacted information in rare instances only to protect CIA assets, officers and their families as well as intelligence methods, operations and partnerships that remain critical to the security of our nation,” she said.
Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of a book about Kennedy, lamented that it might be 100 years post-assassination before everyone has a more complete picture of what happened. “I envy the scholars of, say, 2063,” Sabato said.

The files released Thursday — mostly FBI and CIA records — detail how authorities combed through tips in the wake of Kennedy’s death, including a report from a woman who claimed she saw a man who looked like Oswald at a party in Mexico City.
Another file shows ex-CIA officer David Atlee Phillips being grilled by lawmakers about whether he believed Oswald was the lone assassin. Phillips said he wished there was information showing the Soviets or former Cuban leader Fidel Castro had played a role “because there are so many people, especially on college campuses who are convinced the CIA did it.”
But Phillips said since there was no evidence showing Cuban or Soviet involvement, he had to believe Oswald was just “a kind of loony fellow who decided to shoot the President.”
“Lee Harvey Oswald didn’t miss, and the American public doesn’t want to believe that one man could murder Camelot,” Phillips said.
The records are still being released today because in 1992, Congress passed the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act. The act ordered the archives to disclose all information collected — some 5 million pages of material — on the assassination within 25 years — barring any exceptions designated by the president.
Those 25 years ended Oct. 26, 2017 and Trump had to decide whether any of the documents should still be kept secret. Several days before the deadline, it appeared Trump had no plans to withhold anything.
“Subject to the receipt of further information,” he tweeted on Oct. 21, 2017. “I will be allowing, as president, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.”
Again, on the day before the deadline, it appeared every last shred of the government’s material was headed for release. “The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow. So interesting!” Trump tweeted.
A lot of documents were released, but not all. Bending to appeals from the CIA and FBI, Trump blocked the release of hundreds of records pending a six-month review. “In the end there will be great transparency. It is my hope to get just about everything to public!” Trump tweeted in October.
His six-month review ended Thursday when all documents, he said, were to be released “with redactions only in the rarest of circumstances.”
While happy for what’s been released so far, Sabato said more than 15,000 of the 19,045 in Thursday’s National Archives release have redactions — “some quite substantial.” He said more than 500 files were held back in their entirely for various reasons.
“Trump has set the next official argument over further disclosures at October 2021, when he may or may not still be president,” Sabato said.

The students and parents were at the gate of a middle school in Tai’an city in the eastern province of Shandong just before 7:30 a.m., the Dongping county police department said in a posting on social media.
Six parents and five students were killed, it said. One of the injured was in serious condition while the others were listed as stable, the department said.
The driver was in police custody and the incident was under investigation, it said.
The bus was specially customized for transporting students, it said. It did not say who was responsible for operating the bus. Many schools contract out such services to private companies or individuals.
School safety, including overloaded school buses and poorly designed buildings, has long been a problem in China.
In 2017, a dozen people, including 11 kindergarten pupils, were killed when a school bus crashed and burst into flames in a tunnel in the eastern Chinese city of Weihai, also in Shandong province. The driver, six Chinese children and five South Korean children were killed. It remains unclear whether the crash was deliberate or the result of unsafe driving.
China has cracked down heavily on transportation dangers, adding training and vehicle inspections.
China also has suffered numerous cases in recent years of attacks on school children, often using knives or homemade explosives. The suspects were generally found to be bearing grudges and seeking revenge over personal matters or against society more generally."
A1DL06CME3_OWHQW46AYEKFUFT,A remote Indigenous tribe kills two loggers encroaching on their land in Peru,By STEVEN GRATTAN,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/peru-logging-indigenous-attack-mashco-piro-amazon-09ae1dafd38656b6c33ec4df9b094093,"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Two loggers have been killed by bow and arrow after allegedly encroaching the land of the uncontacted Mashco Piro Indigenous tribe deep in Peru’s Amazon, according to a rights group.
The group, known as FENAMAD, defends the rights of Peru’s Indigenous peoples. It says tensions between loggers and Indigenous tribes are on the rise and more government protective action is needed.
Two other loggers in the attack were missing and another was injured, FENAMAD said, and rescue efforts were underway.
The rights group, which represents 39 Indigenous communities in the Cusco and Madre de Dios regions in southeastern Peru, said the incident took place on Aug. 29 in the Pariamanu river basin while loggers were expanding their passageways into the forest and came into contact with the reclusive and renowned territorial tribe.
“The Peruvian state has not taken preventive and protective measures to ensure the lives and integrity of the workers who have been gravely affected,” the group said in a statement Tuesday, adding authorities have yet to arrive in the area since the incident.
FENAMAD said the attack happened just 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) from a July incident, when the Mashco Piro again attacked loggers. The group said in their statement that even though they advised the government of the risk of a rise in violence, nothing has been done.

“It’s a heated and tense situation,” said Cesar Ipenza, an Amazon-based lawyer who specializes in environmental law in Peru. “Undoubtedly, every day there are more tensions between Indigenous peoples in isolation and the different activities that are within the territory that they ancestrally pass through.”
There have been several other previous reports of conflicts. In one incident in 2022, two loggers were shot with arrows while fishing, one fatally, in an encounter with tribal members.
In January, Peru loosened restrictions on deforestation, which critics dubbed the “anti-forest law.” Researchers have since warned of the rise in deforestation for agriculture and how it is making it easier for illicit logging and mining.
Ipenaza said some effort has been made by authorities in the area like mobilizing a helicopter, but overall there has been “little commitment” by Peru’s Ministry of Culture, responsible for the protection of Indigenous peoples.
The Ministry of Culture did not immediately respond to a message Wednesday seeking comment on the attack and their protection efforts.
The attack took place a day before the Forest Stewardship Council suspended the sustainability certification of a logging company for eight months which rights groups and activists have accused of encroaching on the Indigenous group’s land.
“It’s absurd that certifiers like the FSC keep the certification of companies that clearly and openly violate basic human rights and Indigenous rights,” said Julia Urrunaga, director of the Peru program at the Environmental Investigation Agency. “How terrible that people have to keep dying and that it has to be an international scandal for action to be taken.”

A1N5M62N08_83BAA8RDB32H0BA,Condoms can’t be trusted and boys don’t cry in Catholic Paraguay’s first sex ed program,By ISABEL DEBRE,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/paraguay-sexed-lgbtq-curriculum-teen-pregnancy-evangelical-eu-culture-wars-ec1ea559417e2cd7b6ee852550ee9efd,"ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay (AP) — Ahead of her 15th birthday, Diana Zalazar’s body had gotten so big she could no longer squeeze into the dress she bought for her quinceañera to celebrate her passage into womanhood in Paraguay.

Her mother sought help from a doctor, who suspected that growing inside of the 14-year-old Catholic choir girl could be a giant tumor. Next thing Zalazar knew, a gynecologist was wiping down the probe she’d applied to her belly and informing her that she was in her sixth month of pregnancy.

It made no sense to Zalazar, who had recently had sex for the first time without realizing it could make her pregnant.

In Catholic Paraguay, which has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in South America, many young mothers explained their teen pregnancies to The Associated Press as the result of growing up in a country where parents avoid the birds and the bees talk at all costs and national sex education is indistinguishable from a hygiene lesson.

“I didn’t decide to become a mother,” Zalazar said. “I didn’t have a chance to choose because I didn’t have the knowledge.”

Over the years that Zalazar, now 39, has gone from sexual ignorance and shame to raising her 23-year-old son and advocating for children’s rights, Paraguay’s lack of sex education has remained unchanged — until now. For the first time, the Ministry of Education has endorsed a national sex ed curriculum. But in a surprising twist, it’s the sexual health educators and feminists who are panicked. Conservative lobbyists are thrilled.

The curriculum, a copy of which was obtained by the AP, promotes abstinence, explains sex as “God’s invention for married people,” warns about the inefficacy of condoms and says nothing of sexual orientation or identity.

“We have a very strong Judeo-Christian culture that still prevails, and there’s fierce resistance to anything that goes against our principles,” said Miguel Ortigoza, a key proponent of the curriculum and evangelical pastor from Capitol Ministries, a Washington-based nonprofit that ran Bible study for former President Donald Trump’s Cabinet.

As a new generation of activists campaigning for legal abortion and gay rights scores victories across Latin America, a conservative backlash has gathered in Paraguay. The country already has among the world’s strictest abortion laws — punishable by prison time even in cases of incest or rape, though not when the mother’s life is in danger.

“Laws everywhere now allow girls to kill their babies, but Paraguay is among the remaining few saying no for Jesus’ sake,” said Oscar Avila, manager of an anti-abortion shelter for young mothers in Paraguay’s capital. At a recent morning Mass, girls no older than 15 filled the pews, some heavily pregnant, others with infants on their hips.

Critics explain the outsized power of Paraguay’s right-wing pressure groups as the consequence of a peculiar history. The conservative Colorado party has ruled the country for 76 of the past 80 years — including during a dictatorship openly sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.

“Growing up under the dictatorship, I was told homosexuality is a deviation,” said Simón Cazal, founder of Paraguayan LGBTQ+ rights group SomosGay. “The dictatorship legally ended, but the same political clans kept running the show.”

More recently, the rise of the far right in Latin America has given the governing party’s platform of religion, family and “patria,” or fatherland, newer resonance — emboldening conservative culture warriors with evangelical ties to take their battles to classrooms.

In 2017, Paraguay became the first country to ban school discussions about gender identity, an unwitting trailblazer for European populists and Republican governors. Now its sex ed curriculum has become a national flashpoint.

“The text is very dangerous, it’s an affront to science,” leftist Sen. Esperanza Martínez told a government committee recently convened to debate the curriculum.

Education Minister Luis Fernando Ramirez downplayed the controversy, stressing there was still time to improve the curriculum before enforcing it. “There’s no expenditure of state funds,” he told lawmakers. “Let’s not pass judgement until we do deeper work.”

Authorities assembled teams to revise the curriculum, called “12 Sciences of Sexuality and Affectivity Education,” which it plans to pilot in September across five eastern regions before taking it nationwide. Parents’ rights groups praise the 12 books, one for each grade, as a way of teaching morals and protecting young people.

“It’s a real battle for life, family, the true rights of children and the freedom of parents,” said curriculum author Maria Judith Turriaga. “It’s the reason parents fought for it to be included in public schools.”

The curriculum instructs children to treat others with respect and cultivate healthy relationships.

But in discouraging contraception and enforcing traditional gender norms, it has become a lightning rod for social tensions. Critics say it perpetuates sexist stereotypes: “Men conquer, not seduce,” “girls have smaller and lighter brains,” “boys don’t cry easily,” “girls don’t like taking risks.”

Masturbation, it says, causes “frustration and isolation.” Marital love lasts forever. Girls should beware of “how their way of dressing makes men behave.” Female puberty is “the body preparing to become a wife and mother.”

The books are filled with unexpected claims, too — “Boys do not clearly perceive high-pitched voices,” it says.

Any talk of sex is about the heterosexual variety.


“Without a truly inclusive education that allows you to understand your reality, it’s scary,” said Yren Rotela, a trans activist whose identity as female at 13 pushed her into indentured servitude and sex work in a country where transgender identity is not legally recognized, there’s no legislation recognizing hate crimes and discrimination is widespread.

At a workshop in August, participants voiced alarm over parts of the curriculum emphasizing the duty of obedience to parents and authorities and urging pregnant teens to confide in their families — even as sexual assault is typically perpetrated in the home.

“I never got help from my family, they were threatening me not to tell anyone,” said Liliana, who was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant at 13, speaking on condition that only her first name be used because her case is under investigation.

The focus on unquestioned deference carries a political charge in Paraguay, where experts say Latin America’s longest-ruling dictatorship instilled an enduring autocratic tradition.

“It’s easy in this country to create authoritarian projects that play on people’s fears,” said Adriana Closs, president of Feipar, a Paraguayan group promoting comprehensive education. “Political factions are taking advantage of this because of the favorable global context.”

As the politics of social conservatism surge from Brazil to Hungary, Paraguayan lawmakers have found immense promise in agitating against what they hold is a Western conspiracy to feminize boys and make girls gay.

Panic over foreign influence taps into collective trauma from the War of the Triple Alliance, which pitted Paraguay against Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, and decimated more than half of its population. Paraguayans still have a habit of invoking the 1865-1870 conflict as if it happened last week.

“Paraguay is the perfect breeding ground for globalist conspiracies,” said Esteban Caballero, adviser for the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences, a regional research group. “It’s not a fringe group of fanatics promoting this narrative, it’s a conservative society terrified by nonbinary identities. That means votes.”

Before 2023’s parliamentary elections, an annual transfer of European Union funds to Paraguay’s Education Ministry plunged politicians into a galvanizing battle.

Electoral debate pivoted from Paraguay’s rampant corruption and neglected schools to accusations that the EU indoctrinates children about “gender ideology” through its financing agreement, “Transforming Education.”

The Senate narrowly rejected a bill that swept through the lower house ordering authorities to repeal EU funds, which in reality support anti-hunger initiatives.

As controversy swirled, European diplomats held a ceremony to change the agreement’s name to “Strengthening Education” for fear the word “transforming” caused offense. President Santiago Peña appeared at Paraguay’s biggest evangelical church, promising religious leaders increased influence over the national educational agenda.

“We see stronger support than in previous times,” Pastor Ortigoza said. “There’s greater sensitivity to our causes.”

(AP) — A mother and her partner have been charged with child abuse and child cruelty after police found two kids chained by the ankle in a northern Virginia apartment.
The 47-year-old mother and 29-year old man, who live in the Alexandria section of Fairfax County, told police they would chain the 9-year-old boy and his 7-year-old sibling by the ankle to “‘scare them’ so they wouldn’t leave the apartment,” according to court charging documents in Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.
The two were arrested Aug. 16. According to court records, the 9-year-old borrowed a cellphone from a roommate in the apartment, who is not charged. The 9-year-old used the phone to send a photo of his chained foot to an older sister, who called 911.
Police said when they knocked on the apartment door they could hear chains rattling in the apartment.
The roommate told police the two kids were routinely chained when both the 47-year-old and the 29-year-old were not home, according to a search warrant affidavit.
The boys are now in the custody of their father, who did not live in the apartment and was not charged, according to WRC-TV, which first reported on the arrests. He said his sons did not tell him when they visited him that they were being chained.
“When I heard, I was like, ’Wow, why did this happen?’ Children don’t deserve to be treated like this. We don’t have the right to treat them like this. Maybe a criminal, but not innocent children,” he told the station in Spanish.

Last month’s arrest was not the first time the mother’s parenting drew attention from authorities. Court records show that in 2019, a then-16-year-old daughter of the mother obtained an emergency protective order, and that the mother was charged with misdemeanor assault. The disposition of that case was not clear from juvenile court records.
The public defender’s office, which represents the mother, did not immediately return a call Tuesday morning seeking comment. A phone listed for the court-appointed attorney who represents the 29-year-old man was not working Tuesday.
The mother has been released while she awaits trial. The 29-year-old man remains jailed.
A pretrial hearing is scheduled for Oct. 2."

New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon arrived in Seoul, the South Korean capital, on his first trip to the Asian country since he took office last November.
Luxon and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol condemned “in the strongest possible terms” the expanding military ties between North Korea and Russia, including North Korea’s export of ballistic missiles to Russia in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, according to a joint statement released by Luxon’s office.
The two leaders denounced “in the most serious of terms” North Korea’s illegal nuclear and missile development programs. They also strongly condemned Russia’s war against Ukraine and pledged to continue to support the sovereignty of Ukraine and its efforts to secure a just and lasting peace, according to the joint statement.
During the summit, Yoon and Luxon decided to launch a regular bilateral economic security dialogue to discuss challenges and opportunities. The two emphasized the importance of strengthening trade and economic connections, noting that the two-way trade volume between South Korea and New Zealand has approximately doubled in the past decade, according to the joint statement.
The U.S., South Korea and their partners have steadfastly accused North Korea of supplying much-needed conventional arms to Russia to support its invasion of Ukraine in return for military and economic assistance. Worries about the North Korean-Russia ties deepened in June, when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked."

AZMOFK2C4L_FW1DWO3VYF6W6DS,Doug Emhoff says he’s ‘gutted’ after the hostage killings in Gaza,_,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/emhoff-hersh-goldbergpolin-israel-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-9eed447adcfa3a29809425a009d7d069,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris — and the first Jewish person married to a nationally elected U.S. leader — said he is “gutted” after the killing of American Hersh Goldberg-Polin and five other Israeli hostages taken by Hamas.
Speaking Tuesday at a vigil for the hostages at his synagogue in Washington, Emhoff said, “I haven’t been able to stop thinking about Hersh and his parents, or about the five others and their families.” He added: “This is hard. I feel raw. I’m gutted.”
Emhoff, who stands to become the nation’s “first gentleman” if Harris is elected president in November, has emerged as a prominent administration liaison to the Jewish community and a voice in countering antisemitism, particularly in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. About 1,200 people, including at least 40 Americans, were killed in the assault, and about 250 more were taken hostage.
“How you feel right now is how I feel,” Emhoff said at the event at the Adas Israel Congregation organized by local and national Jewish groups. “And how we all feel is something Kamala hears directly from me.”
He added: “Hersh’s loss feels personal to the two of us. We’re both grieving.”
Emhoff recounted his and Harris’ conversation with Goldberg-Polin’s parents on Sunday, a day after Israeli forces discovered their bodies in a tunnel under Gaza. He said that even while mourning the loss of their son, Rachel Goldberg-Polin and Jonathan Polin were pressing Harris about the latest on the negotiations to reach a cease-fire deal that would free other hostages.

“Part of Rachel and Jon’s world had just ended, and they somehow are still looking forward and looking out for others,” Emhoff said.
He continued: “Jon and Rachel’s hearts have room to hold everyone. They are not giving up, and neither can we. Not on this 333rd day. Not ever. Not until every hostage is reunited with their family.”
Emhoff added that Harris and President Joe Biden are working “around the clock to get a hostage and cease-fire deal done.” He said, “The time to bring them home is now.”

It’s a phenomenon seen around heritage sites across China, inspired by comic book conventions and the Japanese passion for cosplay, but with additional nationalistic and cultural dimensions.
Though the historical veracity of the frocks and cloaks may not be guaranteed, they draw their inspiration from Chinese painting, theater and art, especially that of the Qing, China’s last dynasty that was known for its relative prosperity and cultural advances through trade in silk and porcelain.
During this time, China expanded its empire and its art and paintings flourished, as did clothing and textiles. Men and women wore full length elaborately embroidered silk robes and women wore hairpieces encrusted with flowers, pearls and gemstones.

The Qing fell in 1911 and following decades of warfare, power was seized by the Communist Party, which sought to grind out all vestiges of China’s imperial past.
With the abandonment in recent years of hard-core Maoism and rising prosperity, it is now common to see whole families decked out in Qing Dynasty garb, some of which is homemade, others rented from vendors at photo shoots who will also provide help with hairstyles and makeup.

Popular historical TV dramas and the rise of social media have fed the craze, and while they don’t involve battle reenactments like those popular in the U.S. and Europe, they reflect a growing respect for China’s history in the centuries before the communist takeover. Some participants base their looks on characters from novels, plays and poems going back centuries.

Throngs of people gather along the walls and a scenic moat surrounding the former palace — now a museum that is resplendent in weeping willows and turning colors during the late summer and early fall. Both professional and amateur photographers shop their samples to families and couples. Others in imperial dress take turns with their phone cameras. A group of students from the elite Tsinghua University celebrated their end of semester with a costume photo.
Despite the sweltering Beijing summer heat, families, friends and couples pose with a smile, sweat dripping down foreheads. It’s a serious affair, necessitating the right pose, the perfect prop and the ideal camera angle. And when everything is in place, they slip back in time — feeling like royalty and fulfilling a fantasy — however briefly with others like them living otherwise ordinary lives.

BL96Z33VNO_UCOHP0Y5AFYUVDM,Suspect charged with murder in the fatal shooting of a deputy in Houston,By JUAN A. LOZANO,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/texas-deputy-fatally-shot-intersection-5833c91f6b6582b59f8e4fb317465fb6,"HOUSTON (AP) — A suspect has been charged with murder in the fatal shooting of a Texas deputy constable who had stopped at a Houston intersection as he drove to work, authorities said Thursday.
The announcement of the murder charge came on the same day as the deputy, Maher Husseini, was remembered at his funeral as a Palestinian American who cared deeply for his family, his Islamic faith and his community.
“He was a community servant who strove to make the world a better and safer place. Safety, security and community well-being were manifested in his community service,” Abdurahman Hejazi, the religious scholar for Masjid Al-Salam Mosque in suburban Houston, said during Husseini’s funeral service.
Athir Murady has been charged with one count of murder in the killing of Husseini on Tuesday, said Joe Stinebaker, a Harris County District Attorney’s Office spokesperson.
Authorities say Murady got out of his vehicle, walked up to Husseini’s SUV and fired multiple times. The deputy was pronounced dead at a Houston hospital.
Police are still investigating a motive for the shooting.
According to authorities, Husseini was not in uniform when he was shot and had been driving his personal vehicle. Husseini had worked as a Harris County constable since 2021.
Murady, 40, was being held on Thursday at the county jail in neighboring Galveston County, after he led authorities on a chase that ended in the waters of the Texas Gulf Coast, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) from west Houston where the shooting happened.

Authorities said Sgt. Nick Yeley, a Galveston deputy city marshal, spotted Murady’s vehicle in Galveston hours after the shooting.
“I think it was just fate that I happened to be in the right place at the right time, and I was utilizing the skills that I’ve learned over my career in law enforcement,” Yeley said, according to a Galveston Police Department news release.
Murady then led authorities on a short chase before driving his car into Galveston Bay. He got out of his vehicle and tried to swim from officers, who pulled him aboard a police boat.
Murady is being held without bond in Galveston County on a charge of evading arrest. He was expected to be returned to Houston but authorities could not immediately say when that would happen.
Court and jail records did not list an attorney who could speak on Murady’s behalf.
Harris County prosecutors have filed a motion asking a judge to set Murady’s bond at $5 million.
“Mahir was an American by choice and was a proud Palestinian American,” Hejazi said during Husseini’s funeral service, which was attended by officers from various law enforcement agencies and several local officials. “He loved the freedoms we enjoy here in America and wished for these freedoms to be all around the world.”

BVETX7IR5Q_GYJU9RU2LD7EXC8,Former aide to 2 New York governors is charged with being an agent of the Chinese government,By ANTHONY IZAGUIRRE,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/former-hochul-aide-arrested-new-york-c588a95e87b853ca3d23b36aae4c87cd,"A former aide to two New York governors was charged Tuesday with acting as an illegal agent of the Chinese government who used her state positions to subtly advance Beijing’s agenda in exchange for financial benefits worth millions of dollars.
Linda Sun, who held numerous posts in New York state government, including deputy chief of staff for Gov. Kathy Hochul and deputy diversity officer for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was arrested Tuesday morning along with her husband, Chris Hu, at their $4 million home on Long Island.
Federal prosecutors said Sun, at the request of Chinese officials, blocked representatives of the Taiwanese government from having access to the governor’s office and shaped New York governmental messaging to align with the priorities of the Chinese government, among other things.
In return, her husband got help for his business activities in China — a financial boost that prosecutors said allowed the couple to buy their multimillion-dollar property in Manhasset, New York, a condominium in Hawaii for $1.9 million, and luxury cars including a 2024 Ferrari, the indictment said.
Sun also received smaller gifts, the indictment said, including tickets to performances by a visiting Chinese orchestra and ballet groups and “Nanjing-style salted ducks” that were prepared by the personal chef of a Chinese government official and delivered to Sun’s parents’ home in New York.
If true, the allegations show that Chinese authorities were able to gain influence at the highest levels of state government in New York for nearly a decade.

“As alleged, while appearing to serve the people of New York as Deputy Chief of Staff within the New York State Executive Chamber, the defendant and her husband actually worked to further the interests of the Chinese government and the CCP,” United States Attorney Breon Peace said, using the acronym for the Chinese Communist Party. “The illicit scheme enriched the defendant’s family to the tune of millions of dollars.”
Sun and Hu pleaded not guilty during an initial court appearance on Tuesday afternoon in Brooklyn and will be released on bond. Sun has been barred from having any contact with the People’s Republic of China’s consulate and mission.
Her defense lawyer, Jarrod Schaeffer, said, “We’re looking forward to addressing these charges in court. Our client is understandably upset that these charges have been brought.”
The case is part of a broader Justice Department effort to root out secret agents for the Chinese government operating in the U.S. In recent years, federal authorities have charged Chinese nationals not only with covertly advancing Beijing’s interests but also with harassing and intimidating dissidents on the government’s behalf.
Last year, the Justice Department charged a pair of men with establishing a secret police station in New York City while acting under the direction and control of the Chinese government.
Sun, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in China, worked in state government for about 15 years, holding jobs in Cuomo’s administration and eventually becoming Hochul’s deputy chief of staff, according to her LinkedIn profile. In November 2022, Sun took a job at the New York Department of Labor, as deputy commissioner for strategic business development, but she left that job months later in March 2023, the profile said.
In a statement, a spokesperson for Hochul’s office said the administration fired Sun after “discovering evidence of misconduct.”
“This individual was hired by the Executive Chamber more than a decade ago. We terminated her employment in March 2023 after discovering evidence of misconduct, immediately reported her actions to law enforcement and have assisted law enforcement throughout this process,” the statement reads.
The indictment said that, among other things, Sun worked to ensure that representatives of Taiwan’s government couldn’t get meetings with high-ranking New York state officials. The Chinese government considers Taiwan to be part of China.
It also outlined a series of exchanges Sun had with officials in the Chinese Consulate in New York in January 2021, when Cuomo was still governor and Hochul was lieutenant governor. Neither leader is named in the document but are instead referred to as “Politician-1” and “Politician-2.”
After Chinese officials requested a Lunar New Year video from the governor, Sun said Hochul could probably do it and asked for “talking points of things you want her to mention.”
“Mostly holiday wishes and hope for friendship and cooperation / Nothing too political,” an official told her, according to the indictment.
Sun later told a different official that she had argued with Hochul’s speechwriter over the draft, because the speechwriter insisted on mentioning the “Uyghur situation” in China. She promised that she wouldn’t let that happen, and the final speech did not mention the Muslim ethnic minority, according to the indictment.
Sun’s alleged activities in New York paved the way for lucrative business deals for Hu in China, prosecutors said, including discussions about a venture to export frozen seafood to China. Hu then attempted to conceal the earnings through various methods in the U.S., according to the indictment.
At the arraignment, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexander Solomon said there were a “multitude of shell and business entities” used in the crimes, adding, “This is no ordinary financial fraud.”
The FBI searched the couple’s multimillion home in Manhasset in late July but declined to release details at the time.
Sun is charged with violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act, money laundering and helping people commit visa fraud and enter the U.S. illegally. Hu is charged with money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and misuse of means of identification. Neither has been charged with espionage.
Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi downplayed Sun’s reach in the former governor’s administration, saying she “worked in a handful of agencies and was one of many community liaisons who had little to no interaction with the governor.”
Sun and Hu live in a gated community on Long Island called Stone Hill. The couple purchased the house in 2021 but placed it in a trust earlier this year, records show.

C2L78RR850_EXMWU1012VOI6G2,How do you know when AI is powerful enough to be dangerous? Regulators try to do the math,By MATT O’BRIEN,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/measuring-ai-safety-risk-flops-california-1047-6d556799683b02aa192b821462422aa2,"How do you know if an artificial intelligence system is so powerful that it poses a security danger and shouldn’t be unleashed without careful oversight?
For regulators trying to put guardrails on AI, it’s mostly about the arithmetic. Specifically, an AI model trained on 10 to the 26th floating-point operations must now be reported to the U.S. government and could soon trigger even stricter requirements in California.
Say what? Well, if you’re counting the zeroes, that’s 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or 100 septillion, calculations to train AI systems on huge troves of data.
What it signals to some lawmakers and AI safety advocates is a level of computing power that might enable rapidly advancing AI technology to create or proliferate weapons of mass destruction, or conduct catastrophic cyberattacks.
Those who’ve crafted such regulations acknowledge they are an imperfect starting point to distinguish today’s highest-performing generative AI systems — largely made by California-based companies like Anthropic, Google, Meta Platforms and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI — from the next generation that could be even more powerful.
Critics have pounced on the thresholds as arbitrary — an attempt by governments to regulate math. Adding to the confusion is that some rules set a speed-based computing threshold — how many floating-point operations per second, known as flops — while others are based on cumulative number of calculations no matter how long they take.
“Ten to the 26th flops,” said venture capitalist Ben Horowitz on a podcast this summer. “Well, what if that’s the size of the model you need to, like, cure cancer?”

An executive order signed by President Joe Biden last year relies on a 10 to the 26th threshold. So does California’s newly passed AI safety legislation — which Gov. Gavin Newsom has until Sept. 30 to sign into law or veto. California adds a second metric to the equation: regulated AI models must also cost at least $100 million to build.
Following Biden’s footsteps, the European Union’s sweeping AI Act also measures floating-point operations, but sets the bar 10 times lower at 10 to the 25th power. That covers some AI systems already in operation. China’s government has also looked at measuring computing power to determine which AI systems need safeguards.
No publicly available models meet the higher California threshold, though it’s likely that some companies have already started to build them. If so, they’re supposed to be sharing certain details and safety precautions with the U.S. government. Biden employed a Korean War-era law to compel tech companies to alert the U.S. Commerce Department if they’re building such AI models.
AI researchers are still debating how best to evaluate the capabilities of the latest generative AI technology and how it compares to human intelligence. There are tests that judge AI on solving puzzles, logical reasoning or how swiftly and accurately it predicts what text will answer a person’s chatbot query. Those measurements help assess an AI tool’s usefulness for a given task, but there’s no easy way of knowing which one is so widely capable that it poses a danger to humanity.
“This computation, this flop number, by general consensus is sort of the best thing we have along those lines,” said physicist Anthony Aguirre, executive director of the Future of Life Institute, which has advocated for the passage of California’s Senate Bill 1047 and other AI safety rules around the world.
Floating point arithmetic might sound fancy “but it’s really just numbers that are being added or multiplied together,” making it one of the simplest ways to assess an AI model’s capability and risk, Aguirre said.
“Most of what these things are doing is just multiplying big tables of numbers together,” he said. “You can just think of typing in a couple of numbers into your calculator and adding or multiplying them. And that’s what it’s doing — ten trillion times or a hundred trillion times.”
For some tech leaders, however, it’s too simple and hard-coded a metric. There’s “no clear scientific support” for using such metrics as a proxy for risk, argued computer scientist Sara Hooker, who leads AI company Cohere’s nonprofit research division, in a July paper.
“Compute thresholds as currently implemented are shortsighted and likely to fail to mitigate risk,” she wrote.
Venture capitalist Horowitz and his business partner Marc Andreessen, founders of the influential Silicon Valley investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, have attacked the Biden administration as well as California lawmakers for AI regulations they argue could snuff out an emerging AI startup industry.
For Horowitz, putting limits on “how much math you’re allowed to do” reflects a mistaken belief there will only be a handful of big companies making the most capable models and you can put “flaming hoops in front of them and they’ll jump through them and it’s fine.”
In response to the criticism, the sponsor of California’s legislation sent a letter to Andreessen Horowitz this summer defending the bill, including its regulatory thresholds.
Regulating at over 10 to the 26th is “a clear way to exclude from safety testing requirements many models that we know, based on current evidence, lack the ability to cause critical harm,” wrote state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco. Existing publicly released models “have been tested for highly hazardous capabilities and would not be covered by the bill,” Wiener said.
Both Wiener and the Biden executive order treat the metric as a temporary one that could be adjusted later.
Yacine Jernite, who works on policy research at the AI company Hugging Face, said the computing metric emerged in “good faith” ahead of last year’s Biden order but is already starting to grow obsolete. AI developers are doing more with smaller models requiring less computing power, while the potential harms of more widely used AI products won’t trigger California’s proposed scrutiny.
“Some models are going to have a drastically larger impact on society, and those should be held to a higher standard, whereas some others are more exploratory and it might not make sense to have the same kind of process to certify them,” Jernite said.
Aguirre said it makes sense for regulators to be nimble, but he characterizes some opposition to the threshold as an attempt to avoid any regulation of AI systems as they grow more capable.
“This is all happening very fast,” Aguirre said. “I think there’s a legitimate criticism that these thresholds are not capturing exactly what we want them to capture. But I think it’s a poor argument to go from that to, ‘Well, we just shouldn’t do anything and just cross our fingers and hope for the best.’”"
C4QMFTH1CS_0BWRO9DW7LEKYJY,An ethnic Greek politician and EU lawmaker is released on probation in Albania,By LLAZAR SEMINI,_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/beleris-albania-prison-greece-e85adedb69368ab3f51f7acc7f3f75ad,"TIRANA, Albania (AP) — A former ethnic Greek mayor of an Albanian town, whose imprisonment on vote-buying charges has strained Albanian-Greek ties, has been released on probation, his office and a lawyer said Monday.
Fredis Beleris was freed after a court in Fier, 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of the capital, Tirana, where he was serving a two-year sentence, accepted his request for early release, lawyer Eugen Gjyzari said.
Scores of supporters rallied to celebrate his freedom in his hometown of Hiamara. They gathered in front of the office of the Democratic Union of the Greek Minority, known as Omonoia, a social, political and cultural organization that promotes the rights for the Greek minority in Albania.
Beleris, 51, was arrested two days before the May 14, 2023, municipal elections in Himara, a town populated by ethnic Greeks on what has been dubbed the Albanian Riviera, a coastal region with burgeoning tourist development that has been rife with property disputes. He was charged and convicted of offering about 40,000 Albanian leks (360 euros, $390) to buy eight votes.
The case against Beleris has strained relations between Tirana and Athens, with Greece threatening to hold up Albania’s bid to join the European Union.
Beleris and Athens have claimed his conviction was politically motivated. Albanian officials strongly rejected those claims, citing the independence of the judiciary.

In June, Beleris, a dual Albanian-Greek national, was elected to the European Parliament with Greece’s governing conservative party, and was given a five-day leave from prison to attend the parliament’s opening session in Strasbourg a month later.
Writing on his Facebook page, Beleris thanked Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis for including him on his party’s ballot, which he said “changed the course of my history.”
Greek government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis called Beleris’ release “certainly a positive development.”
“This doesn’t mean we’ll forget the (previous) 17 months and the severity of what happened,” he told a press briefing. “Because in the person of Fredis Beleris the Greek government sees all the Greek citizens, all the Greek ethnic minority in Albania which we will continue to support.”
Beleris said that after pursuing justice at all levels in Albania, he would appeal his case to the European Court of Human Rights, saying “I have been crippled by the Albanian regime.”
“But now, exercising the duties of the Greek MEP, I will be able to focus on the issues of the Greek ethnic minority and the rule of law, without fear but only with passion,” he wrote.
After Beleris was stripped of his title, convicted and imprisoned, an early election was held in Himara for the post of mayor, which was won by the governing Socialist Party candidate.
In the aftermath of the fall of Albania’s communist regime in the early 1990s, property that had previously been seized by the state was distributed among residents. But this often led to disputes over ownership claims, and there have been allegations of ethnic bias in land distribution.
Beleris has claimed the case against him was an attempt by Socialist Party’s Prime Minister Edi Rama to retain control of Himara and its potential for lucrative future property development

C96D8QI68P_N3YEOCW48YSAF5P,Cambodia says China gifting 2 warships as it finishes work expanding strategically important port,By SOPHENG CHEANG and DAVID RISING,_,20230905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/china-cambodia-ream-warships-navy-port-e21dbae6bd1b9943f7bec8bbaa040da9,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Cambodia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday that China is giving its navy two warships of the type it has had docked for months at a strategically important base being expanded with Beijing’s funding, which has raised concerns of China establishing a permanent naval presence on the Gulf of Thailand.
Ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata told The Associated Press that China would give Cambodia two newly built Type 56 corvettes, smaller vessels typically used for coastal patrols, next year at the earliest.
She would not comment on reports that China also planned to hand over to Cambodia newly expanded facilities at Ream Naval Base, including a lengthy new pier capable of accommodating much larger naval vessels than Cambodia has in its own fleet. Maly did say the final phase of construction would soon be completed.
The United States and others have expressed concerns about China’s navy establishing a base at Ream, which would give it easy access to the Malacca Strait, a critical shipping route between the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean.
Those concerns grew after two Type 56 corvettes docked at the newly built pier in December, and have maintained a presence there on-and-off ever since.
Cambodia has said one of the reasons the Chinese corvettes have been there for so long was that it was considering similar warships for its own navy, and for training.

Maly said the two corvettes being given to Cambodia, the Type 56C variant, came after Cambodia requested China’s support.
“It is in the aim of strengthening the capacity and ability of Cambodia to protect and maintain peace, stability, security as well as for supporting search and rescue operations and other humanitarian activities,” she said.
China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry would not comment on the ships or the report that Beijing would turn over the newly expanded Ream base facilities to Cambodia, telling the AP in a faxed reply to a query that “we’re not aware of the relevant information.”
Controversy over the Chinese activity at the Ream base initially arose in 2019 when The Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of a reputed agreement seen by U.S. officials would allow China 30-year use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.
Cambodia’s then-Prime Minister Hun Sen denied there was such an agreement, emphasizing that Cambodia’s Constitution did not allow foreign military bases to be established on its soil.
Chinese work on the base has continued and Hun Sen’s successor as prime minister, his son Hun Manet, has insisted the same thing.
If China’s People’s Liberation Army Navy, or PLAN, were to be granted preferred, or exclusive, access to Ream in exchange for the warships it is giving Cambodia and for its work on the base, it could be a deft way to work around the constitutional issues, said Euan Graham, a senior defense analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
“It’s quite a smart move, as it allows Cambodia to maintain its line that it hasn’t deviated from the constitution by creating a foreign base. And China has no shortage of warships to donate,” he said.
“I expect that China may retain a naval complement on board the corvettes, post-transfer. The real question is what level of access the PLAN will have to Ream, and whether that access is exclusive,” Graham added.
China currently only operates one acknowledged foreign military base, in the impoverished but strategically important Horn of Africa nation of Djibouti, but many believe that its military is busy establishing an overseas network.
The U.S. has more foreign military bases than any other country, including multiple facilities in the Asia-Pacific region.
Thus far, only Chinese naval vessels have been given permission to use the new pier. In February, two Japanese destroyers were routed instead to the nearby Sihanoukville commercial port. A Royal Australian Navy frigate was also directed to Sihanoukville for a port call ending Wednesday.
Maly said Cambodia had the right to promote cooperation with all partners for its benefit, so long as constitutional regulations were followed.
“Cooperation has to comply with the goals and the principles of the Cambodian Constitution especially the protection of its sovereignty, integrity and independence,” Maly said.
Cambodia is China’s closest ally in Southeast Asia, while China is Cambodia’s most important ally and benefactor, with a strong influence on its economy.
Beyond military projects, China funds numerous others in Cambodia — particularly infrastructure, including airports and roads, but also private projects such as hotels, casinos and property development. Some 40% of Cambodia’s $11 billion in foreign debt is owed to China.

CBZ1YK43Y8_ELJPD6BY6HCJQVQ,Ugandan opposition figure Bobi Wine is shot and wounded in a confrontation with police,By RODNEY MUHUMUZA,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/uganda-bobi-wine-police-wounded-opposition-kampala-b2f01cb190363ac5f0b2fd7ec1e94a09,"KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — Uganda’s leading opposition figure Bobi Wine was shot in the leg in a confrontation with police Tuesday just outside the capital, Kampala, and was “seriously injured,” his political party said.
Video posted online showed Wine surrounded by followers who yelled that he had been shot before some supported him into a car. It was not immediately clear whether he was hit by a live bullet or a tear gas projectile. Images shared by his close associates showed a bleeding wound below the left knee.
Street confrontations between Wine and the police have frequently descended into violence, but this is the first time he has been wounded in such a way. He was being treated at a local hospital.
His party, the National Unity Platform, holds the most seats of any opposition group in the national assembly. The party said on X that Ugandan security operatives “have made an attempt on the life” of Wine, whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu.
“He was shot in the leg and seriously injured in Bulindo, Wakiso District,” it said, referring to a town on Kampala’s outskirts.
Ugandan police said in a statement that Wine had been advised against holding a street procession when he left a private event in Bulindo. According to the statement, Wine “insisted on proceeding and closing the road, leading to police intervention to prevent the procession.”
The opposition figure was injured in “the ensuing altercation,” police said, adding that the alleged shooting will be investigated.

The incident involving overzealous police “must be condemned by all people of good conscience,” said David Lewis Rubongoya, secretary-general of the National Unity Platform.
Wine became one of the most recognizable opposition figures in Africa when he ran for president in 2021, losing to President Yoweri Museveni in an election he claimed was rigged against him. Wine had been a famous entertainer in this East African country before he won a seat in the national assembly in 2017. He is especially popular among young Ugandans in urban areas.
Authorities accuse him of trying to lure young people into rioting and have charged him with multiple criminal offenses.
Since becoming a popular government critic, Wine’s attempts to hold rallies have been blocked by authorities. He has complained of harassment and beatings by security forces when they block his public appearances.
Museveni, a U.S. ally on regional security for many years, has held power since 1986 and had Uganda’s constitution amended to remove the age limit for presidents. Now 79, he has resisted calls to announce when he will retire.
Uganda hasn’t had a peaceful transfer of power since independence from the British in 1962."
CGTWBJQHV0_IHVDV33MDO97929,China-linked ‘Spamouflage’ network mimics Americans online to sway US political debate,By DAVID KLEPPER,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/china-disinformation-network-foreign-influence-us-election-a2b396518bafd8e36635a3796c8271d7,"WASHINGTON (AP) — When he first emerged on social media, the user known as Harlan claimed to be a New Yorker and an Army veteran who supported Donald Trump for president. Harlan said he was 29, and his profile picture showed a smiling, handsome young man.
A few months later, Harlan underwent a transformation. Now, he claimed to be 31 and from Florida.
New research into Chinese disinformation networks targeting American voters shows Harlan’s claims were as fictitious as his profile picture, which analysts think was created using artificial intelligence.
As voters prepare to cast their ballots this fall, China has been making its own plans, cultivating networks of fake social media users designed to mimic Americans. Whoever or wherever he really is, Harlan is a small part of a larger effort by U.S. adversaries to use social media to influence and upend America’s political debate.
The account was traced back to Spamouflage, a Chinese disinformation group, by analysts at Graphika, a New York-based firm that tracks online networks. Known to online researchers for several years, Spamouflage earned its moniker through its habit of spreading large amounts of seemingly unrelated content alongside disinformation.
“One of the world’s largest covert online influence operations — an operation run by Chinese state actors — has become more aggressive in its efforts to infiltrate and to sway U.S. political conversations ahead of the election,” Jack Stubbs, Graphika’s chief intelligence officer, told The Associated Press.

Intelligence and national security officials have said that Russia, China and Iran have all mounted online influence operations targeting U.S. voters ahead of the November election. Russia remains the top threat, intelligence officials say, even as Iran has become more aggressive in recent months, covertly supporting U.S. protests against the war in Gaza and attempting to hack into the email systems of the two presidential candidates.
China, however, has taken a more cautious, nuanced approach. Beijing sees little advantage in supporting one presidential candidate over the other, intelligence analysts say. Instead, China’s disinformation efforts focus on campaign issues particularly important to Beijing — such as American policy toward Taiwan — while seeking to undermine confidence in elections, voting and the U.S. in general.
Officials have said it’s a longer-term effort that will continue well past Election Day as China and other authoritarian nations try to use the internet to erode support for democracy.
Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu rejected Graphika’s findings as full of “prejudice and malicious speculation” and said that “China has no intention and will not interfere” in the election.
X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, suspended several of the accounts linked to the Spamouflage network after questions were raised about their authenticity. The company did not respond to questions about the reasons for the suspensions, or whether they were connected to Graphika’s report.
TikTok also removed accounts linked to Spamouflage, including Harlan’s.
What to know about the 2024 Election
“We will continue to remove deceptive accounts and harmful misinformation as we protect the integrity of our platform during the US elections,” a TikTok spokesperson wrote in a statement emailed on Tuesday.
Compared with armed conflict or economic sanctions, online influence operations can be a low-cost, low-risk means of flexing geopolitical power. Given the increasing reliance on digital communications, the use of online disinformation and fake information networks is only likely to increase, said Max Lesser, senior analyst for emerging threats at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a national security think tank in Washington.
“We’re going to see a widening of the playing field when it comes to influence operations, where it’s not just Russia, China and Iran but you also see smaller actors getting involved,” Lesser said.
That list could include not only nations but also criminal organizations, domestic extremist groups and terrorist organizations, Lesser said.
When analysts first noticed Spamouflage five years ago, the network tended to post generically pro-China, anti-American content. In recent years, the tone sharpened as Spamouflage expanded and began focusing on divisive political topics like gun control, crime, race relations and support for Israel during its war in Gaza. The network also began creating large numbers of fake accounts designed to mimic American users.
Spamouflage accounts don’t post much original content, instead using platforms like X or TikTok to recycle and repost content from far-right and far-left users. Some of the accounts seemed designed to appeal to Republicans, while others cater to Democrats.
While Harlan’s accounts succeeded in getting traction — one video mocking President Joe Biden was seen 1.5 million times — many of the accounts created by the Spamouflage campaign did not. It’s a reminder that online influence operations are often a numbers game: the more accounts, the more content, the better the chance that one specific post goes viral.
Many of the accounts newly linked to Spamouflage took pains to pose as Americans, sometimes in obvious ways. “I am an American,” one of the accounts proclaimed. Some of the accounts gave themselves away by using stilted English or strange word choices. Some were clumsier than others: “Broken English, brilliant brain, I love Trump,” read the biographical section of one account.
Harlan’s profile picture, which Graphika researchers believe was created using AI, was identical to one used in an earlier account linked to Spamouflage. Messages sent to the person operating Harlan’s accounts were not returned."
CPGNQIJUXN_6NBJZOSAIZ8ELGC,Former Lebanese central bank governor charged with embezzling $42m in ongoing corruption probe,By KAREEM CHEHAYEB,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-riad-salameh-corruption-central-bank-f40de01078500c8dcde82fb97791f12b,"BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon charged its embattled former central bank governor Wednesday with the embezzlement of $42 million, three judicial officials told The Associated Press.
Riad Salameh, 73, was charged by the Financial Public Prosecution a day after he was detained following an interrogation by Lebanon’s top public prosecutor over several alleged financial crimes.
His case has been transferred to an investigating judge, the officials added, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
Salameh ended his 30-year term as central bank governor a year ago under a cloud, with several European countries probing allegations of financial crimes. Many in Lebanon blame him for the crippling financial crisis that has gripped the country since late 2019.
He was appointed in 1993 and initially celebrated for his role in steering Lebanon’s economic recovery after a 15-year civil war, and for keeping the economy on an even keel during long spells of political gridlock and turmoil.
Salameh has for years denied allegations of corruption, embezzlement and illicit enrichment. He insists that his wealth comes from inherited properties, investments and his previous job as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch.
During his hours-long interrogation on Monday, Salameh was asked about a key case in which a company was allegedly hired to manipulate statements and conceal Lebanon’s hemorrhaging finances.

According to two other judicial officials, Salameh appeared to have brought in the company, called Optimum, to help facilitate embezzling money from the central bank through other accounts, eventually reaching his own.
The financial intelligence unit of the central bank presented bank statements and financial documents to the public prosecution, added the two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
The central bank told the AP that it had no comment.
The embattled Salameh is also in the midst of several other cases against him, both locally and internationally.
France, Germany, and Luxembourg are also investigating Salameh and close associates over alleged illicit enrichment and the laundering of $330 million.
Salameh has criticized the European investigation and said it was part of a media and political campaign make him a scapegoat.
Meanwhile, the U.S., the U.K, and Canada have sanctioned Salameh and his close associates, and France issued an international arrest warrant for him, though Lebanon does not hand over its own citizens for extradition.
Lebanon has not appointed a new central bank governor, but a vice governor, Wassim Mansouri, has been named acting governor. The crisis-hit country has also been without a president for almost two years and is run by a caretaker Cabinet with limited functions."
D7CR1E9Q2Q_5DY2SDS9LEUKYTE,"Mongolia ignores an international warrant for Putin’s arrest, giving him a red-carpet welcome",_,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/mongolia-russia-putin-international-criminal-court-warrant-4c79850ecf409287924e3d96218abc78,"ULAANBAATAR, Mongolia (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin received a red-carpet welcome to Mongolia on Tuesday, as the country ignored calls to arrest him on an international warrant for alleged war crimes stemming from Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
The trip, which concluded Tuesday night, was Putin’s first to a member nation of the International Criminal Court since it issued the warrant in March 2023. Ahead of his visit, Ukraine urged Mongolia to hand Putin over to the court in The Hague, and the European Union expressed concern that Mongolia might not execute the warrant.
The warrant put the government in a difficult position. After decades under communism with close ties to the Soviet Union, it transitioned to democracy in the 1990s and built relations with the United States, Japan and other new partners. But the landlocked country remains economically dependent on its two much larger and more powerful neighbors, Russia and China.

The ICC has accused Putin of being responsible for the abductions of children from Ukraine. Member countries are required to detain suspects if a warrant has been issued, but Mongolia needs to maintain its ties with Russia and the court lacks a mechanism to enforce its warrants.
The United States doesn’t believe any country “should give Putin a platform to promote his war of aggression against Ukraine,” U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said.

“We understand that position that Mongolia is in, you know, sandwiched between two much larger neighbors, but we do think it’s important that they continue to support the rule of law around the world,” he told reporters in Washington.
The Russian leader was welcomed in the main square in Ulaanbaatar, the capital, by an honor guard dressed in vivid red and blue uniforms styled on those of the personal guard of 13th century ruler Genghis Khan, the founder of the Mongol Empire.
A throng of people watched from behind barriers as Putin and Mongolian President Khurelsukh Ukhnaa walked up the red-carpeted steps of the Government Palace and bowed toward a statue of Genghis Khan.
A few protesters who tried to unfurl a Ukrainian flag were taken away by police. Five others who gathered a few blocks west of the square held up an anti-Putin banner and Ukrainian flag but disbanded after hearing about the arrests.
As Putin was welcomed in Mongolia, his forces struck a military training facility and nearby hospital in Poltava, Ukraine, killing at least 50 people, the country’s president said. The strike appeared to be one of the deadliest by Russian forces since the war began on Feb. 24, 2022.
The two governments signed agreements on a power plant upgrade in Ulaanbaatar and on the supply of Russian aviation fuel to Mongolia. They also agreed to carry out an environmental study of a river where Mongolia wants to build a hydroelectric plant that Russia is concerned would pollute its Lake Baikal. Putin also outlined plans to develop the rail system between the countries.
He invited the Mongolian president to a summit of the BRICS nations — which include Russia and China among others — in the Russian city of Kazan in late October. Khurelsukh accepted, according to Russian state media.
After leaving Ulaanbaatar, Putin arrived early Wednesday in Russia’s major Pacific port of Vladivostok, where he is to take part in an economic forum.
On Monday, the EU said it had shared its concerns with Mongolian authorities.
“Mongolia, like all other countries, has the right to develop its international ties according to its own interests,” European Commission spokesperson Nabila Massrali said. But she added that Mongolia has been a party to the ICC since 2002, “with the legal obligations that it entails.”
Given Mongolia’s dependence on Russia and China for trade, energy and security, it was hardly possible to expect the government to arrest Putin, said Sam Greene, the director of democratic resilience at the Center for European Policy Analysis.
“The overriding reason for this trip will have been to show that Putin can travel right now,” he said.
But, Greene added, the warrant narrows the circle of possibilities for Putin, forcing “any government that’s going to think about hosting him to consider both the domestic and the international political consequences of that in a way they wouldn’t have had to before.”
Kenneth Roth, the former longtime director of Human Rights Watch, called Putin’s trip to Mongolia “a sign of weakness,” posting on X that the Russian leader “could manage a trip only to a country with a tiny population of 3.4 million that lives in Russia’s shadow.”
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the trip wasn’t about “showing something to Western countries,” but rather about developing bilateral relations between two countries rooted in history and “wonderful glorious traditions.” His remarks were made to state TV reporter Pavel Zarubin, who posted them on his Telegram channel.
Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia’s Security Council, denounced the warrant as “illegal” in an online statement Tuesday.

Putin, on his first visit to Mongolia in five years, participated in a ceremony to mark the 85th anniversary of a joint Soviet and Mongolian victory over the Japanese army in deadly fighting over the border between then-Japan-controlled Manchuria and Mongolia.
“I am very delighted about Putin’s visit to Mongolia,” said Yansanjav Demdendorj, a retired economist, citing Russia’s role against Japan. “If we think of the ... battle, it’s Russians who helped free Mongolia.”
Uyanga Tsoggerel, who supports the protests, said her country is a democracy that doesn’t tolerate dictatorship and accused Putin of “recklessly humiliating and shaming Mongolia in front of the world.”
Putin has made a series of overseas trips to try to counter the international isolation he faces over the invasion of Ukraine. He visited China in May, made a trip to North Korea and Vietnam in June and went to Kazhakstan in July for a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.
But last year, the South African government lobbied against Putin showing up in Johannesburg for the BRICS summit, which he ended up joining by video link. South Africa, an ICC member, faced criticism in 2015 when it didn’t arrest then-Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir during a visit for an African Union summit.
Enkhgerel Seded, who studies at a university in Moscow, said that historically, countries with friendly relations don’t arrest heads-of-state on official visits.
“Our country has obligations toward the international community,” she said. “But ... I think in this case as well, it would not be appropriate to conduct an arrest.”"
D9R3V45JH2_LXVSB0IZ928ZPP1,"With charges and sanctions, US takes aim at Russian disinformation ahead of November election","By ERIC TUCKER, MATTHEW LEE and DAVID KLEPPER",_,20240805,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/russia-justice-department-election-foreign-influence-4888f4bfc61e46173101060ad0321d2f,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two Russian state media employees in its most sweeping effort yet to push back against what it says are Russian attempts to spread disinformation ahead of the November presidential election.

The measures, which in addition to indictments also included sanctions and visa restrictions, represented a U.S. government effort just weeks before the November election to disrupt a persistent threat from Russia that American officials have long warned has the potential to sow discord and create confusion among voters.

Washington has said that Moscow, which intelligence officials have said has a preference for Republican Donald Trump, remains the primary threat to elections even as the FBI continues to investigate a hack by Iran this year that targeted the presidential campaigns of both political parties.
What to know about the 2024 Election

“The Justice Department’s message is clear: We will have no tolerance for attempts by authoritarian regimes to exploit our democratic systems of government,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said.

One criminal case disclosed by the Justice Department accuses two employees of RT, a Russian state media company, of covertly funding a Tennessee-based content creation company with nearly $10 million to publish English-language videos on social media platforms including TikTok and YouTube with messages in favor of the Russia government’s interests and agenda, including about the war in Ukraine.

The nearly 2,000 videos posted by the company have gotten more than 16 million views on YouTube alone, prosecutors said.

The two defendants, Kostiantyn Kalashnikov and Elena Afanasyeva, are charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act. They are at large. It was not immediately clear if they had lawyers.


The Justice Department says the company did not disclose that it was funded by RT and that neither it nor its founders registered as required by law as an agent of a foreign principal.

Though the indictment does not name the company, it describes it as a Tennessee-based content creation firm with six commentators and with a website identifying itself as “a network of heterodox commentators that focus on Western political and cultural issues.”

That description exactly matches Tenet Media, an online company that hosts videos made by well-known conservative influencers Tim Pool, Benny Johnson and others.

Johnson and Pool both responded with posts on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, calling themselves “victims.” Calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a “scumbag,” Pool wrote that “should these allegations prove true, I as well as the other personalities and commentators were deceived.”

In his post, Johnson wrote that he had been asked a year ago to provide content to a “media startup.” He said his lawyers negotiated a “standard, arms length deal, which was later terminated.”

Tenet Media’s shows in recent months have featured high-profile conservative guests, including RNC co-chair Lara Trump, former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Senate candidate Kari Lake.

In the other action, officials announced the seizure of 32 internet domains that were used by the Kremlin to spread Russian propaganda and weaken international support for Ukraine. The websites were designed to look like authentic news sites but were actually fake, with bogus social media personas manufactured to appear as if they belonged to American users.

The Justice Department did not identify which candidate in particular the propaganda campaign was meant to boost. But internal strategy notes from participants in the effort released Wednesday by the Justice Department make clear that Trump was the intended beneficiary, even though the names of the candidates were blacked out.

The proposal for one propaganda project, for instance, states that one of its objectives was to secure a victory for a candidate who is currently out of power and to increase the percentage of Americans who believe the U.S. has been doing too much to support Ukraine. President Joe Biden has strongly supported Ukraine during the invasion by Russia.

Intelligence agencies have previously charged that Russia, which during the 2016 election launched a massive campaign of foreign influence and interference on Trump’s behalf, was using disinformation to try to meddle in this year’s election. The new steps show the depth of those concerns.

“Today’s announcement highlights the lengths some foreign governments go to undermine American democratic institutions,” the State Department said. “But these foreign governments should also know that we will not tolerate foreign malign actors intentionally interfering and undermining free and fair elections.”

The State Department announced it was taking action against several employees of Russian state-owned media outlets, designating them as “foreign missions,” and offering a cash reward for information provided to the U.S. government about foreign election interference.

It also said it was adding media company Rossiya Segodnya and its subsidiaries RIA Novosti, RT, TV-Novosti, Ruptly, and Sputnik to its list of foreign missions. That will require them to register with the U.S. government and disclose their properties and personnel in the U.S.

In a speech last month, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Russia remained the biggest threat to election integrity, accusing Putin and his proxies of “targeting specific voter demographics and swing-state voters to in an effort to manipulate presidential and congressional election outcomes.” Russia, she said was “intent on co-opting unwitting Americans on social media to push narratives advancing Russian interests.”

She struck a similar note Thursday, saying at an Aspen Institute event that the foreign influence threat is more diverse and aggressive than in past years.

“More diverse and aggressive because they involve more actors from more countries than we have ever seen before, operating in a more polarized world than we have ever seen before, all fueled by more technology and accelerated by technology, like AI, and that is what we have exposed in the law enforcement actions we took today,” she said.

Much of the concern around Russia centers on cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns designed to influence the November vote.

The tactics include using state media like RT to advance anti-U.S. messages and content, as well as networks of fake websites and social media accounts that amplify the claims and inject them into Americans’ online conversations. Typically, these networks seize on polarizing political topics such as immigration, crime or the war in Gaza.

In many cases, Americans may have no idea that the content they see online either originated or was amplified by the Kremlin.

Groups linked to the Kremlin are increasingly hiring marketing and communications firms within Russia to outsource some of the work of creating digital propaganda while also covering their tracks, the officials said during the briefing with reporters.

Two such firms were the subject of new U.S. sanctions announced in March. Authorities say the two Russian companies created fake websites and social media profiles to spread Kremlin disinformation.

The ultimate goal, however, is to get Americans to spread Russian disinformation without questioning its origin. People are far more likely to trust and repost information that they believe is coming from a domestic source, officials said. Fake websites designed to mimic U.S. news outlets and AI-generated social media profiles are just two methods.

Messages left with the Russian Embassy were not immediately returned.

In a phone call with U.S. diplomats in China, Beijing said it “will not continue to process cases at any stage” other than those cases covered by an exception clause. The embassy is seeking clarification in writing from China’s Ministry of Civil Affairs, the U.S. State Department said Thursday.
“We understand there are hundreds of families still pending completion of their adoption, and we sympathize with their situation,” the State Department said.
At a daily briefing Thursday, Mao Ning, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said China is no longer allowing foreign adoptions of the country’s children, with the only exception for blood relatives to adopt a child or a stepchild.
She didn’t explain the decision other than to say that it was in line with the spirit of relevant international conventions.
Many foreigners have adopted children from China over the decades, visiting the country to pick them up and then bringing them to a new home overseas.
U.S. families have adopted 82,674 children from China, the most from any foreign country.
China suspended international adoptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The government later resumed adoptions for children who had received travel authorization before the suspension in 2020, the U.S. State Department said in its latest annual report on adoptions.

A U.S. consulate issued 16 visas for adoptions from China from October 2022 through September 2023, the first in more than two years, the State Department report said. It wasn’t clear if any more visas had been issued since then.
In January, Denmark’s only overseas adoption agency said it was winding down operations after concerns were raised about fabricated documents and procedures, and Norway’s top regulatory body recommended stopping overseas adoptions for two years pending an investigation into several cases.
Beijing’s announcement also has followed falling birth rates in the country. The number of newborn babies fell to 9.02 million in 2023, and the overall population declined for the second consecutive year."

The boy was alone in the car about 7:40 p.m. Monday in Lehi — a city about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City — when he shot himself in the head, Jeanteil Livingston with the Lehi City Police Department told KSL-TV. The boy died at a hospital on Tuesday morning, police said.
The shooting appeared to be “unintentional and self-inflicted,” police said in a statement.
The gun was under a seat in the car, Livingston said. Investigators do not know if the safety was ever on, she said.
Doug Shields said he was putting gas in his vehicle when he heard the gunshot and then a woman screaming. He went to the car where it happened. He told KSL and KUTV that he heard the mother say the boy found the gun under the seat.
Monday’s shooting happened less than two weeks after a 5-year-old Utah boy died after accidentally shooting himself with a handgun at his house in Santaquin, which is about 65 miles (105 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City.
Utah does not have any laws to penalize someone for failing to secure an unattended firearm and leaving it accessible to an unsupervised minor, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The state also does not require unattended firearms to be stored in a certain way or require a locking device to be sold with a firearm.

No charges are currently pending against the mother of the Lehi boy, Livingston said. The shooting is still under investigation.
In St. Louis, a 4-year-old girl died Monday from a gunshot wound suffered while she was in a house with three other children under the age of 10 and no adults present. Police are trying to determine who was handling the gun at the time of the shooting.

E0417FSVU3_3IL3YS0Y3KG3MES,"In Asia, pope urges Indonesia to live up to promise of ‘harmony in diversity,’ fight extremism",By NICOLE WINFIELD and EDNA TARIGAN,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-visit-indonesia-asia-05c710ad993231bd8840c75f959f2b05,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Pope Francis urged Indonesia to live up to its promise of “harmony in diversity” and fight religious intolerance on Wednesday, as he set a rigorous pace for an 11-day, four-nation trip through tropical Southeast Asia and Oceania that will test his stamina and health.
Francis had a packed first full day in Indonesia, meeting with outgoing President Joko Widodo and other Indonesian authorities at the presidential palace, and then greeting Catholic priests, nuns and seminarians at Jakarta’s main cathedral in the afternoon.
Cannons boomed as Francis joined Widodo on the veranda of the palace along with President-elect Prabowo Subianto. A marching band, stiff-legged troops and children in traditional Indonesian dress welcomed the first pope to visit in 35 years.
In his remarks to the Indonesian authorities, Francis compared the country’s human diversity with the archipelago’s 17,000 islands. He said each one contributes something specific to form “a magnificent mosaic, in which each tile is an irreplaceable element in creating a great original and precious work.”
And yet, Francis warned that such diversity can also become a source of conflict. It was an apparent reference to episodes of intolerance that have flared in recent years in Indonesia as well as a broader concern about conflicts raging around the world.
“This wise and delicate balance, between the multiplicity of cultures and different ideological visions, and the ideals that cement unity, must be continuously defended against imbalances,” Francis said. Political leaders, he said, had a particular role to play but he also assured Widodo of the Catholic Church’s commitment to increasing interreligious dialogue.

“This is indispensable for meeting common challenges, including that of countering extremism and intolerance, which through the distortion of religion attempt to impose their views by using deception and violence.”
Regionally, internal conflict in Myanmar has forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh, where thousands have fled overcrowded, violent camps to countries including Indonesia. Francis met with at least one Rohingya refugee upon arrival Tuesday at the Vatican’s residence in a show of support for refugees to be welcomed, not rejected.
Farther afield, Indonesia has long been a strong supporter of Palestinians and the government has regularly condemned Israel’s war in Gaza. Widodo thanked Francis for the Vatican’s support of Palestinians since the start of the war.
“War will not benefit anyone, war will only bring suffering and misery to the common people,” Widodo said. “Therefore let us celebrate the differences that we have. Let us accept each other and strengthen tolerance to realize peace, to realize a better world for all humanity.”
Francis arrived in Jakarta on Tuesday to kick off the longest, farthest and most difficult trip of his pontificate given his myriad health problems. At 87, he uses a wheelchair, has regular bouts of bronchitis and has had multiple surgeries for intestinal problems.
By the trip’s end on Sept. 13, Francis will have flown 32,814 kilometers (20,390 miles) to visit Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore, one of the longest papal trips ever in terms of days on the road and distances traveled.
In Indonesia, Francis will be seeking to support the Catholic community, which only makes up 3% of the population of some 275 million, while seeking to encourage greater ties with the country that is home to the largest Muslim population.
The highlight of Francis’ first stop will be his participation Thursday in an interfaith meeting in Jakarta’s iconic Istiqlal mosque with representatives of the six religions that are officially recognized in Indonesia: Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Catholicism and Protestantism.
While Francis will want to highlight Indonesia’s tradition of religious tolerance, the country’s image as a moderate Muslim nation has been undermined by flare-ups of intolerance. In 2021, a militant Islamic couple blew themselves up outside a packed Catholic cathedral on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island during a Palm Sunday Mass, injuring at least 20 people.
As Francis arrived, Amnesty International said it hoped his visit would encourage an end to acts of intolerance and discrimination against minority groups and truly promote a respect for religious freedom that is enshrined in the country’s constitution.
In a statement, Amnesty noted that from January 2021 to July 2024, there were at least 123 cases of intolerance, including rejection, closure or destruction of places of worship and physical attacks. The perpetrators allegedly came from various backgrounds, including government officials, residents and community organizations.
“The pope’s visit has an important role to play in encouraging Indonesia to end intolerance and discrimination against all minority groups. Freedom of religion is a right protected by the Indonesian Constitution,” said Usman Hamid, executive director of Amnesty International Indonesia.
In the afternoon, Francis meets with Indonesian clergy and nuns in Jakarta’s Our Lady of the Assumption Cathedral for his traditional pep talk to the local church. Indonesia is home to the world’s largest Catholic seminary and has long been a top source of priests and nuns for the Catholic Church, though their numbers today are not keeping pace with the growth in the overall Catholic population.
Asia, along with Africa, has long been seen as the future of the Catholic Church, both in terms of the number of baptized faithful and the number of men and women who decide to become priests or nuns. In Asia, the numbers are growing whereas longtime Catholic bastions such as Europe and the Americas have been seeing a long-term contraction both in the number of Catholics and those who enter religious life.
While Indonesia can by no means compete with India or the overwhelmingly Catholic Philippines in terms of the overall number of baptized Catholics or priests, the number of men studying to become priests is continuing to grow whereas the number of seminarians in Asia overall has started to level off or even decline in the last few years.
According to Vatican statistics as of Dec. 31, 2022, the last year for which data is available, there were 5,903 Catholic priests in Indonesia for a population of 8.29 million Catholics. While the number of seminarians studying for the priesthood in Asia has declined since 2017, including in the Philippines and India, Indonesia continued to add them, with 4,024 seminarians in 2022 compared to 3,777 in 2017.

E5LB8Z3BHS_TK5V1OHZPJP5N4B,Bolivia’s president promises public votes on fuel subsidies and constitutionality of reelection,By CARLOS VALDEZ,_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/bolivia-president-arce-economic-crisis-fuel-subsidies-morales-04255009f9201cd8757959b8d71ccd05,"LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) — Bolivia’s socialist President Luis Arce said Tuesday national referenda would be held soon on the removal of politically combustible fuel subsidies and on the constitutionality of presidential reelections, offering for the first time a concrete path out of the country’s economic morass and political limbo.
Arce did not give a date for the votes in his speech from Sucre, the southern historical capital, as Bolivia marked the 199th anniversary of its independence. He defended the referenda proposal as a way to dispel some of the uncertainty Bolivians have endured for months, promising that the populist gesture wasn’t about “electoral calculations or personal ambitions.”
“It’s time for the people, together with their government, to choose the path we wish to follow in view of the bicentennial,” Arce said.
A plan to vote on the elimination of fuel subsidies comes as incensed truckers and other protesters have blockaded roads leading to Bolivian cities in recent weeks over the scarcity of diesel, which is more than 80% imported. Fuel shipments from Bolivia’s key ally Russia were stranded by a rainstorm last week at a Chilean port, adding to pressures on Arce’s administration.
The government has nearly gone bankrupt importing and heavily subsidizing fuel. Bolivia would need $10 million a day to keep importing gasoline at international prices, selling it at half the price and remaining solvent, energy analyst Raul Velasquez said.
Without exporting natural gas anymore — once the mainstay of its booming economy — Bolivia is burning through its foreign currency reserves.
Over 50 countries go to the polls in 2024
But curtailing the long-established subsidies risks triggering catastrophic price shocks — and further inflaming outrage among Bolivians already beset with economic woes.

The official exchange rate between the boliviano and the U.S. dollar has effectively collapsed. The black market rate has surged 50% above the official one. In his speech, Arce also said he would convene business leaders for discussions on whether to devalue the local currency.
Arce also announced a referendum on whether and how former presidents may seek reelection, an apparent attempt to resolve a dispute with powerful former President Evo Morales.
Arce’s erstwhile mentor and ally, Morales has declared his intent to run against Arce in 2025 presidential elections — which Arce insists is unconstitutional.
Standing for more than two consecutive terms is prohibited under Bolivian law. But Morales managed to serve three terms as president, from 2006-2019, because of a legal loophole.
Morales’ bid for a fourth term — which the constitutional court actually allowed at the time even though he lost a referendum on extending term limits — prompted allegations of fraud and unleashed mass unrest that compelled the leftist leader to resign and flee the country in 2019.
Morales’ power struggle with Arce since returning home to Bolivia and launching a comeback has created a rolling political crisis that has paralyzed the country’s Congress, sunk plans to lure foreign investors to tap Bolivia’s vast lithium reserves and blocked the government from taking on foreign debt that would alleviate the cash crunch.
“To ensure that political actors do not once again affect the stability and economy of Bolivian families, it’s important to clarify the nature of reelection,” Arce said, without giving further details about the public vote. It wasn’t clear whether the referendum would involve changing the constitution ahead of next year’s elections.
Although Independence Day speeches may typically offer leaders a chance to reflect on the year’s political accomplishments, President Arce took the occasion to detail his many woes: Bolivia’s fall in natural gas production, legislative gridlock, foreign currency shortage — even, he said, “the climate crisis.”
His critics showed little pity.
“The president again blames Congress for the country’s crisis and avoids assuming responsibilities,” opposition lawmaker Jairo Quinteros said.
Bolivia’s anniversary comes just over 40 days after an alleged botched military coup brought the country to a standstill.
It remains unclear what exactly transpired on June 26 when General Juan José Zúñiga stormed the government headquarters surrounded by military vehicles and briefly faced down Arce before being dismissed and arrested, his alleged overthrow plot vanquished.
Arce — who has denied an eruption of allegations that he masterminded the coup to boost his own political fortunes — shed no more light on the matter Tuesday.
What has become clearer, analysts say, is that Bolivia’s economic and political crisis has only worsened.
The sight of tanks ramming into the presidential palace last month didn’t quite help restore investor confidence. And amid the Independence Day festivities, trucks and buses idled for hours outside gas stations as the much-anticipated Russian fuel delivered last week failed to relieve the dire shortages.
Few expect the promise of a referendum to solve the country’s problems.
“Arce has opted to get rid of his problems, to pass the hot potato onto others by asking the people to find the solution,” prominent Bolivian political analyst José Luis Bedregal said. “A new scenario has opened that will further complicate the political debate.”

EDG8AWKM8R_ZAZY3LN8B97M8UN,Haiti unveils new corruption cases against high-level officials even as impunity persists,By DÁNICA COTO,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/haiti-corruption-government-ee8c03d035d0f85c4772ed1ebaa7a1fb,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Investigators with Haiti’s anti-corruption agency donned caps and face masks on Tuesday as they stood behind boxes of evidence that accuse high-ranking government officials of crimes ranging from illicit enrichment to abuse of office.
It’s the latest crackdown on widespread corruption in the impoverished Caribbean country long known for its impunity. The newest cases involve food meant for public school students being diverted for other purposes to government fuel being used for personal benefit.
“These personalities have betrayed the country,” said Hans Joseph, general director of the Anti-Corruption Unit, who has been relentless in his pursuit of illegalities despite little to no repercussions for those accused.
He said the corruption cases unveiled Tuesday have cost the Haitian government $4.7 million, “an amount that paradoxically exceeds twice the budget allocated to the (agency) to fight corruption.”
One case involves the general director and other officials at Haiti’s National Solid Waste Management Service. The report states that while the agency disbursed $1.7 million to buy fuel from December 2021 to April 2024, only 45% of the fuel bought was used for the agency’s daily operations. The rest was used by the agency’s general director and others, the report alleged.
“As a general director, I find it normal to use the institution’s cash register to support myself,” Germain Paulémon, told investigators, according to the report.

He could not be immediately reached for comment.
Another case found that officials with Haiti’s National School Food Program bought $2.9 million worth of food from October 2016 to February 2021, but that out of a sample of 11 schools across Haiti, the majority “barely received anything,” the report found.
Officials said the food was diverted for other purposes but did not detail them. They noted that 90% of the providers listed by the program “did not physically exist,” and that some were run by the program’s own employees.
Haiti has long struggled with malnutrition, many of them public school students, and currently more than 1 million people are on the brink of starvation.
Officials also opened a case against the former minister of planification and external cooperation, Aviol Fleurant, after more than 4,900 people signed a petition demanding he be investigated. Authorities accused him of illegal enrichment, saying he could not explain the origin of more than $570,000 in his bank accounts.
Fleurant, who is an attorney, did not respond to a message requesting comment.
Other cases include the alleged embezzlement of more than $170,000 at Haiti’s power company after someone filed a complaint against senior board executives.
“The work that we do and that we intend to execute against all odds is that…of cleaning up the public administration,” Joseph said.
All those cited in the report following years-long investigations were referred to the public prosecutor’s office. However, Haiti rarely prosecutes government officials.
Joseph said that his office also has demanded declarations of assets from 14 diplomats, ambassadors, consuls and consul generals who have yet to submit any information, and, as a result, were referred to authorities.

EHSQT2WTRQ_7TJONNBXERCVYEP,US secures the release of 135 Nicaraguan political prisoners,By SONIA PÉREZ D.,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/nicaragua-guatemala-prisoners-freed-7244a080da577a7992d55e2677630861,"GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — The U.S. government announced Thursday that it secured the release of 135 Nicaraguan political prisoners, who have arrived in Guatemala where they will apply for entry to the United States or other countries.
National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a statement that they were released on humanitarian grounds.
“No one should be put in jail for peacefully exercising their fundamental rights of free expression, association, and practicing their religion,” Sullivan said.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Eric Jacobstein, speaking with reporters, said that the Nicaraguan government received nothing in exchange for the prisoners’ release and the negotiation signaled no change in U.S. policy toward the government of President Daniel Ortega.
“Though the pressure itself has been consistent, the planning and execution of this release was rapid, and we’ve worked quickly to facilitate the travel of these individuals and really ensure their safety at every step of the journey,” Jacobstein said, adding that Nicaragua continues to “unjustly” detain people.
Asked if there were some prisoners Nicaragua was willing to release, but who refused to leave, he declined to comment.
Jacobstein, who greeted the Nicaraguans in Guatemala, said “these are individuals, some of whom have been victims of torture ... who’ve had an extremely difficult time, we did find them generally in very good health and spirits.”

One thing that struck the U.S. diplomat about some of his conversations with the prisoners was the “true pettiness and cruelty” of Ortega’s government for imprisoning people for no justifiable reason.
Francisco Arteaga, a released prisoner who spoke from the window of the yellow bus carrying him and others from the air field, was asked why he had been arrested. “For spreading on social media the government’s actions against the Catholic church,” he said.
Among the Nicaraguans released were 13 members of a Texas-based religious charity, Catholic laypeople, students and others.
Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo agreed to host the Nicaraguans while they apply for entry to the U.S.
The Nicaraguans rolled out of a Guatemalan air base in the capital on buses Thursday morning, with some waving from the windows.
Nicaragua’s government did not immediately confirm the announcement on the prisoners’ release.
Nicaraguan human rights advocate Haydeé Castillo said the release of the prisoners was a “triumph for the Nicaraguan people’s resistance.” She noted that the prisoners weren’t really freed because their release comes with forced displacement from their country.
“Nobody should be held prisoner for thinking differently,” Castillo said.
She said advocates were reviewing lists to see how many such prisoners remain in custody.
Ivannia Alvarez, an exiled Nicaraguan and member of the Recognition Mechanism for Political Prisoners, said that her most recent count had been 151 jailed, suggesting that some of them are still detained.
The Texas-based religious organization Mountain Gateway confirmed the release of 13 of its people after nine months in jail.
“This is the day we have prayed for,” pastor Jon Britton Hancock, Mountain Gateway’s founder, said in a statement.
Environmentalist Amaru Ruiz said on social platforms that among those released were eight Indigenous forest rangers.
“The United States again calls on the government of Nicaragua to immediately cease the arbitrary arrest and detention of its citizens for merely exercising their fundamental freedoms,” Sullivan said.
The U.S. government referred to them as political prisoners and prisoners of conscience.
The announcement came just two days after Nicaragua’s National Assembly approved changes to the criminal code allowing the government to try Nicaraguans and foreigners in absentia.
Opponents and organizations that have fled or been forced into exile in President Ortega’s yearslong campaign to silence critical voices could be fined, sentenced to lengthy prison terms and see their property seized by the government under the approved changes.
Last year, the government exiled more than 300 opposition figures, stripping them of their nationality. Far more Nicaraguans have fled into exile themselves to escape the repression that followed massive 2018 protests that Ortega dubbed a failed coup with international backing.
“These individuals safely and voluntarily arrived in Guatemala,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. “We thank President Bernardo Arévalo and his administration for their efforts and support in welcoming them.”
“Nicaraguan authorities unjustly detained these individuals for exercising their fundamental freedoms of expression, of association and peaceful assembly, and of religion or belief,” Blinken said.
The government has shuttered more than 5,000 organizations since 2018, many of them religious in nature.

EJ4U10T8BO_W85S6NXF4LBCOOF,Iraqi women fear rise in child marriages as lawmakers consider giving conservative clerics more say,By STELLA MARTANY and KAREEM CHEHAYEB,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/iraq-child-marriage-shiite-clerics-parliament-amendment-ed4b3d3bc5d8cf25f46e23fb6ed09d91,"IRBIL, Iraq (AP) — Shaimaa Saadoun is haunted by her memory of being forced into an abusive marriage to a 39-year-old man just after she turned 13.
Her impoverished family near the southern Iraqi city of Basra hoped that the dowry of gold and money would help improve their circumstances. Her husband presented a bloodstained piece of linen to prove her virginity after their wedding night.
“I was expected to be a wife and mother while I was still a child myself. No child or teenager should be forced to live what I have lived and experienced,” said Saadoun, who divorced her husband when she was 30 and is now 44.
Saadoun’s marriage was illegal, though a judge — who was related to the husband — signed off on it. Iraqi law sets 18 as the minimum age of marriage in most cases.
But such child marriages of girls might be state-sanctioned soon. Iraq’s parliament is considering controversial legal changes that would give religious authorities more power over family law matters, a move that rights groups and opponents warn could open the door to the marriage of girls as young as 9.
The push for the changes comes mainly from powerful Shiite Muslim political factions backed by religious leaders that have increasingly campaigned against what they describe as the West imposing its cultural norms on Muslim-majority Iraq. In April, the parliament passed a harsh anti-LGBTQ+ law.
The proposed amendments would allow Iraqis to turn to religious courts on issues of family law, including marriage, which currently are the sole domain of civil courts.

That would let clerics rule according to their interpretation of Shariah, or Islamic law, as opposed to national laws. Some clerics interpret Shariah to allow marriage of girls in their early teens — or as young as 9 under the Jaafari school of Islamic law followed by many Shiite religious authorities in Iraq.
Many Iraqi women have reacted with horror, holding protests outside parliament and campaigning against the changes on social media.
“Legislating a law that brings back the country 1,500 years is a shameful matter … and we will keep rejecting it until the last breath,” Heba al-Dabbouni, an activist among dozens at a protest in August, told The Associated Press. “The Iraqi parliament’s job is to pass laws that will raise the standards of society.”
Conservative legislators say the changes give people a choice whether to use civil or religious law, and argue they are defending families from secular, Western influences.
Human Rights Watch Iraq researcher Sarah Sanbar said the changes prioritize the husband’s preference. “So, yes it’s giving a choice, but it’s giving a choice to men first and foremost.”
The often furious debate has spilled into Iraqi media — even among clerics. On one recent news show, a Sunni cleric argued against a younger marriage age, calling it damaging to girls and saying there was no problem under Islam with the existing laws.
In a lecture posted on social media, Shiite cleric Rashid al-Husseini insisted Shariah allows marrying a 9-year-old girl. “But in practice, is this something that actually happens? … It might be zero percent, or 1% of cases,” he said.
The proposed amendments are backed by most Shiite legislators in a bloc called the Coordination Framework that holds a parliament majority. But disputes continue over the draft. Parliament was meant to hold an initial vote on the law Tuesday but could not reach a quorum and had to postpone it.
Iraq’s personal status law passed in 1959 is broadly perceived as a strong foundation largely protecting women and children’s rights. It set the legal marriage age at 18, though it allows girls as young as 15 to marry with parental consent and medical proof that the girl has hit puberty and is menstruating.
Marriages outside state courts were forbidden. Still, enforcement is lax. Individual judges sometimes approve younger marriages, whether because of corruption or because the marriage has already taken place informally.
Parliamentarian Raed al-Maliki, who presented the proposed amendments, said the state would still provide protections and that discussions were still taking place about a minimum marriage age.
The age will be “very close to the current law,” al-Maliki told the AP, without elaborating.
Al-Maliki and other proponents depict the changes as a defense against Western secularism.
He said the original law was influenced by “communists and Baathists,” the latter in reference to the secular pan-Arab nationalist party that ruled the country with an iron fist from 1968 until its rule under Saddam Hussein was toppled in the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.
“In the West they take children away from their parents for the simplest reasons and accuse them of violence, then they change their culture and create homosexuals out of them,” al-Maliki said, referring to Iraq’s law passed in April that criminalized same-sex relations and the promotion of LGBTQ+ rights. “We cannot imitate that or consider it as development.”
Criticism of Western culture has gained new strength since the latest Israel-Hamas war broke out, with most Iraqis sympathizing with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Many see statements about human rights by the United States and others as hypocritical because of their support of Israel’s campaign in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.
But the most vocal opponents of the changes are Iraqi women, said Sanbar of Human Rights Watch.
“It speaks volumes to the fact that this is what Iraqi women want, not foreign organizations dictating what Iraq needs to do,” she said.
This wasn’t the first such set of amendments to be proposed over the past decade. But now, Shiite parties are more unified behind them.
Harith Hasan, a non-resident fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, says Shiite parties previously had different priorities, focused on the many conflicts rocking the country the past two decades.
“Now there is sort of a consensus” among them on cultural issues, he said, adding that the new amendments would create “institutionalized sectarianism” in Iraq and could weaken civil courts.
“When they say it is the right of religious officials to handle marriage, inheritance, divorce, and the court cannot challenge this, you create two parallel authorities,” Hasan said. “This will create confusion in the country.”
Saadoun, who now lives in IrbiI, in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, said she fears for women and girls in Iraq.
“The new amendments in the personal status law will destroy the future of many little girls and many generations,” she said.

EJFK8R4AT0_ZUPEXHY63HT4H2Q,UAE leader pardons 57 Bangladeshis imprisoned for rallying in the Arab nation over turmoil back home,By JON GAMBRELL,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/uae-emirates-bangladesh-protests-arrests-pardon-b9049c9c41ec02820a233da9afcd6936,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The leader of the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday pardoned 57 Bangladeshi nationals convicted in rapid trials over their involvement in protests in the Arabian Peninsula nation about unrest in their home country.
The decision by Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the ruler of Abu Dhabi, came after he held a telephone call last week with Bangladesh’s interim prime minister, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. Yunus took over Bangladesh after demonstrators drove longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee the country.
The arrests in the UAE underlined the strict laws criminalizing speech and public protest in this Gulf Arab country that is home to the cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
The Emirates’ state-run WAM news agency gave no figure for the number of Bangladeshis pardoned, but said it involved those who took part in “protests and disturbances across several emirates” in July.
“The decision includes cancelling the sentences of those convicted and arranging for their deportation,” WAM said.
In Bangladesh, the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha news agency quoted an adviser to Yunus as saying that all 57 Bangladeshis arrested and tried would be coming back to the country soon.
The Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal in July gave 10-year prison sentences to 53 Bangladeshi nationals and an 11-year term to another Bangladeshi national. Three others received sentences of life in prison in the Emirates, an autocratically ruled federation of seven sheikhdoms.

Prosecutors accused the men of “gathering in a public place and protesting against their home government with the intent to incite unrest,” obstructing law enforcement, causing harm to others and damaging property.
Human Rights Watch instead described the men as being “arbitrarily detained, convicted and sentenced to long prison terms ... based on their participation in peaceful demonstrations.”
The protests in the UAE followed weeks of demonstrations in Bangladesh by people upset about a quota system that reserved up to 30% of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh’s war of independence in 1971. The country’s top court in late July scaled back the controversial system.
Hasina, who had governed the country for 15 years, then resigned and fled Bangladesh on Aug. 5 as the protests intensified.
The weeks of violent protests and Hasina’s crackdown killed more than 600 people, according to United Nations’ estimates.
In the UAE, broad laws tightly restrict speech and nearly all major local media are either state-owned or state-affiliated outlets. Laws also criminalize the very few protests that take place by foreign laborers.
The Emirates’ overall population of more than 9.2 million people is only 10% Emirati. The rest are expatriates, many of them low-paid laborers seeking to send money back home to their families. Estimates suggest Bangladeshis are the UAE’s third-largest expatriate community, trailing only Indians and Pakistanis."
F7P857RTGF_YYYZQVZHQLT6EIW,Malaysia to investigate leak of Chinese diplomatic note over South China Sea row,_,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/malaysia-china-south-china-sea-leaked-diplomatic-note-84f4aea7184b12599ff94a750cddaff8,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Malaysia’s Foreign Ministry called Wednesday for a police investigation into a leaked diplomatic note from China over the South China Sea dispute.
The ministry said details of a Feb. 18 diplomatic note from China’s Foreign Ministry to the Malaysian Embassy in Beijing was published by a Filipino media outlet on Aug. 29. It didn’t give details but alluded to the South China Sea row in its statement.
The Philippine Daily Inquirer had published a diplomatic note in which Beijing reportedly demanded that Malaysia immediately halt all activities in an oil-rich maritime area off Sarawak state on Borneo island.
The report said China had accused Malaysia of encroaching on areas covered by its 10-dash line, Beijing’s controversial map showing its claims to sovereignty in the South China Sea. The diplomatic note also expressed Beijing’s displeasure over Malaysia’s oil and gas exploration activities near the Luconia Shoals, which is near to Sarawak, it said.
“The ministry views the leak of this document, which constitutes an official communication channel between the two countries, with grave concern,” Malaysia’s foreign affairs ministry said in a statement. Apart from calling for a police investigation, the ministry also said it will conduct an internal investigation into the breach of classified information.
Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan all dispute Beijing’s claims to almost the entire South China Sea. Unlike the Philippines which have had public clashes with China in the disputed area, Malaysia’s government prefers diplomatic channels. It rarely criticizes Beijing publicly, even though Chinese coast guard ships have sailed near Malaysia’s waters. This is partly to protect economic ties as China has been Malaysia’s top trading partner since 2009.
The ministry said Malaysia and China were committed to peaceful settlements, without any recourse to disputes and violence. The two countries became co-chairs last month for a three-year period of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations."
FDN1VX9SC7_1FTKZO9ZHL1PPDI,Salvagers abandon effort to tow burning oil tanker in the Red Sea targeted by Yemen’s Houthi rebels,By JON GAMBRELL,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-red-sea-tanker-99db388d84f30c7e53e2703abd343fdf,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Salvagers abandoned an initial effort to tow away a burning oil tanker in the Red Sea targeted by Yemen’s Houthi rebels as it “was not safe to proceed,” a European Union naval mission said Tuesday, leaving the Sounion stranded and its 1 million barrels of oil at risk of spilling.
While a major spill has yet to occur, the incident threatens to become one of the worst yet in the Iranian-backed rebels’ campaign that has disrupted the $1 trillion in goods that pass through the Red Sea each year over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. It also has halted some aid shipments to conflict-ravaged Sudan and Yemen.
“The private companies responsible for the salvage operation have concluded that the conditions were not met to conduct the towing operation and that it was not safe to proceed,” the EU’s Operation Aspides mission said, without elaborating. “Alternative solutions are now being explored by the private companies.”
The EU mission declined to answer questions from The Associated Press about the announcement, other than to say its “assets have been engaged in protecting the tugs involved.” The safety issue could be the fire burning aboard the vessel. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC taken Tuesday afternoon and analyzed by the AP showed the Sounion still ablaze.
The U.S. State Department has warned that a spill from the Sounion could be “four times the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster” in 1989 off Alaska.

Meanwhile, there’s the threat of attacks by the Houthis, who on Monday targeted two other oil tankers traveling through the Red Sea. The Houthis have suggested they’ll allow a salvage operation to take place, but critics say the rebels have used the threat of an environmental disaster previously involving another oil tanker off Yemen to extract concessions from the international community.
The Houthis initially attacked the Greek-flagged Sounion tanker on Aug. 21 with small arms fire, projectiles and a drone boat. A French destroyer operating as part of Operation Aspides rescued its crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, after they abandoned the vessel and took them to nearby Djibouti.
Last week, the Houthis released footage showing they planted explosives on board the Sounion and ignited them in a propaganda video, something the rebels have done before in their campaign.
The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.
The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.
There no American vessels known to be in the Red Sea at the moment as the EU mission has taken charge after the Sounion attack. A U.S. defense official, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss information not made public, said the American military has not been asked and has no role in the cleanup or the towing of the Sounion.
The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower recently served a monthslong deployment in the Red Sea, facing the most intense, continuous combat the U.S. Navy has seen since World War II while fighting against the Houthis.
The U.S. aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, along with its carrier groups, are in the Gulf of Oman to counter a threatened Iranian retaliation against Israel over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. Satellite pictures and a report Tuesday from the U.S. Navy Institute suggest the USS Abraham Lincoln and its strike group, once with the Roosevelt, has moved into the Gulf of Aden.
However, the U.S. has continued a campaign of airstrikes targeting the Houthis. A strike Tuesday destroyed a Houthi missile system, the U.S. military’s Central Command said.
“The onus is on the Houthis, again, to look at the impact that they’re having, not only in the short term, but on the long term as it relates to the environment, the economy and the safety of those that are transiting this important waterway,” said U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon’s press secretary.
The Houthis’ attacks likely will continue until there’s a cease-fire in Gaza, warned Matthew Bey, a senior analyst at the RANE Network, a risk consultancy. Even then, there’s a risk that the rebels continue the attacks.
“The Houthis have learned quite a bit from what they’ve been doing over the last year — it’s been a very significant recruiting boon for them,” Bey said. “I think there are a lot of incentives for them to target shipping in the future because they’ve learned that they can be very successful in that. It brings in the West, which is kind of the enemy that they want to fight to some degree as well.”

FQF51GO3T7_BIGOPI5I34B6UGA,"Russian missiles blast Ukrainian military academy and hospital, killing more than 50, officials say",By ILLIA NOVIKOV and LORI HINNANT,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-missile-strike-poltava-region-a53f1a4500ef52e4bf8217ee0e8bca84,"POLTAVA, Ukraine (AP) — Two ballistic missiles blasted a military academy and nearby hospital Tuesday in Ukraine, killing more than 50 people and wounding more than 200 others, Ukrainian officials said, in one of the deadliest Russian strikes since the war began.
The missiles tore into the heart of the Poltava Military Institute of Communication’s main building, causing several stories to collapse. It didn’t take long for the smell of smoke and word of the deadly strike to spread through the central-eastern town.
“People found themselves under the rubble. Many were saved,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video posted on his Telegram channel. He ordered an investigation.
Shattered bricks were visible inside the closed gates of the institution, which was off-limits to the media, and small pools of blood could be seen just outside hours later. Field communications trucks were parked along the perimeter. Roads were covered in glass from shattered apartment windows.
“I heard explosions ... I was at home at that time. When I left the house, I realized that it was something evil and something bad,” said Yevheniy Zemskyy, who arrived to volunteer his help. “I was worried about the children, the residents of Poltava. That’s why we are here today to help our city in any way we can.”
By Tuesday evening, the death toll stood at 51, according to the general prosecutor’s office.

Filip Pronin, governor of the region that bears Poltava’s name, announced on Telegram that 219 people were wounded. Up to 18 people may be buried under the rubble, he said.
Ten apartment buildings were damaged, and more than 150 people donated blood, Pronin said.
He called it “a great tragedy” for the region and all of Ukraine, and announced three days of mourning starting Wednesday.
The academy trains officers in communications and electronics, as well as drone operators, honing some of the most valued skills in a war where both sides are fighting for control of the electronic battlefield.
“The enemy certainly must answer for all (its) crimes against humanity,” Pronin wrote on Telegram.
The Kremlin offered no immediate comment on the strike. It was not clear whether the dead and wounded were limited to Ukrainian military personnel, such as signal corps cadets, or if they included civilians.
Since it embarked on its full-scale invasion in early 2022, the Russian military has repeatedly used missiles to smash civilian targets, sometimes killing scores of people in a single attack.
Some of the deadliest such assaults included a 2022 airstrike on a theater in Mariupol that killed hundreds of civilians sheltering in the basement and a strike that same year on the train station in Kramatorsk that killed 61. Apartment buildings, markets and shopping centers have also been targeted.
Poltava is about 350 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, on the main highway and rail route between Kyiv and Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, which is close to the Russian border.
The attack happened as Ukrainian forces sought to carve out their holdings in Russia’s Kursk border region after a surprise incursion that began Aug. 6 and as the Russian army hacks its way deeper into eastern Ukraine.
The missiles hit shortly after an air-raid alert sounded, when many people were on their way to a bomb shelter, Ukraine’s Defense Ministry said, describing the strike as “barbaric.”
Rescue crews and medics saved 25 people, including 11 who were dug out of the rubble, a Defense Ministry statement said.
The strike came on the day that Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Mongolia. There was no indication that his hosts would heed demands to arrest him on an international warrant for alleged war crimes.
Zelenskyy repeated his appeal for Ukraine’s Western partners to ensure swift delivery of military aid. He has previously chided the U.S. and European countries for being slow to make good on their pledges of help.
He also wants them to ease restrictions on what Ukraine can target on Russian soil with the weapons they provide. Some countries fear that hitting Russia could escalate the war.
“Ukraine needs air defense systems and missiles now, not sitting in storage,” Zelenskyy wrote in English on Telegram.
“Long-range strikes that can protect us from Russian terror are needed now, not later. Every day of delay, unfortunately, means more lost lives,” he said.
Novikov reported from Kyiv, Ukraine. Associated Press journalist Alex Babenko also contributed to this report.

FTCUAOPFC6_97BREEAU35V0SVB,"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson discusses new memoir, ‘Lovely One,’ at Apollo Theater",By HILLEL ITALIE,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/justice-ketanji-brown-jackson-lovely-one-memoir-d2de344c42e317433a46ec60c23270ea,"NEW YORK (AP) — In one of her first public appearances on behalf of her newly published memoir, “Lovely One,” Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson didn’t make a lot of news, but she did make a little history: She can add her name to James Brown, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson among others as someone who has sung at the Apollo Theater.
Reminiscing Tuesday night with interviewer Gayle King about her love for musical theater, Jackson ably crooned a few lines from “The Wiz” — “When I think of home, I think of a place/Where there’s love overflowing” — and threw in a favorite chant from “Schoolhouse Rock” — “I’m just a bill, yes I’m only a bill. And I’m sitting here on Capitol Hill.”
The capacity audience at the famed Harlem performance center cheered and sang along.
King had promised — and kept her promise — to focus on Jackson’s personal story and not on the law. Jackson discussed her childhood in Miami, the origins of her name (It means “lovely one,” the book’s title), her undergraduate years at Harvard University, her interracial marriage to Dr. Patrick Jackson — who was in the audience Tuesday night — and her rise through the court system, culminating in 2022 when she became the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. “A roaring ocean” in her ears is how she remembered the call from President Joe Biden, asking her if she would agree to fill the vacancy left by retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, for whom she had once clerked.
Jackson explained Tuesday that she had been interested since she was a girl, when she and her father, Johnny Brown, would sit together at the dining room table, she with coloring books and he with law books he was studying at the time. Her ambition grew in middle school after she learned about Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to serve on the federal judiciary.
“I remember this kinship with this fantastic woman,” Jackson told King. “I thought, ‘Why stop at law? I could be a federal judge.”

Jackson’s book, 405 pages, combines family history, legal history and personal history as she narrates her own improbable journey — a Black woman rising to the highest court in a country where segregation was legal well into the 20th century. “Lovely One” often reads as a kind of lesson, or roadmap, what Jackson calls in the preface “a testament for young women, people of color, and strivers everywhere, especially those who nourished outsized ambitions and believe with stubborn faith in the possibility of achieving them.”
She endured aggressive questions from Republican senators during her confirmation hearings and she currently serves on one of the most conservative and divisive courts in U.S. history, casting dissenting votes on such landmark rulings as the granting of partial legal immunity for former presidents. But Jackson avoided naming names — beyond noting that Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican, attended law school with her — or pointing fingers in her book, and resisted Tuesday night when King pressed her to cite even one justice she had clashed with.
“I’m not going to answer that question,” she said, laughing.
When King asked if justices socialized, Jackson responded, “There are opportunities to have lunch.”
Jackson spoke of remaining calm during the confirmation hearings, thanks to her resolve, her preparation and to political realities. The White House worked with her at length in advance, helping her anticipate questions that might otherwise have upset her. One aide had advised she had a choice: “You can get angry or you can be a Supreme Court justice.” Jackson also welcomed another suggestion: Meet with the senators before the hearings.
“They were all lovely. Person to person they were courteous, they were respectful,” she said Tuesday night. “It was ... super helpful in the hearings, because we had had conversations. So I said, ‘Oh, I see. You’re not really talking to me’ — right in my head, as I’m listening to them — because we had talked. ‘You must be talking to your constituents or to someone else.’”"

“It has not been an easy decision but something that I have thought about and processed for some time,” Billström wrote on X.
Billström became foreign minister in October 2022, when Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson formed a coalition government with his own conservative Moderate Party, the smaller Christian Democrats and the Liberals.
In May 2022, Sweden and neighboring Finland sought NATO membership, ending decades of post-World War II neutrality and centuries of broader non-alignment with major powers as security concerns in Europe spiked following Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
After 18 months of delays, Sweden’s membership bid cleared the final hurdle in February Hungary gave its consent.
Turkey also objected to Sweden joining the alliance, but on Jan. 23, Turkish legislators voted in favor. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan put forth a series of conditions including a tougher stance from Stockholm toward groups that Turkey regards as threats to its security, such as Kurdish militants and members of a network it blames for a failed coup in 2016.
Sweden became the 32nd member of the military alliance in March. The 50-year-old Billström said on X that he had taken Sweden through “a sometimes challenging NATO process.”

On Facebook, Kristersson said that Billström had discharged his duties with “flying colors.”
Billström said on X that he would “leave politics completely. This means that I am also leaving my seat in the Riksdag,” the Swedish parliament. The 349-member assembly will convene next week after the summer recess.
Billström has not announced what he’ll do next and his replacement has not yet been named."
GJ7KFTSGUR_5VO48CO21ZKZD6B,Commander of Navy warship relieved of duty months after backward rifle scope photo flap,_,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/navy-yaste-uss-john-mccain-san-diego-3ea123fd26caf4f4981da068aea43135,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — The commander of a Navy destroyer that’s helping protect the San Diego-based aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt in the Middle East has been relieved of duty about four months after he was seen in a photo firing a rifle with a scope mounted backward.
The image brought the Navy considerable ridicule on social media. The San Diego Union-Tribune reported that Cameron Yaste, commanding officer of the destroyer USS John McCain, was removed on Friday.
The Navy said Yaste was relieved of duty “due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command the guided-missile destroyer” that’s currently deployed in the Gulf of Oman. The statement didn’t elaborate about why Yaste was replaced.
In April, a photo posted on the Navy’s social media showed Yaste in a firing stance gripping the rifle with a backward scope.
The military news outlet Stars and Stripes reported that the Marine Corps took a dig at the Navy, sharing a photo on its social media of a Marine firing a weapon aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer. The caption read: “Clear Sight Picture.”
The post featuring Yaste was ultimately deleted. “Thank you for pointing out our rifle scope error in the previous post,” the Navy later wrote on social media. “Picture has been removed until EMI (extra military instruction) is completed.”
Yaste has been temporarily replaced by Capt. Allison Christy, deputy commodore of Destroyer Squadron 21, which is part of the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group that’s also in the Gulf of Oman.

The Pentagon sent the carriers to the Middle East to be in position should Israel need help repelling an attack by Iran or other countries, if such a thing happens, military officials said.
The Roosevelt is the flagship of a strike group that has recently included three Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, $2 billion vessels that are designed to shield carriers from attacks by air, sea and land."
GPMP3KQ9MV_KG6YJGPTDBCMXJY,"Russia launches a barrage of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles at Kyiv, Ukraine’s military says",By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-drone-attacks-1f2730eb13cdf5985f76baf171a68027,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a barrage of drones, cruise and ballistic missiles at Kyiv and possibly other cities, Ukraine’s air force said early Monday.
Several series of explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital in the early hours of Monday, sending residents into bomb shelters.
Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said emergency services were called to the Holosiivskyi and Solomianskyi districts of Kyiv. One person was reportedly injured by falling debris in Shevchenkivskyi district, Klitschko said.
“There will be an answer for everything. The enemy will feel it,” the head of the Presidential Office, Andrii Yermak, posted on his Telegram page following the attack.
According to the air force, Russia fired several groups of cruise missiles accompanied by ballistic missile launches and a few drones, targeting Kyiv.
An explosion also rang out in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, according to Ukrainian media.
The barrage comes a day after Russia’s military reported intercepting and destroying 158 Ukrainian drones targeting multiple Russian regions in one of the biggest attacks of the war that has raged for about 2 1/2 years.
Forty-six of the drones were over the Kursk region, where Ukraine has sent its forces in recent weeks in the largest incursion on Russian soil since World War II. A further 34 were shot over the Bryansk region, 28 over the Voronezh region, and 14 over the Belgorod region — all of which border Ukraine.

Drones were also shot down deeper into Russia, including one each in the Tver region, northwest of Moscow, and the Ivanovo region, northeast of the Russian capital. Russia’s Defense Ministry said drones were intercepted over 15 regions, while one other governor said a drone was shot down over his region, too.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that falling debris from one of the two drones shot down over the city caused a fire at an oil refinery.
Ukrainian drone strikes have brought the fight far from the front line into the heart of Russia. Since the beginning of the year, Ukraine has stepped up aerial assaults on Russian soil, targeting refineries and oil terminals to slow down the Kremlin’s assault.
Also in Russia, regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said 11 people were wounded in Ukrainian aerial missile attacks in the Russian border region of Belgorod on Sunday. These included eight in the regional capital, also called Belgorod.
Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday it had taken control of the towns of Pivnichne and Vyimka, in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. The Associated Press could not independently verify the claim.
Russian forces have been driving deeper into the partly occupied eastern region, the total capture of which is one of the Kremlin’s primary ambitions. Russia’s army is closing in on Pokrovsk, a critical logistics hub for the Ukrainian defense in the area.
At least three people were killed and nine wounded on Sunday in Russian shelling in the town of Kurakhove, some 20 miles (33 kilometers) south of Pokrovsk, Donetsk regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said.
Also on Sunday, 44 people were wounded when Russia attacked the Kharkiv regional capital, also called Kharkiv, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. The city was struck by 10 missiles, with a shopping center, a sports facility and residential buildings among those damaged.
Elsewhere in Ukraine overnight, eight drones were shot down out of 11 launched by Russia, according to the Ukrainian air force.
One person was killed and four wounded in shelling overnight in the Sumy region, local officials said, while Kharkiv Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said five other people had been wounded in his region.

H2T07V5XUO_5GL89U4IUBCDOG0,JD Vance’s Catholicism helped shape his views. So did this little-known group of Catholic thinkers,By MICHELLE R. SMITH and PETER SMITH,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-catholicism-postliberals-social-policy-7e37e43cb1976c516d642a95d495266a,"By his own account, Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s 2019 conversion to Catholicism provided a spiritual fulfillment he couldn’t find in his Yale education or career success.
It also amounted to a political conversion.
Catholicism provided him a new way of looking at the addictions, family breakdowns and other social ills he described in his 2016 bestselling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy.”
“I felt desperate for a worldview that understood our bad behavior as simultaneously social and individual, structural and moral; that recognized that we are products of our environment; that we have a responsibility to change that environment, but that we are still moral beings with individual duties,” he wrote in a 2020 essay.
His conversion also put Vance in close touch with a Catholic intellectual movement, viewed by some critics as having reactionary or authoritarian leanings, that has been little known to the American public until Vance’s rise to the national stage as the Republican vice presidential nominee.
These are not your father’s Catholic conservatives.
The professors and media personalities in this network don’t all agree on everything — even on what to call themselves – but most go by “postliberal.” Vance has used that term to describe himself, though the Trump-Vance campaign did not respond to questions about where Vance sees himself in the movement and whether he shares some of the beliefs promoted by many postliberals.
Postliberals do share some longstanding Catholic conservative views, such as opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

But where Catholic conservatives of the past have seen big government as a problem rather than a solution, the postliberals want a muscular government — one that they control.
They envision a counterrevolution in which they would take over government bureaucracy and institutions like universities from within, replacing entrenched “elites” with their own and acting upon their vision of the “common good.”
“What is needed … is regime change — the peaceful but vigorous overthrow of a corrupt and corrupting liberal ruling class and the creation of a postliberal order,” wrote Patrick Deneen, a prominent author in the movement, in his 2023 book, “Regime Change.”
Vance has signaled his alignment with some of what Catholic postliberals advocate. He’s said the next time his allies control the presidency or Congress, “ we really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power” and said Republicans should seize institutions, including universities “to make them work for our people.” He’s advocated for government policies to spur childbearing, a notion reflected in his digs at “childless cat ladies” with allegedly no stake in America’s future.
Scholars who study this movement caution that Vance does his own thinking and doesn’t necessarily embrace everything proposed by postliberals — or by a subset of them known as integralists, who want a state working in tandem with the Catholic Church. The latter is not a label Vance has used for himself.
But Vance has spoken alongside prominent postliberals at public events and praised some of their work.
What to know about the 2024 Election
At an Ohio conference featuring a who’s who of Catholic postliberals in 2022, he told fellow speakers he has “admired a lot of you from afar” as “some of the people who I think are most interesting about what’s going on in this country.”
Vance praised Deneen’s book at a 2023 panel discussion with the author, a professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame.
Vance has also met privately with leading postliberals, who have posted photos of their gatherings on social media and cheered his vice presidential nomination.
Catholic journals for years have bristled with debates about postliberalism, but with little public attention — in part because its adherents are few and its views are far from mainstream.
But now, postliberals have an avid listener in Donald Trump’s running mate.
“You can go from people writing on an unusual Catholic theology blog to the vice presidential candidate in the course of less than a decade,” said James Patterson, professor of politics at Ave Maria University in Florida.
Vance’s preoccupations show an influence from the movement, he said, citing his remarks about the childless.
“Most ordinary American Catholics would not treat a childless single woman with cats with this kind of contempt,” Patterson said. Even if Vance is not steeped in the philosophy, Patterson added, “he is picking up on the postliberal vibe.”
Some Catholics, including conservatives, have raised alarms about the company Vance has kept, saying postliberalism has historical connections to 20th century European movements that are associated with authoritarian regimes like Francisco Franco’s in Spain.
“We’re talking about people that prefer right-wing authoritarian regimes,” Patterson said.
In a postliberal society, Patterson wrote in an August commentary in the online journal The Dispatch, citizens become “subjects” and personal liberties subjected to “administrative despotism.”
Vance has recently tried to downplay his Catholicism’s impact on policy-making.
Trump’s Supreme Court appointees provided the crucial majority to overturn Roe v. Wade, which had legalized abortion nationwide. But the issue has become a political liability, with voters in several states rejecting abortion restrictions.
Vance had strongly opposed abortion, in the runup to his 2022 senatorial win, saying at one point that “two wrongs don’t make a right” when referring to exceptions for rape and incest. The campaign said in an email Wednesday that he supports “reasonable” exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.
But Vance has aligned with the Republicans’ first post-Roe platform in 2024, in which it backed off from its longstanding support for nationwide abortion restrictions. He pledged he could “absolutely commit” that a Trump-Vance administration would not impose such an abortion ban.
Trump has spoken inconsistently about a ballot measure repealing Florida’s ban on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy.
After facing backlash from anti-abortion activists for seeming to indicate he would support the measure, Trump said he would oppose it.
The Catholic Church’s U.S. bishops declared opposing abortion “our pre-eminent priority.”
Vance told the New York Post in August that Catholic social teaching “certainly influences how I think about issues.” But he acknowledged “there are a lot of things the Catholic Church teaches that frankly, Americans would just never go for.”
He added that in a democracy, “you have to give people their ability to have their own moral views reflected in public policy. There are a lot of non-Catholics in America and I accept that.”
Julian Waller, a political science professor at George Washington University, said Vance has numerous influences outside of Catholic postliberalism — from Trump-style populists to his mentor, tech billionaire Peter Thiel.
It remains to be seen whether Catholic postliberals would get prominent appointments in a Trump-Vance administration — or even how often they’d get their calls returned.
“Someone like JD Vance can read them, be interested in them, attend talks, know them personally, get insights from them,” Waller said. “But he’s not on the hook to obey them.”
For an example of what an administration using state power for postliberal ends might look like, Waller pointed to Florida and Gov. Ron DeSantis’ efforts to rid public higher education of diversity initiatives and critical race theory.
“If you want the model for what someone like JD Vance is really interested in, it’s probably the Florida model, forcefully changing institutions, capturing institutions,” Waller said.
Postliberals’ ideas vary, but there are common themes, said Kevin Vallier, author of “ All the Kingdoms of the World,” a 2023 book on the modern postliberal and integralist movements and their centuries-old roots.
Depending on who’s talking, a postliberal regime change could involve encouraging childbearing, easing or removing church-state separation, banning pornography for adults and children alike, reimposing laws limiting business on the Sabbath, supporting private-sector unions and strengthening safety nets for the middle class.
It’s common to hear postliberals praising Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, particularly for his use of financial incentives for families that have more babies. Orban has championed an “illiberal democracy,”  which includes restrictions on  immigration and LGBTQ+ rights.
Vance has praised Orban for Hungary’s subsidies to married couples with children and for “smart decisions” in seizing control of universities.
Vance has echoed the regime-change rhetoric of using government, staffed by likeminded officials, for postliberal goals.
“You need to have a functional state that accomplishes some of the things that we care about. You need good people to go and work in that functional state,” Vance said a 2022 conference at Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio. It featured prominent postliberals like Deneen and Harvard Law School professor Adrian Vermeule.
Vermeule has advocated for “common-good constitutionalism,” in which the government enacts “strong rule in the interest of attaining the common good.”
Deneen and Vermeule declined requests for interviews.
Vance’s choice to speak at Steubenville underscored his affinity with postliberals, Vallier said.
“He could have given that talk anywhere,” said Vallier, a professor at the Institute of American Constitutional Thought and Leadership at the University of Toledo in Ohio. “Why is he appearing with these intellectuals if he’s not sympathetic to their ideas?”
Vance’s religious journey began in a family that rarely went to church when he was young, he wrote in “Hillbilly Elegy.” But he said his grandmother — the most stable adult in his turbulent household — regularly read the Bible and taught a Christianity that demanded hard work, forgiveness and hope.
For a time, the young JD embraced the strict biblical literalism of his father’s Pentecostal church, crediting it as a stabilizing force, he wrote.
But in college, Vance embraced what he later viewed as an arrogant and fashionable atheism.
Eventually, he wrote in a 2020 essay for the Catholic journal The Lamp, he concluded he “needed grace” to provide him the virtues to be a good husband and father.
“I needed, in other words, to become Catholic,” he wrote.

The blast took place in the southwestern Qala Bakhtiar neighborhood in Kabul, said Khalid Zadran, spokesman for the Kabul police chief.
The dead included one woman, he said, while 13 people were wounded, all of them civilians who were taken to a hospital for treatment.
A police investigation is underway. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing.
The Islamic State group’s affiliate, a major rival of the ruling Taliban, has carried out previous attacks on schools, hospitals, mosques and Shiite areas throughout the country.
The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021 during the chaotic departure of U.S. and NATO troops after 20 years. Despite initial promises of a more moderate stance, the Taliban gradually reimposed a harsh interpretation of Islamic law, or Shariah, as they did during their previous rule of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001."
HABHRTZFBM_1S5NMMXQ7MXQJM4,Honduras’ president is asked to resign after corruption scandal she says is a plot to oust her,By ASSOCIATED PRESS,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/xiomara-castro-coup-carlos-zelaya-honduras-corruption-60fc69e941f8b8ed55b770da530468bf,"TEGUCIGALPA (AP) — The head of an anti-corruption organization on Wednesday demanded that Honduran President Xiomara Castro resign after a video was released in which her brother-in-law allegedly received drug money.
“This request is based on the serious accusations of drug trafficking that have been presented against your family, whom you have appointed to work in the State,” said Gabriela Castellanos, director of the non-governmental organization the National Anti-Corruption Council, in a public letter to Castro.
The demand comes after a rocky week for Castro, who won the presidency on an anti-corruption campaign.
The day before the letter was sent, a video recorded in 2013 was released purportedly showing drug traffickers currently imprisoned in the United States offering more than $525,000 to the president’s brother-in-law and congressional leader, Carlos Zelaya.
In this video published in an investigation by journalists at InsightCrime, Zelaya said “half of it will go to the commander,” referring to his brother, former president Manuel Zelaya, Castro’s husband and main adviser who was overthrown in a 2009 coup d’état.
Castro’s brother-in-law Zelaya acknowledged days earlier that he had met with the leader of the drug trafficking organization “Los Cachiros,” who offered to support his party’s campaign that year; 2013 was the same year Castro made her first unsuccessful run for president.

But Zelaya told the press he was unaware the people who attended the meeting were related to drug trafficking.
Castro’s brother-in-law Carlos Zelaya was among a few family members who resigned from their positions in government after he admitted to having met with a drug-trafficking group in 2013. Zelaya claimed he didn’t know the people he met with were narcos and denied taking money at the time.
“I fell into a trap, I take responsibility for my actions,” Zelaya told press.
Zelaya and his son, the former minister of defense, both resigned from their positions as a result.
Shortly before Zelaya’s revelation, Castro had knocked down a longstanding extradition treaty between Honduras and the United States, which analysts and disillusioned Hondurans said was not a coincidence.
Under the treaty, dozens of Hondurans accused of drug trafficking were extradited to face justice in the U.S., including the country’s ex-president who was recently sentenced to 45 years in prison by a New York court.
The video of Zelaya was met by anger and frustration by many Hondurans, who harbored hope when they elected Castro in 2021 that she would be a different president than the corrupt leaders that have long ruled the Central American nation.
But her popularity has slowly faded in recent years as gang violence rages, the economy and high unemployment continue to plague Hondurans and many feel they haven’t seen the change promised them.
After the video of Zelaya’s meeting with the narco group was broadcast, Castro claimed in statements over radio and television that “dark forces” in Honduras and abroad were working to carry out a coup d’état against her.
“The plan to destroy my socialist and democratic government and the upcoming election is underway,” she said. She offered few other details in her accusations.
Analyst and former presidential candidate Olban Valladares described her claims of a plot to oust her as “absurd,” adding that Castro “insists on using rhetoric that has already been worn out.”"
HALDG0Y3MN_VOA3KOBHGRIMCI4,Markey and Warren condemn Steward’s CEO for refusing to comply with a Senate subpoena,By MICHAEL CASEY,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/steward-ceo-senate-subpoena-7eefc8b915866600928e21e919616ef9,"BOSTON (AP) — Several political leaders, including Massachusetts U.S. Sens. Edward Markey and Elizabeth Warren, attacked the leader of a troubled health care system on Thursday for refusing to comply with a subpoena to appear before a Senate committee.
Lawyers for Steward Health Care CEO Ralph de la Torre said Wednesday that he won’t testify before a committee investigating the Dallas-based hospital company’s bankruptcy because a federal court order prohibits him from discussing anything during an ongoing reorganization and settlement effort.
Warren and Markey both dismissed those concerns on Thursday, saying de la Torre is trying to avoid accountability.
Steward, which operated about 30 hospitals nationwide, filed for bankruptcy in May. It has been trying to sell its more than half-dozen hospitals in Massachusetts, but received inadequate bids for Carney Hospital in Boston and Nashoba Valley Medical Center in the town of Ayer, both of which closed on Saturday. A federal bankruptcy court on Wednesday approved the sale of Steward’s other hospitals in Massachusetts.
In a letter Wednesday to Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, de la Torre did not rule out testifying before the committee at a later date.
“He is in hiding because he does not want to answer to the American people or Congress or the patients and workers of Massachusetts for what he has done,” Markey, speaking at a press conference Thursday, said of de la Torre. “He wants to hide from the accountability of what the last five months have exposed.”

Warren said de la Torre could invoke his constitutional right against self-incrimination if he “believes the answers will put him at risk for going to jail.”
“Ralph de la Torre is one more rich guy who thinks the rules don’t apply to him,” Warren said. “He seems to think he’s above the law and that he can take whatever he wants and not have to answer for any of the destruction that he leaves behind.”
Warren argued that de la Torre’s decision not to appear should result in his ouster from Steward.
“I understand it’s way late in the process, but I’d like to see someone else who gets their eyes on all of the information that’s happening confidentially, internally, and not disclosed to the public — someone besides Ralph de la Torre,” she said.
In their letter to Sanders, lawyers for de la Torre said the Senate committee is seeking to turn the hearing into “a pseudo-criminal proceeding in which they use the time, not to gather facts, but to convict Dr. de la Torre in the eyes of public opinion.”
Sanders said in a statement that he will work with other members of the panel to determine the best way to press de la Torre for answers.
“Let me be clear: We will not accept this postponement. Congress will hold Dr. de la Torre accountable for his greed and for the damage he has caused to hospitals and patients throughout America,” Sanders said. “This Committee intends to move forward aggressively to compel Dr. de la Torre to testify to the gross mismanagement of Steward Health Care.”
The committee’s options include holding de la Torre in criminal contempt, which could result in a trial and jail time; or civil contempt, which would result in fines until he appears. Both would require a Senate vote.
De la Torre also refused invitations to testify at a Boston field hearing earlier this year chaired by Markey."

It said outgoing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s two-day visit was arranged after he “actively expressed hope” to end his term on a high note in bilateral relations. In what would be their 12th summit talks, the leaders will discuss further developing two-way ties and strengthening the countries’ cooperation in regional and global issues, the office said.
A series of local election losses earlier in the year sparked calls for change within Japan’s governing party, which was also dealing with a fundraising scandal. Kishida announced in August that he’ll step down after the Liberal Democratic Party picks a new leader on Sept. 27.
“Prime Minister Kishida is expected to continue to provide constructive advice to his successor on foreign policies and the future development of South Korea-Japan relations based on his experience,” Yoon’s office said in a statement.
Yoshimasa Hayashi, Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, said the meeting will be an “important occasion” for the two leaders to discuss further cooperation between their governments in the face of an increasingly difficult strategic environment.
“Japan and South Korea are the two important neighbors that should cooperate as partners in tackling various issues of the international community,” he told reporters.

Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has focused on resolving historical disputes with Japan as part of broader efforts to beef up South Korea’s military alliance with the United States. The countries have strengthened their military and diplomatic cooperation in the face of North Korean nuclear threats.
Ties between Seoul and Tokyo have long been complicated by grievances related to Japan’s brutal rule of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945, when hundreds of thousands of Koreans were mobilized as forced laborers for Japanese companies, or sex slaves at Tokyo’s military-run brothels during World War II.
Yoon’s most significant move to improve ties came in March 2023, when he announced a contentious plan to compensate Korean forced laborers during Tokyo’s colonial rule that doesn’t require Japanese companies to contribute to the reparations. It was an attempt to end a yearslong impasse with Tokyo and solidify three-way security cooperation with Washington.
The plan met fierce opposition at home from forced labor victims, their supporters and liberal opposition politicians, who have called it a diplomatic surrender and demanded direct payments and a fresh apology from Japan over the issue.

HJSDL6FCEK_DO73NQ69M14AVZ0,Ukrainian foreign minister resigns ahead of expected reshuffling of government leaders,By ILLIA NOVIKOV and EMMA BURROWS,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-resign-kuleba-bb5195cc2df40d32bac374ece6dbc0b8,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, one of Ukraine’s most recognizable faces on the international stage, resigned Wednesday ahead of an expected reshuffling of government leaders. Russian strikes, meanwhile, killed seven people in a western city, a day after one of the deadliest missile attacks since the war began.
Kuleba, 43, gave no reason for stepping down. Four other Cabinet ministers tendered their resignations late Tuesday, likely making this reshuffle the biggest since Russia’s invasion in February 2022.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicated last week that the reshuffling was imminent, with the war poised to enter a critical stage and to mark its 1,000th day in November.
He said Wednesday that Ukraine needs “new energy, and that includes in diplomacy.” He said during a Kyiv news conference with visiting Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris that he could not announce any replacements yet because he did not know whether the candidates would accept his invitation to join the government.
AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Russia has hit the Ukrainian city Lviv, causing deaths and injuries.
Zelenskyy needs to keep up Ukraine’s morale amid the grinding war of attrition with its bigger neighbor and to steel the country’s resolve for what will be another hard winter. Russia has been smashing Ukraine’s power grid, knocking out some 70% of generation capacity and rupturing heat and water supplies.
Wednesday’s deadly attack on Lviv — a city near the border with NATO member Poland and far from the front lines — underscored how all of Ukraine is at the mercy of Moscow’s long-range capabilities.

The Ukrainian army’s risky incursion almost a month ago into Russia’s Kursk border region raised Ukrainian spirits and countered months of grim news from the front line in eastern Ukraine. The incursion’s ultimate goals are unclear, though Zelenskyy says Ukraine wants to create a buffer zone there that would prevent cross-border Russian attacks.
Russian President Vladimir Putin remains bent on pushing his army deeper into eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin’s onslaught in Donetsk, where Ukraine is short of troops and air defenses, and long-range missile strikes that repeatedly hit civilian areas of Ukraine, signal that Putin will remain uncompromising and unrelenting in his efforts to crush Ukrainian resistance.
The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said late Tuesday that Putin believes Russia “can slowly and indefinitely subsume Ukraine through grinding advances” and “by outlasting Western support” for Kyiv.
Zelenskyy is also keeping in mind the U.S. presidential election in November, which could bring a shift in key U.S. military support for his country.
During the war, Kuleba has been second only to Zelenskyy in carrying Ukraine’s message and needs to an international audience, whether through social media posts or meetings with foreign dignitaries. In July, Kuleba became the highest-ranking Ukrainian official to visit China since Russia’s invasion. He has been foreign minister since March 2020.
Kuleba’s successor is not yet known but is expected to be announced Thursday. Several Ukrainian media outlets, citing unnamed sources, said Kuleba’s deputy, Andrii Sybiha, would become the country’s chief diplomat.
The new foreign minister will likely accompany Zelenskyy next week to the U.N. General Assembly in New York, which is an opportunity to lobby global leaders for their support.
Kuleba’s resignation will be discussed by lawmakers at their next session, parliamentary Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said on his Facebook page.
More than half the current Cabinet will undergo changes, said Davyd Arakhamiia, a leader of Zelenskyy’s party in the parliament. Ministers will resign Wednesday, and new appointments will be made Thursday, he said.
Zelenskyy’s five-year mandate expired in May. He remains in power under the provisions of martial law.
Elsewhere, the nighttime strike on Lviv wounded 52 people as well as killing seven, Ukraine’s rescue service said. The strike was carried out with a Kinzhal missile and drones and targeted defense industry enterprises, Russian news agency Tass said, citing the Russian Defense Ministry.
Local officials disputed the targeting claim. Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi and the Ukrainian Catholic University published a photo of a family whose mother and three daughters were killed in the attack that struck their home. The father survived but was in critical condition, Sadovyi said.
The eldest daughter, 21-year-old Yaryna, was a program manager at the European Youth Forum, a platform of the continent’s youth organizations, her colleagues wrote on Facebook. “We will neither forget nor forgive” the attack, they said in the post.
Another Russian attack wounded five people in Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy’s hometown, regional head Serhii Lysak said.
Kuleba said the Lviv and Kryvyi Rih attacks showed Ukraine’s need for more Western support.
“To put an end to this terror, Ukraine’s partners must promptly deliver the promised air defense systems and ammunition, as well as strengthen Ukraine’s defense capabilities and allow us to launch long-range strikes on all legitimate military targets in Russia,” he wrote on X.
Zelenskyy reacted to the attacks by urging Ukraine’s allies to give Kyiv “more range” to use Western weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory.
The attack happened a day after two ballistic missiles blasted a military academy and nearby hospital in Poltava in eastern-central Ukraine, killing 53 people and wounding almost 300 others, Ukrainian officials said.
The missiles tore into the heart of the Poltava Military Institute of Communication’s main building, causing several stories to collapse.
Poltava is about 350 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Kyiv, on the main highway and rail route between Kyiv and Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, which is close to the Russian border.
In other developments, the head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency, Rafael Grossi, visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, a day after describing the situation at Europe’s largest atomic energy facility as “very fragile.”
The International Atomic Energy Agency published a report Wednesday saying that since Grossi’s last visit there in February, the plant has been struck by drones, lost power lines and seen “significant damage” to one of its two cooling towers by fire.

HSFJXO5T9Y_PSPQ97F4A6SGIWW,NZ gets America’s Cup yacht back on water two days after crane mishap damaged its hull,_,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/americas-cup-zealand-9af57f4811b5e9b8da41dc8ea6ae419a,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Emirates Team New Zealand got its yacht back in the water on Saturday, two days after it was damaged when dropped from a crane at the America’s Cup.
The Kiwis’ shore crew worked around the clock to cut out and replace a piece of the hull of the 75-footer named “Taihoro” that was dinged up on Thursday. The boat dropped some six meters (20 feet) onto the support cradle at their team base inside Barcelona’s old port. The defending champion team has not explained what caused the incident.
Initially, team boss Grant Dalton said he feared the boat could be in the shed being refitted throughout the opening two-week phase of the race. With his team, as defending champion, guaranteed a spot in October’s finals, that would not have been a disaster. But it would have limited their sailing time to prime their boat.
But the boat was out of action only on Friday.
New Zealand was skimming over the Mediterranean waves on its hydrofoils on Saturday for a warmup race against Orient Express Racing Team. The French however, were unable to participate due to an unspecified technical issue.
“Unbelievable to get the boat back out on the water,” Taihoro crew member Sam Meech said. “The boat’s going like it always has and we’re pretty happy with the boat’s performance. It was just good to get out there, and just run through our day.”
In the opening stage, the boats race each another twice with a point going to each winner. The five challengers will be reduced to four for the semifinals.

Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli, the 2021 finalist, made a statement on Saturday by beating both NYYC American Magic and INEOS Britannia, the two boats that many race watchers thought had the best chance to challenge the Italians for a the top spot.
Luna Rossa leads the standings with a 3-0 record. INEOS is 2-1, American Magic 2-2, and Orient Express 1-2. Switzerland’s Alinghi Red Bull Racing is 0-3 and in the danger zone.

HVRNPMCVR6_9I7PDH6JC8BDP3R,Young Palestinian journalist who reported on Gaza’s destruction now continues education in Lebanon,By KAREEM CHEHAYEB,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-gaza-israel-hamas-palestinians-journalism-fa34150f2930bd502b4baf5fd1af2322,"BEIRUT (AP) — A young Palestinian journalist whose coverage of the widespread destruction and humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip went viral now watches the war from afar in Lebanon.
Twenty-two-year-old Plestia Alaqad was just over a year out of university with a journalism degree when she found herself in the middle of a war zone. She donned a blue press helmet and vest to interview families in refugee camps and hospitals, posting the videos to Instagram.
“I can’t just look at what’s happening without doing anything,” she told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday in Beirut.
From Gaza City where she lived, Alaqad was among a handful of young journalists and media workers sharing what they saw on social media, with outside journalists unable to access the Palestinian enclave. She now has over 4.5 million followers on Instagram.
Alaqad landed in Lebanon last month to pursue a master’s degree in media studies at the American University of Beirut after being awarded a scholarship named after iconic Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh who was killed in 2022 while reporting on an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank.
Today she spends her days on the tranquil tree-lined AUB campus or in the cafes of Beirut’s Hamra Street, but her mind remains in Gaza.
“You’re a journalist and a Palestinian human witnessing it,” Alaqad told the AP, sitting in the patio of one of those cafes, wearing a black and white traditional keffiyeh scarf. Balancing those two roles “was the difficult part,” she said.

She had already lived through three wars in Gaza by the time she graduated university, but the war that began on Oct. 7 was on a different scale.
The Israeli aerial bombardment and ground offensive triggered by the deadly Hamas-led attack on southern Israel - which killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage - has killed over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry. The war has caused vast destruction across the territory, with entire neighborhoods wiped out and critical infrastructure heavily damaged.
“It used to break my heart seeing kids standing in lines for hours just to buy bread or to fill tanks with water,” Alaqad said. “Instead of those kids being at a school, they’re standing in line to do these chores.”
By covering the impact of the humanitarian crisis as a result of Israel’s blockade of Gaza and aid agencies’ struggles to reach the civilian population, she hoped that it would counter what she saw as the “dehumanization” of Palestinians in the wider media and show that they are more than “just numbers.”
“I used to connect with the people, and get to know them on a deeper level so people can remember their names, their smiles, and who they are,” Alaqad said.
Reporting while tending to her own and her family’s well-being and safety was often complicated.
Electricity and telecom cuts at times made charging equipment and uploading material a challenge. Sometimes she would have to put work on hold to secure basic items, including food.
“I would think ‘what a downgrade’ — why am I spending three hours of my day just to search for eggs?” she said.
During almost two months covering the war, Alaqad said she was displaced several times, moving between houses and hospital in Gaza City before heading south to stay with relatives in Khan Younis.
One night, her mother told her that her uncle in Australia had secured them temporary visas to evacuate, and that the family was put on a list to leave through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt in several hours.
Alaqad said she was reluctant to leave, but felt that continuing to cover the war would be an eventual death sentence, and so she left for Australia in late November.
The United Nations and human rights organizations have been alarmed by the large number of journalists killed in Gaza since Oct. 7. Committee to Protect Journalists says it has confirmed that least 111 Palestinian journalists and media workers in Gaza have been killed.
In March, three dozen leaders at news organizations around the world, including the AP, signed a letter expressing solidarity with journalists in the tiny enclave, calling for their safety and freedom to report there.
“You either get forcefully displaced out of your country, or eventually you’d get targeted and killed,” Alaqad said. “I felt at one point that we will all stay in Gaza and just get killed and the story will never go out to the world.”
Since she left, more of Gaza has been levelled to the ground in Israeli military operations. The vast majority of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced and no longer have access to the Rafah crossing. Large-scale polio vaccinations began Sunday in response to an outbreak of the rare disease as humanitarian organizations warn that lack of aid and worsening living conditions pose major public health risks.
Efforts for a cease-fire and the release of Israeli hostages mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States remain unsuccessful.
Alaqad said witnessing the destruction of schools and universities in Gaza has given even more importance to her in furthering her education. She hopes to return to report on Gaza’s reconstruction once a cease-fire agreement is reached and on the Palestinians’ ongoing advocacy for self-determination.
“You can leave Gaza, but I don’t think Gaza can ever leave you,” she said."
HW5GY5QOVG_1ORMQZFJE1ZP312,FACT FOCUS: Posts falsely claim video shows Harris promising to censor X and owner Elon Musk,By MELISSA GOLDIN,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-elon-musk-x-twitter-rfk-c7d6ca7cda02e29cb6acc5ad25d3d6dc,"After a nationwide suspension of billionaire Elon Musk’s X platform in Brazil, social media users — including former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — are misrepresenting a years-old video of Vice President Kamala Harris to falsely claim that the Democratic presidential nominee has threatened to censor both X and Musk.
Here’s a closer look at the facts.
CLAIM: A video clip portrays Harris as saying that she will shut down X if she wins the 2024 presidential election and that Musk has “lost his privileges.”
THE FACTS: That’s false. Harris was referring to Trump long before Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it as X.
The clip is from 2019 and shows Harris speaking with CNN host Jake Tapper after a Democratic primary debate, discussing whether then-President Donald Trump’s profile should be removed from the platform, called Twitter at the time, and how there needs to be increased accountability for social media companies.
Kennedy, who on Aug. 23 suspended his presidential bid and endorsed Trump, used the clip in an X post as alleged proof that Harris was talking about Musk, stating: “Can someone please explain to her that freedom of speech is a RIGHT, not a ‘privilege’?” He also provided his own interpretation of Harris’ comments on social media sites in general as follows: “If they don’t police content to conform to government-approved narratives, they will be shut down.”
The post had been liked and shared approximately 200,300 times as of Tuesday.

Another popular X post that shared the video simply reads: “Kamala will shut down X if she wins.” It has been liked and shared approximately 105,000 times. Other social media users claimed that Harris was speaking in support of a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who made the decision last week to block X.
In extended footage of the interview, part of CNN’s post-debate analysis on Oct. 15, 2019, Tapper asked Harris: “So, one of the topics that you chose to talk a lot about, especially confronting Sen. Warren on, was your push, your call, for Twitter to suspend the account of President Trump. Why was that important?”
Tapper was referring to the moment in the debate when Harris criticized then-fellow Democratic candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren for not urging such a suspension. Twitter did eventually ban Trump’s account in January 2021, citing “the risk of further incitement of violence” after the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, with multiple other social media platforms kicking him off around the same time. Musk restored Trump’s account in November 2022 after he bought the platform.
Harris responded during the interview that Trump had “proven himself to be willing to obstruct justice” and that what he says on Twitter “impacts people’s perceptions about what they should and should not do.”
She continued: “And as far as I’m concerned, and I think most people would say, including members of Congress who he has threatened, that he has lost his privileges and it should be taken down.”
Harris did not call for the platform as a whole to be shut down. Rather, she advocated for increased accountability.
“The bottom line is that you can’t say that you have one rule for Facebook and you have a different rule for Twitter,” she stated. “The same rule has to apply, which is that there has to be a responsibility that is placed on these social media sites to understand their power. They are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation, and that has to stop.”
What to know about the 2024 Election
The exchange is reflected in CNN’s transcript of the coverage.
The Harris campaign directed an Associated Press inquiry about the false claims to a Democratic National Committee spokesperson, who declined to comment. Representatives for Trump and Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.
Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered X blocked last Friday for refusing to name a local legal representative, as required by law. His decision was unanimously upheld by a court panel on Monday. X had removed its legal representative from Brazil on the grounds that de Moraes had threatened her with arrest. The platform will stay suspended until it complies with de Moraes’ order and pays outstanding fines.

I8I0L4LDRP_QQN1LG4PAB7X54D,"After the king’s endorsement, Thailand has a new Cabinet but with some familiar faces",By NAPAT KONGSAWAD,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/thailand-cabinet-paetongtarn-shinawatra-pheu-thai-srettha-98b9915f7e3bbd32a3d6ceb90d47abb6,"BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand on Wednesday welcomed a new Cabinet after King Maha Vajiralongkorn approved the appointment of 35 members to serve under Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.
Paetongtarn took office on Aug. 16, after her predecessor, Srettha Thavisin was forced out of office by a court ruling that he had violated an ethics law by appointing a Cabinet member who had served time in prison in connection with a bribery case. She is the daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted by a military coup in 2006 but remains politically influential.
Paetongtarn is leader of the Pheu Thai Party, which took power after last year’s general election. It formed a government after members of the conservative Senate refused to endorse the prime minister nominated by the progressive Move Forward Party, which won the most seats in the poll.
The new Cabinet is substantially the same as Srettha’s, with five of the deputy prime ministers retaining their jobs. Also keeping their jobs are Interior Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira, who are both also deputy prime ministers, as well as Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa.
The new Cabinet’s royal endorsement, published in the government gazette, followed weeks of speculation over its composition after the pro-military Palang Pracharath Party was removed from the ruling coalition that Srettha had formed. The party and its leader, retired General Prawit Wongsuwan, were widely believed to be behind the ethics case brought before the Constitutional Court that cost Srettha his job before he completed a full year in office.

Paetongtarn’s Pheu Thai party invited its long-time rival, the Democrat Party, to join the governing coalition, with party leader Chalermchai Sri-on appointed Minister of Natural Resources, a post previously held by Prawit’s brother.
Pheu Thai’s predecessor, the Thai Rak Thai Party, ended years of Democrat domination of electoral politics in 2001 when its billionaire founder and leader, Thaksin, became prime minister. After Thaksin was ousted in 2006, the Democrats linked up with other conservative forces in Thai society to try to thwart a comeback of his political machine. Thaksin’s ouster triggered years of struggle between his supporters and his opponents, in the streets, in the courts and at the ballot box.
Because Srettha lost his position over an ethics issue involving a Cabinet minister, Paetongtarn’s appointments were vetted to ensure they were free of legal problems.
Srettha’s Deputy Interior Minister Chada Thaised, once accused of ordering two murders in the early 2000s, was replaced by his daughter Sabida, while Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Thammanat Prompao, who was jailed in Australia for heroin trafficking in 1994, also lost his seat.
“There’s a lot of openings in the constitution for all sorts of ethics probes, and the Constitutional Court has great power in interpreting the constitution,” commented Prinya Thaewanarumitkul, a law professor at Thailand’s Thammasat University. Terms used by the court, such as “evidently honest” and “ethical standards,” are entirely subjective, he told The Associated Press.
“It’s all systemic. When you have vengeful people and a court with power to rule over entirely subjective matters, the Pheu Thai party won’t have any problems with the opposition in Parliament. It would have problems with all the people they’ve upset, launching petitions that put them into the courts’ hands,” he said."
IGIT8XIICH_DC26O13F18Y6N0G,Japan and Australia agree to increase joint military training,By ROD McGUIRK,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/australia-japan-china-military-training-incursions-b0ef3f07c4546c17523cd6a7bce11ba8,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Japan and Australia agreed on Thursday to increase joint military training exercises as their government ministers shared concerns over China’s recent incursions into Japanese airspace and territorial waters.
Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa and Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara met for a regular summit with their Australian counterparts, Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Defense Minister Richard Marles in the Australian coastal town of Queenscliff.
They discussed greater security cooperation in the context of the ministers’ shared support for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and concerns over China’s increasingly aggressive territorial claims in the South and East China Seas, Wong said.
The ministers agreed on more engagement in training exercises involving the two air forces after F-35A Lighting II stealth fighters from both countries joined in combat training over Japan last year in Exercise Bushido Guardian, Marles said.
Next year, Australia will participate for the first time in Orient Shield, the largest annual field training exercise between the U.S. Army and Japan Ground Self-Defense Force.
Australia and Japan also plan to involve the Japanese Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, a marine unit of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, in annual training rotations of U.S. Marines in the northern Australian city of Darwin.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Japan and Australia’s cooperation should not disadvantage any third country.
“China believes that defense and security cooperation between countries should be conducive to maintaining regional peace and stability and enhancing mutual trust among regional countries, and should not target third parties,” Mao said at a daily briefing in Beijing.
China’s increasingly assertive activity around Japanese waters and airspace has caused unease among Japanese defense officials, who are also concerned about the growing military cooperation between the Chinese and Russian air forces.
Japan lodged a formal protest through the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo against what it called an incursion by a Chinese survey ship in its waters last weekend.
This followed Tokyo’s protest after a Chinese military aircraft briefly entered Japan’s southwestern airspace on Aug. 26. It was the first time the Japan Self-Defense Forces detected a Chinese military aircraft in Japan’s airspace.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said later his country had “no intention” to violate any country’s airspace.
Kihara confirmed the incidents were discussed with the Australian counterparts.
“We have shared very strong concern over these incidents and, for the East China Sea and South China Sea, any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force or by coercion, we have put forward our strong opposition,” Kihara told reporters through an interpreter.
Marles said he and Wong “did express our support for Japanese sovereignty in that moment.”
“It really underlined our shared commitment to asserting the rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific, in our neighborhood,” Marles said.
“The countries of the region and indeed the world want to be in a world where disputes are resolved not by power and might but by reference to international law,” Marles added."
IGK3K0R9MJ_7BL3GBJDAIF8ASO,Prosecutors probe allegations of fake voter rolls in Switzerland’s vaunted direct democracy,By JAMEY KEATEN,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-electoral-fraud-investigation-bb6691574275801cc7b95d0b5bad06ee,"GENEVA (AP) — Swiss federal prosecutors said Tuesday they have ordered house searches and interrogations as part of an investigation into possible electoral fraud after an advocacy group unearthed thousands of fake signatures on voter rolls.
The allegation that malfeasance that could have skewed results in Swiss elections has jolted Switzerland’s vaunted system of direct democracy, where mail-in balloting is the main way that voters cast ballots and where referendums four times a year give citizens a direct say in policy-making.
Newspapers in Swiss media group Tamedia first reported the criminal complaint filed by the “Service Citoyen” (Citizen Service) group.
The next referendum in Switzerland is scheduled for Sept. 22. Advocacy groups and others that want to float proposals for referendums must collect at least 100,000 signatures from eligible voters to qualify for national votes, and at times turn to outside firms to do so.
The advocacy group’s co-president Noemie Roten commissioned an outside firm last year to collect some 10,000 signatures on voter rolls. She discovered that nearly a third appeared fake, involving bogus addresses, falsified birth dates and repeated signatures.
She issued a 236-page report to the Swiss attorney general’s office, which said in an email to The Associated Press on Tuesday it is investigating the matter.
In a phone interview, Roten said the findings “could indeed jeopardize the confidence that Swiss citizens have in direct democracy.”

The Swiss federal chancellery, which oversees national elections, said it was carrying out increased checks of cantons, or regions, from which it had received evidence of forged signatures. It said it could not make any reliable assessment about how widespread the practice was pending the investigations."
IH608TAUYC_QLYS71DM5ZKVJOL,"California lawmakers pass landmark bills to atone for racism, but hold off on fund to take action",By SOPHIE AUSTIN,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/california-reparations-black-african-american-slavery-62fe50116b04f1d4e4a0bf6a434f87bc,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California lawmakers this week passed some of the nation’s most ambitious legislation aimed at atoning for a legacy of racist policies that drove disparities for Black people, from housing to education to health.
None of the bills would provide widespread direct payments to African Americans. The state Legislature instead approved proposals allowing for the return of land or compensation to families whose property was unjustly seized by the government, and issuing a formal apology for laws and practices that have harmed Black people.
But lawmakers left out two bills that would have created a fund and an agency to carry out the measures, considered key components of the efforts to take action. California Legislative Black Caucus Chair Assemblymember Lori Wilson said Saturday that the Black Caucus pulled the bills, adding the proposals need more work.
“We knew from the very beginning that it was an uphill battle. ... And we also knew from the very beginning that it would be a multiyear effort,” Wilson told reporters.
Sen. Steven Bradford, who authored the measures, said the bills didn’t move forward out of fear Gov. Gavin Newsom would veto them.
“We’re at the finish line, and we, as the Black Caucus, owe it to the descendants of chattel slavery, to Black Californians and Black Americans, to move this legislation forward,” Bradford said, urging his colleague to reconsider Saturday afternoon.

The Democratic governor hasn’t weighed in on most of the bills, but he signed a $297.9 billion budget in June that included up to $12 million for reparations legislation. However the budget did not specify what proposals the money would be used for, and his administration has signaled its opposition to some of them. Newsom has until Sept. 30 to decide whether to sign the bills that passed into law.
Democratic Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer, who is Black, called his bill to issue a formal apology for discrimination “a labor of love.” His uncle was part of a group of African American students who in the 1950s were escorted by federal troops past an angry white mob into Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, three years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that school segregation was unconstitutional. The students became known as the “ Little Rock Nine.”
“I think my grandmother, my grandfather, would be extremely proud for what we are going to do today,” Jones-Sawyer said ahead of the vote on the legislation that was passed. “Because that is why they struggled in 1957, so that I’d be able to — and we’d be able to — move forward our people.”
Newsom approved a law in 2020 creating a first-in-the-nation task force to study reparations proposals. New York state and Illinois have since followed suit with similar legislation. The California group released a final report last year with more than 100 recommendations for lawmakers.
Newsom signed a law last month requiring school districts that receive state funding for a career education program to collect data on the performance of participating students by race and gender. The legislation, part of a reparations package backed by the California Legislative Black Caucus, aims to help address gaps in student outcomes.
The state Senate overwhelmingly approved the bill on the return of land or compensation to families whose property was taken unfairly through racially discriminatory means using eminent domain.
The topic garnered renewed attention in California when Los Angeles-area officials returned a beachfront property in 2022 to a Black couple decades after it was seized from their ancestors.
The Newsom administration’s Department of Finance opposes the bill. The agency says the cost to implement it is unknown but could “range from hundreds of thousands of dollars to low millions of dollars annually, depending on the workload required to accept, review, and investigate applications.”
It’s not immediately clear how the initiative would be enacted even if Newsom signs it into law, after lawmakers dropped the measure to create an agency to implement it. That proposal would have formed a genealogy office to help Black Californians research their family lineage and verify their eligibility for any reparations that become law.
California would accept responsibility and formally apologize for its role in perpetuating segregation, economic disparities and discrimination against Black Americans under another bill the Legislature approved.
The legislation requires the secretary of state to send a final copy of the apology to the state archives, where it could be viewed by the public.
The apology would say that the state “affirms its role in protecting the descendants of enslaved people and all Black Californians as well as their civil, political, and sociocultural rights.”
The two failed proposals would have created an agency to implement reparations programs if they are passed in California.
It could have cost the state between $3 million and $5 million annually to run the reparations agency, according to the California Government Operations Agency.
Another proposal would have established a fund for reparations programs that become law in California. The money would have been used to address state policies that have harmed Californians descended from enslaved Black people or free Black people living in the U.S. before the end of the 19th century.

J9KIBLG2EU_C7CCZMJEI98Q611,Steward CEO says he won’t comply with Senate subpoena on hospital closings,By STEVE LeBLANC,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/steward-health-care-ceo-senate-subpoena-bankruptcy-62bb08339211d57e8c59395d62cb484d,"BOSTON (AP) — Steward Health Care CEO Ralph de la Torre won’t comply with a subpoena to appear before a U.S. Senate committee that is investigating the hospital company’s bankruptcy, his lawyers said Wednesday.
De la Torre needs to remain silent to respect an ongoing hospital reorganization and settlement effort, his lawyers said in a letter to Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. A federal court order prohibits de la Torre from discussing anything during mediation, the lawyers said.
The Dallas-based Steward, which operated about 30 hospitals nationwide, including more than a half-dozen in Massachusetts, declared bankruptcy earlier this year. It has been trying to sell its hospitals in Massachusetts, but received inadequate bids for two of them: Carney Hospital in Boston and Nashoba Valley Medical Center in the town of Ayer, both of which closed last weekend.
A federal bankruptcy court on Wednesday approved the sale of Steward’s other hospitals in Massachusetts.
Lawyers for de la Torre said the U.S. Senate committee is seeking to turn the hearing into “a pseudo-criminal proceeding in which they use the time, not to gather facts, but to convict Dr. de la Torre in the eyes of public opinion.”
“It is not within this Committee’s purview to make predeterminations of alleged criminal misconduct under the auspices of an examination into Steward’s bankruptcy proceedings, and the fact that its Members have already done so smacks of a veiled attempt to sidestep Dr. de la Torre’s constitutional rights,” the letter said.

De la Torre didn’t rule out testifying before the committee at a later date.
Sanders said in a statement that he’ll be working with other members of the panel to determine the best way to press de la Torre for answers.
“Let me be clear: We will not accept this postponement. Congress will hold Dr. de la Torre accountable for his greed and for the damage he has caused to hospitals and patients throughout America,” Sanders said. “This Committee intends to move forward aggressively to compel Dr. de la Torre to testify to the gross mismanagement of Steward Health Care.”
Massachusetts U.S. Sens. Edward Markey and Elizabeth Warren, both Democrats, called de la Torre’s refusal to appear before the committee next Thursday outrageous.
The committee’s options include holding de la Torre in criminal contempt, which could result in a trial and jail time; or civil contempt, which would result in fines until he appears. Both would require a Senate vote.
Markey and Warren said de la Torre owes the public and Congress answers and must be held in contempt if he fails to appear before the committee.
“He got rich as private equity and real estate vultures picked apart, and drove into bankruptcy, hospitals that employed thousands of health care workers who served communities in Massachusetts and across the country,” the two said in a joint statement.
“De la Torre used hospitals as his personal piggy bank and lived in luxury while gutting Steward hospitals,” they added.
De la Torre also refused invitations to testify at a Boston field hearing earlier this year chaired by Markey.
Sanders has said de la Torre became obscenely wealthy by loading up hospitals from Massachusetts to Arizona with billions of dollars in debt and selling the land underneath the hospitals to real estate executives who charged unsustainably high rents."
JCSFU7ALV9_PVNNMFLQNG29RSX,"For many investors and intellectuals leaving China, it’s Japan — not the US — that’s the bigger draw",By YURI KAGEYAMA and DAKE KANG,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/chinese-immigration-japan-opportunity-digital-chinatowns-99898105a2204d22669f6c693c58cbd5,"TOKYO (AP) — One by one, the students, lawyers and others filed into a classroom in a central Tokyo university for a lecture by a Chinese journalist on Taiwan and democracy — taboo topics that can’t be discussed publicly back home in China.
“Taiwan’s modern-day democracy took struggle and bloodshed, there’s no question about that,” said Jia Jia, a columnist and guest lecturer at the University of Tokyo who was briefly detained in China eight years ago on suspicion of penning a call for China’s top leader to resign.
He is one of tens of thousands of intellectuals, investors and other Chinese who have relocated to Japan in recent years, part of a larger exodus of people from China.
Their backgrounds vary widely, and they’re leaving for all sorts of reasons. Some are very poor, others are very rich. Some leave for economic reasons, as opportunities dry up with the end of China’s boom. Some flee for personal reasons, as even limited freedoms are eroded.
——
EDITOR’S NOTE: This story is part of the China’s New Migrants package, a look by The Associated Press at the lives of the latest wave of Chinese emigrants to settle overseas.
——
Chinese migrants are flowing to all corners of the world, from workers seeking to start businesses of their own in Mexico to burned-out students heading to Thailand. Those choosing Japan tend to be well-off or highly educated, drawn to the country’s ease of living, rich culture and immigration policies that favor highly skilled professionals, with less of the sharp anti-immigrant backlash sometimes seen in Western countries.

Jia initially intended to move to the U.S., not Japan. But after experiencing the coronavirus outbreak in China, he was anxious to leave and his American visa application was stuck in processing. So he chose Japan instead.
“In the United States, illegal immigration is particularly controversial. When I went to Japan, I was a little surprised. I found that their immigration policy is actually more relaxed than I thought,” Jia told The Associated Press. “I found that Japan is better than the U.S.”
It’s tough to enter the U.S. these days. Tens of thousands of Chinese were arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border over the past year, and Chinese students have been grilled at customs as trade frictions fan suspicions of possible industrial espionage. Some U.S. states passed legislation that restricts Chinese citizens from owning property.
“The U.S. is shutting out those Chinese that are friendliest to them, that most share its values,” said Li Jinxing, a Christian human rights lawyer who moved to Japan in 2022.
Li sees parallels to about a century ago, when Chinese intellectuals such as Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of modern China, moved to Japan to study how the country modernized so quickly.
“On one hand, we hope to find inspiration and direction in history,” Li said of himself and like-minded Chinese in Japan. “On the other hand, we also want to observe what a democratic country with rule of law is like. We’re studying Japan. How does its economy work, its government work?”
Over the past decade, Tokyo has softened its once-rigid stance against immigration, driven by low birthrates and an aging population. Foreigners now make up about 2% of its population of 125 million. That’s expected to jump to 12% by 2070, according to the Tokyo-based National Institute of Population and Social Security Research.
Chinese are the most numerous newcomers, at 822,000 last year among more than 3 million foreigners living in Japan, according to government data. That’s up from 762,000 a year ago and 649,000 a decade ago.

In 2022, the lockdowns under China’s “zero COVID” policies led many of the country’s youth or most affluent citizens to hit the exits. There’s even a buzzword for that: “runxue,” using the English word “run” to evoke “running away” to places seen as safer and more prosperous.
For intellectuals like Li and Jia, Japan offers greater freedoms than under Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s increasingly repressive rule. But for others, such as wealthy investors and business people, Japan offers something else: property protections.
A report by investment migration firm Henley & Partners says nearly 14,000 millionaires left China last year, the most of any country in the world, with Japan a popular destination. A major driver is worries about the security of their wealth in China or Hong Kong, said Q. Edward Wang, a professor of Asian studies at Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey.
“Protection of private property, which is the cornerstone of a capitalist society, that piece is missing in China,” Wang said.
The weakening yen makes buying property and other local assets in Japan a bargain.
And while the Japanese economy has stagnated, China’s once-sizzling economy is also in a rut, with the property sector in crisis and stock prices stuck at the level they were in the late 2000s.

“If you are just going to Japan to preserve your money,” Wang said, “then definitely you will enjoy your time in Japan.”
Dot.com entrepreneurs are among those leaving China after Communist Party crackdowns on the technology industry, including billionaire Jack Ma, a founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, who took a professorship at Tokyo College, part of the prestigious University of Tokyo.
So many wealthy Chinese have bought apartments in Tokyo’s luxury high-rises that some areas have been dubbed “Chinatowns,” or “Digital Chinatowns” — a nod to the many owners’ work in high-tech industries.
“Life in Japan is good,” said Guo Yu, an engineer who retired early after working at ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.
Guo doesn’t concern himself with politics. He’s keen on Japan’s powdery snow in the winter and is a “superfan” of its beautiful hot springs. He owns homes in Tokyo, as well as near a ski resort and a hot spring. He owns several cars, including a Porsche, a Mercedes, a Tesla and a Toyota.

Guo keeps busy with a new social media startup in Tokyo and a travel agency specializing in “onsen,” Japan’s hot springs. Most of his employees are Chinese, he said.
Like Guo, many Chinese moving to Japan are wealthy and educated. That’s for good reason: Japan remains unwelcoming to refugees and many other types of foreigners. The government has been strategic about who it allows to stay, generally focusing on people to fill labor shortages for factories, construction and elder care.
“It is crucial that Japan becomes an attractive country for foreign talent so they will choose to work here,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said earlier this year, announcing efforts to relax Japan’s stringent immigration restrictions.
That kind of opportunity is exactly what Chinese ballet dancer Du Hai said he has found. Leading a class of a dozen Japanese students in a suburban Tokyo studio one recent weekend, Du demonstrated positions and spins to the women dressed in leotards and toe shoes.

Du was drawn to Japan’s huge ballet scene, filled with professional troupes and talented dancers, he said, but worried about warnings he got about unfriendly Japanese.
That turned out to be false, he said with a laugh. Now, Du is considering getting Japanese citizenship.
“Of course, I enjoy living in Japan very much now,” he said.

JM4RR4Z39X_7BUN0H3DTR5P5V5,Mexico finds the devil is in the details with laws against gender-based attacks on women politicians,_,_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-women-politicians-genderbased-violence-xochitl-galvez-3f99bc7c9ee2a6552d248a93eb9b1c2e,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — In a U.S. electoral campaign punctuated by jibes about “childless cat ladies,” some might wish there were rules against mocking candidates based on their gender. Mexico — which just elected its first female president — has such a law but, surprise, it’s not that easy.
The debate centers around a hard-fought race between two female candidates for a Mexico City borough presidency. An electoral court overturned an opposition candidate’s victory, ruling that she had committed “gender-based political violence” against the losing, ruling-party candidate.
Outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador suggested Monday the ruling could create a dangerous precedent, even though the losing candidate belonged to his own Morena party.
“We should be careful about this,” López Obrador said. “When insults, real or imagined, can be cause, or could be a cause, for overturning or nullifying a victory, that is something else altogether.”
The dispute arose after opposition candidate Alessandra Rojo won a narrow victory over Morena’s Caty Monreal in the race for the borough that includes downtown Mexico City. During the campaign, Rojo brought up the fact that Monreal’s father, Ricardo Monreal, is a leading Morena party politician, suggesting she may have been the candidate because of her dad’s influence.
The court ruled last week that the comment violated a Mexican electoral law that prohibits “slandering, insulting or seeking to disqualify a female candidate based on gender stereotypes,” in this case, beliefs that women succeed in politics based on their husbands’ or fathers’ political power.

It brings up obvious comparisons to U.S. politics, and the digs by Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential candidate, about “childless cat ladies” with allegedly no stake in America’s future. It is unclear whether that could be perceived as a dig at Vice President Kamala Harris.
But critics say the fact that Caty Monreal had little political experience, or that her father appears to treat politics as a family business (his brother now holds the Zacatecas state governorship that Ricardo Monreal once held) could be legitimate points to make.
It also brought up uncomfortable aspects of limits on free speech, or how one female can be accused of committing gender violence against another.
Rojo has vowed to appeal the ruling, saying she is fighting “so that never again can the struggle and fight against gender-based political violence be used as a weapon against the very thing they are trying to protect, the rights of all women who participate” in politics.
Caty Monreal wrote in her social media accounts that “saying that I’m a puppet ... violence cannot be disguised as freedom of expression.”
Julia Zulver, a Mexico-based expert on gender violence for the Swedish Defence University, said a much-needed law may have become politicized, noting exclusion and repression of women is “a vast and serious problem in Mexico, and should be taken seriously.” ‎
“The way gendered violence is being spoken about and politically mobilized here is a little concerning,” Zulver said. “It dilutes the power of a law to protect against a real problem.”
It’s not that the Mexican law doesn’t have its place or use.
Mexico has long been plagued by “machismo” and violence against women, which can range from comments on the street to, in its most extreme form, acid attacks and brutal slayings of women. Critics say dismissive speech about female candidates perpetuates harmful narratives that can turn deadly in real life.
López Obrador was himself accused of gender-based political violence during the run-up to this year’s presidential campaign by opposition candidate Xóchitl Gálvez, after the president claimed she had been chosen by a group of conservative men who propped her up.
In that case, an electoral court ruled that López Obrador had in fact violated the law, but said he couldn’t be punished for it because the rules prevent courts from sanctioning the president. Another female candidate, former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, of López Obrador’s Morena party, went on to win the June 2 elections by a large margin and will take office on Oct. 1."

(AP) — Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Virginia’s long history, has officially set her sights on the state’s top political office.
The Virginia Department of Elections on Wednesday accepted the necessary documents for Earle-Sears to run for governor next year, WRIC was first to report.
Earle-Sears is the first Republican to officially enter the race for the party’s nomination in 2025. She recently said she was exploring a run.
The current governor, Republican Glenn Youngkin, cannot run for reelection because Virginia is the only state that doesn’t allow governors to run for consecutive terms.
U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger is the only Democrat currently seeking her party’s nomination to run for governor.
Earle-Sears was part of a Republican sweep of top offices in 2021 that also saw Youngkin and Attorney Gen. Jason Miyares get elected.
A Marine veteran who immigrated to the United States from Jamaica as a child, Earle-Sears defeated Democrat Hala Ayala to become only the second woman in Virginia’s long history to serve in a statewide office. Attorney Gen. Mary Sue Terry, who was elected in 1985, was the first.
A staunch conservative who speaks frequently about her Christian faith, Earle-Sears has made history as a woman in politics before.
She got her start in elected office in 2001 when she stunned both parties by defeating a 10-term Democrat in an overwhelmingly blue district to become the first Black Republican woman elected to the House of Delegates.

She served just one term before deciding not to seek reelection. She also unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott in a race The Associated Press described at the time as “a campaign of raw invective.”
Earle-Sears went on to serve on the State Board of Education and more recently as the national chair of an organization dedicated to reelecting former President Donald Trump. She has also led a men’s prison ministry, served as director of a women’s homeless shelter, and run a plumbing and electrical supply company."

He was 33.
Quan, whose legal name is Dequantes Devontay Lamar, died at an Atlanta hospital, the Fulton County Medical Examiner confirmed to The Associated Press. The medical examiner was informed of his death Thursday, said Jimmy Sadler, senior medical examiner investigator. The cause of death was not immediately available, with an autopsy scheduled for Friday.
Quan was one of the biggest names in hip-hop in the mid-2010s. He released a slew of mixtapes before he broke through in 2013 with the infectious “Type of Way.” The song became such a success that several other rappers jumped on the remix, including Jeezy and Meek Mill. He maintained his momentum, appearing on a YG track with Jeezy and releasing the London on da Track-produced song “Lifestyle” through his Rich Gang rap collective that included Young Thug and Birdman.
From AP’s archives: Rich Homie Quan spoke with AP in 2022 about his 2013-2016 run of hip-hop hitmaking that included “Type of Way,” “Flex (Ohh, Ohh, Ohh),” “Walk Thru” and “Lifestyle.” The Atlanta rapper has died at 33.
Quan followed up with “Flex (Ooh, Ooh, Ooh),” a song produced by DJ Spinz and Nitti Beatz. It became his highest charting solo single at No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. He also featured on Lil Dicky’s viral “$ave Dat Money.”
In 2018, Quan debuted his first and only studio album “Rich as in Spirit,” which mostly went without any features — except for “Think About It,” a single with Rick Ross.

Quavo, Lil Boosie and Playboi Carti are some of the music artists who paid tribute to Quan on social media.
“Rest in Peace my brother Rich Homie Quan,” said singer Jacquees, who also called him a “legend” on X. “I love you for Life.”
Quan spoke with The Associated Press in 2022 about returning to music after an abrupt hiatus. At the time, the rapper said he was going through litigation with independent label T.I.G. (Think It’s a Game Record), but was prepared to make a comeback.
During that time, Quan ended up in a feud with his old collaborator Young Thug — who along with rapper Gunna — were among a group indicted on charges of conspiracy to violate Georgia’s RICO Act and also accused of participation in a criminal street gang.
Quan said there was no beef between him Young Thug and was open to having a conversation with him if the opportunity presented itself. He said he hated to see Young Thug locked up, adding that rappers were being targeted by law enforcement.
“I wouldn’t say unfairly targeted because at the same time, some of these rappers are putting guns in videos and, you know, it’s like social media — it goes back to the social media thing,” he said.
“I think we showing too much, I think they’re showing too much, you know what I mean. Like that’s the difference in my music, I’ma tell a story but I ain’t going to tell you how I did it,” he added. “It’s still Black art, but we’re definitely being targeted. So that’s why I’m mindful of what I say in my music.”

Many may be political prisoners, activist says",By JON GAMBRELL,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/bahrain-king-hamad-prison-pardon-unrest-ea2774fcd876be5928c7aaa957c0a5b4,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Bahrain’s king pardoned 457 prisoners Wednesday night to mark his 25th anniversary as the island nation’s ruler, with one activist saying many of those freed appeared to be political prisoners.
The announcement by the state-run Bahrain News Agency marks another mass release of prisoners in the Persian Gulf kingdom that has experienced repeated crackdowns on all dissent in the years following its 2011 Arab Spring protests.
There was no list of names of the prisoners released by the order of King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, who has ruled Bahrain first as its emir in 1999 before Bahrain became a kingdom in 2002.
Bahrain’s government did not answer questions from The Associated Press, but said the pardon “further demonstrates Bahrain’s commitment to criminal justice, with an opportunity today for over 450 individuals to positively re-integrate back into society.”
Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, who serves as the director of advocacy for the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, described many as being political prisoners now freed from the Jaw Rehabilitation and Reform Center. The prison has seen demonstrations and hunger strikes by prisoners over conditions there.
“Authorities have been meeting with ... hundreds, saying to them they would be released very soon,” Alwadaei said. “It seems to be targeting mostly political prisoners.”

He added: “This is a really optimistic step and it does seem to be also coming within a regional context where Bahrain is trying to normalize with Iran.”
Bahrain’s Shiite majority long has complained about mistreatment and abuse from the government overseen by the ruling Sunni Al Khalifa family. Addressing activists’ complaints could help Bahrain ease tensions with Iran despite decades of enmity, particularly after Saudi Arabia reached a Chinese-mediate detente with Tehran last year.
In April, King Hamad pardoned 1,584 prisoners, including over 650 considered to be political prisoners by the institute.
Prominent Bahraini activists being held include Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, a dual Danish Bahraini national convicted of internationally criticized terrorism charges and held in what a United Nations panel calls an “arbitrary” imprisonment ever since.
Bahrain, home to the U.S. Navy’s Mideast-based 5th Fleet, is an island off the coast of Saudi Arabia that’s about the size of New York City with a population of around 1.5 million people.
Since Bahrain put down the 2011 protests with the help of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, it has imprisoned activists, deported others, stripped hundreds of their citizenship and closed its leading independent newspaper.
Meanwhile, Bahrain has recognized Israel diplomatically and hosted Pope Francis in November 2022."
K8ILUCQFWU_VKO7VF8NYTA3107,Israel-Hamas war latest: Biden adds to pressure on Netanyahu to reach cease-fire deal,By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-latest-02-september-2024-60f8ead4530f1f3871c345c9ca07938d,"United States President Joe Biden is adding to the pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he isn’t doing enough to reach a cease-fire deal in Gaza.
Israel’s largest trade union, the Histadrut, called for the general strike, the first since the start of the war. It aimed to shut down or disrupt major sectors of the economy, including banking, health care and the country’s main airport. But a court ruled it had to end early after the government called the strike politically motivated.
Hundreds of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets Sunday in grief and anger after six hostages were found dead in Gaza. The families and much of the public blamed Netanyahu, saying they could have been returned alive in a deal with Hamas to end the nearly 11-month-old war.
But others support Netanyahu’s strategy of maintaining military pressure on Hamas, whose Oct. 7 attack into Israel triggered the war. They say it will force the militants to give in to Israeli demands and ultimately annihilate the group.
Here’s the latest:
WASHINGTON — United States President Joe Biden again spoke briefly to reporters, this time as he departed the White House on Monday for a campaign stop with Vice President Kamala Harris in Pittsburgh.
Asked about progress toward a cease-fire, Biden responded, “We’re negotiating.” When asked about the hostages being held by Hamas, he reiterated, “We’re in the middle of negotiations.”

He was also asked about his previous comment from the morning that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn’t doing enough to reach a possible cease-fire agreement but said only, “We’re still in negotiations. Not with him, but with my colleagues from Qatar and from Egypt.”
WASHINGTON — United States President Joe Biden says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not doing enough to reach a deal to free hostages in Gaza along with a cease-fire in its war with Hamas.
Biden spoke to reporters two days after six hostages, including one Israeli-American, were found after being killed by Hamas. Protests rocked Israel on Sunday.
Asked if Netanyahu was doing enough, Biden responded, “No.” Biden was arriving at the White House for a Situation Room meeting with advisers involved in negotiating a hostage deal and cease-fire. The president insisted that negotiators remain “very close” to a deal, adding that “hope springs eternal.”
A rare general strike in Israel is ending after a labor court ruled that it must stop by 2:30 p.m. local time. The court accepted a petition from the government saying it was politically motivated.
The head of Israel’s largest trade union, the Histadrut, says it will abide by the court decision and has instructed members to return to work. Arnon Bar-David had called for the general strike, the first since the start of the war, as Israelis shared grief and anger over the discovery of six dead hostages in Gaza.
The strike aimed to shut down or disrupt major sectors of the economy, including banking and health care. Municipalities in Israel’s populated central area including Tel Aviv participated, but others including Jerusalem did not, reflecting deep political divisions.
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A suspected attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted a ship in the Red Sea on Monday, authorities said.
Two projectiles hit the vessel, and a third explosion occurred near the ship, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said.
“Damage control is underway,” UKMTO said. “There are no casualties onboard and the vessel is proceeding to its next port of call.”
The Houthis did not immediately claim responsibility for the attack. However, it can take the rebels hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults.
The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a United States-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets.
The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.
DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Palestinian health authorities and United Nations agencies on Sunday began a large-scale campaign of vaccinations against polio in the Gaza Strip, hoping to prevent an outbreak in the territory that has been ravaged by the Israel-Hamas war.
Authorities plan to vaccinate children in central Gaza until Wednesday before moving on to the more devastated northern and southern parts of the strip. The campaign began with a small number of vaccinations on Saturday and aims to reach about 640,000 children.
Gaza’s Health Ministry said more than 72,600 children received vaccines Sunday.
The World Health Organization has said Israel agreed to limited pauses in the fighting to facilitate the campaign. There were initial reports of Israeli strikes in central Gaza early Sunday, but it was not immediately known if anyone was killed or wounded. The pause ended Sunday afternoon, according to a schedule released by Israel.
Israel has said the vaccination program will continue through Sept. 9 and last eight hours a day.
Gaza recently reported its first polio case in 25 years — a 10-month-old boy, now paralyzed in a leg. The World Health Organization says the presence of a paralysis case indicates there could be hundreds more who have been infected but aren’t showing symptoms."

The remarks by Aleksandar Vulin, a former intelligence chief who is under U.S. sanctions, reflect persistent close relations between Belgrade and Moscow despite Serbia’s proclaimed bid to join the European Union.
“It’s a great honor for me to have the privilege to talk to you,” Vulin told Putin. “Please believe me when I say it is a great encouragement for all Serbs, wherever they may live.”
Serbia has refused to join Western sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine though it has condemned Moscow’s aggression. Populist President Aleksandar Vučić has said that imposing the sanctions wasn’t in Serbia’s national interest.
“Serbia is not only a strategic partner of Russia, Serbia is also Russia’s ally,” Vulin said. “This is why pressure on us by the West is huge.”
Vulin’s meeting with Putin in Russia’s far-eastern city of Vladivostok came just days after French President Emmanuel Macron visited Serbia when Belgrade signed an agreement to buy French Rafale fighter jets, a move that was seen as possible a shift away from Moscow. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz earlier also visited Belgrade for the signing of a tentative EU deal with Serbia on raw materials needed in green transition.
The two met in Vladivostok on the sidelines of an economic forum designed to attract foreign investment and showcase Russia to them. Greeting Vulin as the two sat down for talks, Putin expressed hope that Serbia’s deputy prime minister will be able to “take a close look and evaluate the possibilities of cooperation with such a large and promising region” as Russia’s far east.

Vulin told Putin that Serbia’s close ties with Russia will continue in the future.
“Serbia led by Aleksandar Vučić is a Serbia that will never become a member of NATO, which will never impose sanctions against the Russian Federation and which will never allow its territory to be used for any anti-Russian actions,” he said.
“Serbia has not become and will not become part of anti-Russian hysteria,” Vulin said.
The U.S. imposed sanctions on Vulin last July, accusing him of involvement in illegal arms shipments, drug trafficking and misuse of public office and aiding Russia’s influence in the volatile Balkans.
Vulin has received two medals of honor from Russia.
The U.S. sanctions against individuals and companies in the Balkans are designed to counter attempts to undermine peace and stability in the volatile region and Russia’s “malign” influence.
The West has stepped up efforts to lure the troubled region into its fold, fearing that Russia could stir unrest to avert attention from the war in Ukraine. The Balkans went through multiple wars in the 1990s, and tensions still persist."
KTQCIAKYTG_JWSRBS9VAQIGQO7,Netanyahu pushes back against new pressure over Gaza and hostages: ‘No one will preach to me’,By TIA GOLDENBERG,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-09-02-2024-f8a8c85f8947631a7f3039e087dd3904,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday pushed back against a new wave of pressure to reach a cease-fire deal in Gaza after hundreds of thousands of Israelis protested and went on strike and U.S. President Joe Biden said he needed to do more after nearly 11 months of fighting.
In his first public address since Sunday’s mass protests showed many Israelis’ furious response to the discovery of six more dead hostages, Netanyahu said he will continue to insist on a demand that has emerged as a major sticking point in talks — continued Israeli control of the Philadelphi corridor, a narrow band along Gaza’s border with Egypt where Israel contends Hamas smuggles weapons into Gaza. Egypt and Hamas deny it.
Netanyahu called the corridor vital to ensuring Hamas cannot rearm via tunnels. “This is the oxygen of Hamas,” he said.

And he added: “No one is more committed to freeing the hostages than me. ... No one will preach to me on this issue.’
Israelis had poured into the streets late Sunday in grief and anger in what appeared to be the largest protest since the start of the war. The families and much of the public blamed Netanyahu, saying the hostages could have been returned alive in a deal with Hamas. A rare general strike was held across the country on Monday.
Late Monday, several thousand demonstrators gathered outside Netanyahu’s private home in central Jerusalem, chanting, “Deal. Now.” and carrying coffins draped in the Israeli flag. Scuffles broke out when police snatched away the coffins, and several protesters were arrested. Thousands more marched outside Netanyahu’s Likud party in Tel Aviv, according to Israeli media.

But others support Netanyahu’s drive to continue the campaign in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel and has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians in the territory. Netanyahu says the assault will force militants to give in to Israeli demands, potentially facilitate rescue operations and ultimately annihilate the group.
Key ally the United States is showing impatience. Biden spoke to reporters as he arrived at the White House for a Situation Room meeting with the U.S. mediation team in the negotiations. Asked if Netanyahu was doing enough, Biden responded, “No.”
He insisted that negotiators remain “very close” to a deal, adding, “Hope springs eternal.”
Hamas has accused Israel of dragging out months of negotiations by issuing new demands, including for lasting Israeli control over the Philadelphi corridor and a second corridor running across Gaza. Hamas has offered to release all hostages in return for an end to the war, the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners, including high-profile militants — broadly the terms called for under an outline for a deal put forward by Biden in July.
Netanyahu has pledged “total victory” over Hamas and blames it for the failure of the negotiations. On Monday, he said he is ready to carry out the first phase of the cease-fire — a plan that would include the release of some hostages, a partial pullout of Israeli troops and the release of some prisoners held by Israel. But he rejected a full withdrawal from Gaza, saying he saw no other party that could control Gaza’s borders.
Israeli media have reported deep differences between Netanyahu and top security officials, including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who say the time is ripe for a cease-fire.
An official confirmed a shouting match between Gallant and Netanyahu at a security cabinet meeting Thursday, where Netanyahu held a vote in favor of maintaining control over the Philadelphi corridor.
Gallant cast the lone vote against the proposal, saying Netanyahu was favoring border arrangements over the lives of hostages. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door meeting. Gallant on Sunday called on the security cabinet to overturn the decision.
Khalil al-Hayya, the Hamas official leading the negotiations, told the Qatari network Al Jazeera late Sunday that Netanyahu had deemed keeping the Philadelphi corridor “more important” than winning the hostages’ release.
Al-Hayya also said Hamas had offered “great flexibility,” including reducing its demand for 500 Palestinian prisoners to be released in exchange for each captive Israeli soldier to 50, and from 250 Palestinian prisoners or each Israeli civilian hostage to 30. He accused Israel of introducing new conditions including increasing the number of prisoners who would be deported upon release and banning the release of elderly or ill prisoners serving life sentences.
Israel said the six hostages found dead in Gaza were killed by Hamas shortly before Israeli forces arrived in the tunnel where they were held.
Hamas’ armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, appeared to say in a statement Monday that it now had a policy of killing any hostages that Israel tries to rescue. It said that after Israeli troops rescued four hostages in a deadly raid in June, it issued new orders to its fighters guarding hostages on how to deal with them if Israeli troops approach. It said that Netanyahu’s insistence on using military pressure instead of reaching a deal “will mean they (hostages) will return to their families in coffins.”

Three of the slain hostages were reportedly among those who would have been released in the first phase of the cease-fire proposal outlined by Biden in July.
Thousands attended the funeral Monday for one of the six, Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin. He was one of the best-known hostages, with his parents leading a high-profile campaign for the captives’ release, meeting with Biden and Pope Francis and addressing the Democratic National Convention last month.
The general strike, called by Israel’s largest trade union, the Histadrut, ended early after a labor court accepted a petition from the government calling it politically motivated.
It was the first such strike since the start of the war, aiming to shut down or disrupt major sectors of the economy, including banking and health care. Some flights at Israel’s main international airport, Ben-Gurion, either departed early or were slightly delayed.
“There’s no need to punish the whole state of Israel because of what is happening, overall, it is a victory for Hamas,” said one passenger, Amrani Yigal.
But in Jerusalem, resident Avi Lavi said that “I think this is fair, the time has come to stand and to wake up, to do everything for the hostages to come back alive.”
Municipalities in Israel’s populated central area, including Tel Aviv, participated. Others, including Jerusalem, did not.
Some 250 hostages were taken on Oct. 7. More than 100 were freed during a cease-fire in November in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Eight have been rescued by Israeli forces. Israeli troops mistakenly killed three Israelis who escaped captivity in December.
Roughly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.
Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, when they stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7. Israel’s retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not say how many were militants.
The war has displaced the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times, and plunged the besieged territory into a humanitarian catastrophe, including new fears of a polio outbreak.
Meanwhile, Israel continued its six-day raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. AP reporters saw bulldozers tearing up roads. The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israeli forces were blocking their ambulances from reaching the wounded.
Israeli operations continued in the West Bank city of Jenin on Monday, the fifth day of heavy fighting in the Palestinian territory.
Palestinians in a town outside Jenin held a funeral for a 58-year-old man, Ayman Abed, who was arrested the day before and died in Israeli custody. The Israeli military said he died from a “cardiac event,” but did not provide details. Human rights groups have reported abuses of Palestinians detained by Israel, and the military has confirmed the deaths of at least 36 Palestinians in its detention centers since October.
Israel says it has killed 14 militants in Jenin and arrested 25 militants. Palestinian health officials say at least 29 people have been killed, including five children.
Mohannad Hajj Hussein, a Jenin resident, said electricity and water were cut off. “We are ready to live by candlelight and we will feed our children from our bodies and teach them resistance and steadfastness in this land,” he said. “We will rebuild what the occupation destroyed and we will not kneel.”

L0PDAN0TM9_4M6K18YWLNOEB73,Hondurans disillusioned with leader amid scandal and end to US extradition treaty,By MARLON GONZÁLEZ and MEGAN JANETSKY,_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/xiomara-castro-honduras-extradition-corruption-e02908f5610fc9010788de6485c9ce73,"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) — An incriminating admission by the brother-in-law of Honduras’ president just days after the country announced it would end its longstanding extradition treaty with the U.S. is feeding fears among Hondurans that the country’s legacy of corruption is continuing.
President Xiomara Castro had inspired hope when she was elected the Central American nation’s first female leader in 2021 on a promise to “pull Honduras out of the abyss we have been buried in by neoliberalism, a narco-dictator and corruption.”
Despite being married to former President Manuel Zelaya Rosales – ousted in a coup in 2009 – she was a breath of fresh air for many Hondurans after the presidency of Juan Orlando Hernández, who in June was sentenced to 45 years in prison by a U.S. federal court for drug trafficking.
But as gang violence has continued to roil Honduras and several scandals have plagued Castro’s government, frustration has replaced that initial optimism for many Hondurans who now see her as the same brand of corrupt leader that has long ruled their country.
“We thought that corruption would end with Xiomara Castro, because they were supposed to be different from previous governments, but they have turned out to be the same or worse,” said 44-year-old Gabriel Hernández, who works in marketing in the capital, Tegucigalpa.
The latest blow came this weekend, when Castro’s brother-in-law, Carlos Zelaya, part of Libre’s leadership team in the Congress, admitted that he had met with a leader of the drug trafficking organization “Los Cachiros” in 2013.

Zelaya, brother of the former president, revealed the details to the press when he went to the Public Prosecutor’s Office on Saturday to give a statement related to an investigation into his alleged links to drug trafficking.
He said the drug trafficker offered support to Libre’s campaign that year, when Castro made a failed first bid for the presidency. Zelaya explained that at the time, he did not know that people in the meeting were linked with drug trafficking.
“Eleven years ago I was invited to participate in a meeting in which there was a group of businessmen who wanted to make a contribution to the campaign,” Zelaya said as he left the Public Prosecutor’s Office. “I am convinced that that meeting and everything that happened there was recorded. I fell into a trap, I assume my responsibility.”
His admission came just days after Castro’s foreign affairs minister announced Honduras was ending an extradition treaty with the United States following a spat with an American diplomat. The treaty had been in place for over a century and since 2014, 64 Hondurans have been extradited to the U.S., largely on drug trafficking charges. Among those was former president Hernández.
“I don’t think this is a coincidence, I don’t think it’s random ... This is an issue that could be a turning point in Castro’s presidency,” Breda said. “Unless Castro steps back and reestablishes the extradition treaty, this move will inevitably be seen as a way to protect their family.”
Those suspicions were shared by Hondurans like Hernández, the marketing worker, who said that even an “ordinary person like me” knows that it was not a coincidence.
The discontent may be a major political burden for Castro and her Liberty and Refoundation Party (Libre) in the lead up to next year’s elections, said Tiziano Breda, a is a Latin America expert at the conflict analysis organization ACLED. The recent moves by the government “weaken the argument that brought Libre to power, which was basically to kick out the corrupt elite that was in cahoots with drug trafficking organizations,” he said.
The frustrations among Hondurans coincide with sliding approval numbers for the president. Compounding that discontent is also unemployment, economic turmoil and failures to reduce the level of violence.
“It’s common for politicians to play these kinds of games, looking for ways to escape justice, not be accountable to the people, to hide their misdeeds and thus continue their legacy of corruption, which ultimately never ends,” marketer Hernández said.
It’s not the first time Castro has faced criticism for perceived corruption.
Last year, the director of a Honduran anti-corruption organization fled the country with her family over threats she received after publishing a report on nepotism in the Castro administration. The organization had warned of a “concentration of power” from government posts going to the children and other relatives of Castro and her husband, the former president.
Carlos Zelaya’s announcement was followed by another from his son, Honduras Defense Minister José Manuel Zelaya Rosales, who tendered his resignation in an effort to ensure no favoritism would be shown to his father.
On Sunday, Castro announced that Zelaya Rosales, her nephew, would be replaced as defense minister by presidential hopeful Rixi Moncada Godoy.
Moncada Godoy will “raise our flag high and remind us that our true value lies in dignified, strong and determined people who forge their own destinies,” Castro said.

L30IPTNXD6_0EUV3L9CT6M5WW0,Randal Grichuk homers twice as Diamondbacks hold off Giants 8-7,By JANIE McCAULEY,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/diamondbacks-giants-score-8c6da4fb83a56e42aa9d24fa8426b19f,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Randal Grichuk hit a two-run homer in the first and a solo drive in the fifth to move within one of 300 for his career, and the Arizona Diamondbacks held off the San Francisco Giants 8-7 on Tuesday night for their seventh straight road win.
Grichuk had his 12th career multi-homer game and first in nearly two years since connecting twice for Colorado on Sept. 6, 2022, against Milwaukee.
“He’s hot, and when he’s hot he can carry a ballclub,” manager Torey Lovullo said.
Grichuk’s big bat helped Ryne Nelson (10-6) reach double-digit victories for the first time in his career in just the second win in six games overall for Arizona, which holds the second NL wild card spot.
“It was a big win for us to kind of get back on that train we were riding for a little bit,” Nelson said.
Matt Chapman homered in the sixth and Mike Yastrzemski connected to spark a four-run eighth for the Giants on a night they drew a season-low crowd of 23,545 and lost their third straight and fifth in six. San Francisco threatened against Ryan Thompson, who gave up RBI singles to Jerar Encarnacion and Patrick Bailey.
Justin Martinez relieved and surrendered a run-scoring single to Marco Luciano, freshly up from the minors, before retiring Luis Matos on a called third strike. Martinez allowed Yastrzemski’s leadoff single in the ninth then a one-out RBI double to Heliot Ramos before striking out Encarnacion to close it out for his eighth save — with the tying and go-ahead runs aboard.
Corbin Carroll singled to begin the ninth for a career-best 13-game hitting streak then stole second and third before Christian Walker singled him home for a key insurance run.

“It felt great to help the team,” said Walker, who returned from the injured list after he missed more than a month with a strained left oblique muscle. He went 1 for 5 in the cleanup spot, and Walker will be carefully built up to playing regularly again.
“I talk to you guys about momentum and swings all the time and it was clearly in their favor after the eighth inning,” Lovullo said. “I felt like our group knew how important it was to go out there and add on a run or two to stop the momentum and they did a great job.”
Arizona loaded the bases with two outs in the third against rookie lefty Kyle Harrison (7-7), who was replaced following Adrian Del Castillo’s single. Tristan Beck entered and immediately surrendered Kevin Newman’s two-run single.
Josh Bell added an RBI groundout in the initial inning then Geraldo Perdomo made it 4-1 when he singled in a run in the second.
Diamondbacks: Walker played for the first time since July 29 against Washington. ... OF Lourdes Gurriel Jr. went on the 10-day IL with a strained left calf, though Lovullo expects him to return when eligible. Gurriel was hurt trying to beat out a double play Sunday against the Dodgers. ... INF Ketel Marte tested his sprained left ankle with some aggressive baserunning while C Gabriel Moreno (strained adductor in his left leg) still needs some recovery time. ... LHP Jordan Montgomery is listed as day-to-day after he took a comebacker off the lower right leg Monday and exited in the seventh inning.
Giants: Michael Conforto was scratched from the designated hitter spot. He had some discomfort in his left side Sunday then San Francisco had a day off Monday. Conforto still felt something when went in the cage to swing Tuesday and the team decided to be cautious. Manager Bob Melvin expects him to play Wednesday.
The Giants recalled Luciano and OF Luis Matos from Triple-A Sacramento. C/OF Blake Sabol and INF Casey Schmitt were optioned to Sacramento.
RHP Zac Gallen (10-6, 3.87 ERA), 1-1 with a 3.60 ERA and 29 strikeouts over his last four outings at Oracle Park, pitches the middle game of the series for Arizona opposite RHP Hayden Birdsong (3-4, 5.14).

The Democratic vice president and the Republican former president will devote almost all of their remaining time and resources to just seven states. They will spend hundreds of millions of dollars targeting voters who, in many cases, have just begun to pay attention to the election. And their campaigns will try to focus their messages on three familiar issues — the economy, immigration and abortion — even in the midst of heated debates over character, culture and democracy.
The candidates will debate in one week in what will be their first meeting ever. The nation’s premier swing state, Pennsylvania, begins in-person absentee voting the week after. By the end of the month, early voting will be underway in at least four states with a dozen more to follow by mid-October.
In just 63 days, the final votes will be cast to decide which one of them will lead the world’s most powerful nation.
Harris and Trump are neck-and-neck in most national polls conducted since President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign.

Here’s the Latest:
A federal judge on Tuesday rejected Donald Trump’s request to intervene in his New York hush money criminal case, thwarting the former president’s latest bid to overturn his felony conviction and delay his sentencing.

U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein ruled that Trump had not satisfied the burden of proof required for a federal court to take control of the case from the state court where it was tried.
Hellerstein’s ruling came hours after Manhattan prosecutors raised objections to Trump ’s effort to delay post-trial decisions in the case while he sought to have the federal court step in.
The Manhattan district attorney’s office argued in a letter to the judge presiding over the case in state court that he had no legal obligation to hold off on post-trial decisions and wait for Hellerstein to rule.

Vice President Kamala Harris plans to propose on Wednesday a tenfold increase in federal tax incentives for small business startup expenses, from $5,000 to $50,000, hoping to help spur a record 25 million new small business applications over her four-year term should she win the presidency in November.
She’s set to unveil the plan during a campaign stop in the Portsmouth area of New Hampshire — marking a rare deviation from the Midwestern and Sunbelt battlegrounds the Democrat has focused on in her race against former Republican President Donald Trump.
A Harris campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a policy plan that hadn’t been released publicly, said Tuesday the change would cover the $40,000 it costs on average to start a business. The proposal would let new businesses wait to claim that deduction until they first turn a profit, to better maximize its impact lowering their taxes.

What to know about the 2024 Election
The nation’s top election security officials say there’s been no indication of any attempt by foreign adversaries to launch an attack on U.S. election systems, but they remain a “persistent threat.”
Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and her senior adviser Cait Conley told reporters on Tuesday that intense efforts since the 2016 election have boosted security around the nation’s voting systems. They highlighted estimates there will be a paper record of ballots cast for more than 97% of voters this year.
But they spoke about threats to U.S. elections, with adversaries like Russia, Iran and China continuing to show interest in undermining U.S. democracy.
“While our election infrastructure is more secure than ever, today’s threat environment is arguably more complex than ever,” Easterly said. “We can absolutely expect that our foreign adversaries will remain a persistent threat to attempting to undermine American confidence in our democracy and our institutions and to sow partisan discord.”
Easterly notes that since 2023 her agency has conducted over 1,000 physical security assessments, 700 cybersecurity reviews and 400 trainings for state and local election officials.
She says it’s important for the public to remember that “hiccups” are likely to occur during the election, ranging from polling places opening late to possibly a ransomware attack on a local government. And that foreign adversaries are likely to try to exploit any uncertainty during or after the election.
“What is most critical to remember is that when these incidents happen, while they may be disruptive, it does not mean that there has been impact on the security of votes being cast or on the accuracy of votes counted as cast,” Easterly said. “But our foreign adversaries may attempt to mislead Americans into believing otherwise, and we cannot let them.”
Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is spending nearly $25 million to help down-ballot Democrats, in a sign of confidence heading into the final two months before Election Day. A campaign official said it was the largest-ever transfer by a national campaign and the Democratic National Committee to committees focused on electing congressional and state-level Democrats. The official said $10 million will go to each to the Democratic arm aimed at electing members of the House and Senate, $2.5 million will go to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, and $1 million each will flow to the Democratic Attorneys General Association and Democratic Governors Associations. It’s a reflection both of Harris’ strong financial position after a rush of fundraising that followed her replacement of President Joe Biden on the ticket, and an improving political map for Democrats that followed the same.
“The Vice President believes that this race is about mobilizing the entire country, in races at every level, to fight for our freedoms and our economic opportunity,” said Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon. “That’s why the Vice President has made the decision to invest a historic sum into electing Democrats up and down the ballot: because Democrats win when we fight together.”
Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign is releasing a new ad aiming to draw contrast with former President Donald Trump’s economic agenda. The spot highlights some of Harris’ new economic proposals, including federal price gouging legislation and taking on “corporate speculators” in the housing market, while Trump has push for tax cuts for corporations. The ad is part of the campaign’s massive television and digital ad effort running through Election Day."
LBM360XIET_YLLLAMHZE5DUVD9,Prosecutors in Trump election case get judge’s OK to lay out fresh evidence in court filing,"By ERIC TUCKER, ALANNA DURKIN RICHER and MICHAEL KUNZELMAN",_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/trump-justice-department-jan-6-jack-smith-f29a81ddd995b15afe95fcc00e928465,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal election interference case against Donald Trump inched forward Thursday, with a judge permitting prosecutors to file court documents later this month that could detail unflattering allegations about the former president as the Republican nominee enters the final weeks of his White House run.
The order came hours after a court hearing, the first in the case in nearly a year, in which U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan sparred with a Trump lawyer who accused the government of trying to rush ahead with an “illegitimate” indictment in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. Chutkan made clear she would not let the upcoming election affect how she proceeds, turning aside defense efforts to delay the process while also acknowledging that the case is nowhere close to a trial date.
“There’s no rush to judgment here,” Chutkan said.
Prosecutors and defense lawyers are at odds over the next steps in the case after the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of the prosecution by ruling that former presidents are entitled to broad immunity from criminal charges. The dueling proposals and testy courtroom exchanges Thursday reflected the extent to which the justices’ July opinion had upended the path of the case that charges Trump with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election before the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.
By day’s end, she permitted prosecutors to file by Sept. 26 a legal brief that could include fresh details about Trump’s failed efforts to cling to power four years ago. The brief is meant to defend a revised, and stripped-down, Trump indictment that special counsel Jack Smith’s team filed last week to comply with the Supreme Court’s immunity opinion. The filing is expected to include detailed allegations from the investigation, said Thomas Windom, a member of Smith’s team.

Trump lawyer John Lauro objected to the filing of the brief before the defense team has had a chance to seek the indictment’s dismissal — and during the “sensitive time” before the election.
“This process is inherently inherently unfair, particularly during this sensitive time that we’re in,” Lauro said.
That comment drew a rebuke from Chutkan, who said that the timing of the election was “not relevant” to how the case should proceed.
“This court is not concerned with the electoral schedule,” the judge said. At another point, she suggested that the defense was trying to delay the case because of the forthcoming election, cautioning, “That’s not going to be a factor I consider at all.”
Another tense encounter occurred when Lauro told Chutkan that the case concerned momentous issues. “We are talking about the presidency of the United States,” he said. Chutkan shot back: “I’m not talking about the presidency of the United States. I’m talking about a four-count indictment.”
The new indictment filed by Smith’s team last week removed allegations related to Trump’s attempts to use the Justice Department’s law enforcement powers to undo the election results, conduct for which the Supreme Court said he enjoyed immunity. But the Trump team believes the new indictment did not go far enough to comply with the 6-3 ruling, in part because it left intact allegations that Trump badgered his vice president, Mike Pence, to refuse to certify the counting of the electoral votes, Lauro said.
“We may be dealing with an illegitimate indictment from the get-go,” Lauro said.
He told Chutkan that the Supreme Court’s opinion required the outright dismissal of the case, a position the judge made clear she did not accept. She bristled again when he suggested that prosecutors were guilty of a “rush to judgment.”
“This case has been pending for over a year,” Chutkan said, referencing the fact that the matter has been frozen since last December while Trump pursued his immunity appeal. “We’re hardly sprinting to the finish here.”
She added: “We all know — we all know — that whatever my ruling on immunity is, it’s going to be appealed. And the taking of that appeal will again stay this case. So, no one here is under any illusion that we’re sprinting towards any particular trial date.”
The Supreme Court held that former presidents are immune from prosecution for the exercise of their core constitutional functions and are presumptively immune for all other official duties. It now falls to Chutkan to determine which of the acts in the four-count indictment are official or not and which can remain part of the case in light of the opinion.
Neither side envisions a trial happening before Election Day, especially given the amount of work ahead.
Pushing back on the defense’s claims that the special counsel wants to move too quickly, Windom noted that Trump’s lawyers filed a lengthy brief seeking to overturn his New York hush money conviction and dismiss the case less than two weeks after the Supreme Court’s ruling in July.
“The defense can move comprehensively, quickly and well. So can we,” Thomas Windom said.
The hearing ended without the judge issuing an order about future dates in the case.
Trump was not in the courtroom and gave an economic speech in New York, though A not guilty plea was entered on his behalf for the revised indictment. Smith attended the hearing.
Defense lawyers said they intend to file multiple motions to dismiss the case, including one that piggybacks off a Florida judge’s ruling that said Smith’s appointment was unconstitutional.
The case is one of two federal prosecutions against Trump. The other, charging him with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, was dismissed in July by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who said Smith’s appointment as special counsel was unlawful.
Smith’s team has appealed that ruling. Trump’s lawyers say they intend to ask Chutkan to dismiss the election case on the same grounds, though Chutkan noted in court Thursday that she did not find Cannon’s opinion “particularly persuasive.”"
LDH1T9V7C3_983V8QXQD9PEK8V,"Turkey wants to join the BRICS bloc of developing economies, official confirms",_,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/turkey-brics-developing-economies-erdogan-foreign-policy-15a2428e73e804732085f78b9c5c3c50,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A senior official on Tuesday confirmed a report that Turkey wants to join the BRICS bloc of developing economies but stopped short of declaring that the NATO country had formally applied for membership.
The Bloomberg news agency reported Monday that Turkey had officially applied to join BRICS several months ago. Asked about the report, Omer Celik, spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party, said Erdogan has stated “several times” that Turkey aspires to become a member.
“Our request on this issue is clear. This process is ongoing. But there is no concrete development regarding this,” Celik told reporters. “Our president has clearly stated that Turkey wants to take part in all important platforms, including BRICS.”
The BRICS alliance was founded in 2006 by Brazil, Russia, India and China, with South Africa joining in 2010, but has recently undergone a major expansion, and now includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has said it’s considering joining and Azerbaijan has formally applied.
BRICS has a stated aim to amplify the voice of the Global South. Its founding members have called for a fairer world order and the reform of international institutions like the United Nations, the IMF and the World Bank.
Erdogan, who has been in power for more than two decades, has sought to carve a more independent foreign policy for Turkey and to enhance its global influence. The country is also frustrated by the lack of progress in its membership talks with the European Union.

Last week, Erdogan said Turkey should “simultaneously” develop relations with both the East and the West.
“We don’t have to choose between the European Union and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,” Erdogan said in reference to the regional cooperation organization established by China and Russia. “On the contrary we have to develop our relations with both these and other organizations on a win-win basis.”
BRICS is expected to discuss taking in new members in a meeting in Russia next month.
Turkey, which straddles Europe and Asia, joined the NATO military alliance in 1952. It began talks to join the European Union in 2005 but the negotiations have stalled due to concerns over democratic regression under Erdogan’s administration, and ongoing disputes with Cyprus, an EU member, among other challenges.
Earlier this year, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Turkey was “exploring new opportunities for cooperation with several partners in different platforms, such as BRICS.”
On Monday, Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, also said Turkey has expressed its interest in joining BRICS."
LEF0RM58RH_AN01ITHAMVKPK2D,Former cadets accuse the Coast Guard Academy of failing to stop sexual violence,By DAVE COLLINS,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/coast-guard-academy-sexual-assaults-d2a2542182db62db732f6be0743af80f,"Thirteen former cadets at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy accused overseers of the Connecticut school on Thursday of failing to prevent sexual violence on campus and covering it up, in federal complaints seeking $10 million apiece in damages.
The former cadets, who all say they were sexually assaulted at the academy from the 1980s to more recent years, filed Federal Tort Claims Act administrative complaints against the Coast Guard, its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, and its former parent agency, the Department of Transportation.
They allege the Coast Guard’s failure to put adequate policies and practices in place allowed sexual violence to go unchecked at the academy in New London, Connecticut, and that officials covered up the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment at the school.
Coast Guard officials said in a statement that the service had received the complaints, but they were barred by federal law from discussing them. They said the service is “devoting significant resources to improving prevention, victim support, and accountability. ”
“Sexual assault and sexual harassment have no place in our Service,” the statement said. “The Coast Guard is committed to protecting our workforce and ensuring a safe and respectful environment that eliminates sexual assault, sexual harassment, and other harmful behaviors.”
The complaints follow revelations the Coast Guard kept secret a probe, called Operation Fouled Anchor, into sexual assault and harassment on campus. The investigation found that dozens of cases involving cadets from 1990 to 2006 had been mishandled by the school, including the prevention of some perpetrators from being prosecuted.

The revelations, first reported by CNN, sparked calls for major reforms and long-awaited accountability for offenders and those who protected them. There are multiple government and congressional investigations underway looking into the mishandling of serious misbehavior at the school and beyond.
“What happened to these individuals at the academy has really had a lifelong impact,” said Christine Dunn, a lawyer who is representing the former cadets. “Some of them are still suffering from active PTSD. As a result, their careers have been ruined. As a result, marriages have been ruined.”
Coast Guard officials have previously said they’re taking action to change and improve the culture at the academy and in the service in response to the allegations raised in the Operation Fouled Anchor investigation.
Among the former cadets who filed a complaint Thursday is a woman named in the papers as Jane Doe 1, who said she was raped twice at the academy and later gang-raped multiple times while serving on a ship after graduating from the school.
After the first rape on campus, she said she didn’t think she could report it because it would be her word against that of the well-liked senior cadet she said attacked her. She also said she had heard of other female cadets who were not believed when they raised sexual misconduct allegations.
About a year later, she said she did inform a campus official that she was attacked, although she did not provide details or the name of the alleged attacker. The official did not formally report it, she said. Years later, she reported it herself to Coast Guard officials. Disciplinary proceedings were held against the alleged attacker but were dismissed, she said. Officials told her too much time had passed for a successful prosecution, she said.
She said she didn’t feel like she could report the subsequent rapes.
“The culture of silence and victim-blaming perpetuated in the Coast Guard prevented me from immediately reporting what happened to me each time, and caused me to completely lose my physical, emotional, and mental stability,” she said in her complaint.
She said she not only has suffered psychological anguish but physical trauma as well. She said she has suffered chronic pain because of the attacks including a pelvic disorder and migraines and that she had several abdominal surgeries including a hysterectomy because of her injuries.
Another former cadet, named as Jane Doe 2, said she was raped at the academy but did not immediately report it because of how other women were treated when they raised similar allegations. She said that when she did report it to a superior, she was never called to testify as part of any investigation. She also alleged that school officials discouraged her from reporting the rape and said her written statement about the attack had been lost.
She said the mental and physical trauma she suffered affected her career and personal life, including low-rated performance reviews and the end of her first marriage.
“I have chronic insomnia and constantly need to ensure my sleeping and living space is safe and all doors are locked,” she said in her complaint. “I have severe anxiety. I have experienced stress related health problems including low thyroid, infertility, core issues, and a lack of sexual satisfaction. It has harmed my current marriage.”
After the filing of such complaints under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Coast Guard has six months or longer to investigate the allegations. If the service dismisses the complaints, the former cadets could file federal lawsuits, Dunn said.
The former cadets’ lawyers say they expect more victims to come forward because of the complaints filed Thursday.
“Today marks a historic turning point in addressing the epidemic of sexual violence at the Coast Guard Academy,” said J. Ryan Melogy, another lawyer for the former cadets. “For far too long, the Coast Guard has relied on a culture of silence, fear, and retaliation to keep survivors from seeking accountability for the horrific injustices they faced as cadets.”"
LMKQVMEC1B_JGSGTQRWKQJCUHQ,Thousands of Turks protest controversial law to remove stray dogs,_,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/turkey-stray-dogs-shelters-animal-rights-66eff47e6a99f21041589c5786d89bcc,"ISTANBUL (AP) — Thousands of demonstrators gathered in Istanbul on Sunday to protest recent legislation that critics say is leading to the killing of stray dogs across Turkey.
Last month, legislators approved the new law aimed at removing millions of stray dogs from Turkish streets citing safety concerns. Animal-lovers fear it will lead to widespread culling or dogs ending up in disease-ridden and overcrowded shelters.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the law was necessary to deal with the country’s “stray dog problem.”
Sunday’s protesters called for the law to be repealed, brandishing posters reading ‘shelters are death camps’ and ‘withdraw the bloody law.’
“We want this law to be withdrawn immediately,” protester Hasan Kizilyatak, 64, told The Associated Press. “They (stray dogs) are living beings, just like us. We are here because we are against them being annihilated.”
Ayten Arslan, 55, who said she supports Erdogan, also showed up to protest.
“Just like we stood beside our president on July 15 (2016) when there was a coup attempt, we are here for the stray animals,” she told the AP. “I say as an AK Party supporter, this law, is a bloody law.”
The main opposition Republican People’s Party moved to repeal the law in the Constitutional Court less than two weeks after it passed.
The government estimates that around 4 million stray dogs roam Turkey’s streets and rural areas. Although most are harmless, several people, including children, have been attacked.

A report released by the Safe Streets and Defense of the Right to Life Association, an organization campaigning for the removal of all stray dogs from the streets, says that 65 people have died in street dog attacks since 2022.
The new legislation requires municipalities to collect stray dogs and house them in shelters to be vaccinated, neutered and spayed before making them available for adoption. Dogs that are in pain, terminally ill or pose a health risk to humans will be euthanized. The initial draft bill included cats, but that article was changed after a public outcry.
However, many question where cash-strapped municipalities would find the money to build the necessary extra shelters required.
Animal rights activists worry that some municipalities might kill dogs on the pretext that they are ill rather than allocate resources to shelter them.
Videos showing dead cats and dogs buried in ditches have been circulating on social media recently. Animal rights activists say the animals were indiscriminately killed after the passage of the law."
LN183JSDXU_BNJP9P28P8PN7JQ,A Māori king who urged racial unity in New Zealand is laid to rest and a new queen rises,By CHARLOTTE GRAHAM-McLAY and ALAN GIBSON,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/maori-king-queen-zealand-ngawai-tuheitia-funeral-39e90f1feecf70690c01f55ae46c2f46,"NGĀRUAWĀHIA, New Zealand (AP) — They came in the thousands in the freezing dawn, parking cars far away and winding down rural roads on foot, children riding on their shoulders. They arrived in mourning black with crowns of ferns and kawakawa leaves, bone carvings or wedges of deep green pounamu -– New Zealand jade -– resting on their chests.
The mourners came to the North Island town of Ngāruawāhia on Thursday to pay final respects to New Zealand’s Māori king, Tūheitia Pōtatau Te Wherowhero VII, who died six days earlier, and witness the ascension to the throne of his daughter, Ngā wai hono i te po. The new queen, 27, is the second woman to become Māori monarch in a tradition dating back to 1858.
As she was escorted onto Tūrangawaewae marae -– an ancestral meeting place — where her father’s casket lay draped in feathered cloaks, cheers rang out among thousands crowded around TV screens outside and waiting along the wide, flat banks of the Waikato River to glimpse Kīngi Tūheitia’s funeral procession. After her ascension, Ngā wai hono i te po accompanied the late king in a flotilla of traditional canoes along the river as he was guided by Māori warriors to his final resting place.

The events marked the end of a weeklong tangihanga -- funeral rite -– for Kīngi Tūheitia, 69, a leader who had in recent months rallied New Zealand’s Indigenous people to unity in the face of a more racially divisive political culture than before. His daughter’s ascension represents the rise of a new generation of Māori leaders in New Zealand -– one which grew up steeped in a resurging language that had once almost died out.
Kīngi Tūheitia died last Friday after undergoing heart surgery, just days after celebrations marking his 18th anniversary on the throne. He became king after his mother’s death in 2006 and on Thursday was buried alongside her in an unmarked grave on Taupiri Maunga, a mountain of spiritual significance to his iwi, or tribe.

The Kīngitanga, or Māori royalty movement, is not a constitutional monarchy and King Charles III of Britain is New Zealand’s head of state. It has a ceremonial mandate rather than a legal one and was formed in the years after British colonization of New Zealand to unite Māori tribes in resistance to forced sales of Indigenous land and the loss of the Māori language and culture.
Monarchs have traditionally wielded politics lightly and Tūheitia was remembered this week as a quiet and humble man. But in recent months, his voice had become louder.
After a center-right government took power in New Zealand last November and began to enact policies reversing recognition of Māori language, people and customs, Tūheitia took the unusual step in January of calling a national meeting of tribes which was attended by 10,000 people.
“The best protest we can make right now is being Māori. Be who we are. Live our values. Speak our reo,” he told them, using the Māori word for language. “Just be Māori. Be Māori all day, every day. We are here. We are strong.”
Tūheitia urged New Zealanders to embrace the concept of kotahitanga -– unity of purpose -– in a cause that he said had “room for everyone.”
His words were echoed throughout the days of his funeral, including by political leaders whose plans he had rallied to oppose. In a reflection of the place that Māori language and customs have grown to hold in New Zealand’s public life in recent decades, his funeral was attended not only by Māori tribes but by leaders of all political parties, past prime ministers, leaders of Pacific Island nations, diplomats and representatives of the British crown.
Tens of thousands of ordinary people also flocked there. Many spoke to each other in Māori, a language which had steadily waned after colonization until activists in the 1970s provoked its renaissance. Among their initiatives was the establishment of Māori language pre-schools, the first graduates of which are now young adults.
Tūheitia’s daughter was among them; while her father hailed from a generation in which many were discouraged from speaking Māori, she was steeped in it, attending Māori immersion schools. Ngā wai hono i te po holds a degree in Māori customs and is an accomplished performer of kapa haka, an Indigenous performance art.
The late king, a truck driver before he took the throne, was a surprise appointment to the monarchy, which is chosen by a council and is not required to be hereditary. But the new queen was groomed for the role and had accompanied her father in his work during recent years.
Her ascension comes at a fraught political moment. Since 1858, the Kīngitanga has championed Māori sovereignty and the other promises of modern New Zealand’s founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between the Crown and Māori tribes. In the years since, translation issues and attempts to reinterpret the treaty have at times provoked conflict, which has in recent months flared again.
“The treaty provides a foundation for us all to work together. Let’s not change it, that would harm us,” Tūheitia said at the event marking his coronation days before his death. While New Zealand was facing a storm as Māori rights were rolled back, “there’s no need to worry. In this storm, we are stronger together,” he said.
After the new queen was anointed with oils and a service for her father held, mourners flocked behind the hearse as it drove to the banks of the river sacred to his tribe. There, Tūheitia’s casket was accompanied by traditional carved canoes on his journey to the mountain, with mourners, in some places 10 people deep, falling silent and bowing as he passed.

As he was carried to the foot of the mountain under a clear afternoon sky, a roaring haka, or ceremonial chant, rang out from mourners waiting among gravestones dotted up the steep hillside and dozens helped to carry the late king to his burial place at the top.
Many had waited for hours to see the procession pass, including a large number of young families. Commentators said the queen’s ascension represented the culture’s renewal, with the majority of Māori — who account for almost 20% of New Zealand’s population — aged under 40.
Among them on Thursday was Awa Tukiri, 9, whose family had driven nearly two hours from Auckland to watch the canoe carrying the late king pass by.
“It was pretty amazing because all they do on the boat is do haka and waiata on it,” he said, using the words for Māori chants and songs. Tukiri, who attends a kura kaupapa — the immersion schools that are growing in popularity — said the best part of being Māori was “just hanging out and speaking Māori to each other.”

LQS0YTUMVC_WKZUHZ124A3CHR6,Turkey hopes to double its trade with North Macedonia to $2 billion,By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/turkey-north-macedonia-trade-foreign-minister-7e6ed74e0aadd6e709dc331b2f9d37ff,"SKOPJE, North Macedonia (AP) — Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Thursday his country hopes to boost its trade with North Macedonia to $2 billion a year, or roughly double the current volume with the Balkan country.
Fidan said following talks in the North Macedonian capital with North Macedonia’s Foreign Minister Timcho Mutsunski that Ankara wants to establish a “strategic council for cooperation” to handle the boost in trade. Neither minister gave a time-frame.
Turkey currently is North Macedonia’s seventh-largest trade partner,
“We want to raise our economic cooperation to a level that befits our strong political relations. We aim to increase our trade volume with Macedonia to $2 billion,” Fidan said during a joint news conference with Mutsunski. “We talked with our esteemed counterpart about what steps we need to take to achieve this.”
Mutsunski described the visit as “another important moment in our bilateral relations.”
The two ministers also discussed issues related to the Turkish community in North Macedonia, which represents nearly 4% of the country’s 1.8 million population.
The Turkish foreign minister also raised the issue of combatting followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan whose movement Ankara now deems a terrorist organization known as FETO.
Ankara has blamed a failed 2016 coup on Gulen’s followers and has demanded the extradition of anyone it deems a FETO member from several countries, including from North Macedonia. Gulen denies any involvement in the attempted coup.

Turkey believes FETO operates in North Macedonia through educational institutions and commercial companies, and raises the issue in every meeting with officials from the Balkan country.
North Macedonian authorities respond that they are cooperating with the Turkish side and that they are acting in accordance with domestic laws and international agreements. There have been no extraditions so far of any alleged FETO members from North Macedonia to Turkey.
Fidan also planned to meet North Macedonia’s parliament speaker, Afrim Gashi, and Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski.

M7GAGU08JX_H7352LSY7LHBP2R,Yemen’s Houthi rebels target oil tanker in the Red Sea. US says rebels also hit Saudi-flagged tanker,By JON GAMBRELL,_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-red-sea-ship-attacks-ae131e1dc4f24524dc1d7a7ce6edf844,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — An attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels targeted a Panama-flagged oil tanker in the Red Sea on Monday, authorities said, as a nearby Saudi-flagged tanker ship also allegedly came under fire from the group.
The attacks are believed to be the latest in the Iranian-backed rebels’ campaign that has disrupted the $1 trillion in goods that pass through the Red Sea each year over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and has halted some aid shipments to conflict-ravaged Sudan and Yemen.
The new attacks on oil tankers also come amid efforts to salvage the still-burning Sounion oil tanker earlier hit by the Houthis, seeking to head off the potential ecological disaster posed by its cargo of 1 million barrels of crude oil.
In Monday’s first assault, two ballistic missiles hit the oil tanker Blue Lagoon I and a third exploded near the ship, the multination Joint Maritime Information Center overseen by the U.S. Navy said.
“All crew on board are safe (no injury reported),” the center said. “The vessel sustained minimal damage but does not require assistance.”
Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed responsibility for the attack on the Blue Lagoon I late Monday night.
The Blue Lagoon I is traveling south through the Red Sea to an unlisted destination. The vessel was coming from Russia’s port of Ust-Luga on the Baltic Sea and had been broadcasting that it had Russian-origin cargo on board.

In recent months, the Blue Lagoon I traveled to India, which gets more than 40% of its oil imports from Russia despite Moscow’s ongoing war on Ukraine and the international sanctions it faces over it.
The Greek-based firm operating the ship could not be reached. The Joint Maritime Information Center said it assessed that the ship “was targeted due to other vessels within its company structure making recent port calls in Israel.” Saree also cited that as the reason the Houthis attacked the vessel.
Later on Monday morning, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center reported a second attack off the Houthi-controlled port city of Hodeida. The private security firm Ambrey said an aerial drone hit a merchant ship, though no damage or injuries were reported. The attack happened only a few kilometers (miles) from where the Blue Lagoon I attack occurred, Ambrey said.
The U.S. military’s Central Command, which oversees American operations in the Mideast, identified the second vessel as the Saudi-flagged oil tanker Amjad and blamed the attack on the Houthis. The Amjad carried 2 million barrels of oil, it said.
“These reckless acts of terrorism by the Houthis continue to destabilize regional and global commerce, as well as put the lives of civilian mariners and maritime ecosystems at risk,” Central Command said.
The U.S. military also destroyed two Houthi missile systems in strikes on Monday, the command added.
The Houthi group did not immediately claim responsibility for the attack on the Amjad. However, it can take the rebels hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults.
In the case of the Amjad attack, the Houthis likely did not claim it given a yearslong, de facto cease-fire in which the group has not attacked Saudi Arabia as the kingdom tries to reach a peace deal with the rebels. Saudi Arabia also reached a Chinese-mediated detente with Iran, the Houthis’ main benefactor, last year that’s still holding.
Saudi Arabia launched a war against the Houthis in March 2015 in support of Yemen’s exiled government, which earlier had been thrown out of the capital, Sanaa, by the rebels.
Saudi Arabia similarly did not acknowledge the attack on the Amjad, possibly to lower any pressure on it to respond militarily. Yemen’s war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.
The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a United States-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets.
The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.
Meanwhile on Monday, a salvage effort appeared to be underway to tow away the Sounion oil tanker, which was earlier hit by the Houthis and abandoned by its crew. Jamel Amer, an official with the Houthis, wrote online Saturday that tugboats assigned to pull the Sounion away should arrive Sunday.
However, NASA fire satellites showed a blaze at the site where the Sounion had been abandoned on Monday morning. Later photos published by the European Union’s Operation Aspides naval mission in the Red Sea of the Sounion taken on Monday showed no tugboats near the still-burning vessel.
“Private companies are involved in the salvage operation that is about to start,” the operation said. “Upon their request, EUNAVFOR ASPIDES will provide protection to the tugboats, that will deal with the salvage operation and facilitate their efforts to prevent an environmental disaster.”
It added: “Currently, several fires continue to burn on the vessel’s main deck. The vessel remains anchored without drifting, and there are no visible signs of an oil spill.”
The Sounion was carrying about 1 million barrels of oil when the Houthis initially attacked it on Aug. 21 with small arms fire, projectiles and a drone boat. A French destroyer operating as part of Operation Aspides rescued the Sounion’s crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, after they abandoned the vessel and took them to nearby Djibouti.
Last week, the Houthis released footage showing they planted explosives on board the Sounion and ignited them in a propaganda video, something the rebels have done before in their campaign."

MIAPSM09O4_3P7FEGRULTM9TFL,Minnesota man with history of driving drunk charged in patio crash that killed 2 and injured 9,By MICHAEL GOLDBERG,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/who-died-minnesota-restaurant-patio-crash-7c3b9a0df8db274e377cf9dd5e79b38c,"ST. LOUIS PARK, Minn. (AP) — A man with a history of driving under the influence was charged with criminal vehicular homicide Tuesday days after he rammed his car through a Minnesota restaurant’s outdoor patio where a group of medical professionals were celebrating after work, killing two people and injuring nine.
Steven Frane Bailey, 56, faces two counts of criminal vehicular homicide for intoxication and negligence, and nine counts of criminal vehicular injury. The number of charges could rise if investigators identify more victims, Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said at a news conference Tuesday.
A 30-year-old mother of three who worked as a server at the Park Tavern in St. Louis Park and a medical staffer at a nearby hospital who was beloved by his colleagues both died after Bailey said he hit the gas pedal instead of his brakes. Nine others were injured in the deadly crash, which left a Minneapolis suburb in shock that a pleasant evening dining outside could end in tragedy.
“Bailey could have simply decided to stay home or take a Lyft rather than driving while intoxicated,” Moriarty said. “This tragedy killed two people and injured several others, and it was entirely avoidable.”
Moriarty did not know whether Bailey had retained an attorney on Tuesday. Calls to him and a family member, as well as an attorney who represented him in a previous case, were not returned Tuesday.

Surveillance footage captured Bailey pulling into the Park Tavern parking lot, driving past an open parking spot and hitting a parked car when he tried to back into that spot, a criminal complaint said. He then pulled out and accelerated toward the patio, barreling through a metal fence into a crowded area where patrons, restaurant staff and several children were gathered, court records show.
His gray BMW came to an abrupt stop after he hit several rocks on the patio. The server who died, Kristina Folkerts, was pinned under the car until police officers lifted it off her. She died at the scene. Gabe Harvey, who was at the restaurant celebrating with several colleagues from Methodist Hospital, was hit and pronounced dead later at a different medical facility.
Tables, chairs, beer glasses and furniture were strewn about over an artificial grass turf mat at the chaotic scene.
When police officers approached Bailey’s vehicle they heard him talking on the phone, prosecutors said. They reported hearing him say, “I hit the gas instead of the brake and went right through a thing” and “I’m probably going to jail.”
A preliminary breath sample showed a blood alcohol of .325%, which is four times the legal limit, Moriarty said.
Court records show Bailey was convicted of driving while intoxicated twice before, once in 2014 and again in 2015.
Four Methodist Hospital nurses who were with Harvey on Sunday were injured. Two are hospitalized in serious condition, two sustained less serious injuries and another has been released, the facility said in a statement.
The Park Tavern restaurant and nearby Methodist Hospital have supported each other for years as pillars of a Minneapolis suburb. The restaurant sent meals to the hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic as medical workers were overwhelmed. And those same workers would frequent the restaurant after shifts.
Harvey and the group of nurses went to the Park Tavern that night to celebrate with one of their colleagues, who was leaving her role for a new position. Harvey worked as a Health Unit Coordinator at Methodist, and was remembered by colleagues as a dedicated worker and an empathetic person.
Christopher Wendt, a nurse at the hospital, said he spoke to Harvey just hours before his death. Wendt’s mother is paralyzed and currently a patient at the hospital. She was having trouble with the call light that alerts medical staff when she needs assistance. Harvey came into Wendt’s mother’s room with a new call light. That act of service was their last interaction.
“He was such an amazing individual,” Wendt said. “He could not only put a smile on people’s faces, but he always went above and beyond.”
The Park Tavern is a “family-friendly destination” with bowling, arcade games, a restaurant and a bar, according to its website. In a written statement published online, the restaurant said it would partially reopen Wednesday in a special event.
Park Tavern owner Phil Weber told KARE-TV that Kristina Folkerts had a longstanding connection to the restaurant. Before Folkerts’ mother died, she was also a server at the restaurant. She passed when Folkerts was 14, and restaurant employees came to the teenager’s aid and would occasionally babysit her. Folkerts is survived by three young daughters.
Jacque Smith, a spokesperson for St. Louis Park, said that the city would recover.
“We extend our condolences to the family and friends of those who were killed and injured, and to the many people who witnessed this traumatic event,” Smith said in a statement. “We know the St. Louis Park community will support one another in the aftermath of this tragedy.”"
MMUE9AABOO_2JQ26YT8FNDWSB2,Shooter’s sanity at issue as trial begins in Colorado supermarket mass killing,By COLLEEN SLEVIN and MEAD GRUVER,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/colorado-supermarket-shooting-ahmad-alissa-boulder-ca3da921bf27bf81ca257be070e2d754,"BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — A man who gunned down 10 people in a supermarket mass shooting was not insane when he unleashed terror in a Colorado college town but a calculated killer who knew what he did was wrong, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday in an opening statement swiftly disputed by the defense attorney.
Years of legal wrangling over the mental state of Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa during the March 2021 shooting will likely continue through his three-week trial.
Alissa’s attorney argued that his client, who has been diagnosed with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, suffered from hallucinations — hearing screaming voices, seeing people who weren’t there and believing he was being followed — in the runup to the shooting at the King Soopers grocery store in Boulder.
Alissa has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. No one, including Alissa’s lawyers, disputes he was the shooter.
“We’re not running from that. But if you’re going to point the finger at this guy, you deserve to hear the truth about him. This man, Ahmad Alissa, is an ill individual,” said his attorney, Samuel Dunn, in his opening statement.
A prosecutor argued Alissa was able to determine right from wrong and therefore sane.
“The victims were random, but the murders were absolutely deliberate and intentional,” Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty told jurors.
Dressed in a striped white dress shirt, Alissa sat beside his attorneys in court, sometimes swiveling in his chair and turning to look up at a video screen where lawyers presented evidence and bullet points of their arguments.

Relatives of the victims filled rows on the opposite side of court, dabbing their eyes at times and comforting one another.
Alissa is charged with 10 counts of murder, 15 counts of attempted murder and other offenses for the shooting in Boulder, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Denver.
Alissa’s motive, if he had one, has remained unclear and Dougherty did not posit one. He argued Alissa acted with intent and full knowledge of his wrongdoing.
Most of those shot inside and outside the store were killed in just over a minute. Alissa targeted people trying to flee and made a special effort to finish off those he wounded with additional shots, Dougherty pointed out.
“The shooter prepared to kill them, planned to kill them, and went and executed 10 people at King Soopers. That’s why you’re here,” Dougherty told the jury after showing photos of each victim and describing why each was at the store that day.
No one who was shot survived. After shooting eight people, Alissa prowled the store — which had fallen quiet except for background music still playing over the store speakers — then spotted and killed Suzanne Fountain, 59, as she left a hiding spot in another aisle.
His final victim was Boulder Police officer Eric Talley, a father of seven and one of the first three officers who entered the store.
Alissa surrendered to other police who arrived, voluntarily stripping down to his underwear and complying with their instructions as they approached and handcuffed him.
“There’s no hallucinating, there’s no delusion, there’s no confusion,” Dougherty said of Alissa’s behavior.
Alissa’s attorney described a range of hallucinations, delusions and social withdrawal that relatives said Alissa experienced before the shooting and that psychiatrists later verified.
The schizophrenia was so severe it took years for him to engage with therapists and only after he was given a drug, clozapine, which Dunn pointed out is used only when other treatments don’t work.
Before the shooting, Alissa had gone without treatment as a member of a Syrian immigrant family whose father believed possession by an evil spirit, or djinn, was to blame, Dunn said.
“I want you to imagine that between your ears, where you have no shelter or reprieve, you can’t identify the source of it: You just hear yelling and screaming,” Dunn said. “That’s what was being broadcast in Ahmad Alissa’s mind.”
Once, Alissa’s father awoke at 3 a.m. and his son, who was also awake, asked if he had seen a man in the bathroom. The father looked and nobody was there, Dunn said.
“The law says you can have intent and be insane. But what the law doesn’t allow is you to ignore plain, clear evidence someone’s mental illness that is severe and chronic and say that person is sane, that person is capable of telling right from wrong,” Dunn said.
He told jurors to use “common sense, apply the law,” and find Alissa insane.
If successful, Alissa’s plea of not guilty by reason of insanity could enable him to avoid prison and instead be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital.
Prosecution witnesses who testified Thursday included Alison Sheets, an emergency room doctor who heard the gunfire while shopping and hid sideways on a shelf of potato chips. There, she heard more shots and somebody in the next aisle taking their last breath — a sound she recognized from work.
“It was a sigh, almost,” she said. Prosecutors said it was Fountain’s dying breath.
A mental health evaluator testified during a competency hearing in 2022 that Alissa said he bought firearms to carry out a mass shooting and suggested he wanted police to kill him.
Relatives have said he irrationally believed that the FBI was following him and that he would talk to himself as if he were talking to someone who was not there, according to court documents.

MW5XIUPM52_7P9F0RCFNEJZWTX,Takeaways from a report that questions the accuracy of Iran’s ballistic missiles,By JON GAMBRELL,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/iran-ballistic-missiles-israel-retaliation-gaza-war-takeaways-9b577a3c3da0ee970f01b5e4f2aa20dc,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — As Iran threatens to retaliate against Israel over the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, the accuracy of the Islamic Republic’s long-vaunted missile program has been called into question.
A new report by experts shared exclusively with The Associated Press suggests one of the advanced missiles Tehran would use in any future attack against Israel is far less accurate than previously thought.
The finding comes months after a U.S.-led coalition shot down many drones and missiles launched by Iran in an April attack on Israel. Other projectiles apparently failed at launch or crashed while in flight.
Here are some takeaways about Iran’s ballistic missile threat:
Analysts at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies examined the Iranian strike on the Nevatim Air Base some 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Jerusalem in the Negev Desert. They believe Iran used its Emad missile, a variant of the country’s Shahab-3 missile built from a North Korean design.
Assuming Iran targeted Israeli F-35I fighter jet hangars, the James Martin analysts measured the distance between the hangars and the impact zones of the missiles. That gave an average of about 1.2 kilometers (0.75 miles) for the “circular error probable” — a measurement used by experts to determine a weapon’s accuracy based on the radius of a circle that encompasses 50% of where the missiles landed.
That’s far worse than a 500-meter (1,640-foot) error circle first estimated by experts for the Emad. Iran separately advertised the Emad to potential international buyers as having a 50-meter (164-foot) circle.


The U.S., the United Kingdom, France and Jordan all shot down incoming fire. The Americans claimed to have downed 80 bomb-carrying drones and at least six ballistic missiles. Israeli missile defenses were also activated, though their initial claim of intercepting 99% of the projectiles appeared to be an exaggeration.
U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, told the AP they assessed that 50% of the Iranian missiles failed at launch or crashed before reaching their target. That raises further doubts about the abilities of Iran’s missile arsenal.
Iran shares no border with Israel, and the two countries are some 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) apart at the shortest distance. That makes Iran’s missile program vital in any direct military attack. The longer the distances, the greater any slight errors in the missile’s guidance system become, along with the effects of wind and other weather.
Iran could also enlist help from allied militias such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels to overwhelm Israel’s defenses. Israel and Hezbollah exchanged heavy fire on Aug. 25.
However, Iran’s poor performance in April and yearslong sabotage campaigns targeting its ballistic missile program raise questions about whether Tehran would be able to accurately strike targets at that distance.
Meanwhile, Iran continues to make threats about its ability to potentially build a nuclear weapon. Pressure over its inability to deter Israel could see it weaponize a program it has long insisted is peaceful.

MWMBDG0RDG_BHDAZOT42FG4IGY,There’s a Brewer named Brewer. Milwaukee adds OF Brewer Hicklen to its major league roster,_,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/milwaukee-brewers-brewer-hicklen-7e4d5fd20cbb970834a7355c511d6688,"CINCINNATI (AP) — Milwaukee’s newest player was born to be a Brewer.
The Brewers recalled outfielder Brewer Hicklen from Triple-A Nashville before their 4-3, 11-inning loss to the Cincinnati Reds on Sunday. This marks the first time in franchise history that the Brewers’ roster has included a player named Brewer.
The name has some family history. Hicklen told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in spring training that Brewer was his great-great-grandmother’s maiden name.
Hicklen batted fifth and started in right field in his first major league appearance since 2022. He went 0 for 2.
Hicklen played in six games and made four plate appearances in 2022 with the Kansas City Royals, who selected him out of UAB in the seventh round of the 2017 amateur draft.
The Brewers signed Hicklen to a minor league contract in November 2023, and he earned his way back to the big leagues with a productive season in Nashville. Hicklen was batting .247 with a .364 on-base percentage, 21 homers, 68 RBIs and 42 steals in 105 games.

(AP) — More than a month has passed since a Virginia woman disappeared, and authorities say she likely died in a bloody struggle at her Manassas Park home.
Police are still looking for the body of Mamta Bhatt, 28, a mother and pediatric nurse who was last seen in late July, The Washington Post reported. Meanwhile, her husband Naresh Bhatt, 37, is in jail and facing a charge of concealing a body.
The investigation has drawn international attention. It’s also drawing scrutiny from Naresh’s Bhatt’s attorney, who told a judge last week that the felony count against his client “requires that there is a dead body.”
“What they have, to be clear, is blood,” said Shalev Ben-Avraham, the senior assistant public defender representing Naresh Bhatt, the Post reported.
But Prince William County prosecutor Sarah Sami told the judge that the amount of blood found in the home in the northern Virginia suburbs of the nation’s capital indicates “injuries that are not survivable.”
Naresh Bhatt has waived his right to a preliminary hearing and is being held in jail without bail until his next court date, which is in early October.
NBC Washington reported that authorities searched a local park over the weekend as part of the ongoing investigation into the disappearance."
N2FG3G7WXC_V2Z2F49RQE04KX0,House Republicans subpoena Secretary Blinken for testimony on US withdrawal from Afghanistan,By FARNOUSH AMIRI,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/blinken-mccaul-afghanistan-withdrawal-kabul-6651c68dc637111d53f1ec00639c7639,"WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans have issued a subpoena demanding testimony from Secretary of State Antony Blinken as they wrap up a sprawling yearslong investigation into the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.
Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, sent a subpoena letter late Tuesday ordering Blinken to appear before the committee by Sept. 19 or face a contempt of Congress charge.
“You served as the final decision maker for the department on the withdrawal and evacuation,” McCaul wrote.
He added that three years later, Blinken is “in a position to inform the Committee’s consideration of potential legislation aimed at helping prevent the catastrophic mistakes of the withdrawal, including potential reforms to the Department’s legislative authorization.”
Matthew Miller, a State Department spokesman, said Blinken is unable to testify on the dates proposed by the committee as he will be traveling for diplomatic work the majority of September. He claimed the committee denied “reasonable alternatives” to the subpoena date.
“The Secretary has testified before the Congress on Afghanistan more than 14 times — more than any other Cabinet-level official,” Miller said, adding that four of those times were directly before the Foreign Affairs committee at the request of McCaul. “It is disappointing that instead of continuing to engage with the Department in good faith, the Committee instead has issued yet another unnecessary subpoena.”
The subpoena for Blinken’s testimony is the latest in a series of moves by McCaul and other House Republicans over the last 18 months to hold the Biden administration accountable for what they have called a “stunning failure of leadership” after Taliban forces seized the Afghan capital of Kabul, far more rapidly than U.S. intelligence had foreseen as American forces pulled out.

The committee is expected to summarize its work in an investigative report to be released Monday, amid the contentious presidential election where Republican nominee Donald Trump has tried to elevate the withdrawal from Afghanistan as a campaign issue.
While the GOP report is expected to place blame on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now the Democratic nominee for president, independent watchdog reports over the last three years have documented a much more nuanced and bipartisan case for which administration was at fault.
A 2022 report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, concluded it was decisions made by both President Donald Trump and Biden to pull all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan that were key factors in the collapse of that nation’s military.
That report mirrors assertions made by senior Pentagon and military leaders in the aftermath of the withdrawal. Military leaders have made clear that their recommendation was to leave about 2,500 U.S. troops in the country, but that plan was not approved.

N3KLK3BRKW_EXUTA2LAYADSRHB,Indonesia arrests a fugitive former Filipino town mayor wanted for illegal online gaming scams,By JIM GOMEZ and EDNA TARIGAN,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/indonesia-philippines-fugitive-arrest-79b8a2a3d742aef31ab4ffe4c7d84dda,"JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — A dismissed town mayor who fled the Philippines after being accused of helping establish an illegal online gaming and scam center catering mostly to clients in China has been arrested near Indonesia’s capital, officials said Wednesday.
Indonesian authorities arrested Alice Guo at a house in Jakarta’s satellite city of Tangerang just before midnight on Tuesday, according to Khrisna Murti, chief of the international division of the National Police.
Guo was in custody and awaiting deportation to the Philippines, Murti said, adding that her arrest was the result of “cooperation between Indonesian and Filipino’s police.”
Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. thanked the Indonesian authorities.
“Let this serve as a warning to those who attempt to evade justice,” Marcos said and added that arrangements were being made to bring Guo back to the Philippines where she faces a slew of criminal charges.
After Guo fled the Philippines in July, she was tracked in Malaysia and Singapore before turning up in Indonesia. Two companions, who reportedly slipped out of the Philippines with her without going through normal immigration and clearing procedures, were recently arrested in Indonesia.
Guo ran as a Filipino candidate in 2022 elections and won as mayor of the rural town of Bamban in Tarlac province north of Manila. She was accused of helping establish a massive complex with several buildings near the town hall as a hub for an illegal online gambling and scam outfit that catered mostly to clients in China, where gambling is forbidden.

A Senate committee ordered Guo arrested after she refused to appear in hearings looking into the illegal gambling business that flourished under Marcos’s predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who nurtured cozy ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping while often criticizing the United States and European countries.
Guo has also been accused of concealing her Chinese nationality to run for public office, which is reserved for Filipino citizens only. At the time, a few senators suggested she may be working as a Chinese spy.
Guo has denied any wrongdoing but was dismissed from her post for grave misconduct by the Ombudsman, an agency that investigates and prosecutes government officials accused of crimes, including graft and corruption.
In July, Marcos ordered an immediate ban on widespread and mostly Chinese-run online gaming operations, accusing them of involvement in human trafficking, torture, kidnappings and murder.
The crackdown on the Chinese-run online gambling outfits — estimated to number more than 400 across the Philippines and employing tens of thousands of Chinese and Southeast Asian nationals — was backed by Beijing.
It resulted in the shutdown in the Philippines of sprawling complexes, where authorities suspect thousands of Chinese, Vietnamese and other nationals mostly from Southeast Asia have been illegally recruited and forced to work in dismal conditions.
Philippine senators say the massive online gambling industry has flourished largely due to corruption in government regulatory agencies and big payoffs to officials.
Indonesia and the Philippines signed an extradition agreement in 1976.

N76F097M94_CFOEECZXNOWLLZK,A man serving a 20-year sentence in New York gets on the ballot for Alaska’s lone House seat,_,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/alaska-felon-congress-ballot-rankedchoice-voting-605651194fbff79ddfa1d3646d109a0e,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — A man serving time on a 20-year prison sentence for threatening officials in New Jersey has made it onto Alaska’s general election ballot for the state’s lone U.S. House seat this November.
Eric Hafner was convicted in 2022 of threatening to kill judges, police officers and others and sentenced to serve 20 years in federal prison. He originally came in sixth in Alaska’s open primary, which allows only the top four vote-getters to advance to the general election.
But Republican Matthew Salisbury withdrew from the race just ahead of Monday’s deadline, and Republican Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom withdrew last month.
That means Hafner will appear on the November general election ballot along with Alaskan Independence Party chairman John Wayne Howe and frontrunners Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola and Republican Nick Begich.
Peltola finished with the most votes in a field of 12 in the Aug. 20 primary, followed by Begich and Dahlstrom, who was backed by former President Donald Trump. Far behind them were Salisbury and Howe, who combined received just over 1% of the vote and led the remaining candidates. Hafner received just 0.43% of the vote.
There are no state laws prohibiting felons from running for election in Alaska, which means both Hafner and Trump will have a place on the ballot.
But state law does require an elected U.S. representative to reside in the state. Hafner has no apparent ties to Alaska and is serving time at a federal prison in Otisville, New York, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, with a release date set for Oct. 12, 2036. There are no federal prisons in Alaska, so even if the long-shot candidate was elected, he would be unlikely to meet the residency requirement.

This isn’t Hafner’s first attempt to win a congressional seat. He has unsuccessfully ran for office in Hawaii and Oregon, and he’s filed a flurry of failed federal lawsuits in recent years claiming to be a candidate for congressional races in New Mexico, Nevada, Vermont and other states.
This story has been updated to correct that Alaska has an open primary, not a ranked-choice contest."
NB39TLJWOM_6BSDXG9THXDA5YS,Surprise Ukrainian resignations include the nation’s top diplomat,By DEREK GATOPOULOS and VOLODYMYR YURCHUK,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/kuleba-ukraine-russia-war-cabinet-resignations-5c25eff9ca5c7935238fd152afbb2889,"A spate of resignations from Ukraine’s government came with one major surprise: the departure of Dmytro Kuleba, the career diplomat who courted Western support for his country’s defense as its tireless foreign minister.
Ahead of a major overhaul of the government, six Cabinet ministers have resigned, sending handwritten notes to parliament that offered little explanation for their decisions. Kuleba was the last to leave Wednesday, though his exit has not been formally sanctioned by parliament.
The 43-year-old Kuleba became Ukraine’s most recognizable representative abroad – second only to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy – and built close relationships with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and European leaders.
Both before and after the full-scale Russian invasion of early 2022, he argued on multiple trips abroad that the outcome of the conflict was a test of Western resolve to push back autocracy.
“I believe that Kuleba is a good communicator, and it’s bad to lose him as minister, but we do not know what his next position will be,” Olexiy Haran, a professor of political science at Kyiv Mohyla University, told The Associated Press.
Haran said Kuleba’s departure was unlikely to bring any change to Ukrainian foreign policy, given the list of his possible successors.
The son of a diplomat, Kuleba said his attendance as a teenager at an international school in Vienna was a pivotal experience that forged his conviction that Ukraine should be rooted in the West and not in a post-Soviet Russian orbit.

He joined the foreign ministry in 2003 and later worked as a Ukrainian representative with the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. He became known for his analytical delivery and closer to home for his love of cooking and cooking metaphors.
After the invasion, Kuleba represented his country in a business suit, in contrast to the military attire preferred by Zelenskyy and many officials surrounding him.
Kuleba could have fallen out of alignment with powerful officials in Zelenskyy’s office who have direct input in defense and foreign affairs. Haran said Zelenskyy may be keen to use the reshuffle to turn the page and shore up public support as the war with Russia enters a new, uncertain stage.
Ukraine is fighting to defend the incursion into Russia that it launched nearly a month ago and struggling to hold back a punishing advance of enemy troops in the east — all while bracing for the U.S. presidential election in November that could cast doubt over international military assistance.
Publicly, Ukrainian officials have remained tight-lipped about the reshuffle.
At a meeting Wednesday with the visiting Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris, Zelenskyy said his government needed “new energy” in various areas, including diplomacy.
Outwardly, Kuleba gave little indication that anything had changed. He attended scheduled meetings Wednesday and posted a strongly worded condemnation online of Russian airstrikes that killed civilians in Lviv, in western Ukraine.
“Russia understands only one language: the language of strength,” Kuleba wrote at the end of the post. “We must all take decisive action, show leadership, and be brave in order to put a fair end to Russian war and terror.”

O0WYWR9RPX_CZMJJKXF3MLOJ4U,Irish teacher jailed for third time after defying order to stay away from the school that fired him,_,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/ireland-teacher-enoch-burke-contempt-prison-de19764c57fea54da6350066d9ab62d8,"LONDON (AP) — A teacher in Ireland who says he was fired for his views on gender has been jailed for a third time for refusing to stay away from the school where he used to work.
Enoch Burke was found in contempt by a High Court judge on Monday for violating a court injunction barring him from Wilson’s Hospital School in Mullingar, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Dublin.
He was suspended by the school in 2022 after publicly objecting to what he called “transgender ideology” and refusing to address a trans student by their preferred name and pronoun. He was later fired, and has launched an appeal.
He has continued to show up at the school, and has spent more than 400 days in prison after defying a court order to stay away. He was released in June from a stint in Dublin’s Mountjoy Prison and began going to the school again when the term began in late August.
The school took legal action, saying Burke’s presence was disruptive for staff and students.
Ireland’s national police force, An Garda Síochána, said officers “executed a High Court order in Mullingar, Co. Westmeath on Monday afternoon, 2nd September 2024. A man was detained by An Garda Síochána and has now appeared before the High Court.”
Burke, who has become a well-known figure in Ireland, claims he is being silenced for his Christian beliefs.
Courts have rejected that notion. An Irish High Court judge said in September that “it is an insult to every law-abiding citizen for someone who is the subject of a court order to decide, unilaterally, that it should be ignored.”

Lawyers have pointed out that Burke can end the legal drama by agreeing to abide by the injunction, which he has refused to do.
“Unless people obey court orders, we cannot really expect of any kind of social order at all,” Tom O’Malley, a retired law lecturer at University College Galway, told broadcaster RTE.
“There has to be some kind of system whereby people have to be sanctioned or at least coerced or persuaded as much as possible to obey them and unfortunately, beyond imprisonment … there doesn’t appear to be the alternative to it right now.”"
O26ILE2GGB_Y9OF8XJABN0BLO3,Strikes start at top hotel chains as housekeepers seek higher wages and daily room cleaning work,By ALEXANDRA OLSON,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/hotel-workers-union-contracts-housekeeping-2bc35ed24dd424bc66d1afc9b036f92d,"With up to 17 rooms to clean each shift, Fatima Amahmoud’s job at the Moxy hotel in downtown Boston sometimes feels impossible.
There was the time she found three days worth of blond dog fur clinging to the curtains, the bedspread and the carpet. She knew she wouldn’t finish in the 30 minutes she is supposed to spend on each room. The dog owner had declined daily room cleaning, an option that many hotels have encouraged as environmentally friendly but is a way for them to cut labor costs and cope with worker shortages since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unionized housekeepers, however, have waged a fierce fight to restore automatic daily room cleaning at major hotel chains, saying they have been saddled with unmanageable workloads, or in many cases, fewer hours and a decline in income.
The dispute has become emblematic of the frustration over working conditions among hotel workers, who were put out of their jobs for months during pandemic shutdowns and returned to an industry grappling with chronic staffing shortages and evolving travel trends.
Some 10,000 hotel workers represented by the UNITE HERE union walked off the job Sunday at 24 hotels in eight cities, including Honolulu, Boston, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Seattle. Hotel workers in other cities could strike in the coming days, as contract talks stall over demands for higher wages and a reversal of service and staffing cuts. At total of 15,000 workers have voted to authorize strikes.
“We said many times to the manager that it is too much for us,” said Amahmoud, whose hotel was among those where workers have authorized a strike but have not yet walked out.

Michael D’Angelo, Hyatt’s head of labor relations for the Americas, said the company’s hotels have contingency plans to minimize the impact of the strikes. “We are disappointed that UNITE HERE has chosen to strike while Hyatt remains willing to negotiate,” he said.
In a statement before the strikes began, Hilton said it was “committed to negotiating in good faith to reach fair and reasonable agreements.” Marriott and Omni did not return requests for comments.
The labor unrest serves as a reminder of the pandemic’s lingering toll on low-wage women, especially Black and Hispanic women who are overrepresented in front-facing service jobs. Although women have largely returned to the workforce since bearing the brunt of pandemic-era furloughs — or dropping out to take on caregiving responsibilities — that recovery has masked a gap in employment rates between women with college degrees and those without.
The U.S. hotel industry employs about 1.9 million people, some 196,000 fewer workers than in February 2019, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nearly 90% of building housekeepers are women, according to federal statistics.

It’s a workforce that relies overwhelmingly on women of color, many of them immigrants, and which skews older, according to UNITE HERE.
Union President Gwen Mills characterizes the contract negotiations as part of long-standing battle to secure family-sustaining compensation for service workers on par with more traditionally male-dominated industries.
“Hospitality work overall is undervalued, and it’s not a coincidence that it’s disproportionately women and people of color doing the work,” Mills said.
The union hopes to build on its recent success in southern California, where after repeated strikes it won significant wage hikes, increased employer contributions to pensions, and fair workload guarantees in a new contract with 34 hotels. Under the contract, housekeepers at most hotels will earn $35 an hour by July 2027.
The American Hotel And Lodging Association says 80% of its member hotels report staffing shortages, and 50% cite housekeeping as their most critical hiring need.
Kevin Carey, the association’s interim president and CEO, says hotels are doing all they can to attract workers. According to the association’s surveys, 86% of hoteliers have increased wages over the past six months.
“Now is a fantastic time to be a hotel employee,” Carey said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press.
Hotel workers say the reality on the ground is more complicated.
Maria Mata, 61, a housekeeper at the W Hotel in San Francisco, said she earns $2,190 every two weeks if she gets to work full time. But some weeks, she only gets called in one or two days, causing her to max out her credit card to pay for household expenses
“It’s hard to look for a new job at my age. I just have to keep the faith that we will work this out,” Mata said.
Guests at the Hilton Hawaiian Village often tell Nely Reinante they don’t need their rooms cleaned because they don’t want her to work too hard. She said she seizes every opportunity to explain that refusing her services creates more work for housekeepers.
Since the pandemic, UNITE HERE has won back automatic daily room cleans at some hotels in Honolulu and other cities, either through contract negotiations, grievance filings or local government ordinances.
But the issue is back on the table at many hotels where contracts are expiring. Mills said UNITE HERE is striving for language to make it difficult for hotels to quietly encourage guests to opt out of daily housekeeping.
The U.S. hotel industry has rebounded from the pandemic despite average occupancy rates that remain shy of 2019 levels, largely due to higher room rates and record guest spending per room. Average revenue per available room, a key metric, is expected to reach a record high of $101.84 in 2024, according the hotel association.
David Sherwyn, the director of the Cornell University Center for Innovative Hospitality Labor & Employment Relations, said UNITE HERE is a strong union but faces a tough fight over daily room cleaning because hotels consider reducing services part of a long-term budget and staffing strategy.
“The hotels are saying the guests don’t want it, I can’t find the people and it’s a huge expense,” Sherwyn said. “That’s the battle.”
Workers bristle at what they see as moves to squeeze more out of them as they cope with erratic schedules and low pay. While unionized housekeepers tend to make higher wages, pay varies widely between cities.

Chandra Anderson, 53, makes $16.20 an hour as a housekeeper at the Hyatt Regency Baltimore Inner Harbor, where workers have not yet voted to strike. She is hoping for a contract that will raise her hourly pay to $20 but says the company came back with a counteroffer that “felt like a slap in the face.”
Anderson, who has been her household’s sole breadwinner since her husband went on dialysis, said they had to move to a smaller house a year ago in part because she wasn’t able to get enough hours at her job. Things have improved since the hotel reinstated daily room cleaning earlier this year, but she still struggles to afford basics like groceries.
Tracy Lingo, president of UNITE HERE Local 7, said the Baltimore members are seeking pensions for the first time but the biggest priority is bringing hourly wages closer to those in other cities.
“That’s how far behind we are,” Lingo said.

The 33-year-old teacher was inside his sixth-floor classroom at a middle school in the Bronx just before noon when a bullet flew through a window and grazed his right hand, police said. He was taken to a hospital for treatment and released.
There were no students in the building, since classes start Thursday in New York City public schools.
Police said a single bullet was recovered inside the classroom. The unidentified shooter likely fired from an elevated surface, possibly a rooftop, but is not believed to have been aiming for the school, according to Keiyon Ramsey, a deputy police chief in the Bronx.
“This egregious display of violence is both upsetting and reprehensible,” a spokesperson for the city Department of Education said in a statement. “NYPD immediately responded to the scene where one educator sustained non-life-threatening injuries. We will provide additional support to this school community.”"

Abdel-Rahman Milad, who commanded a coast guard unit in the western town of Zawiya and was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council, was shot dead by unknown assailants, the officials said.
The circumstances of his death were not immediately known, and no group claimed responsibility for his killing.
Libyan media outlets reported that he was shot while he was in his vehicle in the Sayyad area, in the western part of Tripoli. Footage circulated online showed a white Toyota Land Cruiser for Milad with bullet marks on its side.
Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity for their safety. There was no comment from the Tripoli-based government of Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah.
Moammar Dhawi, a militia leader in western Libya, mourned Milad’s death. In a statement, posted on Facebook, he called for an investigation to bring the perpetrators to account.
Libya has been plagued by corruption and turmoil since a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. The county has since then split between two administrations, each backed by armed groups and foreign governments.
Amid the chaos, the oil-rich country has emerged as a major conduit for people from Africa and the Middle East fleeing wars and poverty and hoping to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean Sea.

In June 2018, the Security Council imposed sanctions on Milad and five other leaders of criminal networks allegedly engaged in trafficking migrants and others from Libya. At the time, Milad was described as the head of a coast guard unit in Zawiya “that is consistently linked with violence against migrants and other human smugglers” from rival gangs.
U.N. experts monitoring sanctions claimed Milad and other coast guard members “are directly involved in the sinking of migrant boats using firearms.”
Milad had denied any links to human smuggling and said traffickers wear uniforms similar to those of his men. He was jailed for about six months between October 2020 and April 2021 on human trafficking and fuel smuggling charges."
OCU0M3B2U0_GTK2G8L5NAIUR22,EU chief Ursula von der Leyen aims for gender parity in commissioner posts. But it’s raining men,By RAF CASERT,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/european-commission-gender-balance-von-der-leyen-d4f6d7567f7604f3be6fc555cdec9987,"BRUSSELS (AP) — At first glance, the European Union may seem like a paragon of gender equality — what with Ursula von der Leyen heading the all-important executive branch. Still, all the talk this week is about an excess of men poised for top positions at the EU headquarters.
Not that von der Leyen, the first woman to hold the position as European Commission president, would want anything other than full gender parity in the body that runs the day-to-day business of the world’s biggest trading bloc of 450 million people.
“One of its key objectives is achieving gender balance in decision-making,” the strategy of von der Leyen’s outgoing European Commission boldly proclaimed. Her office was “committed to lead by example, with the first female Commission president selected in 2019, and the first gender-balanced College of Commissioners during this time.”
When it comes to gender issues, the 27-nation EU is often seen as perhaps the most progressive grouping of countries in the world, leaving other nations and continents in its wake where the dominance of men in political institutions is still the order of the day.
So it makes it especially galling for von der Leyen, who is setting up the team for her second five-year mandate, that her hands are tied and she can’t independently pick her commissioners. In her first five-year term, there was near gender parity among EU commissioners.

In her offices overlooking the Brussels skyline, she sometimes holds court underneath a massive picture of the founding fathers of the current-day EU meeting in Rome in 1957 — they’re men as far as the camera lens could see.
Until the late 1980s, it remained an exclusive boy’s club before women shattered the institutional ceiling.
But von der Leyen is beholden to the EU’s complicated rules that allow every member nation to put forward a commissioner. And while von der Leyen asked them to field a male and female candidate to make her job picking the right politician for each portfolio easier, all too many member states have flat out ignored her since they have the law, if not politics, on their side.
Often, the pick depends on strictly national politics that gives one party the right one year, and another the right the next time. If not governments, parliaments can also get involved — making life even more difficult. The quality of available people also matters. And nations can also ignore her for whatever whim or reason.
There are member states like Ireland that say they have used their full rights to put the best person forward. In Ireland’s case, a man — namely their finance minister, Michael McGrath.
“We’ve put forward a very high caliber nominee, that’s to me is the most important criterion,” said Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin.
Von der Leyen at first started out with 21 men on the list, which would make for a male dominated European Commission — the extent of which has not been seen in more than two decades — and she has been working to get that figure down.
The EU, on the other hand, will have women as president of the European Parliament — Roberta Metsola of Malta — and as foreign policy chief — Kaja Kallas from Estonia.
“The president has been very clear in what her ambition is, which is a gender balance college,” European Commission spokesperson Arianna Podesta said. “She is doing everything in her powers to have a gender-balanced college for the next mandate. She is, of course, in constant touch with the leaders of all member states.”
And late Monday, she got some good news from the last holdout nation, Belgium. It ditched outgoing Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders, who was bent on returning, and picked Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib to bring the balance to a potential 17-10.
Once von der Leyen completes the mix and match of political group, nation and post, the full list goes to the European Parliament where each prospective commissioner can still be rejected by lawmakers. There is no set date for when a vote will happen, but debate will continue for most of September."

(AP) — A newlywed couple has been charged in the death of a groomsman who was struck by a vehicle on the wedding day, authorities in Michigan said Thursday.
The groom, James Shirah, was at the wheel when the SUV hit Terry Taylor Jr. in Flint on Aug. 30, police said.
“After the wedding (Taylor) was involved in an argument, which led to him being intentionally struck by a large SUV that was traveling at a high rate of speed,” police said.
Shirah, 22, was charged with second-degree murder. The Genesee County public defender office said Thursday that an attorney hadn’t been assigned yet to the case.
Police described Taylor, 29, as a groomsman.
“I’ve never seen anything quite like this,” said David Leyton, who is in his 20th year as county prosecutor. “I’ve seen people running over other people but not so soon after a wedding.”
Leyton, citing the police report, said the wedding was at a pizzeria. The argument occurred at a house where the celebration continued.
Taylor was in the street in front of the house when he was hit by the SUV, Leyton said.
The bride and groom left the scene and didn’t go to police until the next day, he added, making it “more difficult to unravel what happened.”
Shirah was being held in jail without bond. His 21-year-old wife was charged with being an accessory. She posted bond Wednesday."
OPQ5GY4K4F_5V2RSX76HGUKB5S,"GOP network props up liberal third-party candidates in key states, hoping to siphon off Harris votes",By BRIAN SLODYSKO and DAN MERICA,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/cornel-west-jill-stein-republican-network-harris-4089fb0c9ebb16002e56a1c254a21b0e,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Italo Medelius was leading a volunteer drive to put Cornel West on North Carolina’s presidential ballot last spring when he received an unexpected call from a man named Paul who said he wanted to help.
Though Medelius, co-chairman of West’s “Justice for All Party,” welcomed the assistance, the offer would complicate his life, provoking threats and drawing him into a state election board investigation of the motivations, backgrounds and suspect tactics of his new allies.
His is not an isolated case.
Across the country, a network of Republican political operatives, lawyers and their allies is trying to shape November’s election in ways that favor former President Donald Trump. Their goal is to prop up third-party candidates such as West who offer liberal voters an alternative that could siphon away support from Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.
It is not clear who is paying for the effort, but it could be impactful in states that were decided by miniscule margins in the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden.
This is money West’s campaign does not have, and he has encouraged the effort. Last month the academic told The Associated Press that “American politics is highly gangster-like activity” and he “just wanted to get on that ballot.”
Trump has offered praise for West, calling him “one of my favorite candidates.” Another is Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Trump favors both for the same reason. “I like her very much. You know why? She takes 100% from them. He takes 100%.”

Democrats are exploring ways to lift Randall Terry, an anti-abortion presidential candidate for the Constitution Party, believing he could draw voters from Trump.
But the GOP effort appears to be more far-reaching. After years of Trump accusing Democrats of “rigging” elections, it is his allies who are now mounting a sprawling and at times deceptive campaign to tilt the vote in his favor.
“The fact that either of the two major parties would attempt financially and otherwise to support a third-party spoiler candidate as part of its effort to win is an unfortunate byproduct” of current election laws “that facilitate spoilers,” said Edward B. Foley, a law professor who leads Ohio State University’s election law program. “This phenomenon is equally problematic whichever of the two major party engages in it.”
One key figure in the push is Paul Hamrick, the man on the other end of the call with Medelius in North Carolina.
Hamrick serves as counsel for the Virginia-based nonprofit People Over Party, which has pushed to get West on the ballot in Arizona, Maine, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Virginia, as well as North Carolina, records show.
In an interview, Hamrick declined to say who else besides him was orchestrating the effort and he would not divulge who was funding it. He vigorously disputed any suggestion that he was a Republican, but acknowledged that he was not a Democrat, either.
His history is complex.
Hamrick was chief of staff to former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman, a one-term Democrat who was booted from office in 2003 and later was convicted and sentenced to prison on federal bribery, conspiracy and mail fraud charges. Hamrick was charged alongside his former boss in two separate cases. One was dismissed and he was acquitted in the other.
Though he insists he is not a Republican, Hamrick voted in Alabama’s Republican primary in 2002, 2006 and 2010, according to state voting records maintained by the political data firm L2. He was tapped briefly in 2011 to work for the Alabama state Senate’s Republican majority. And since 2015, according to federal campaign finance disclosures, he has contributed only to GOP causes, including $2,500 to the Alabama Republican Party and $3,300 to Georgia Rep. Mike Collins, a Republican who has trafficked in conspiracy theories.
What to know about the 2024 Election
Hamrick denied that he voted in any Republican primaries, suggesting that the voting data was inaccurate.
For years, he was a consultant for Matrix LLC, an Alabama firm known for its hardball approach.
Matrix LLC was part of an effort in Florida to run “ghost candidates” against elected officials who had raised the ire of executives for Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest utility.
Daniella Levine Cava, the current mayor of Miami-Dade County, was a target. As a county commissioner, Levine Cava had fought with FPL. When she ran for reelection in 2018, Matrix covertly financed a third-party candidate they hoped would siphon enough votes to tip her seat to a Republican challenger, The Miami Herald reported in 2022.
Hamrick was deeply involved. A company he created paid the spoiler candidate a $60,000 salary and rented a $2,300-a-month home for him, according to the newspaper and business filings made in Alabama. Hamrick said the candidate worked for him to help recruit business. Hamrick denied having anything to do with the man’s campaign.
Either way, it did not work. Levine Cava was reelected before winning the mayor’s seat in 2020.
Now Hamrick is playing a prominent role to place West’s name on the ballot in competetive states. Hamrick surfaced in Arizona two weeks ago after a woman told the AP that a document was fraudulently submitted in her name to Arizona’s secretary of state in which she purportedly agreed to serve as an elector for West. She said her signature was forged and she never agreed to be an elector.
After the AP published her account, Hamrick said he spoke to the woman’s husband, trying to rectify the situation and “gave some information.” Hamrick declined to say what information was shared. He also tried to persuade another elector who backed out to recommit to West, according to interviews and voicemails.
The next day, with the deadline to qualify for the Arizona ballot just hours away, Brett Johnson, a prominent Republican lawyer, and Amanda Reeve, a former GOP state lawmaker, made house visits to each as they tried to persuade both to sign new paperwork to serve as West electors.
Johnson and Reeve work for Snell & Wilmer, which has done $257,000 worth of business for the Republican National Committee over the past two years, campaign finance disclosures show.
Hamrick declined to comment on the role of Johnson and Reeve. They did not respond to requests for comment.
West did not qualify for the Arizona ballot.
Other Republican-aligned law firms also have been involved in the national push, opposing Democrat-backed challenges to West’s placement on the ballot:
— In Georgia, Bryan Tyson, a partner at the Election Law Group, represented the state Republican Party as it tried to keep West on the ballot. The firm has collected $60,000 in payments from the RNC since April, campaign finance records show. Tyson did not respond to a request for comment.
On Thursday, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger overruled an administrative law judge and placed West, Stein and Party for Socialism and Liberation nominee Claudia De la Cruz on the ballot.
— In North Carolina, Phil Strach, a member of the Republican National Lawyers Association, successfully challenged in court a North Carolina State Board of Elections decision to bar West from the ballot. Strach did not respond to a message left for him.
— In Michigan, John Bursch, a senior lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative legal group that helped overturn Roe v. Wade, fought a challenge to West’s placement on the ballot. Bursch’s firm, Bursch Law PLLC, was paid $25,000 by Trump’s campaign in November 2020 for “RECOUNT: LEGAL CONSULTING,” according to campaign finance disclosures. Bursch did not respond to a request for comment.
— In Pennsylvania, a lawyer with long-standing ties to Republican candidates and causes, unsuccessfully argued in August for West to stay on the ballot. The attorney, Matt Haverstick, declined to say in an interview who hired him or why. People Over Party, the group Hamrick is affiliated with, had tried to get West on the ballot.
None of these actions was funded by West’s campaign, though he and his “Justice for All” party have coordinated at times with Hamrick’s People Over Party, according to legal filings, a news release and social media posts.
In North Carolina, People Over Party, worked with Blitz Canvassing and Campaign & Petition Management — two firms that routinely work for the GOP — to gather signatures for West. Hamrick later responded in writing on behalf of workers for the two companies after the state election board opened its inquiry.
Jefferson Thomas, a longtime Republican operative from Colorado, submitted petition signatures that his firm, The Synapse Group, gathered on behalf of Stein in New Hampshire, records show. He did not respond to requests for comment.
In Wisconsin, Blair Group Consulting oversaw West’s petition signature drive to qualify for the ballot, as previously reported by USA Today. David Blair, the firm’s president, was the national director of Youth for Trump during the 2016 campaign and was a spokesman in the Trump administration. Blair declined to comment.
Mark Jacoby, whose signature gathering firm Let the Voters Decide often works for Republicans, was involved in the failed Arizona push to get West on the ballot. The California operative was convicted in 2009 of voter registration fraud, court records show. Jacoby did not respond to a message left at a phone number listed to him.
Medelius, the North Carolina co-chairman of West’s “Justice for All Party,” said the partisan battles over third-party candidates amounted to a “gang war.”
“If they want to use us for cannon fodder, there’s not much I can do about it,” he said.

ORGZ951B57_1GOUZWDFGTYLF7G,The world is pumping out 57 million tons of plastic pollution a year,By SETH BORENSTEIN,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/plastics-waste-pollution-oceans-global-south-dd9ce2a092c5d5826a3436d9f47764c7,"The world creates 57 million tons of plastic pollution every year and spreads it from the deepest oceans to the highest mountaintop to the inside of people’s bodies, according to a new study that also said more than two-thirds of it comes from the Global South.

It’s enough pollution each year — about 52 million metric tons — to fill New York City’s Central Park with plastic waste as high as the Empire State Building, according to researchers at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. They examined waste produced on the local level at more than 50,000 cities and towns across the world for a study in Wednesday’s journal Nature.

The study examined plastic that goes into the open environment, not plastic that goes into landfills or is properly burned. For 15% of the world’s population, government fails to collect and dispose of waste, the study’s authors said — a big reason Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa produce the most plastic waste. That includes 255 million people in India, the study said.


Lagos, Nigeria, emitted the most plastic pollution of any city, according to study author Costas Velis, a Leeds environmental engineering professor. The other biggest plastic polluting cities are New Delhi; Luanda, Angola; Karachi, Pakistan and Al Qahirah, Egypt.

India leads the world in generating plastic pollution, producing 10.2 million tons a year (9.3 million metric tons), far more than double the next big-polluting nations, Nigeria and Indonesia. China, often villainized for pollution, ranks fourth but is making tremendous strides in reducing waste, Velis said. Other top plastic polluters are Pakistan, Bangladesh, Russia and Brazil. Those eight nations are responsible for more than half of the globe’s plastic pollution, according to the study’s data.

The United States ranks 90th in plastic pollution with more than 52,500 tons (47,600 metric tons) and the United Kingdom ranks 135th with nearly 5,100 tons (4,600 metric tons), according to the study.

In 2022, most of the world’s nations agreed to make the first legally binding treaty on plastics pollution, including in the oceans. Final treaty negotiations take place in South Korea in November.

The study used artificial intelligence to concentrate on plastics that were improperly burned — about 57% of the pollution — or just dumped. In both cases incredibly tiny microplastics, or nanoplastics, are what turn the problem from a visual annoyance at beaches and a marine life problem to a human health threat, Velis said.

Several studies this year have looked at how prevalent microplastics are in our drinking water and in people’s tissue, such as hearts, brains and testicles, with doctors and scientists still not quite sure what it means in terms of human health threats.

“The big time bomb of microplastics are these microplastics released in the Global South mainly,” Velis said. “We already have a huge dispersal problem. They are in the most remote places ... the peaks of Everest, in the Mariana Trench in the ocean, in what we breathe and what we eat and what we drink.”

He called it “everybody’s problem” and one that will haunt future generations.

“We shouldn’t put the blame, any blame, on the Global South,” Velis said. “And we shouldn’t praise ourselves about what we do in the Global North in any way.”

It’s just a lack of resources and ability of government to provide the necessary services to citizens, Velis said.

Outside experts worried that the study’s focus on pollution, rather than overall production, lets the plastics industry off the hook. Making plastics emits large amounts of greenhouse gas that contribute to climate change.

“These guys have defined plastic pollution in a much narrower way, as really just macroplastics that are emitted into the environment after the consumer, and it risks us losing our focus on the upstream and saying, hey now all we need to do is manage the waste better,” said Neil Tangri, senior director of science and policy at GAIA, a global network of advocacy organizations working on zero waste and environmental justice initiatives. “It’s necessary but it’s not the whole story.”

Theresa Karlsson, science and technical advisor to International Pollutants Elimination Network, another coalition of advocacy groups on environment, health and waste issues, called the volume of pollution identified by the study “alarming” and said it shows the amount of plastics being produced today is “unmanageable.”

But she said the study misses the significance of the global trade in plastic waste that has rich countries sending it to poor ones. The study said plastic waste trade is decreasing, with China banning waste imports. But Karlsson said overall waste trade is actually increasing and likely plastics with it. She cited EU waste exports going from 110,000 tons (100,000 metric tons) in 2004 to 1.4 million tons (1.3 million metric tons) in 2021.

Velis said the amount of plastic waste traded is small. Kara Lavender Law, an oceanography professor at the Sea Education Association who wasn’t involved in the study, agreed, based on U.S. plastic waste trends. She said this was otherwise one of the more comprehensive studies on plastic waste.

Officials in the plastics industry praised the study.

“This study underscores that uncollected and unmanaged plastic waste is the largest contributor to plastic pollution and that prioritizing adequate waste management is critical to ending plastic pollution,” Chris Jahn, council secretary of the International Council on Chemical Associations, said in a statement. In treaty negotiations, the industry opposes a cap on plastic production.

The United Nations projects that plastics production is likely to rise from about 440 million tons (400 million metric tons) a year to more than 1,200 million tons (1,100 million metric tons, saying “our planet is choking in plastic.”

OSSWH36C3E_9GY02J23YD1ZKVM,Could mass protests in Israel over the hostages persuade Netanyahu to agree to a cease-fire deal?,By TIA GOLDENBERG,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hostages-netanyahu-gaza-war-d041f4fc2519597a15be95ad837e0df8,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israelis were plunged into grief and anger this weekend after the military said six hostages were killed by their captors in Gaza just as troops were closing in on their location. The rage sparked massive protests and a general strike — the most intense domestic pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since the start of the war nearly 11 months ago.
Many Israelis blame Netanyahu for the mounting number of dead hostages and are calling for a cease-fire agreement to free the remaining roughly 100 captives — even if that means ending the conflict. Sunday’s demonstrations were the largest show of support for a hostage deal since Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel and kidnapped 250 people.
But Netanyahu has faced fierce pressure to reach a cease-fire agreement before, from key governing partners to top security officials and even Israel’s most important international ally, the U.S. Yet a deal to wind down the war in Gaza remains elusive.
Here’s a look at how the public outcry in Israel could affect Netanyahu’s next moves in the war:
Throughout the war, critics have claimed Netanyahu has put his political survival above all else, including the fate of the hostages. His rule relies on support from two ultranationalist parties that were once at the fringes of Israeli politics but now hold key positions in government.

Headed by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, they oppose any deal that ends the war or sets free Palestinian prisoners convicted of killing Israelis. They have vowed to topple the government should Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire — a step that would trigger elections that could remove Netanyahu from office.
“What he cares about is his political survival,” said Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University. “His political survival with Ben-Gvir and Smotrich doesn’t allow him to end the war and bring back the hostages.”
Netanyahu blames Hamas for the lack of a deal.
Looming over the prime minister is also his ongoing trial on corruption charges. If Netanyahu is voted out of power, he will lose his platform to rail against the judicial system, which he accuses of being biased. He also wouldn’t be able to move ahead with his government’s planned changes to the legal system that critics say could affect the trial and help him avoid a conviction.

Netanyahu says he has the country’s best interests in mind and insists that the military operation in Gaza is the best way to bring about the hostages’ freedom. He also wants any deal to keep Israeli troops in two strips of land in Gaza, and reaffirmed his insistence that he will never agree to a withdrawal from one of those areas on Monday.
Hamas has rejected those demands as dealbreakers — and the condition has prompted clashes with Netanyahu’s own defense minister, who says a deal that frees the hostages should be a priority.
As the toll of the war in Gaza has mounted — with tens of thousands killed and whole swaths of the territory decimated — Israel has become increasingly isolated internationally. On Monday, when asked if Netanyahu was doing enough to negotiate a deal, U.S. President Joe Biden responded, “No.”
Biden, who has never seen eye to eye with the Israeli leader even though their nations are close allies, has grown increasingly critical of his counterpart’s leadership. But the timing on Monday’s remark was particularly pointed, coming as it did after the demonstrations and outpouring of grief for the hostages.
Many Israelis accuse Netanyahu of obstructing a deal to stay in power and say that by not ending the war, he is putting the lives of the hostages in danger.
“Hamas was the one that pulled the trigger, but Netanyahu is the one who sentenced (the hostages) to death,” said an editorial Sunday in the liberal daily Haaretz.

Israel has seen weekly protests in solidarity with the hostages since the start of the war. But over time, as Israelis have tried to return to a semblance of normalcy or have been preoccupied by fears of a regional war with Iran or the militant group Hezbollah, the protests have dwindled in size. That has eased pressure on Netanyahu and talks toward a deal have repeatedly fizzled.
But on Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people poured into central Tel Aviv, banging drums and chanting “Deal, now!” About 100 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza, roughly a third of them said to be dead. Israel and Hamas have been mulling a three-phased proposal that would set them free and end the war.
It was the largest demonstration Israel has seen at least since before the war, when Israelis took the streets weekly to protest a plan by Netanyahu to overhaul the judiciary. While the protests coupled with a general strike prompted Netanyahu and his government to walk back or soften some decisions, the overhaul was only put on hold when the war broke out.
The current public outcry has its limits. Sunday’s protest failed to break longstanding political boundaries and appeared to be largely made up of the same liberal, secular Israelis who protested the overhaul and against Netanyahu’s leadership while on trial for alleged corruption. Many of Netanyahu’s supporters say relenting on any position in talks now after the deaths of the six hostages would signal to Hamas that it can reap rewards from such violence.
Similarly, Monday’s strike reflected those same political divisions. Liberal municipalities in central Israel, including Tel Aviv, joined the strike, leading to public daycares and kindergartens closing as well as other services. But other cities, mostly with conservative and religious populations that tend to support Netanyahu, including Jerusalem, did not join the strike. And a labor court cut the strike short by several hours, hobbling its efficacy.
Without large sustained protests across a broader swath of society, it’s hard to see how Netanyahu will feel enough pressure to change his approach, said Hazan, the political scientist. And so long as his government is stable, he may stick to his demands in the negotiations to appease his coalition and ignore the protests entirely.
Still, relatives of the hostages found killed in Gaza expressed hope that the protests marked a turning point in the war that might force progress on a deal.
In a eulogy for Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an Israeli-American who became one of the most high-profile captives, his father spoke of the emotional resonance the deaths might have.
“For 330 days, mama and I sought the proverbial stone that we could turn over to save you,” Jon Polin said. “Maybe, just maybe, your death is the stone, the fuel, that will bring home the remaining” hostages.

P5Y584TOWF_BXK5EZU8BO8CHDA,Brazil Supreme Court panel unanimously upholds judge’s decision to block X nationwide,By DAVID BILLER and GABRIELA SÁ PESSOA,_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/brazil-musk-x-platform-moraes-shutdown-6942614705a4e85064f1d98628b49295,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A Brazilian Supreme Court panel on Monday unanimously upheld the decision of one of its justices to block billionaire Elon Musk’s social media platform X nationwide, according to the court’s website.
The broader support among justices undermines the effort by Musk and his supporters to cast Justice Alexandre de Moraes as an authoritarian renegade who is intent on censoring political speech in Brazil.
The panel that voted in a virtual session was comprised of five of the full bench’s 11 justices, including de Moraes, who last Friday ordered the platform blocked for refusing to name a local legal representative, as required by law. It will stay suspended until it complies with his orders and pays outstanding fines that as of last week exceeded $3 million, according to his decision.
The platform has clashed with de Moraes over its reluctance to block users, and has alleged that de Moraes wants an in-country legal representative so that Brazilian authorities can exert leverage over the company by having someone to arrest.
De Moraes also set a daily fine of 50,000 reais ($8,900) for people or companies using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access X. Some legal experts questioned the grounds for that decision and how it would be enforced, including Brazil’s bar association, which said it would request the Supreme Court review that provision.
But the majority of the panel upheld the VPN fine — with one justice opposing unless users are shown to be using X to commit crimes.

Brazil is one of the biggest markets for X, with tens of millions of users. Its block marked a dramatic escalation in a monthslong feud between Musk and de Moraes over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation.

Over the weekend, many X users in Brazil said they felt disconnected from the world and began migrating en masse to alternative platforms, like Bluesky and Threads.
The suspension has also proceeded to set up a showdown between de Moraes and Musk’s satellite internet provider Starlink, which is refusing to enforce the justice’s decision.
“He violated the constitution of Brazil repeatedly and egregiously, after swearing an oath to protect it,” Musk wrote in the hours before the vote, adding a flurry of insults and accusations in the wake of the panel’s vote. On Sunday, Musk announced the creation of an X account to publish the justice’s sealed decisions that he said would show they violated Brazilian law.
But legal experts have said such claims don’t hold water, noting in particular that de Moraes’ peers have repeatedly endorsed his rulings — as they did on Monday. Although his actions are viewed by experts as legal, they have sparked some debate over whether one man has been afforded too much power, or if his rulings should have more transparency.
De Moraes’ decision to quickly refer his order for panel approval served to obtain “collective, more institutional support that attempts to depersonalize the decision,” Conrado Hübner, a constitutional law expert at the University of Sao Paulo, told The Associated Press.
It is standard for a justice to refer such cases to a five-justice panel, Hübner said. In exceptional cases, the justice also could refer the case to the full bench for review. Had de Moraes done the latter, two justices who have questioned his decisions in the past — and were appointed by former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — would have had the opportunity to object or hinder the vote’s advance.
X’s block already led de Moraes last week to freeze the Brazilian financial assets of Starlink as a means to force it to cover X’s fines, reasoning that the two companies are part of the same economic group. The company says it has more than 250,000 clients in Brazil.
Legal experts have questioned the legal basis of that move, and Starlink’s law firm Veirano has told the AP it has appealed the freeze. It declined to comment further.
In a show of defiance, Starlink informally told the telecommunications regulator Anatel that it will not block X access until its financial accounts are unfrozen, Anatel’s press office said in an email to the AP. Starlink didn’t respond to a request for comment.
“If I’m not mistaken, it was a WhatsApp message that the legal representative of Starlink sent to the president of Anatel, forwarding a message from the company in the United States,” said Arthur Coimbra, a board member of Anatel, on a video call from his office in Brasilia.
That communication doesn’t hold legal value as conclusive evidence of non-compliance but prompted the telecommunications regulator to conduct inspections on Monday.
Coimbra said Anatel would finish an inspection report by the end of the day and then send it to the Supreme Court. He added that the maximum sanction for a telecom company would be revocation of its license. If Starlink loses its license and continues providing service, it would be committing a crime. Anatel could seize equipment from Starlink’s ground stations in Brazil that ensure the quality of its internet service, he said.
The ground stations receive and transmit data between satellites and the Earth. When a user accesses the internet via satellite, the data request is sent to the satellite, which then forwards it to the ground station connected to the global internet network.
That means a shutdown of Starlink is likely, although enforcement will be difficult given the company’s satellites aren’t inside national territory, said Luca Belli, coordinator of the Technology and Society Center at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. It is popular in Brazil’s expansive rural and forested areas.
Anatel’s President Carlos Baigorri told local media GloboNews late Sunday afternoon that he has relayed Starlink’s decision to Justice de Moraes.
“It is highly probable there is a political escalation,” because Starlink is “explicitly refusing to comply with orders, national laws,” said Belli, who is also a professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation’s law school.
The arguments from Musk, a self-proclaimed “free-speech absolutist,” have found fertile ground with Brazil’s political right, who view de Moraes’ actions as political persecution against Bolsonaro’s supporters.
On Brazilian orders, X previously has shut down accounts including of lawmakers affiliated with Bolsonaro’s right-wing party and far-right activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy. X’s lawyers in April sent a document to the Supreme Court, saying that since 2019 it had suspended or blocked 226 users.
Bolsonaro and his allies have cheered on Musk for defying de Moraes. Supporters rallied in April along Rio de Janeiro’s Copacabana beach with a giant sign reading “Brazil Thanks Elon Musk.”
Earlier that month, de Moraes ordered an investigation into Musk over the dissemination of defamatory fake news and another probe over possible obstruction, incitement and criminal organization.
Bolsonaro is also the target of a de Moraes probe over whether the former president had a role in inciting an attempted coup to overturn the results of the 2022 election that he lost.

The crash happened in the southern community of Azua, located west of the capital, Santo Domingo, Juan Salas, the director of civil defense, told The Associated Press.
One of the victims was a police sergeant, said police spokesman Diego Pesqueira.
It wasn’t immediately clear what caused the crash, although authorities are reviewing cameras in the area, Salas said.
Pesqueira said the driver of the truck fled the scene and has not been found. He said police detained a passenger in the truck, which was transporting avocados.
Most of the injured were taken to a nearby hospital, with four of them in critical condition, said Shaira Castillo, spokeswoman for the National Health Service. The injured are women between the ages of 17 and 45 and men from 18 to 55."

(AP) — A former tax assessor and collector in north Mississippi checked into a residential treatment center for a gambling addiction after he called the state auditor’s office and confessed to misusing more than $300,000 in public money, his attorney said Tuesday.
Shannon Wilburn, 49, resigned in April from the elected office he had held in Benton County since 2016, and he began the 12-week addiction treatment in late July, his attorney Tony Farese told The Associated Press.
“I’ve known Shannon all of his life,” Farese said. “We are shocked that he finds himself in this situation.”
Mississippi Auditor Shad White announced Tuesday that Wilburn has been charged with one count of embezzlement. The announcement came days after Wilburn was indicted. Farese said Wilburn turned himself in to the sheriff’s office Friday, then posted bond and returned to the treatment program.
Wilburn is accused of taking $327,055 paid to the Benton County Tax Collector’s office and using the money for personal expenses, Farese said. He said Wilburn confessed to the auditor’s office before hiring legal representation and has continued to cooperate with investigators.
“He apologizes for disappointing the citizens of Benton County and the state of Mississippi,” Farese said.
If convicted, Wilburn would face up to $5,000 in fines and 20 years in prison.
White said Wilburn’s employment as a Benton County elected official was covered by $200,000 in surety bonds to protect taxpayers from losses from corruption. The county also has an insurance policy that covers theft.
“The dedicated team at the State Auditor’s Office will continue to work closely with prosecutors to get record results, one case at a time,” White said in a statement."

Cypriot authorities say 24-year-old Lebanese national needed no medical attention after the Panamanian-flagged vehicles carrier NIVIN plucked him from the sea.
Cmdr. Andreas Charalambides, head of the Cyprus Search and Rescue Coordination Center, told The Associated Press that a helicopter was dispatched 185 kilometers (115 miles) southeast of the island nation shortly after sundown when the NIVIN sent a distress call that one of its crew had fallen overboard.
The helicopter, which was equipped with heat sensors to detect sources at night, couldn’t locate the sailor after combing a 25 square kilometer (10 square mile) area for close to an hour. The helicopter returned to base for refueling, but Cypriot authorities gave the NIVIN the potential location of the sailor using computer models factoring in prevailing currents in the area at the time.
As the ship scoured the area in the dead of night, the crew heard the sailor crying out for help and managed to pick him up.
Charalambides said an investigation into how the man ended up in the water is the responsibility of the nation under which the ship sails."
Q1C13PIX92_2AQL2WMAVNG5UNE,"Gun shops that sold weapons trafficked into Washington, DC, sued by nation’s capital and Maryland",By LINDSAY WHITEHURST,_,20230904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/guns-lawsuit-gun-trafficking-washington-eab845153f48ff94287312ecc4233156,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Three gun shops that sold nearly three dozen firearms to a man who trafficked the weapons in and around Washington, D.C., are facing a new lawsuit jointly filed Tuesday by attorneys general for Maryland and the nation’s capital.
At least nine of those guns have now been found at crime scene and or with people wanted on warrants for violent offenses, D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb said. Many of the others are still unaccounted for.
“Our city is being flooded with illegal weapons,” he said. “All three of these stores ignored the red flags.”
Washington, D.C., has struggled with gun violence in recent years. The nation’s capital saw its highest number of homicides in more than three decades last year, and more than 90% of those were carried out with firearms, the suit states.
“Many of us watch the news and we wonder where all these guns are coming from,” said Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown. “Now we have part of the answer.”
In Washington, the supply of weapons is often fueled by people who buy guns for others who can’t legally possess them, Schwalb said. About 95% of guns recovered in Washington, D.C., which has strict gun laws, originally come from nearby Maryland or Virginia, Schwalb said. While some of those are stolen weapons, more come from illegal straw sales, according to data about firearm trafficking investigations from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
The suit seeks unspecified damages and court action to halt any future straw purchases.

The lawsuit is the first to be filed jointly and comes as cities and states around the country file civil suits against gun shops, including in New Jersey, Minnesota, Chicago and Philadelphia. Kansas City also settled a suit last year against a gun dealer accused of ignoring evidence that guns were being sold illegally.
Licensed firearm dealers do work with ATF to identify possible straw purchases, said Larry Keane, senior vice president at the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry group. Still, he said that warning signs may not always be obvious at busy stores, where a buyer might encounter different employees on different days.
“The focus should be on the actions of the criminal, not trying to scapegoat retailers who do their best every day to try to prevent straw purchasing,” he said, pointing to a 2016 Justice Department survey of people in prison that found a relatively small number had gotten firearms from a retail source.
The new suit, filed with the gun safety group Everytown Law, accuses the Maryland-based stores of failing to respond to warning signs, including bulk purchasing and repetitive purchases.
The three stores sold a total of nearly three dozen similar weapons to Demetrius Minor over a seven-month period in 2021, the suit said. Nearly all were trafficked to others, including people who aren’t legally allowed to buy firearms, the suit alleges. One gun, for example, was found in a D.C. hotel room along with an illegal large-capacity magazine and another was found at the home of a stabbing suspect, the suit says.
Minor pleaded guilty to one count of dealing in firearms without a license last year in a plea deal with prosecutors and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. An attorney who represented Minor could not immediately be reached for comment.
One store, Atlantic Guns, Inc., said it has “never and will never knowingly sell to someone who we have reason to believe is committing a straw purchase.” Another, United Gun Shop, declined immediate comment, and the third, Engage Armament LLC, did not immediately respond.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and court action to halt any future straw purchases."
Q7P9LZ57BD_CMNLVJ0Z4UQRJ5Q,Azerbaijan holds a parliamentary election expected to retain the presidential party’s dominance,By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/azerbaijan-parliament-election-aliyev-2755643bfbf7abac2104f702a9dfded9,"Polls closed Sunday evening in Azerbaijan’s snap parliamentary election, the first since it regained full control of a former breakaway territory in a lightning offensive last year.
Previous elections since independence from the Soviet Union in the 1990s have not been regarded as fully free or fair, and the vote for the Milli Mejlis parliament is not expected to bring significant changes to the body dominated by President Ilham Aliyev ‘s New Azerbaijan party.
Aliyev’s father, Haidar, ruled Azerbaijan from 1993 until he died in 2003, then Ilham took over. Both have ruled with a heavy hand, suppressing dissent as the country of almost 10 million people on the shores of the Caspian Sea basked in growing wealth from its huge oil and natural gas reserves.
The ruling party holds 69 of the 125 seats in the parliament, and most of the rest belong to small pro-government parties or independents. The Musavat party, the major opposition formation, put forward 34 election candidates but only 25 were registered. The Republican Alternative opposition party ran 12 candidates.
Under the constitution, the election should have been held this coming November, but Aliyev moved the date up by two months to avoid clashing with the United Nations climate talks, known as COP29, which will take place in the capital, Baku.
The election comes just short of a year after Azerbaijani forces reclaimed in a military operation the Karabakh region, which since 1994 had been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia, and forced out its self-declared government. Most of the region’s 120,000 Armenian residents fled in the face of the offensive.
Azerbaijan’s national election commission said 50 organizations would conduct observer missions. The largest observer contingent, from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, is scheduled to present its preliminary assessment on Monday."
QIZ4TWM4K8_MCIOK3VJJ0UH0X5,"A day after 12 deaths, other migrants risk their lives trying to cross the English Channel","By MARK CARLSON, NICOLAS GARRIGA and JOHN LEICESTER",_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/migration-france-britain-uk-english-channel-6218132f0ca868f4a12343b047902b85,"WIMEREUX, France (AP) — A day after 12 migrants died when their small inflatable ripped apart on a failed effort to cross the English Channel, several dozen others made another crossing attempt on a crowded vessel from northern France on Wednesday, as French patrol boats watched it labor through the seas.
That migrants were prepared to risk their lives so soon after a dozen others lost theirs trying to cross the busy waterway from France to Britain underscored the magnitude of the problem for the French and U.K. governments. It was the deadliest accident involving a migrant boat in the English Channel this year.
The mayor of Wimereux, a French coastal town where Associated Press journalists filmed the crowded inflatable boat on Wednesday, pleaded for French and British officials to do more to limit the number of migrants attempting the often perilous journey.
“Unfortunately, every day is like this for us. The smugglers — a criminal network — continue with insistence to send people to their deaths in the channel. It really is unacceptable, scandalous. And it is high time that a lasting solution is found with Britain,” Mayor Jean-Luc Dubaële said by phone.
“Let’s ask ourselves the question: Why do they want to go to Britain? Because something is drawing them there,” he said. “They can ask for asylum in France. (But) none ask for the right to asylum in France. They all want to go to Britain. So it is high time that we sit around a table with the new British government.”

Cross-Channel migration was a key focus in the U.K. general election in July, which the Labour Party won resoundingly to make its leader, Keir Starmer, the new prime minister.
A French prosecutor investigating Tuesday’s sinking, Guirec Le Bras, said 10 of the 12 dead were women and six of the victims were minors. Many appeared to be Eritrean, he said. The inflatable boat sank about 5 kilometers (3 miles) off the French coast, he said. Maritime authorities said many aboard didn’t have life vests.
Fishermen who recovered some of the dead said they were moved to tears.
“The bodies of two women were very young. That hurt me. I cried all day. I couldn’t stop,” said 53-year-old Samba Sy Ndiaye, who works aboard the Murex, one of two fishing boats that assisted the French rescue effort.
Another crew member, Axel Baheu, said the body of one young woman – he guessed she was between 15 and 20 – had a telephone in a waterproof pouch around her neck. It started to ring as he was pulling her out of the water and checking for a pulse, he said.
“That was hard because you know full well that no one will ever answer,” Baheu said.
His father, Jean Marie Baheu, said he saw another heavily laden migrant boat set off Wednesday in front of his house.
“When the weather is good and there’s no wind, there are departures every day,” he said. “At the beginning, you’d see 20, 30 people. Now, it’s minimum 70, 80.”
The inflatable boat the AP saw and filmed on Wednesday was carrying migrants, French maritime authorities confirmed. AP journalists estimated that 40 to 50 people were aboard.
Many wore life preservers. A patrol boat flying a French flag approached the inflatable at one point and the crew tossed more life vests — about half a dozen — to the migrants.
The English Channel’s gray seas were comparatively calm, with small waves lapping the beach as people walked dogs on the sand.
Still, the inflatable appeared to make slow headway. Even though journalists filmed it for more than two hours, it remained clearly visible from shore, with the patrol vessel buzzing around it and a larger one shadowing it from farther away.
The French maritime agency that oversees that stretch of sea said the boats were monitoring the inflatable in case it ran into difficulty or people aboard requested assistance.
In a statement to the AP, the agency said that although maritime law forbids the use at sea of makeshift inflatables, it’s too dangerous to force them back to shore when the boats are heavily laden.
“It’s difficult to achieve with more than 50 people on board who are vehemently refusing to be rescued. The main risk is a stampede on board and then a capsizing, these boats being neither stable nor reliable. The risk of loss of human life being too high for an intervention under duress, the choice is made to prioritize the protection of the people on board and by simply monitoring from a distance the navigation capabilities of these boats,” the statement said.
“It is therefore more a question of ethics than of blind application of the law,” it added.
By the U.K. government’s count, at least 21,720 migrants have managed to cross the English Channel so far this year. That’s 3% more than at the same stage last year, but 19% lower than during the same period in 2022.
The boat that ripped apart on Tuesday, plunging 65 people into the sea, was one of several crossing attempts that day. British authorities said at least 317 migrants succeeded, arriving aboard five boats.
One of the first measures the new U.K. government immediately enacted was to scrap the previous Conservative government’s plan to send some migrants arriving in small boats to Rwanda rather than being allowed to seek asylum in Britain. Human rights groups criticized the plan.
Starmer called the plan a “gimmick” and wouldn’t act as a deterrent. Instead, his government has opted to divert some of the money saved from ditching the program into setting up a strengthened border force to “smash” the criminal gangs behind the small-boat arrivals.

(AP) — A 63-year-old man has been arrested in Alabama in the 2000 murder of a northwest Georgia woman.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the Walker County Sheriff’s Office announced on Friday that they have charged Clerance D. George with murder and aggravated assault in the June 2000 death of Julie Ann McDonald.
McDonald, a pharmacist, was found stabbed to death in her home in LaFayette, Georgia, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Chattanooga.
In a Friday news conference, officials said a combination of better crime lab technology and traditional police work had allowed them to conclude that George had killed McDonald.
Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson said George was arrested in Birmingham on Aug. 22 and awaits extradition to Georgia. George remained in the Jefferson County jail in Birmingham on Monday and it’s unclear if he has a lawyer to speak for him.
George was initially identified as one of four or five suspects in the case, said GBI Special Agent in Charge Joe Montgomery, in part because George was found with McDonald’s checkbook in neighboring Catoosa County.
“It was not a stranger crime,” Wilson said. “They knew each other.”
Montgomery declined to discuss what motive George may have had for killing McDonald.
The agencies said the case was reinvestigated in 2015-2016, but tests on evidence could not then identify a suspect. The case was reviewed again over the last two years, with Montgomery saying lab testing linked evidence to George.

“It’s getting better every day,” Montgomery said of technology. “It gives us hope for some of the other cases that we couldn’t solve, 20 or 30 years ago, we have that ability now.”
Wilson said McDonald’s nearest surviving relatives are a niece and a nephew, who have been notified of the arrest.
“We’ve been working on this case — it’s 24 years old and we never give up on these cold cases,” he said."
QSHYL75SW2_XXTF4LDZL1IR7TH,A French woman whose husband is accused of inviting men to rape her testifies in court,By LEWIS JOLY and NICOLAS VAUX-MONTAGNY,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/trial-rape-drug-france-husband-wife-5ad00446b8a76f0c8d14f349df9147e3,"AVIGNON, France (AP) — A woman who was allegedly drugged by her now ex-husband so that she could be raped by other men while she was unconscious testified Thursday that her world collapsed when police uncovered the years of alleged abuse.
Speaking in a calm and clear voice, Gisèle Pélicot detailed with impressive composure the horror of discovering that her former spouse had systematically filmed the dozens of suspected rapes — storing thousands of images that police investigators later found.
“It’s unbearable,” she told the court in the southern French city of Avignon in an hour of testimony. “I have so much to say that I don’t always know where to start.”
Dominique Pélicot, now 71, and 50 other men are standing trial on charges of aggravated rape and face up to 20 years in prison. The trial started on Monday and is expected to run until December. Thursday marked the first time that Gisèle Pélicot, also in her 70s, had testified.
The Associated Press doesn’t generally identify victims of sexual crimes. But Gisèle Pélicot’s lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, said she accepted that her name would be published in the same way that she insisted that the trial be held in public.
She told the court that she hopes her testimony might help spare other women from similar ordeals. She said she pushed for the trial in open court in solidarity with other women who go unrecognized as victims of sexual crimes.

She and her husband of 50 years had three children. When they retired, the couple moved into a house in Mazan, a small town in Provence.
“I thought we were a close couple,” she told the court.
But in late 2020, a security agent caught her husband taking photos of women’s crotches in a supermarket, leading investigators to search Dominique Pélicot’s phone and computer. They found thousands of photographs and videos of men appearing to rape Gisèle in their home while she appears to be unconscious.
When police officers called her in for questioning, she initially told them her husband was “a great guy.” But after being confronted with the unfathomable — police showed her some of the images — she left her husband.
“For me, everything collapses,” she testified. “These are scenes of barbarity, of rape.”
She left with two suitcases, “all that was left for me of 50 years of life together.” Since then, she said, “I no longer have an identity. ... I don’t know if I’ll ever rebuild myself.”
Police investigators found communications Dominique Pélicot allegedly sent on a messaging website commonly used by criminals, in which he invited men to sexually abuse his wife. French authorities shut down the website earlier this year.
Crude details of the alleged abuses, which investigators said began in 2011, and of the elaborate system Pélicot put into place over 10 years have emerged during the trial.
Dominique Pélicot told investigators that men invited to the couple’s home had to follow certain rules — they could not talk loudly, had to remove their clothes in the kitchen, could not wear perfume nor smell of tobacco.
They sometimes had to wait up to an hour and a half in a nearby parking lot for the drug to take full effect and render Gisèle Pélicot unconscious.
The toxicologist on Thursday spoke of a “cocktail” of medication, a mixture of Temesta and Zolpidem, hypnotic and anxiolytic drugs. A medical expert said that the alleged rapists were not made to wear condoms and that Gisèle Pélicot had contracted four sexually transmitted infections.
“I was sacrificed on the altar of vice,” Gisèle Pélicot testified. “They regarded me like a rag doll, like a garbage bag.”
Because Dominique Pélicot videotaped the alleged rapes, police were able to track down — over a period of two years — a majority of the 72 suspects they were seeking.
Besides Pélicot, 50 other men, aged 22 to 70, are standing trial. Several defendants are denying some of the accusations against them, alleging they were manipulated by Pélicot.
Questioned in court, Gisèle Pélicot rejected the argument that any of these men were manipulated or trapped.
“These men entered my home, respected the imposed protocol. They did not rape me with a gun to the head. They raped me in all conscience,” she said. “Why didn’t they go to the police station? Even an anonymous phone call could have saved my life.”
Over the next few months, the defendants will appear in small groups before a panel of five judges, with Pélicot scheduled to speak next week. Psychologists, psychiatrists and computer experts will also testify.
Outside the courthouse, Gisèle Pélicot told reporters she had tried to answer lawyers’ questions as best she could, despite the pressure of having all these “individuals” behind her.
“We will have to fight until the end.”

In India’s Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states, houses collapsed and were swept away by torrential downpours while floods disrupted road and rail traffic, officials said. The weather service issued a red alert for 11 districts, predicting more rains in the region, Telangana’s top bureaucrat, Shanta Kumari, said.
More than 4,000 people have been moved to 110 government-run relief camps in Telangana since Monday, according to the state’s top elected official, A. Revanth Reddy.
Overflowing lakes, tanks and streams have cut off some villages in Mahabubnagar and Nalgonda districts.
Vijayawada, the commercial capital of Andhra Pradesh, is experiencing the worst flooding in two decades with the Budameru River flooding 40% of the city and stranding nearly 275,000 people in more than a dozen residential area.
Disaster relief teams are struggling to transport stranded families to safter areas, said Andhra Pradesh’s top elected official, N. Chandrababu Naidu.
Since June, at least 170 people have died across India’s six northeastern states due to floods and mudslides brought on by the rains, according to official figures.
In neighboring Pakistan, flash floods triggered by heavy monsoon rains killed five children on Monday in southwestern Balochistan province, bringing the country’s overall death toll from rain-related incidents to at least 300 since July 1.

The five deaths were reported in the Zhob and Khuzdar districts, according to a statement by the disaster management authority. In Balochistan alone, floods have killed 32 people, including 18 children and 12 women over the past two months.
The deluges have also inundated dozens of villages and blocked highways in parts of Balochistan, and damaged nearly 20,000 homes across the country, mostly in Balochistan.
Disasters caused by landslides and floods are common in both India and Pakistan during the June-September monsoon season. Scientists and weather forecasters have blamed climate change for heavier rains in recent years.
In 2022, climate-induced downpours inundated one-third of Pakistan, killing 1,739 people and causing $30 billion in damage.

Three people were killed and two others injured in a shooting at a home stemming from a dispute between neighbors on Saturday night in Waianae, a west Oahu community. The shooter was also fatally shot by a resident, who was arrested on a second-degree murder charge, police said.
Honolulu police said the 42-year-old man was released pending investigation on Sunday night. The Honolulu prosecuting attorney’s office will ultimately decide if there are any charges, Police Chief Joe Logan said Tuesday.
“In Hawaii, we are a non ‘stand your ground’ state,” he said. “Even if you have a license to carry, if you’re an individual that discharges a firearm that is involved in injuring another person, ... you’re going to be arrested.”
The identities of those killed were not yet released by the Honolulu medical examiner’s office Tuesday.
On Saturday night, a family was hosting a gathering in a carport when a 58-year-old neighbor using a front-end loader rammed cars into the carport and opened fire, police said. Three women were killed. The 42-year-old man, who lives at the home of the gathering, shot and killed the 58-year-old with a handgun, police said.
Philip Ganaban, chair of the Waianae Coast Neighborhood Board, said he knows the families from both of the residences involved. He was still struggling Tuesday to make sense of what happened. The man who opened fired at the gathering was known as a family man, Ganaban said.

“We’re still wondering what would trigger him so bad,” Ganaban said. “It was a bad decision he made.”
The 58-year-old was known to rent out space on his property for parties, Ganaban said. Earlier in the evening, some people at the gathering had been concerned about people renting the space and “burning rubber with cars going up and down the road,” Ganaban said.
That’s when, as police described, he used the heavy equipment with four 55-gallon drums containing unknown fuel to ram vehicles into the carport gathering."
R53DN6T167_05DYQMM045H1XG0,Some Lebanese who fear war is coming have an unusual backup plan: Moving to Syria,By ABBY SEWELL,_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-displaced-70eeb35e16e813e79c2fd9129415dd78,"BEIRUT (AP) — Residents of Beirut’s southern suburbs have been scrambling to make contingency plans since an Israeli airstrike on an apartment building in a busy neighborhood killed a top Hezbollah commander and touched off fears of a full-scale war.
For most, that means moving in with relatives or renting homes in Christian, Druze or Sunni-majority areas of Lebanon that are generally considered safer than the Shiite-majority areas where the Hezbollah militant group has its main operations and base of support.
But for a small number, plan B is a move to neighboring Syria.
Although Syria is in its 14th year of civil war, active fighting has long been frozen in much of the country. Lebanese citizens, who can cross the border without a visa, regularly visit Damascus. And renting an apartment is significantly cheaper in Syria than in Lebanon.
Zahra Ghaddar said she and her family were shaken when they saw an apartment building reduced to rubble by the July 30 drone strike in her area, known as Dahiyeh. Along with Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukur, two children and three women were killed and dozens more were injured in the targeted Israeli attack.
Previously, the Lebanese capital had been largely untouched by the near-daily cross-border clashes that have displaced around 100,000 people from southern Lebanon and tens of thousands more in Israel since Oct. 8. That’s when Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of its ally Hamas, which a day earlier led a deadly raid in Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Israel responded with an aerial bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians.

In recent weeks, the conflict in Lebanon appeared on the brink of spiraling out of control.
Ghaddar said her family first considered moving within Lebanon but were discouraged by social media posts blaming displaced civilians, along with Hezbollah, for the threat of all-out war. Also, surging demand prompted steep rent hikes.
“We found the rents started at $700, and that’s for a house we wouldn’t be too comfortable in,” she said. That amount is more than many Lebanese earn in a month.
So they looked across the border.
Ghaddar’s family found a four-bedroom apartment in Aleppo, a city in northwestern Syria, for $150 a month. They paid six months’ rent in advance and returned to Lebanon.
Israel periodically launches airstrikes on Syria, usually targeting Iranian-linked military sites or militants, but Bashar Assad’s government has largely stood on the sidelines of the current regional conflict.
Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006 that demolished much of southern Lebanon and Beirut’s southern suburbs. At the time, some 180,000 Lebanese took refuge in Syria, many taking shelter in schools, mosques and empty factories. Those who could afford it rented houses. Some put down permanent roots.
Rawad Issa, then a teenager, fled to Syria with his parents. They returned to Lebanon when the war ended, but Issa’s father used some of his savings to buy a house in Syria’s Hama province, just in case.
“That way, if another war happened, we would already have a house ready,” Issa said.
The house and surrounding area were untouched by Syria’s civil war, he said. A few weeks ago, his sister and her husband went to get the house ready for the family to return, in case the situation in Lebanon deteriorated.
Issa, who works in video production, said he initially planned to rent an apartment in Lebanon if the conflict expanded, rather than joining his family in Syria.
But in “safe” areas of Beirut, “they are asking for fantastic prices,” he said. One landlord was charging $900 for a room in a shared apartment. “And outside of Beirut, it’s not much better.”
Azzam Ali, a Syrian journalist in Damascus, told The Associated Press that in the first few days after the strike in Dahiyeh, he saw an influx of Lebanese renting hotel rooms and houses in the city. A Lebanese family — friends of a friend — stayed in his house for a few days, he said.
In a Facebook post, he welcomed the Lebanese, saying they “made the old city of Damascus more beautiful.”
After the situation appeared to calm down, “some went back and some stayed here, but most of them stayed,” he said.
No agency has recorded how many people have moved from Lebanon to Syria in recent months. They are spread across the country and are not registered as refugees, making tracking the migration difficult. Anecdotal evidence suggests the numbers are small.
Of 80 people displaced from southern Lebanon living in greater Beirut — including Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinian refugees — at least 20 said they were considering taking refuge in Syria if the war in Lebanon escalated, according to interviews conducted by researchers overseen by Jasmin Lilian Diab, director of the Institute for Migration Studies at the Lebanese American University.
Diab noted that the Lebanese considering this route were a niche group who had “existing networks in Syria, either business networks, family or friends.”
The threat of war has also not prompted a mass reverse migration of Syrians from Lebanon. Some 775,000 Syrians are registered with the U.N. Refugee Agency in Lebanon, and hundreds of thousands more are believed to be unregistered in the country.
While fighting in Syria has died down, many refugees fear that if they return they could be arrested for real or perceived ties to the opposition to Assad or forcibly conscripted to the army. If they leave Lebanon to escape war they could lose their refugee status, although some cross back and forth via smuggler routes without their movements being recorded.
Many residents of Dahiyeh breathed a sigh of relief when an intense exchange of strikes between Israel and Hezbollah on July 25 turned out to be short-lived. But Ghaddar said she still worries the situation will deteriorate, forcing her family to flee.
“It’s necessary to have a backup plan in any case,” she said."
RKK65SZVP4_J1F7F7VTJ8RSMHB,"Wildlife trafficking ring killed at least 118 eagles, prosecutors say",By MATTHEW BROWN,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/eagles-killed-black-market-montana-f865b3aa23590eaa5d30764d9985b6a2,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — A man helped kill at least 118 eagles to sell their feathers and body parts on the black market as part of a long-running wildlife trafficking ring in the western U.S. that authorities allege killed thousands of birds, court filings show.
Travis John Branson is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court on Sept. 18 for his role in the trafficking ring that operated on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana and elsewhere.
Prosecutors say the Cusick, Washington man made between $180,000 and $360,000 from 2009 to 2021 selling bald and golden eagle parts illegally.
“It was not uncommon for Branson to take upwards of nine eagles at a time,” prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Montana wrote in a Tuesday court filing. “Not only did Branson kill eagles, but he hacked them into pieces to sell for future profits.”
Eagle wings, tails, feathers and other parts are highly sought after by Native Americans who use them in ceremonies.
Prosecutors asked Judge Dana Christensen to sentence Branson to “significant imprisonment” and restitution totaling $777,250. That includes $5,000 for every dead eagle and $1,750 for each of 107 hawks that investigators said he and his co-conspirators killed.
Branson’s attorney disputed the prosecutors’ claims and said they overstated the number of birds killed. The prosecution’s allegation that as many as 3,600 birds died came from a co-defendant, Simon Paul, who remains at large. Branson’s attorney suggested in court filings that the stated death toll has fueled public outcry over the case.

“It is notable that Mr. Paul himself went from a 3,600 to 1,000 bird estimate,” Federal Defender Andrew Nelson wrote in a Tuesday filing, referring to a statement Paul made to authorities in a March 13, 2021, traffic stop.
Nelson also said restitution for the hawks was not warranted since those killings were not included in last year’s grand jury indictment. He said Branson had no prior criminal history and asked for a sentence of probation.
Branson and Paul grew up in the Flathead Reservation area. Since their indictment, Paul has been hiding in Canada to evade justice, according to Nelson.
Paul’s defense attorney did not immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment.
Investigators documented the minimum number of eagles and hawks killed through Branson’s text messages, prosecutors said. Two years of his messages were not recovered, leading prosecutors to say the “full scope of Branson’s killings is not captured.”
Government officials have not revealed any other species of birds killed.
Bald and golden eagles are sacred to many Native Americans. U.S. law prohibits anyone without a permit from killing, wounding or disturbing eagles, or taking their nests or eggs.
Illegal shootings are a leading cause of golden eagle deaths, according to a recent government study.
Members of federally recognized tribes can get feathers and other bird parts legally through from the National Eagle Repository in Colorado and non-government repositories in Oklahoma and Phoenix. There’s a yearslong backlog of requests at the national repository.
Branson pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy, wildlife trafficking and two counts of trafficking federally protected bald and golden eagles. He faced a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the most serious charge, conspiracy. Under a plea deal, prosecutors said they would seek to dismiss additional trafficking charges.
Federal guidelines call for a sentence of roughly three to four years in prison for Branson, they said."
RNDWZ56PK8_6LR5VOLE8CSQGR7,Federal judge decries discrimination against conservative group that publishes voters’ information,By MORGAN LEE,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/judge-ensures-public-access-to-voter-data-d0399b6469fe2feb25bc7ec8cc5f6547,"SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A federal judge says New Mexico election regulators and prosecutors discriminated against a Republican-backed group in refusing access to voter registration rolls.
The Friday ruling bars the state from refusing to turn over voter data to Voter Reference Foundation, bolstering the group’s efforts to expand a free database of registered voters so that groups and individuals can take it upon themselves to try to find potential irregularities or fraud.
State prosecutors plan to appeal the ruling, said Lauren Rodriguez, a spokesperson for the New Mexico Department of Justice.
The VoteRef.com website recently restored New Mexico listings to its searchable database of registered voters — including street addresses, party affiliations and whether voters participated in recent elections.
Election officials in several states and privacy advocates have raised alarms about a push by several conservative groups to gain access to state voter rolls. They say the lists could find their way into the hands of malicious actors and that voters could be disenfranchised through intimidation, possibly by canceling their registrations to avoid public disclosure of their home addresses and party affiliation.
But Albuquerque-based U.S. District Court Judge James Browning ruled that state election regulators engaged in viewpoint-based discrimination and free speech violations in denying the Voter Reference Foundation access to voter data and by referring the matter to state prosecutors.
The foundation’s VoteRef.com database includes voter information spanning more than 32 states and the District of Columbia. It is run by Gina Swoboda, chair of the Arizona Republican Party and organizer of former President Donald Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign in Arizona.

Browning previously ruled that New Mexico authorities violated public disclosure provisions of the National Voter Registration Act by refusing to provide voter rolls to the same foundation, overriding a provision of a state law that restricts the use of voter registration data.
The VoteRef.com site doesn’t list whom people voted for. It preserves confidentiality under a program that shields victims of domestic violence or stalking.
Addresses also remain confidential for more than 100 publicly elected or appointed officials in New Mexico, including Democrats and Republicans, enrolled in a separate safety program enacted in the aftermath of drive-by shootings on the homes of local lawmakers in Albuquerque in December 2022 and January 2023."

Three of the four people in the Nissan SUV died from the crash before they could be taken to hospitals, while the fourth was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Statesboro, Georgia. The driver and passenger of the van were taken by helicopters to a hospital in Savannah, Georgia with serious injuries.

RUFO8L92NS_OTF3TVFOF9FD7PA,Sweden begins brown bear hunting season with conservationists warning of a 20% drop in number,By JAN M. OLSEN,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/bear-sweden-hunting-conservationists-population-9c75458155a8ad577c3d0ad0cb871ac5,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — Brown bear hunting in Sweden started Wednesday with 486 licenses to kill them, but conservationists warned that the move would result in a 20% drop in the country’s predator population.
“Bear hunting is very much about pure trophy hunt,” Magnus Orrebrant of the Swedish Carnivore Association — a non-profit and independent advocacy group — told The Associated Press.
“Wildlife management in Sweden is about killing animals instead of preserving them,” he added.
In June, when the figure for this year’s bear hunting was released, Jonas Kindberg of a Swedish-Norwegian bear preservation research program said that “if you want the population to remain stable at around the 2,400 animals as we estimate today, you can only shoot about 250 bears annually.”
It “can quickly have major consequences that could become critical for the bear population,” he added.
In Sweden, the number of bears has dropped in recent years chiefly due to the expected effect of licensed hunting in recent years, according to officials. Last year’s license to cull them was record-high at 649, while it was 622 in 2022 and 501 in 2021.
Every five years, an estimate is made of how many bears there are in Sweden. The previous estimated count was done in 2017 which showed there were about 2,900 bears at that time, according to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, a government body.

The assessment is that the number of carnivoran mammals increased slightly between 2018 and 2020, and then decreased, the agency said.
The Swedish hunters’ magazine Svensk Jagt told its readers that “the bear, like other large predators, may only be hunted under strictly controlled conditions.”
Sweden is covered by 70% of forest and the seven counties inhabited by bears issue a limited number of licenses to cull them each year.
The hunting season for the carnivoran mammals in 2024 ends at the latest on Oct. 15. The counties are chiefly located in central and northern Sweden.
The magazine also wrote that the county of Varmland, west of Stockholm, closed the 2024 bear hunting season Wednesday, shortly after three bears it had been allocated, had been culled.
Besides the hunting licenses, bears can also be killed in self-defense when people are threatened, and these are not counted as part of the hunting licenses.
Female bears weigh 60-100 kilograms (132-220 pounds) while males weigh 100-250 kilograms (220-551 pounds) and they have a shoulder height of up to 135 centimeters (53 inches).
Bears roam the Scandinavian peninsula. Sweden has a 1,600-kilometer (994-mile) border with Norway where bear hunting is forbidden."

Fans can now bid on a slew of costumes, props, set pieces and memorabilia from the hit show that ended in 2019. More than 2,000 items — including a melted version of the coveted Iron Throne — distributed across 900 lots will be on the auction block in October through Heritage Auctions.
The starting bids range from $500 to $20,000 for items as iconic as Jaime Lannister’s full suit of armor and sword to props as granular as prosthetic teeth used for the White Walkers.
Other notable items include Daenerys Targaryen’s memorable cloaks, coats and leather ensembles (some that feature dragon chokers and accents) worn by Emilia Clarke, Jon Snow’s notorious Longclaw sword wielded by Kit Harington, and the Hand of the Queen Pin donned by Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister. Even items that didn’t boast much screen time, like the bell wielded during Cersei Lannister’s walk of shame or bloodstained garb from the infamous Red Wedding, are expected to draw fans’ attention during bidding.
Jay Roewe, HBO’s senior vice president of global incentives and production planning, said the auction — a chance for fans to “grab a piece of history” — speaks to the staying power the series has had five years after its finale.
“‘Game of Thrones’ was a zeitgeist moment in our culture. It was a zeitgeist moment in high-end television. It was a zeitgeist moment in terms of HBO,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press. “This is something we all grew up with. It’s impacted every single one of our lives. It’s impacted the culture, and ‘Game of Thrones’ has meant something to every single person.”

Although the series started in 2011 and several items in the auction date back to then, they have not been “collecting dust,” Roewe said. HBO had been carefully preserving thousands of props, costumes and set pieces since the series began for use on potential spinoffs or sequels. With “House of The Dragon” having recently completed its second season and other projects firmly in development — while others have been discarded — Roewe said the studio now knows what they’ll need to hold on to and what they can part ways with.
“These items have been curated and taken care of since we finished filming. They are the quality that they were when we finished filming, and we’ve had people working on them for years to keep them in shape,” he said. “We don’t need them anymore. It’s time to finally open it up to the world.”
Beyond the preservation and quality of the items, the sheer scale of the auction required months of collaboration with HBO and countless hours of research and planning to organize, said Joe Maddalena, the executive vice president of Heritage Auctions.
Maddalena wanted to ensure fans and collectors didn’t feel like there were any “glaring holes” in the collection by including a wide variety of characters’ costumes and props, displayed in a 750-page catalog. There are even multiples of crucial items like Arya Stark’s rapier Needle, of which there were several versions throughout the series’ run.
The intricate nature and craftsmanship of the costumes and props are part of what make the show so memorable, Maddalena, a fan himself, said. Emmy-winning costume designer Michele Clapton has been praised since the series’ start for the detailed and intentional designs that fueled storylines. The catalog features interviews with Clapton, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss and several of the cast members commenting on the episode-specific usage and significance of hundreds of the items. Maddalena called this kind of access and information “uncharted territory” in the auction world.
“You don’t usually get studio-sanctioned auctions like this. This is studio sanctioned,” he said. “Everything comes from the archive. Everything was handpicked, scene specific. You know where your piece was used. You know it was actually used on screen.”
For fans who want to snag a piece of “Game of Thrones,” the vast collection is now open for preliminary bidding with the auction taking place Oct. 10-12 through Heritage Auctions in Dallas. The collection will be available to preview in the auction house’s New York and London locations starting Sept. 17 through Oct. 4."
SKP9ER5OKI_F74O8GXPHP0GU8C,Ex-police officer who joined Capitol riot receives a reduced prison sentence,By MICHAEL KUNZELMAN,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/thomas-robertson-police-officer-capitol-riot-supreme-court-f626494958a0672b4359afaa25d7694f,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A former Virginia police officer who stormed the U.S. Capitol received a reduced prison sentence of six years on Wednesday, making him one of the first beneficiaries of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that limited the government’s use of a federal obstruction law.
More than two years ago, former Rocky Mount Police Sgt. Thomas Robertson originally was sentenced to seven years and three months of imprisonment for joining a mob’s Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
Prosecutors urged U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper to preserve the original sentence, but the judge imposed the shorter prison term Wednesday after agreeing to dismiss Robertson’s conviction for obstructing the congressional certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 electoral victory.
Robertson was the first Capitol riot defendant to be resentenced after the dismissal of a conviction for the obstruction charge at the center of the Supreme Court’s ruling in June, according to Justice Department prosecutors. The high court ruled 6-3 that a charge of obstructing an official proceeding must include proof that a defendant tried to tamper with or destroy documents — a distinction that applies to few Jan. 6 criminal cases.
“I assume I won’t be seeing you a third time,” the judge told Robertson at the end of his second sentencing hearing.
Robertson, who declined to address the court at his first sentencing hearing, told the judge on Wednesday that he looks forward to returning home and rebuilding his life after prison.

“I realize the positions that I was taking on that day were wrong,” he said of Jan. 6. “I’m standing before you very sorry for what occurred on that day.”
A jury convicted Robertson of all six counts in his indictment, including charges that he interfered with police officers during a civil disorder and that he entered a restricted area with a dangerous weapon, a large wooden stick. Robertson’s jury trial was the second among hundreds of Capitol riot cases.
Robertson traveled to Washington on that morning with another off-duty Rocky Mount police officer, Jacob Fracker, and a third man, a neighbor who wasn’t charged in the case.
Fracker, who pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and agreed to cooperate with the government, was sentenced in 2022 to probation and two months of home detention.
Jurors who convicted Robertson saw some of his posts on social media before and after the riot. In a Facebook post on Nov. 7, 2020, Robertson said “being disenfranchised by fraud is my hard line.”
“I’ve spent most of my adult life fighting a counter insurgency. (I’m) about to become part of one, and a very effective one,” he wrote.
After Jan. 6, Robertson told a friend that he was prepared to fight and die in a civil war and he clung to baseless conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen from then-President Donald Trump.
“He’s calling for an open, armed rebellion. He’s prepared to start one,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Aloi told the judge.
Prosecutors said Robertson used his law enforcement and military training to block police officers who were trying to hold off the advancing mob.
Defense attorney Mark Rollins said Robertson made bad choices and engaged in bad behavior on Jan. 6 but wasn’t trying to “overthrow democracy” that day.
“What you find now is a broken man,” Rollins said.
The town fired Robertson and Fracker after the riot. Rocky Mount is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Roanoke, Virginia, and has about 5,000 residents."
STPCNG0MMW_LADH39WD6S53V5M,Prosecutors drop fraud case against Maryland attorney,By MICHAEL KUNZELMAN,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/jeremy-schulman-attorney-somalia-charges-dropped-d146fb06e240229331c1f3165536fae0,"Federal prosecutors have dropped their criminal case against a Maryland attorney whom they accused of engaging in a scheme to fraudulently access more than $12.5 million in Somali government assets from financial institutions.
U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis on Friday granted prosecutors’ request to dismiss the indictment against Jeremy Wyeth Schulman “with prejudice,” which means they won’t ask to revive the case.
In a court filing, prosecutors cited their “assessment of pre-trial evidentiary rulings” as one of the reasons for dismissing Schulman’s indictment. They didn’t elaborate on that or any other reason.
Schulman’s attorneys asked the judge to dismiss the case last year. They accused prosecutors of “gamesmanship” by avoiding the collection of evidence that could have favored Schulman and withholding information that could have helped him prepare a defense.
Schulman’s attorneys also argued that the government’s delay in bringing the case prevented the defense from presenting testimony from several witnesses who could have rebutted the charges.
“These unseemly efforts by the prosecution have proven to be an extraordinary success,” defense attorneys wrote.
In December 2020, a federal grand jury indicted Schulman on charges including wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and money laundering.
The Justice Department began investigating the case 10 years ago. Schulman said he learned he was under investigation in January 2017.

“It’s extremely gratifying for this ordeal to be over. It has taken an enormous toll, but I’ve kept a good attitude. I have had the support of some great friends and family. All my clients stuck with me,” he said.
Schulman said he has been able to maintain a law practice despite the government’s damaging allegations.
“But opposing counsel tried to use it against me in many cases, to bring it up to try to discredit me and thus try to damage my clients. But it hasn’t really worked,” he said. “Judges still believe in the presumption of innocence.”
The indictment accused Schulman and others of trying to fraudulently obtain control over hundreds of millions of dollars in Central Bank of Somalia assets held in bank accounts that had been frozen due to civil war and political instability in the African country.
The indictment also claimed that Schulman personally received hundreds of thousands of dollars in compensation from a law firm that retained $3.3 million of the Somali assets for fees and expenses.
A trial for the case was scheduled to start in December before the judge agreed to dismiss it. In a ruling last year, the judge had agreed that the government appeared to be “all too willing” to avoid witnesses that would likely aid in Schulman’s defense
Defense attorney Stanley Woodward said prosecutors decided to drop the case after the judge ruled in favor of the defense on the admissibility of certain key evidence.
“They had to know that they had no path to victory,” Woodward said."
T2S686LC6L_H4K8LGFP4RI5SAB,Ukraine gets a new chief diplomat as the war with Russia enters a critical phase,By ILLIA NOVIKOV,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-parliament-foreign-minister-sybiha-e0dccf7d2a77eef553c0d6f13292c742,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s parliament approved the appointment of a new foreign minister Thursday, two lawmakers said, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sought to breathe fresh life into his administration with the war against Russia poised for what could be a pivotal phase.
Andrii Sybiha, a former ambassador to Turkey, is the country’s new chief diplomat. He replaced Dmytro Kuleba, who became one of Ukraine’s most recognizable faces on the international stage as he petitioned and pleaded with Western countries to support Ukraine’s war effort.
Sybiha, 49, has been working as Kuleba’s deputy since April.
Zelenskyy wants to replace almost a dozen top officials in his biggest government shake-up since Russia’s full-scale invasion started on Feb. 24, 2022. Other changes included the heads of strategic industries, justice, natural resources and farming.
Parliament’s approval is required for the changes. Ukrainian lawmakers Yaroslav Zhelezniak and Oleksii Honcharenko confirmed the vote to The Associated Press.
Zelenskyy said Wednesday of the reshuffle that Ukraine needs “new energy.”
The war, more than 900 days long, is on the cusp of what could be a key period.
A likely hard winter lies ahead, testing the country’s resolve. Ukraine’s power grid is under severe strain after Russian missiles and drones knocked out around 70% of the country’s generation capacity. That could mean going without heat and water.

On the battlefield, Ukraine is waiting to see whether the military’s gamble with its surprise thrust into Russia’s Kursk border region a month ago pays dividends. Meanwhile, outgunned Ukrainian soldiers are gradually being pushed backward by Russia’s monthslong drive deeper into eastern Ukraine, and Ukrainian civilians are at the mercy of Russia’s deadly long-range aerial strikes.
The casualty list from a Russian missile strike Tuesday on a military training school in the Ukrainian city of Poltava grew to 55 dead and 328 wounded, Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said Thursday. A search and rescue operation was continuing.
No major policy changes were expected under the new administration. Zelenskyy’s five-year mandate expired in May, but he remains in power under the provisions of martial law, and his leadership is largely unchallenged.
Sybiha, the new foreign minister who also previously worked in the president’s office, takes on the role as Ukraine endeavors to prevent war fatigue from eroding the West’s commitment.
Kyiv officials will also have to navigate the result of the U.S. election in November, which could produce important policy shifts in Washington.
Top of Ukraine’s wish list at the moment are more Western air defense systems and permission from its Western partners to let it use their weapons to hit targets on Russian soil. Some Western leaders are reluctant to grant that request, because they fear an escalation that could drag them into the fighting.
Top U.S. military leaders, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. C.Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will meet in Germany on Friday to discuss those issues with European allies.
Zelenskyy hasn’t shrunk from major decisions that risk alienating senior officials and perplexing the public.
In February, he replaced his top general in a shake-up aimed at reigniting battlefield momentum, and the then defense minister Oleksii Reznikov quit a year ago, after Zelenskyy said that he would be replaced and named his successor.

TFPNAUCB5J_7B3X3IEC8UTV4GY,"Alaska law saying only doctors can provide abortions is unconstitutional, judge rules",By BECKY BOHRER,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/alaska-abortion-law-struck-down-58ae7420bdafde5f788b5f693c91d269,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — An Alaska judge struck down Wednesday a decades-old state law that restricted who could perform abortions in the state.
The decision comes out of a 2019 lawsuit brought by Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, which challenged the law that says only a doctor licensed by the State Medical Board can perform an abortion in Alaska.
Alaska Superior Court Judge Josie Garton in 2021 granted the group’s request to allow advanced practice clinicians to provide medication abortion pending her decision in the underlying case. Garton at that time said the organization was likely to succeed in its lawsuit challenging the law as unconstitutional.
The Alaska Supreme Court has interpreted the right to privacy in the state’s constitution as encompassing abortion rights.
In her ruling Wednesday, Garton found that the law violated the privacy and equal protection rights of patients by burdening their access to abortion, as well as the rights of clinicians qualified to perform the procedures. The restrictions have a disproportionate impact on people who are low-income, have inflexible work schedules or have limited access to transportation, the judge noted.
“There is ... no medical reason why abortion is regulated more restrictively than any other reproductive health care,” such as medical treatment of miscarriages, Garton wrote.
Planned Parenthood in its lawsuit argued there was no medical justification for the restriction and noted that advanced practice clinicians — which include advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants — provide services that are “comparably or more complex” than medication abortion or aspiration, such as delivering babies and removing and inserting intrauterine contraceptive devices. Those care providers help fill a void in the largely rural state where some communities lack regular access to doctors, according to the group’s lawsuit.

Planned Parenthood also asked that an Alaska Board of Nursing policy that it said prevented advanced practice registered nurses from using aspiration in caring for women who suffered miscarriages be struck down as unconstitutional.
Women, particularly in rural Alaska, have to fly to larger cities, such as Anchorage, Juneau or even Seattle, for abortion care because of the limited availability of doctors who can provide the service in the state, or sometimes women wait weeks before they’re seen by a doctor, according to the lawsuit.
Delays increase medical risk and cost and “make it impossible for many women to access medication abortion care, which is only available in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy,” the lawsuit states.
Attorneys for the state, however, argued Garton’s 2021 decision allowing advanced practice clinicians to provide medication abortion while the case played out had no real effect on the total number of women who received abortions from Planned Parenthood.
“The quantitative evidence does not suggest that patients are delayed or prevented from obtaining abortion care in Alaska,” Alaska Department of Law attorneys Margaret Paton Walsh and Christopher Robison wrote in a court filing.
Planned Parenthood attorneys said that since the 2021 order, medication abortion has been available every day that advanced practice clinicians have been in the organization’s clinics. An annual state report on abortions in Alaska shows that while overall abortion numbers have been comparable between 2021 and 2023, the number of medication abortions have jumped.
Advanced practice clinicians can provide abortion care in about 20 states, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. In two of those states — New Mexico and Rhode Island — the care is limited to medication abortions. In California, certain conditions must be met, such as the clinician providing care during the first trimester, under a doctor’s supervision and after undergoing training, according to the organization."
TK52B11J5X_N8VHOIM5BHE2DX3,Fake engineer: A top South African railway official is sentenced to prison for forged qualifications,By GERALD IMRAY,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-corruption-railway-fake-engineering-qualifications-6522ff15439428983491a1d6b85c6be1,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — A former top official at South Africa’s state-owned passenger railway company received a 15-year concurrent prison sentence on Tuesday for faking his engineering qualifications and other cases of fraud.
Daniel Mtimkulu, 49, resigned as the head of engineering at the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, or PRASA, shortly before he was arrested in 2015. He was convicted of three counts of fraud and forgery in 2022 over fake university qualifications and a forged job offer from a rival company that resulted in executives at PRASA nearly doubling his salary to keep him.
Mtimkulu was sentenced to 15 years for the first count of fraud and six years in prison for each of the other two counts. A judge at the special commercial crimes court in Johannesburg ordered that the sentences be served concurrently.
As PRASA’s head of engineering, Mtimkulu was behind a deal worth more than $100 million to buy dozens of new train locomotives from Spain, which were then found to be too tall for South Africa’s rail network and couldn’t be used. The big-money contract was one of several at PRASA that have been linked with alleged bribes and kickbacks.
Investigators have said there was rampant corruption and mismanagement at some of South Africa’s biggest state-owned businesses between 2009 and 2018. A report last week by a special unit that is investigating high-level corruption said that more than $7 billion may have been lost to graft at some of those state-owned companies, including PRASA.
Mtimkulu claimed to have a master’s degree from a university in South Africa and a doctorate in engineering management from a university in Germany, neither of which were true. He also faked a job offer from a German company that resulted in his salary being increased from around $90,000 a year to $155,000 a year.
The judge ordered him to pay back $323,000 to PRASA, which police said were the proceeds of crime.

The official visit, in which he is to meet Tuesday with Mongolian leader Ukhnaa Khurelsukh, is Putin’s first to a member country of the International Criminal Court since it issued a warrant for his arrest nearly 18 months ago on charges of war crimes in Ukraine.
Ukraine has called on Mongolia to arrest Putin and hand him over to the court in The Hague. A spokesperson for Putin said last week that the Kremlin isn’t worried about the visit.
Members of the international court are bound to detain suspects if an arrest warrant has been issued, but the court doesn’t have any enforcement mechanism.
Mongolia, a sparsely populated country between Russia and China, is heavily dependent on the former for fuel and electricity and on the latter for investment in its mining industry.
The ICC has accused Putin of being responsible for the abductions of children from Ukraine, where the fighting has raged for 2½ years.
Putin and the Mongolian leader on Tuesday are to attend a ceremony marking the 1939 victory of Soviet and Mongolian troops over the Japanese army that had taken control of Manchuria in northeastern China. Thousands of soldiers died in months of fighting in a dispute over where the border was between Manchuria and Mongolia.
Though Putin has faced international isolation over the invasion of Ukraine, he visited North Korea and Vietnam in June and has also visited China twice in the past year.
He joined a meeting in Johannesburg by video link last year after the South African government lobbied against him showing up for the BRICS summit, a group that also includes China and other emerging economies. South Africa is an ICC member."

AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) — A Florida man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison after earlier pleading no contest to attacking four Jewish teenagers who were walking along a road while dressed for a religious holiday in 2022.
Noah Amato, 19, of Ponte Vedra, was sentenced Friday for aggravated battery and carrying a concealed firearm in the October 2022 attack. Local news outlets reported his sentence also covers a no contest plea to fleeing police and reckless driving in 2023.
Investigators said Amato and a friend were riding a bike in Ponte Vedra Beach in 2022 while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Amato shouted a slur to a group of four Jewish teenagers who were out celebrating the Jewish holiday of Sukkot. Amato then hit one of the teenagers with a handgun in the face, deputies said, and fired the gun near the teenager’s head, leaving burns on the teen’s face.
Amato’s attorney disputed parts of the account, saying there was a verbal confrontation between Amato and the Jewish teens. The lawyer said the teen who was targeted by Amato, Zalman Barrocas, had shoved Amato first.
“I believe this man should have the maximum punishment,” Barrocas said in testimony during the sentencing hearing. “My life could have been over that day. I believe it’s a miracle from God and I thank him every day. I hope it’s a story that ends with us being safer and we’re able to live in society without being in fear.”

Rabbi Nochum Kurinsky, Barrocas’ uncle, had called for hate crime charges against Amato. Prosecutors previously said there were no hate crime charges pending.
Amato apologized for the pain he caused the family, saying on the witness stand, “I take 100% responsibility for the heinous crime I committed. I was highly intoxicated on an entire bottle of liquor and some Percocets.”"
TS0KJPNH37_DKKP51ZTV33KLS4,A Florida county’s plan to turn a historic ship into the world’s largest artificial reef hits a snag,By KATE PAYNE,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/united-states-historic-ship-philadelphia-artificial-reef-805a0b16057b65c6a891ea2d30f5c0ba,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A Florida county is in talks to acquire a storied but aging ocean liner in a proposed deal that could create the largest artificial reef in the world.
But the plan hit a snag Tuesday, after local officials in coastal Okaloosa County in the Florida panhandle postponed a vote on the plan to buy and purposefully sink the SS United States.
The largest passenger ship ever built in the U.S., the SS United States shattered a record for the fastest trans-Atlantic crossing by a passenger liner on its maiden voyage in 1952, The Associated Press reported from aboard the ship.
Now the historic vessel is in a race against time to find a new resting place, after a court set a Sept. 12 deadline for the ship to vacate its current home at a pier in Philadelphia, following a yearslong legal dispute over rent and dockage fees.
Options include scrapping the massive ocean liner — which is more than 100 feet (30 meters) longer than the Titanic — or purposefully sinking it to create an artificial reef. Officials in Florida’s Okaloosa County hope to do just that: send the SS United States to the bottom of the Gulf to create the world’s largest artificial reef — a diving attraction that boosters hope will generate millions of dollars a year in local tourism spending for scuba shops, charter fishing boats and hotels.
“Most divers are going to be very excited,” said David Bailey, a member of the Emerald Coast Scubaholics dive club. “But any of the reefing program is about more than just diving. ... Build the reefs, you get the fish.”

County staff have been tracking the status of the boat since 2022, with advocates arguing the SS United States could be a barnacle-encrusted star in the county’s constellation of more than 500 artificial reefs.
But at a meeting of Okaloosa’s Board of County Commissioners on Tuesday, staff asked that a vote on the proposal be postponed until the board’s next meeting on Sept. 17.
“We’ve hit a wrinkle with the pier operators,” County Administrator John Hofstad explained.
A spokesperson for the county said officials there are actively working with the SS United States Conservancy, the group behind the effort to save the ship, but declined to make further comments about the status of the proposal.

UE3MOHHIX9_AX6XH9SU706XB95,Blinken arrives in Haiti to show US support for fighting gang violence,_,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/haiti-blinken-us-mission-gangs-9b19ea203edd64c3b45c0b2a71884ebb,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived Thursday in Haiti to reaffirm the U.S. government’s commitment to a multinational mission to fight gangs in the Caribbean country and push for long-awaited general elections as he supported consideration of a peacekeeping operation.
Some 400 Kenyan police have been deployed to Haiti to lead a U.N.-backed mission to quell gang violence in the Haitian capital and beyond, but concerns have grown that the mission lacks resources.
“At this critical moment, we do need more funding, we do need more personnel to sustain and carry out the objectives of this mission,” Blinken told reporters.
He added that the U.S. is working to renew the mission, “but we also want to make sure that we have something that’s reliable, that’s sustainable. We’ll look at every option to do that. A peacekeeping operation would be one such option.”
On Wednesday, Brian Nichols, U.S. assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs, confirmed the U.S. government is considering a U.N. peacekeeping operation as one way to secure money and resources to fight gangs that control 80% of Haiti’s capital.
Many Haitians have rejected the proposal of another peacekeeping operation, given the introduction of cholera and sexual abuse cases that occurred when U.N. troops were last in Haiti.
Blinken arrived a day after Haiti’s government extended a state of emergency to the entire country. It had been imposed earlier in the year in the capital and surrounding areas in an attempt to stem the ongoing violence.

Blinken met with Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille and a nine-member transitional presidential council that was created after former Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigned. He also met with unspecified political party leaders, the head of the multinational mission and the chief of Haiti’s National Police.
He said the discussions centered in part on how to ensure that security personnel are well-trained, well=equipped and held accountable, adding that there’s a “clear plan” on the mission’s next steps. Talks also focused on the need to hold general elections.
“That is the critical next step,” he said. “We want to make sure Haiti is back on a clear democratic track.”
Haiti last held elections in 2016, and officials since then have blamed gang violence and political upheaval for preventing them from holding new ones.
In July 2021, former President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated, and gang violence since then has surged. In February, gangs launched coordinated attacks on police stations and the main international airport, which remained closed for nearly three months. They also stormed Haiti’s two largest prisons, releasing more than 4,000 inmates.
The violence subsided somewhat before the first contingent of Kenyan police arrived in late June, with Blinken noting that economic activity has restarted in some areas of Port-au-Prince, and that joint operations have led to successes including regaining control of Haiti’s biggest public hospital.
However, gangs continue to attack communities surrounding Port-au-Prince.
“Taking back the streets from gangs is critical,” Blinken said.
After meeting with officials in Haiti, Blinken is scheduled to fly Thursday night to the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.
On Friday, he is scheduled to meet with Dominican President Luis Abinader and other officials before returning to the U.S. later that day.
Nichols said the talks with Abinader will focus on three priorities: strengthening economic ties, advancing values including respect for human and labor rights and promoting increased security in the region, especially in Haiti.
Abinader has come under fire in recent years for his administration’s treatment of Haitian migrants and those born in the Dominican Republic to Haitian parents.
He also has largely closed the airspace with Haiti and is building a wall between the two nations."
UT7BTPKII7_B2HK0IFX425WX6W,"US government seizes plane used by Venezuelan president, citing sanctions violations","By ERIC TUCKER, REGINA GARCIA CANO and JOSHUA GOODMAN",_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-venezuela-maduro-sanctions-cceb18c18908a5d3bd4ea691ac3a8d7d,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government has seized a luxury jet used by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro that officials say was illegally purchased through a shell company and smuggled out of the United States in violation of sanctions and export control laws.
The Dassault Falcon 900EX was seized in the Dominican Republic and transferred to the custody of federal officials in Florida, the Justice Department said Monday. The plane landed at Ft. Lauderdale Executive Airport shortly before noon Monday, according to flight tracking websites.
U.S. officials say associates of the Venezuelan leader in late 2022 and early 2023 used a Caribbean-based shell company to hide their involvement in the purchase of the plane, valued at the time at $13 million, from a company in Florida. The plane was then exported from the U.S. to Venezuela, through the Caribbean, in April 2023 in a transaction meant to circumvent an executive order that bars U.S. persons from business transactions with representatives of Maduro’s government.
The plane, registered to San Marino, was widely used by Maduro for foreign travel, including in trips earlier this year to Guyana and Cuba. It was also involved in a December swap on a Caribbean airstrip of several Americans jailed in Venezuela for a close Maduro ally, Alex Saab, imprisoned in the U.S. on money laundering charges.
Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement the aircraft had been smuggled out of the U.S. for use by “Maduro and his cronies.”

Venezuela’s government acknowledged the seizure in a statement Monday. It characterized the U.S. government’s move as “a repeated criminal practice that cannot be described as anything other than piracy.”
State media footage from a December visit to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines shows Maduro, First Lady Cilia Flores and senior officials getting off the airplane ahead of a day of discussions over a territory dispute between Venezuela and neighboring Guyana.
“Let this seizure send a clear message: aircraft illegally acquired from the United States for the benefit of sanctioned Venezuelan officials cannot just fly off into the sunset,” Matthew Axelrod, an assistant secretary for export enforcement in the Commerce Department, said in a statement.
CNN first reported the plane seizure.
The seizure announcement comes just over a month after ruling party-loyal electoral authorities declared Maduro the victor in presidential elections without showing any detailed results to back up their claim. The lack of transparency has drawn international condemnation. Meanwhile, the opposition managed to obtain more than 80% of vote tally sheets showing Maduro lost by a wide margin against former diplomat Edmundo González.
Late Monday, a Venezuelan judge issued an arrest warrant for González as part of a criminal investigation into the results of the disputed July election. The warrant was issued at the request of authorities who accuse González of various crimes including conspiracy, falsifying documents and usurpation of powers.
The plane was previously registered in the U.S. and owned by Lorida, Florida-based Six G Aviation, a broker that buys and sells used aircraft. FAA records indicate it was exported to St. Vincent and the Grenadines and de-registered in the U.S. in January 2023.
Gary Gwynn, owner of Six G, declined to comment. “I’ve been instructed by the FBI not to speak to anyone,” he said when contacted by The Associated Press.
In March, it flew to the Dominican Republic, along with a Venezuelan-registered plane, for what was believed to be maintenance, never to leave again.
Monday’s action follows the U.S. government’s earlier seizure in Argentina of a Boeing 747-300 cargo plane transferred from Iran to a subsidiary of Venezuela’s state-owned airlines.
Federal prosecutors have also have seized several private jets belonging to top government officials and insiders who have been either sanctioned or indicted in the U.S.
The U.S. has sanctioned 55 Venezuelan-registered planes, mostly belonging to state-owned oil giant PDVSA. It has also offered a $15 million bounty for the arrest of Maduro to face federal drug trafficking charges in New York.
“There is an overarching body of work and continued body of work, looking at the corrupt practices of the Venezuelan government,” Anthony Salisbury, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Miami, told the AP. “Obviously, we are not done yet.”

UU6BN4FCRW_UNIGX8QI02VXW4T,"Turkey seeks to join the BRICS bloc of emerging economies, a Kremlin official says",_,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/russia-turkey-brics-bloc-developing-economies-525b68836de1301187c5805ead872b65,"MOSCOW (AP) — NATO member Turkey has applied for membership in the BRICS bloc of developing economies, a senior Kremlin official said Wednesday, as Russia and China seek to counter the West’s global influence.
Yuri Ushakov, President Vladimir Putin’s foreign affairs aide, told reporters that Turkey has submitted an application “for full membership” in the bloc that Russia this year chairs, and it will be considered.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stated several times that his country aspires to become a member of the BRICS alliance, according to Omer Celik, a spokesman for Erdogan’s ruling party. But Celik stopped short this week of confirming that Turkey has applied formally.
The BRICS alliance was founded in 2006 by Brazil, Russia, India and China, with South Africa joining in 2010. It recently has undergone an expansion, and now includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has said it’s considering joining, and Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied.
BRICS has a stated aim to amplify the voice of major emerging economies to counterbalance the Western-led global order. Its founding members have called for a fairer world order and the reform of international institutions like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Erdogan, who has been in power for more than two decades, has sought to carve a more independent foreign policy for Turkey and to enhance its global influence. The country is also frustrated by the lack of progress in its membership talks with the European Union.

Last week, Erdogan said Turkey should “simultaneously” develop relations with both the East and the West.
Turkey, which straddles Europe and Asia, joined the NATO military alliance in 1952. It began talks to join the European Union in 2005 but the negotiations have stalled due to concerns over democratic regression under Erdogan’s administration, and ongoing disputes with Cyprus, an EU member, among other challenges.
BRICS is expected to discuss taking in new members in a meeting in Russia next month.
Putin earlier this year welcomed Turkey’s interest in the bloc and promised that Moscow “will support this aspiration and desire to be together with the countries of this alliance, to be together, closer, to solve common problems.”
On Monday, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also said Turkey expressed interest in joining BRICS."

The Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported that the whale carcass was found floating at the Risavika Bay in southern Norway Saturday by a father and son who were fishing.
The beluga, named by combining the Norwegian word for whale — hval — and Russian President Putin’s first name Vladimir, was lifted out of the water with a crane and taken to a nearby harbor where experts will examine it.
“Unfortunately, we found Hvaldimir floating in the sea. He has passed away but it’s not immediately clear what the cause of death is,” marine biologist Sebastian Strand told NRK, adding that no major external injuries were visible on the animal.
Strand, who has monitored Hvaldimir’s adventures for the past three years on behalf of the Norway-based Marine Mind non-profit organization, said he was deeply affected by the whale’s sudden death.
“It’s absolutely horrible,” Strand said. “He was apparently in good condition as of (Friday). So we just have to figure out what might have happened here.”
The 4.2-meter (14-foot) long and 1,225-kilogram (2,700-pound) whale was first spotted by fishermen near the northern island of Ingøya, not far from the Arctic city of Hammerfest, in April 2019 wearing a harness and what appeared to be a mount for a small camera and a buckle marked with text “Equipment St. Petersburg”.

That sparked allegations that the beluga was “a spy whale.” Experts said the Russian navy is known to have trained whales for military purposes.
Over the years, the beluga was seen in several Norwegian coastal towns and it quickly became clear that he was very tame and enjoyed playing with people, NRK said.
NGO Marine Mind said on its site that Hvaldimir was very interested in people and responded to hand signals.
“Based on these observations, it appeared as if Hvaldimir arrived in Norway by crossing over from Russian waters, where it is presumed he was held in captivity,” it said.
Norwegian media have speculated whether Hvaldimir could have been used as “a therapy whale” of some sort in Russia."
VC2GKT4AS1_ZD9ZV2SSKCIDZG4,A woman pleads guilty to trying to bribe a juror in a major COVID-related fraud case,By MICHAEL GOLDBERG,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-jury-pandemic-fraud-cash-bribe-d0b8171b485d55177734e876b1e9b7d3,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A Seattle woman pleaded guilty Thursday to attempting to bribe a Minnesota juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash in exchange for an acquittal in one of the country’s largest COVID-19-related fraud cases.
Ladan Mohamed Ali, 31, dropped off a cash bribe in a plan that involved tracking a juror to her home and promising more money if the woman agreed to return a not guilty verdict in the fraud case. Ali is one of five people charged in the attempted bribery of the juror, a scheme prosecutors have described as “something out of a mob movie.” Officials have also said rare attempts to bribe jurors threaten foundational aspects of the judicial system.
Ali wiped away tears while answering questions from prosecutors before U.S. District Judge David Doty. She said was pleading guilty because she “wanted to take responsibility for my actions.” Ali’s attorney, Eric Newmark, did not immediately return a call seeking an additional comment.
Court documents revealed an extravagant scheme in which Ali and her co-defendants are accused of researching the juror’s personal information on social media, surveilling her, tracking her daily habits and buying a GPS device to install on her car.
The four others charged with crimes related to the bribe are Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, Said Shafii Farah, Abdulkarim Shafii Farah and Abdimajid Mohamed Nur. Nur, 23, pleaded guilty to one count of bribery of a juror in July. The other three defendants have pleaded not guilty.

The group hatched the bribery plan in mid-May, records show.
Nur admitted to recruiting Ali, who delivered the bribe money to the juror’s home. She flew from Seattle to Minneapolis in May to meet with Nur and allegedly agreed to deliver the bribe money later that month to the home of “Juror #52” in exchange for $150,000, prosecutors said.
In new details revealed in federal court Thursday, prosecutors said Ali was concerned the plan would fail and that she would not get paid. So Ali came up with a separate plan to steal some or all of the bribe money.
Ali lied to Nur and said she had approached the juror at a bar, according to prosecutors. Ali claimed the juror wanted $500,000 in exchange for returning a not guilty verdict, and that the juror had instructed her to deliver the money when she’d be home alone. In reality, Ali had never spoken to the juror, prosecutors said.
On June 2, Abdiaziz Farah instructed Nur to meet at Said Farah’s business to pick up the bribe money, court records say. When Nur arrived at the business, Said Farah gave him a cardboard box containing the money. Nur gave the money to Ali after picking her up in a parking lot later in the day. Hours later, Ali and Abdulkarim Farah drove to a Target store and purchased a screwdriver, which they used to remove the license plates from Ali’s rental car before driving to the juror’s home.
Ali knew Abdulkarim Farah had planned to follow her and film the encounter at the juror’s home, but when he insisted on driving Ali rather than taking separate cars, she abandoned her separate plan to steal all of the bribe money.
Nur had given Ali $200,000 in cash, all of which was intended to be used to bribe the juror. Ali knocked on the juror’s door and was greeted by a relative. Ali handed the gift bag to her and explained there would be more money if the juror voted to acquit. But Ali only delivered $120,000 and kept the remaining $80,000 for herself.
The juror called the police, setting off an an FBI investigation that led to the group’s arrest. Authorities believe the defendants targeted the woman, known as “Juror #52,” because she was the youngest and they believed she might be sympathetic to the defendant, as the only person of color on the panel.
Five of the seven people charged in the pandemic fraud trial were later convicted. The defendants in that case were accused of coordinating to steal more than $40 million from a federal program that was supposed to feed children during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than $250 million in federal funds were taken overall in the scheme, and only about $50 million has been recovered, authorities say.
Abdiaziz Farah and Abdimajid Nur were among five people convicted in the pandemic fraud trial in June while Said Farah and another person were acquitted. Abdulkarim Farah and Ali were not involved in the original fraud case.
Ali will be sentenced at a later date."
VDX66F9M5P_538FH1WLTCERXA2,What’s at stake in Mexico’s judicial system under sweeping overhaul pushed by the president,By MARÍA VERZA,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-court-judicial-reform-elected-judges-81081cc0980cd128f3191331bc61a8c4,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s governing party says judges in the current court system are corrupt, and it wants to push through an extreme proposal to make the country’s entire judicial branch — around 7,000 judges — stand for election.
While some countries like Switzerland and the United States elect some judges indirectly or at the local level, outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador wants citizens to vote on every single judge, appeals court member and justice all the way up to the Supreme Court. The president has clashed repeatedly with judges throughout his six-year term, which ends Sept. 30.
In its present form, the overhaul has drawn criticism domestically and from abroad and leaves a lot of questions to be answered. As the country’s Senate prepares to debate — and likely vote in favor of — the contentious overhaul, Mexico’s Supreme Court is examining if it can weigh in on challenges to the proposal.
Here is a look at some of the biggest issues at stake.
People would only need a law degree, decent grades, five years of undefined “judicial area experience” and a letter of recommendation from anyone to run for some judgeships. The candidates’ applications would be winnowed down by a committee of experts, and the names of the finalists would then be drawn from a hat, in some cases. Supreme Court justices would require 10 years’ experience, but would also be elected.
But many questions remain unanswered, including, for example, how many names would be on the ballots. Hundreds, or potentially thousands, of relatively unknown people could be running for these positions.

Would voters research and read the resumes of all these people, or would political parties simply hand out a list of their preferred candidates to supporters?
It’s also not clear who would pay for the candidates’ election campaigns.
While the proposal sets limits on campaigning and spending, people who are willing to finance a judgeship candidate may well be those who have a vested interest in court cases.
Judges and court secretaries (something like assistant judges) currently work their way up to higher positions by periodic reviews and evaluation committees.
There are clearly problems with cronyism and favoritism in the current model, and it isn’t very good at punishing corrupt judges. At the highest levels, some are nominated or selected by the legislative or executive branches.
It would create so-called faceless judges to hear organized crime cases, to protect their identities and avoid reprisals, threats or pressure against them.
It would create a judicial disciplinary committee that could rule not just on judicial misconduct like bribes, mishandling evidence or improper delays, but also conduct investigations into judges for their legal reasoning.
It would reduce the Supreme Court from 11 justices to nine, and their terms to 12 years from the current 15.
The overhaul has to be approved by the two chambers of Congress. The lower chamber, dominated by the governing party, has already voted in favor by a wide margin. The measure is now headed to the Senate, where it’s expected to pass by a razor-thin margin. It must then win approval in 17 of the country’s 32 state legislatures, where the governing party also appears to have sufficient votes.
Once enacted, apart from the cost and time involved in organizing such massive elections, the current judges would all have to be fired and given severance pay. Fired judges could run as candidates. Many of the newly elected judges would be walking into specialized courtrooms and appeals courts that they have never seen or argued cases in before. The learning curve could be long.
The governing party says letting voters decide would make judges more responsive to the popular will and make it easier to punish bad ones.
But in Mexico, the main problem isn’t that corrupt judges dismiss too many cases. It’s that police and prosecutors are so ill-trained and overwhelmed that more than 90% of crimes are never brought to court at all.
In 2009, Bolivia implemented voting for some judgeships, but a lot of voters turned in blank ballots and the process has been frozen for the time being.

VEGSQ11LD5_D5W8HO145CM8OFS,Footage of motorcade racing JFK to the hospital after he was shot is set to go to auction,By JAMIE STENGLE,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/jfk-assassination-film-auction-ac5c9d844a17d14150685f51945d0c62,"DALLAS (AP) — Newly emerged film footage of President John F. Kennedy’s motorcade speeding down a Dallas freeway toward a hospital after he was fatally wounded will go up for auction later this month.
Experts say the find isn’t necessarily surprising even over 60 years after the assassination.
“These images, these films and photographs, a lot of times they are still out there. They are still being discovered or rediscovered in attics or garages,” said Stephen Fagin, curator at The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, which tells the story of the assassination on Nov. 22, 1963.
RR Auction will offer up the 8 mm home film in Boston on Sept. 28. It begins with Dale Carpenter Sr. just missing the limousine carrying the president and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy but capturing other vehicles in the motorcade as it traveled down Lemmon Avenue toward downtown. The film then picks up after Kennedy has been shot, with Carpenter rolling as the motorcade roars down Interstate 35.
“This is remarkable, in color, and you can feel the 80 mph,” said Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of the auction house.
The footage from I-35 — which lasts about 10 seconds — shows Secret Service Agent Clint Hill — who famously jumped onto the back of the limousine as the shots rang out — hovering in a standing position over the president and Jacqueline Kennedy, whose pink suit can be seen.

“I did not know that there were not any more shots coming,” Hill said. “I had a vision that, yes, there probably were going to be more shots when I got up there as I did.”
The shots had fired as the motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza in front of the Texas School Book Depository, where it was later found that assassin Lee Harvey Oswald had positioned himself from a sniper’s perch on the sixth floor. The assassination itself was famously captured on film by Abraham Zapruder.
After the shots, the motorcade turned onto I-35 and sped toward Parkland Memorial Hospital, where Kennedy would be pronounced dead. It was the same route the motorcade would have taken to deliver Kennedy to his next stop, a speech at the Trade Mart.
Carpenter’s grandson, James Gates, said that while it was known in his family that his grandfather had film from that day, it wasn’t talked about often. So Gates said that when the film, stored along with other family films in a milk crate, was eventually passed on to him, he wasn’t sure exactly what his grandfather, who died in 1991 at age 77, had captured.
Projecting it onto his bedroom wall around 2010, he was at first underwhelmed by the footage from Lemmon Avenue. But then, the footage from I-35 played out before his eyes. “That was shocking,” he said.
He was especially struck by Hill’s precarious position on the back of the limousine, so around the time that Hill’s book, “Mrs. Kennedy and Me,” was published in 2012, Gates got in touch with Hill and his co-author, Lisa McCubbin, who became Lisa McCubbin Hill when she and Hill married in 2021.
McCubbin Hill said it was admirable that Gates was sensitive enough to want Hill to see the footage before he did anything else with it. She said that while she was familiar with Hill’s description of being perched on the limousine as it sped down the interstate, “to see the footage of it actually happen ... just kind of makes your heart stop.”
The auction house has released still photos from the portion of the film showing the race down I-35 but is not publicly releasing video of that part.
Farris Rookstool III, a historian, documentary filmmaker and former FBI analyst who has seen the film, said it shows the rush to Parkland in a more complete way than other, more fragmented film footage he’s seen. He said the footage gives “a fresh look at the race to Parkland,” and he hopes that after the auction, it ends up somewhere where it can be used by filmmakers.
Fagin said the assassination was such a shocking event that it was instinctive for people to keep material related to it, so there’s always the possibility of new material surfacing.
He said historians had wondered for years about a man who can be seen taking photos in one of the photos from that day.
“For years we had no idea who that photographer was, where his camera was, where these images were,” Fagin said.
Then, in 2002, Jay Skaggs walked into the museum with a shoebox under his arm. He was the photographer captured in the photo, and in that shoebox were 20 images from Dealey Plaza before and after the assassination, including the only known color photographs of the rifle being removed from the Texas School Book Depository building, Fagin said.
“He just handed that box to us,” Fagin said."

The wooden replica, called Naddodd, was crossing the North Atlantic from the Faeroe Islands to Norway with an international team of six people. The 10-meter (33-feet) double-masted vessel built on the Faeroes had departed the islands located halfway between Scotland and Iceland on Saturday.
On Tuesday, it sailed into strong winds and high waves and late that night, the ship capsized off the coastal town of Stad, about 346 kilometers (215 miles) from the capital of Oslo.
Survivors told police that the weather “suddenly turned significantly worse than predicted with very high waves.” Rescuers said some of the waves were up to 5 meters (16 feet) high at the time.
The five survivors had managed to get into an inflatable life raft and were were later airlifted to safety by helicopter. A sixth person, who had been trapped underneath the vessel, drowned, police said. The victim’s body was found on Wednesday.
Police have not released the name of the victim but Norwegian and Faeroese media identified her as 29-year-old archaeologist Karla Dana, from Florida.
“Thrilled to be a part of this crew, fearlessly embarking on this Nordic voyage on a Viking ship replica across the North Sea, pushing through physical and mental limits to sail into history,” Dana had posted on her LinkedIn profile before the trip."

The plan would make judges stand for election, something critics say would deal a severe blow to the independence of the judiciary and the system of checks and balances.

The overhaul has fueled a wave of protests by judges, court employees and students across Mexico in recent weeks, and reached another inflection point on Tuesday when protesters strung ropes across entrances to the lower house of Congress to block legislators from entering. That came as the country’s Supreme Court voted 8-3 to join strikes, adding more weight to the protests.

“The party with the majority could take control of the judicial branch, and that would practically be the end of democracy,” said protester Javier Reyes, a 37-year-old federal court worker. “They want to own Mexico.”

Despite that, lawmakers from Mexico’s governing party, Morena, and their allies appeared determined to quickly pass the reform. Unable to meet at the congressional building, they instead gathered in a sweltering gymnasium about 3 miles (5 kilometers) away to begin the voting process. The party’s strong majority in a recently inaugurated Congress is paving the way for the reform to sail through the process with relative ease.

The proposal was met by hours of fierce debate Tuesday night after workers laid out grapes, juices and other snacks in a congressional session reminiscent of a summer camp. As Morena politicians said they were building a justice system that would be an example globally, opposition lawmakers from the National Action Party (PAN) railed on the governing party.

“We should inaugurate a wall of shame that says: ‘Today begins the fall of our Republic.’ And it should have the date and all the faces of the Morena congressmen,” shouted Paulina Rubio Fernández, a PAN congresswoman, surrounded by other members of her party.

Rubio Fernández accused the president and his party of “lying” to get a majority in Congress, while another colleague in her party warned Morena was “shooting itself in the foot” by passing the reform.


Outside, a pack of protesters roared, blocking streets and demanding lawmakers hear their objections to the proposal.

The constitutional reforms submitted by outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Morena have drawn criticism both domestically and from foreign governments and investors. López Obrador, a populist who has long been at odds with the judiciary and other independent regulatory agencies, maintains the proposal is necessary to fight corruption.

Critics say the overhaul would stack the courts in favor of López Obrador’s party, politicize the judicial system and pose a threat to foreign investment.

Under the current system, judges and court secretaries, who act as judges’ assistants, slowly qualify for higher positions based on their record. But under the proposed changes, any lawyer with minimal qualifications could run, with some candidacies decided by drawing names from a hat.

The Morena party has the two-thirds majority in Congress needed to approve the reforms, which they should be able to do handily in the lower house of Congress. The party’s congressional leader, Rep. Ricardo Monreal, said there were no plans to abandon the reforms, noting “This reform is going ahead.” Monreal told lawmakers they were in for a long night on Tuesday.

Mexico’s courts have long been plagued by corruption and opacity, but in the last 15 years they have been subject to reforms to make them more open and accountable, including changing many closed-door, paper-based trials for a more open, oral-argument format.

Voices both at home and abroad say the new changes could mark a setback in the effort to clean up courts.

U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar said Tuesday that “there is a great deal of concern,” claiming the changes “could damage relations a lot, and it’s not just me saying that.” Salazar has pointed to the election of judges as his main qualm with the overhaul, noting that it would negatively affect investment and the Mexican economy.

López Obrador said last week he has put relations with the United States and Canadian embassies “on pause” after the two countries voiced concerns over the proposed judicial overhaul.

President-elect Claudia Sheinbaum, López Obrador’s close ally, on Tuesday night once again defended the reform, writing on the social media platform X that it “does not affect our commercial relations, nor national or foreign private investments. On the contrary, there will be more and better rule of law and more democracy for all.”

“If judges, magistrates, and ministers are elected by the people, where is the authoritarianism?” she added.

The proposed changes would cover about 7,000 judges at various levels and would introduce a time limit for judges to rule on many cases to combat a tendency for some trials to stretch out over decades. More controversially, the reforms would also introduce “hooded judges” to preside over organized crime cases; their identities would be kept secret in order to prevent reprisals.

And the courts would be largely stripped of their power to block government projects or laws based on appeals by citizens. It would also almost certainly assure that the president’s party continues with significant political power long after López Obrador leaves office at the end of this month.

After Morena and its allies won overwhelming majorities in the June 2 elections, López Obrador pledged to push forward with other constitutional changes that would eliminate most independent regulatory and oversight agencies.

Still, protesters like Reyes hold onto hope that their weekslong demonstrations will pay off, roaring in unison “Mexico stay strong, justice is coming.”

Protesters chanted in front of a wall of murals painted with López Obrador’s face reading “hasta siempre, presidente.” My president, forever.

W7ZWGMY1JX_QY4M2UDI2MCRT2O,Data indicates voting by noncitizens is rare. Republicans are pressing measures to make sure of it,By DAVID A. LIEB,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/noncitizens-voting-republicans-election-2024-immigration-09b86e6768f755fd875f3c51b0e8ea70,"Only U.S. citizens are eligible to vote in this fall’s election for president and other top offices. While that’s nothing new, the potential for noncitizens to register or vote has been receiving a lot of attention lately.
Citing an influx of immigrants in recent years at the U.S.-Mexico border, Republicans have raised concerns about the possibility that noncitizens will be voting — something that has rarely occurred in the past. In Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson is seeking to link an extension of federal government spending authority to a proposal requiring states to obtain proof of citizenship when registering people to vote.
In various states, GOP officials have launched reviews of voter rolls, issued executive orders and placed constitutional amendments on state ballots as part of an emphasis on thwarting noncitizen voting. Some Democrats contend the measures could create hurdles for legal voters, are unnecessary and lead people to believe the problem of noncitizens voting is bigger than it really is.
A 1996 U.S. law makes it illegal for noncitizens to vote in elections for president or members of Congress. Violators can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. They can also be deported.
When people register to vote, they confirm under penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens. Federal law requires states to regularly maintain their voter rolls and remove anyone who is ineligible, a process that could identify immigrants living in the country illegally.

No state constitutions explicitly allow noncitizens to vote, and many states have laws that prohibit noncitizens from voting for state offices such as governor or attorney general. But some municipalities in California, Maryland and Vermont, as well as the District of Columbia, do allow voting by noncitizens in some local elections such as for school board and city council.
Congress needs to approve a stopgap spending bill before the Sept. 30 end of the budget year to avoid a government shutdown. At the urging of some Republicans, Johnson is seeking to combine a six-month extension of government spending with a measure requiring proof of citizenship, such as birth certificate or passport, to register to vote.
Johnson said Congress has a responsibility to “ensure that only American citizens can decide American elections.”
The plan is similar to a bill Republicans pushed earlier this year known as the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act. That legislation passed the Republican-led House in July largely along partisan lines but has not come to a vote in the Democratic-led Senate.
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Monday that he opposes the latest Republican attempt to require proof of citizenship for voter registration. He said the stopgap spending bill should be free of “partisan policy changes.”
The Biden administration also has opposed the Republican efforts while asserting that existing laws against noncitizen voting are working.
Data from states indicates that voting by noncitizens is rare, But Republican officials have highlighted voter registration reviews that turned up potential noncitizens.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said last month that more than 6,500 potential noncitizens have been removed from Texas voter rolls since 2021, including 1,930 with “a voter history” who have been referred for investigation by the attorney general’s office. Texas has almost 18 million registered voters.
What to know about the 2024 Election
Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, said in August that he referred for potential prosecution 138 apparent noncitizens found to have voted in a recent election and 459 more who registered but did not vote. Those figures were higher than reviews from previous years but a small fraction of the more than 8 million registered voters in Ohio.
Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, recently announced that 3,251 people previously identified as noncitizens by the federal government are being switched to inactive status on the state’s voter registration rolls. They will be required to provide proof of citizenship and fill out a form to vote this fall. Alabama has more than 3 million registered voters.
In Georgia, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger found that 1,634 potential noncitizens tried to register to vote between 1997 and 2022, though election officials flagged them and none was registered. Georgia registered millions of other voters during that time.
Some election administration experts have said the voter roll reviews show that current tools to flag noncitizen voters are working.
Arizona provides a case study for the long-running attempts by Republicans to prohibit noncitizen voting.
Under a 2004 voter-approved initiative, Arizona required a driver’s license, birth certificate, passport or other similar document to approve a federal voter registration application. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that Arizona cannot require documentary proof of citizenship for people to vote in federal elections.
The state responded by creating two classes of voters. For state and local elections, voters must provide proof of citizenship when they register or have it on file with the state. But because that cannot be required in presidential and congressional elections, tens of thousands of voters who have not provided proof of citizenship are registered only for federal elections.
An August order by a divided U.S. Supreme Court will allow voter registration forms submitted without “documentary proof of citizenship” to be rejected by Arizona counties while litigation over the law continues. People will be able to register to vote in presidential and congressional elections using a different federal form that requires people to swear they are citizens under penalty of perjury, without requiring proof.
Republican-led legislatures in eight states have proposed constitutional amendments on their November ballots declaring that only citizens can vote.
Proposals in Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin would replace existing constitutional provisions stating that “every” citizen or “all” citizens can vote with new wording saying “only” citizens can vote. Supporters contend the current wording does not necessarily bar noncitizens from voting.
In Idaho and Kentucky, the proposed amendments would explicitly state: “No person who is not a citizen of the United States” can vote. Similar wording won approval from Louisiana voters two years ago.
Voters in North Dakota, Colorado, Alabama, Florida and Ohio passed amendments between 2018 and 2022 restricting voting to “only” citizens.
Although noncitizen voting already is prohibited in the state constitution, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry of Louisiana is continuing to draw attention to the issue. He recently signed an executive order requiring state agencies that provide voter registration forms to include a written disclaimer that noncitizens are prohibited from voting.
In Georgia, Raffensperger is requiring every polling place to post a sign in English and Spanish warning noncitizens that it is illegal to vote.
Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, citing “significant growth of the noncitizen population” in the state, set up a special email account to report suspected violations of election laws.
In Wisconsin, Republicans have filed a pair of similar lawsuits in recent weeks that challenge the state’s process for verifying whether a registered voter is a citizen. The lawsuits seek court orders requiring the elections commission to perform checks to ensure there are no registered voters who are noncitizens.
North Carolina Republicans have sued the state election board, alleging it is not enforcing a new law aimed at removing people from voter rolls who seek jury duty exclusions because they are not citizens.
Tennessee’s top election office sent letters in June asking for proof of citizenship from more than 14,000 registered voters, though those who failed to respond won’t be barred from voting. The list was based on data from the state Department of Safety and Homeland Security, which has information about whether residents were U.S. citizens when they first interacted with that department.

WDPTE7DXTH_K8CIRFDPVRQDE21,Takeaways from AP’s report on JD Vance and the Catholic postliberals in his circle of influence,By PETER SMITH and MICHELLE R. SMITH,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-catholicism-postliberals-social-policy-a82350ba78148ab24748c3fe0a20eabe,"Ohio Sen. JD Vance’s 2019 conversion to Catholicism helped shape his political worldview, he has written.
It has also put him in close touch with a Catholic intellectual movement, viewed by some critics as having reactionary or authoritarian leanings, that has been little known to the American public.
That’s changing with Vance’s rise to the national stage as the Republican vice presidential nominee and running mate to former President Donald Trump.
The professors and media personalities in this network are generally known as “postliberal.” Vance has used that term to describe himself as well.
Here are some takeaways from the AP’s reporting on Vance’s Catholicism and the Catholic thinkers in his circle of influence.
It’s a movement primarily among Catholic intellectuals that rejects both the progressive left, with its focus on individual rights and identity, and “economic liberalism,” the ideology that favors a free market and small government.
Postliberals do share Catholic conservatives’ longstanding opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.
But Catholic postliberals want a muscular government — one that they control.
They envision people who share their views taking over government bureaucracies, universities and other institutions from within, replacing entrenched “elites” and acting upon their vision of the “common good.”
“What is needed … is regime change — the peaceful but vigorous overthrow of a corrupt and corrupting liberal ruling class and the creation of a postliberal order,” wrote Patrick Deneen, a prominent author in the movement, in his 2023 book, “Regime Change.”

Vance has identified as postliberal, spoken alongside prominent postliberals at public events, met with them privately and praised some of their work.
And he has taken stances similar to those of other postliberals.
He’s said the next time his allies control the presidency or Congress, “ we really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power.” He has said Republicans should seize institutions, including universities “to make them work for our people.” He’s advocated for government policies to spur childbearing, a notion reflected in his digs at “childless cat ladies” with allegedly no stake in the nation’s future.
The Trump-Vance campaign did not respond to questions about where Vance sees himself in the movement and whether he shares some of the beliefs promoted by many postliberals.
Not big, but it has a following among influential Catholic professors and writers.
But now, postliberals have an avid listener in Donald Trump’s running mate.
“You can go from people writing on an unusual Catholic theology blog to the vice presidential candidate in the course of less than a decade,” said James Patterson, professor of politics at Ave Maria University in Florida.
Some Catholics, including conservatives, have raised alarms about the company Vance has kept. They say postliberalism has historical connections to 20th century European movements that are associated with authoritarian regimes like Francisco Franco’s in Spain.
“We’re talking about people that prefer right-wing authoritarian regimes,” Patterson said. In a postliberal society, he said, citizens become “subjects” and personal liberty subjected to “administrative despotism.”
What to know about the 2024 Election
Postliberals’ ideas vary, but there are common themes, said Kevin Vallier, author of “ All the Kingdoms of the World,” a 2023 book on the modern postliberal and integralist movements and their centuries-old roots.
Depending on who’s talking, a postliberal regime change could involve encouraging childbearing, easing or removing church-state separation, banning pornography for adults and children alike, reimposing laws that limit business on the Sabbath, supporting private-sector unions and strengthening safety nets for the middle class.
It’s common to hear postliberals praising Hungary’s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, who has championed an “illiberal democracy.” Vance himself has praised Orban for Hungary’s financial subsidies to childbearing couples and for “smart decisions” in seizing control of universities.
Vance has said his faith helped shape his political worldview — emphasizing the need to promote both individual moral responsibility and social reform.
But Vance has recently tried to downplay his Catholicism’s impact on policy-making.
Trump’s Supreme Court appointees provided the crucial majority to overturn Roe v. Wade, which had legalized abortion nationwide.
But the issue has become a political liability, with voters in several states rejecting abortion restrictions.
Vance strongly opposed abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, in the runup to his 2022 senatorial win. But Vance has aligned with the Republicans’ first post-Roe platform in 2024, in which it backed off from its longstanding support for nationwide abortion restrictions.
Vance told the New York Post in August that Catholic social teaching “certainly influences how I think about issues.” But he said he accepted that there are “a lot of things the Catholic Church teaches that frankly, Americans would just never go for.”
Vance has other influences besides postliberals, said Julian Waller, a political science professor at George Washington University.
“Someone like JD Vance can read them, be interested in them, attend talks, know them personally, get insights from them,” Waller said. “But he’s not on the hook to obey them.”
For an example of what an administration using state power for postliberal ends might look like, Waller pointed to Florida and Gov. Ron DeSantis’ efforts to rid public higher education of diversity initiatives and critical race theory.
“Forcefully changing institutions, capturing institutions. He’s interested in firing federal bureaucrats. This has been a long standing interest, that he’s interested in reformatting or abolishing certain departments.”

WEJ07CN6YL_NDTSS0DB5IQ5C6D,The EU wants answers from Hungary about work visas for Russia and Belarus,By LORNE COOK,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/eu-hungary-russia-belarus-visas-03d840066a0e6940a7e3409a370ee50c,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union’s top migration official expressed concern on Wednesday about a Hungarian work visa program open to citizens from Russia and Belarus, just as sabotage attacks and spying allegations raise alarm across Europe.
Hungary extended its National Card program to citizens from Russia and Belarus as it took over the EU’s rotating presidency in July. It happened as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán traveled to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a trip slammed by his EU counterparts.
The card also allows easier entry into Europe’s ID-check free zone for work purposes to citizens from Bosnia, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Ukraine. All six countries are candidates to join the EU. Russia and Belarus are not.
“It’s a bit strange to actually welcome specifically citizens from Russia and Belarus in a situation where we know that these countries are hostile to the European Union,” European Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told EU lawmakers.
The Hungarian prime minister, widely seen as having the warmest relations with Putin among EU leaders, has routinely blocked, delayed or watered down EU efforts to assist Kyiv and impose sanctions on Moscow for its actions in Ukraine.
Belarus is Russia’s main ally and has served as a rear base for Russian troops.
Johansson listed a series of incidents since Russia’s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, including sabotage or hacking attacks in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland. She also noted possible threats to military bases in Germany.

“This is a time for more vigilance, not less. This is not a time to be soft on security,” she said, adding that safe travel within the passport-free zone linking 29 countries, most of them EU nations, could be undermined. “We must keep each other safe.”
Early last month, Johansson sent a letter to Hungary seeking clarification about its National Card, notably whether the program imposes stricter security checks on Russian and Belarus nationals. She received a reply two weeks ago but on Tuesday wanted to know more.
Johansson asked: “Why does the Hungarian government consider such a scheme necessary or appropriate in the current political situation? The expected national economic gains seem limited (and) disproportionate to the potential security impact.”
At a news conference in Brussels, Hungarian EU Affairs Minister Janos Boka played down the commission’s concerns. He said that seven countries, including Germany, Latvia, Poland and Spain have issued more visas to Russians.
“In the past two months, 10 permits were issued for Russian citizens and four permits were issued for Belarus from citizens. This is not an increasing trend, and these numbers are statistically irrelevant,” Boka told reporters. Johansson said the number of visas issued to Russians have dropped by almost 90%.
Boka insisted that for Hungary “there is no legal and security issue whatsoever when it comes to the National Card.” Hungarian officials complained that he had not been invited to the European Parliament to address Johansson’s questions in person.
The parliament’s press service said Hungary had not expressed a wish to attend."
X43X2WR50W_P1UT7PM9EIS2GWX,Can the city of Savannah fine or jail people for leaving guns in unlocked cars? A judge weighs in,By RUSS BYNUM,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-guns-vehicles-savannah-lawsuit-4e79c98cd9956962738ea06c688c3d52,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — A Georgia gun owner’s attorney asked a judge Wednesday to halt enforcement of a Savannah city ordinance that imposes fines and possibly jail time for people who leave guns inside unlocked cars.
The lawsuit by Clarence Belt could ultimately determine whether city officials successfully found a niche where they can legally regulate gun safety in a state where Republican lawmakers have widely abolished restrictions on owning and carrying firearms.
Savannah’s mayor and city council voted unanimously in April to outlaw keeping firearms in unlocked vehicles, with maximum penalties of a $1,000 fine and 30 days in jail. They said the law would make it harder for criminals to steal guns, and cited local police statistics showing more than 200 guns reported stolen last year from vehicles that weren’t locked.
Belt filed suit in May. He lives in Jesup, Georgia, about 66 miles (106 kilometers) southwest of Savannah, but says he frequently visits the coastal city for shopping, eating and doctor appointments. His lawyer, John Monroe, says Belt carries a gun in his vehicle and fears being cited.
“He’s disabled and it’s difficult for him to comply with the ordinance,” said Monroe, who gave no further details about Belt’s disability during a court hearing Wednesday. “He also doesn’t want to comply with the ordinance.”
Chatham County Superior Court Judge Benjamin Karpf didn’t rule Wednesday on Belt’s motion to halt enforcement of the Savannah ordinance while considering his underlying lawsuit that seeks to have it thrown out permanently.

Monroe said Savannah’s ordinance should be voided because it violates a state law prohibiting local governments from regulating “the possession, ownership, transport, (or) carrying” of firearms.
Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, a Republican, made the same argument in a May letter to Savannah officials stating that “no local ordinance can regulate firearms.” City officials ignored Carr’s warning that they could face civil liability for enforcing the ordinance.
Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, a Democrat and a former police officer, has supported the city’s ordinance as a way to make gun owners act responsibly without infringing on their rights to own or carry firearms.
Bates Lovett, Savannah’s city government attorney, noted in court Wednesday that the state law cited by Belt’s lawyer and Carr doesn’t expressly say local governments can’t regulate gun storage.
Lovett also argued that Savannah’s ordinance isn’t primarily about guns.
“We’re regulating the vehicle, not the firearm,” Lovett told the judge, adding that it’s perfectly legal in Savannah to store a gun in a car. “But once you leave the vehicle, you must lock that vehicle.”
Monroe said Georgia courts have struck down attempts by other local governments to “indirectly” regulate guns, and that any limitations on gun storage by cities should be considered illegal restrictions on possession and ownership.
Savannah police had only issued three citations and one warning for guns left in unlocked cars as of Aug. 15, the Savannah Morning News reported. The police department did not immediately provide an updated total Wednesday to The Associated Press.
Before deciding whether to block Savannah’s gun ordinance, the judge said he first has questions about whether Belt has legal standing to sue the city because he’s not a resident. He gave the lawyers until Sept. 16 to file written briefs on the issue.
Monroe said his client’s residency shouldn’t matter because Savannah’s ordinance applies to residents and visitors. Belt did not attend the court hearing Wednesday.
If Karpf allows Belt’s lawsuit to move forward, the judge predicted a protracted legal battle that could wind through multiple Georgia courts.
“I don’t have any illusion about having the final word on this,” Karpf said."
XE6Y4DW0EC_CTRJ8CUU10HGAR2,EU ministers take a very public swipe at Hungary over a lack of respect for the bloc’s values,By LORNE COOK,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/hungary-eu-rule-law-rights-media-presidency-ace8c12b2d63ac8d570cda0567f314a8,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Senior government ministers from Ireland, Luxembourg and Belgium took a very public swipe at Hungary on Tuesday, raising questions about whether Prime Minister Vitkor Orbán’s stridently nationalist cabinet respects European Union values and standards.
Hungary took over the 27-nation bloc’s rotating presidency in July. Orbán immediately made a surprise trip to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, angering several of his EU counterparts, who insisted that the Hungarian leader did not represent them.
“I will ask also my colleague (European Affairs Minister János Bóka) if tomorrow he plans a trip to Moscow, because this seems to be a habit for Hungarian politicians,” Luxembourg Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel said at a meeting in Budapest.
Beyond its ties with Russia, Orbán’s government has irritated its EU partners by promoting hostility to migrants and LGBTQ+ rights, and by controlling public media. Millions of euros in EU funds have also been frozen over concerns about democratic backsliding in Hungary.
Bettel, his Belgian counterpart Hadja Lahbib and Irish European Affairs Minister Jennifer Carroll McNeill said that they had held joint meetings with members of the Hungarian media, civil society and LGBTQ+ representatives ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, which Bóka chaired.
“This is extremely important to us in Ireland: human rights, fundamental freedoms, rule of law,” Carroll McNeill said. “I’m pleased to be here with my colleagues to just further discuss the rule of law and the concerns that we have and as they relate to the future of Europe.”

The ministers made their statements directly to a Hungarian TV camera, without prompting from reporters. It was an unusual and potentially embarrassing public display for Hungary, given that EU member countries rarely criticize each other in public.
Lahbib said she would send a message that “the Hungarian presidency should be ambitious, that it works to unite, to build bridges between the 27 European Union member states.” She urged Budapest to lift its veto on EU funds helping to supply weapons to Ukraine.
Many EU countries have been sending lower-level officials to meetings hosted by Hungary in protest at its conduct. Last week, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also used his convening powers to shift a gathering of the bloc’s foreign ministers from Budapest to Brussels.
At Tuesday’s meeting, things were taken to a new level.
“For me it was important to be in Budapest today. You know, big questions: do we come, don’t we come, should we come, is it good to come, is it better to boycott,” Bettel mused. “Not being here would, I think, be an error. But being here means also to be loud.”
Bóka played down the tensions, saying that the ministers had informed him of their meetings and that he saw no problem with this.
He said that more than half of the member countries were represented at senior level, although he conceded that the EU’s executive branch, the European Commission, had not sent one of its policy commissioners as it usually does.
“The atmosphere of today’s council reflected a sense of cooperation, and a willingness on the part of member states to cooperate with the Hungarian presidency, and I welcome this,” Bóka told reporters after the meeting had concluded.
Hungary’s mandate at the EU helm ends on Dec. 31."
XQQ5MFZGGZ_5HZ416Q5B1ZVRC3,Harris opposes US Steel’s sale to a Japanese firm during joint Pennsylvania event with Biden,"By COLLEEN LONG, WILL WEISSERT and ERIN B. LOGAN",_,20240902,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/harris-biden-election-2024-afd4b7fbd9d747e307a8fb5c1f60d5fa,"PITTSBURGH (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris used a joint campaign appearance with President Joe Biden in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania on Monday to say that U.S. Steel should remain domestically owned — concurring with the White House’s monthslong opposition to the company’s planned sale to Japan’s Nippon Steel.
Her comments came during a rally before cheering union members marking Labor Day in the industrial city of Pittsburgh, where Harris said U.S. Steel was “an historic American company and it is vital for our country to maintain strong American steel companies.”
“U.S. Steel should remain American-owned and American-operated, and I will always have the backs of America’s steelworkers,” she said.
That echoes Biden, who repeated Monday what he’s said since March — that he opposes U.S. Steel’s would-be sale to Nippon, believing it would hurt the country’s steelworkers. It also overlaps with Republican former President Donald Trump. It’s little surprise that Harris would agree with Biden on the issue, but it nonetheless constitutes a major policy position for the vice president, who has offered relatively few of them since Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed his vice president in July.
Biden took the stage first and was met with chants of “Thank You, Joe” as he and Harris appeared in an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hall.
The president called Harris the only “rational” choice for president in November. He said choosing her to be vice president was the “single best” decision of his presidency and told the union members that electing her will be “the best decision you will ever make.”

Biden also started to say, “Kamala Harris and I are going to build on this” as if he were still running and she was his running mate — but he corrected himself. It underscored just how much the race has changed and how Harris has been careful to balance presenting herself as “a new way forward” while remaining intensely loyal to Biden and the policies he has pushed.
Her delivery is very different — and in some cases she’s pushed to move faster than Biden’s administration — but the overall goal of expanding government programs to buoy the middle class is the same.
“We know this is going to be a tight race till the very end,” Harris told the Pittsburgh crowd.
The joint rally with Biden was Harris’ second of the day and followed Pittsburgh’s Labor Day parade, one of the country’s largest. It was their first joint appearance at a campaign event since the election shakeup six weeks ago.
Harris opened her Labor Day campaigning solo with an event in Detroit, where hundreds of audience members wore bright yellow union shirts and hoisted “Union strong” signs. The vice president said “every person in our nation has benefited” from unions’ work.
“Everywhere I go, I tell people, ‘Look, you may not be a union member, you’d better thank a union member,” Harris said, noting that collective bargaining by organized labor helped secure the five-day work week, sick pay and other key benefits and solidify safer working conditions.
“When unions are strong, America is strong,” she said.
What to know about the 2024 Election
The 81-year-old Biden has spent most of his lengthy political career forging close ties with organized labor. The White House said he asked to introduce Harris in Pittsburgh — instead of the usual other way around — because he wanted to highlight her record of supporting union workers.
In addition to opposing the Nippon Steel sale, Biden has endorsed expanding tariffs on imported Chinese steel — another area of policy agreement with Trump, who has cheered steeper foreign tariffs on many imports. Still, in a statement Monday, U.S. Steel said it remains “committed to the transaction with Nippon Steel, which is the best deal for our employees, shareholders, communities, and customers.”
“The partnership with Nippon Steel, a long-standing investor in the United States from our close ally Japan, will strengthen the American steel industry, American jobs, and American supply chains, and enhance the U.S. steel industry’s competitiveness and resilience against China,” the company said, noting that it employs nearly 4,000 people in Pennsylvania alone.
Nippon Steel reacted to Harris’ comments by saying it was confident that its “acquisition of U. S. Steel will revitalize the American steel rust belt, benefit American workers, local communities, and national security in a way no other alternative can.” The Harris campaign released a statement countering that sentiment from David McCall, president of the United Steelworkers union, who said Harris’ opposition to the sale “once again made it clear that she will always stand up for steelworkers.”
The 59-year-old Harris has sought to appeal to voters by positioning herself as a break from former president Trump’s acerbic rhetoric while also looking to move beyond the Biden era. Harris events feel very different from Biden’s, which usually featured small crowds. But the vice president’s agenda includes the same issues he’s championed: capping the cost of prescription drugs, defending the Affordable Care Act, growing the economy, helping families afford child care — and now her position on the sale of U.S. Steel.
The vice president has promised to work to lower grocery store costs to help fight inflation. She’s moved faster than Biden in some cases, calling for using tax cuts and incentives to encourage home ownership and ending federal taxes on tips for service industry employees. But she’s also offered relatively few specifics on major policies, instead continuing to side with Biden on top issues.
Harris appeared onstage with Biden after the president addressed the opening night of last month’s Democratic National Convention, but they had not shared a microphone at a political event since Biden himself was running against Trump. At that time, the campaign was using Harris mostly as its chief spokeswoman for abortion rights, an issue they believe can help them win in November as restrictions grow and health care worsens for women following the fall of Roe v. Wade.
For more than 3 1/2 years, Harris has been one of Biden’s chief validators. Now the tables are turned, as Harris looks to lean on Biden — a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania — to help win the potentially decisive state.
Although the vice president has appeared more forceful in speaking about the plight of civilians in Gaza, as Israel’s war against Hamas there nears the 11-month mark, she also has endorsed Biden’s efforts to arm Israel and bring about a hostage deal and ceasefire. Before she left Washington for Detroit, Biden and Harris met in the White House Situation Room earlier Monday with the U.S. hostage deal negotiating team.
“History will show what we here know: Joe Biden has been one of the most transformative presidents,” Harris said in Pittsburgh. “And as we know Joe still has a lot of work to do.”
When that event was over, Biden and Harris rode back to the airport together in the presidential limo. Air Force One and Air Force Two subsequently took off within moments of each other to return to suburban Washington — though the president and vice president never travel on the same plane for continuity of government reasons, just in case of an air emergency.

XWRMFQBIMB_TF4UDQULIFH3P98,Trial expected to focus on shooter’s competency in 2021 Colorado supermarket massacre,By COLLEEN SLEVIN,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/colorado-supermarket-shooting-ahmad-alissa-boulder-80754900be687b1fcf1169675ec56595,"DENVER (AP) — A man sitting in his van after fixing a coffee machine inside a supermarket in the college town of Boulder was the first person killed. In just over a minute, nine more people died in a barrage of gunfire inside and outside the store in 2021 as the shooter targeted and pursued people who were moving.
Survivors fled out of the back of the store to escape the bullets. For more than an hour, others hid in shelves, checkout stands and offices.
Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, then 21, surrendered after being shot in the leg by a police officer in the store, emerging wearing only his underwear and repeatedly asking officers to call his mother. His attorneys don’t dispute he was the shooter.
But why he carried out the mass shooting remains unknown as his trial is set to begin this week. Public questioning of potential jurors began Tuesday with opening statements expected before the end of the week. Alissa is charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder, 15 counts of attempted murder and other offenses, including having six high-capacity ammunition magazine devices banned in Colorado after previous mass shootings.
The closest thing to a possible motive revealed so far was when a mental health evaluator testified during a competency hearing last year that Alissa said he bought firearms to carry out a mass shooting and suggested that he wanted police to kill him.
Robert Olds, whose 25-year-old niece Rikki Olds was the manager Alissa fatally shot at close range near the entrance, plans to sit in his usual spot in the front row throughout the trial. He has sometimes wished Alissa had just died in the attack. But he has held out hope that he would one day learn why his niece, known for her sense of humor and outgoing personality, and the others were killed. He has become less hopeful of that but is certain Alissa knew what he was doing.

“I hope he goes to prison for the rest of his life, and then he’ll serve the real penalty when he has to meet God and answer for killing 10 people,” he said.
The trial is expected to focus largely on Alissa’s mental state at the time of the shooting. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. His lawyers argue he should be acquitted because his mental illness prevented him from being able to tell right from wrong.
The defense argued in a court filing that his relatives said he irrationally believed that the FBI was following him and that he would talk to himself as if he were talking to someone who was not there. However, prosecutors point out Alissa was never previously treated for mental illness and was able to work up to 60 hours a week leading up to the shooting, something they say would not have been possible for someone severely mentally ill.
Alissa’s trial has been delayed because experts repeatedly found he was not able to understand legal proceedings and help his defense. But after Alissa improved after being forcibly medicated, Judge Ingrid Bakke ruled in October that he was mentally competent, allowing proceedings to resume.
Prosecutors will have the burden of proving he was sane, attempting to show Alissa that knew what he was doing and intended to kill people in the store.
Authorities have not explained why Alissa bypassed a King Soopers near his home in the Denver suburb of Arvada and drove about 15 miles (24 kilometers) to the chain’s store in Boulder, a city he had never visited before the shooting, according to the defense.
Prosecutors have presented evidence that, in the months before the shooting, Alissa had researched things like how to move and shoot with an assault rifle and what kinds of bullets are the most deadly. One court document noted without elaboration that he searched for information about the “Christ Church attacks,” an apparent reference to the livestreamed shooting attacks by a white nationalist on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, that killed 51 people in 2019.
Alissa immigrated from Syria with his family as a toddler. He lived with his family in Arvada, where they owned a restaurant.
The only known problem Alissa had before the shooting was an incident in high school in 2018 when he was convicted of assaulting a fellow student, according to police documents. A former classmate also told The Associated Press that Alissa was kicked off the wrestling team after yelling he would kill everyone following a loss in a practice match.
A sister-in-law who lived in Alissa’s home told police that he had been playing with what she thought was a “machine gun” two days before the shooting before two relatives took it away, according to court documents.
Several of Alissa’s relatives are listed as potential witnesses for the defense during the trial.
Both sides will rely on experts to testify about his sanity, possibly including videos of their interviews with Alissa, said defense lawyer Karen Steinhauser, a former prosecutor and University of Denver law professor.
If jurors don’t believe Alissa was legally insane, they could also consider whether his mental illness prevented him from being able to act with deliberation and intent and find him guilty of second-degree murder instead, she said.
A sanity evaluation done by experts at the state mental hospital found Alissa was legally sane at the time of the attack, according to details provided by the defense in a court hearing this spring. According to the defense, the evaluators found the attack would not have happened but for Alissa’s untreated mental illness, which attorney Sam Dunn said was schizophrenia that included “auditory hallucinations.”
Olds said he is bracing himself to learn more horrific details about the shooting, including surveillance video not previously shown in public.
But he said having the trial behind him will help him and many of the families finally grieve what they’ve lost, he said.
“There’s no such thing as moving on. It’s finding other ways to live without your loved one,” he said."
Y7ZHY0QRAI_KJ1GN9AUGPX21Y1,Oregon hospital hit with $303M lawsuit after a nurse is accused of replacing fentanyl with tap water,_,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/oregon-hospital-nurse-fentanyl-6fc5a74badcb1bcbf8396f2d9bce024f,"MEDFORD, Ore. (AP) — Attorneys representing both living and deceased patients of an Oregon hospital filed a $303 million lawsuit against the facility on Tuesday after a nurse was accused of replacing prescribed fentanyl with nonsterile tap water in intravenous drips.
The wrongful death and medical malpractice complaint accuses Asante Rogue Regional Medical Center in Medford of negligence. The suit says the hospital failed to monitor medication administration procedures and prevent drug diversion by their employees, among other claims.
A spokesperson said the hospital had no comment.
Dani Marie Schofield, a former nurse at the hospital, was arrested in June and charged with 44 counts of second-degree assault. The charges stemmed from a police investigation into the theft and misuse of controlled substances that resulted in patient infections. She has pleaded not guilty.
Schofield is not named or listed as a defendant in the complaint filed Tuesday. A separate suit was filed against Schofield and the hospital earlier this year on behalf of the estate of a 65-year-old man who died.
The 18 plaintiffs in the new suit include nine patients and the estates of nine patients who died. According to the suit, the hospital began informing them in December that an employee had replaced fentanyl with tap water, causing bacterial infections.
“All Plaintiff Patients were infected with bacterium uniquely associated with waterborne transmission,” the complaint says.

All of the plaintiffs experienced mental anguish, according to the suit, which seeks millions of dollars in damages for medical expenses, lost income and the pain and suffering of those who died.
Medford police began investigating late last year, after hospital officials noticed a troubling spike in central line infections from July 2022 through July 2023 and told police they believed an employee had been diverting fentanyl.
Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid that has helped fuel the nation’s overdose epidemic, but it is also used in legitimate medical settings to relieve severe pain. Drug theft from hospitals is a longstanding problem."
YB224A9PIQ_22C9CHP8555WMN2,"California lawmakers approve legislation to ban deepfakes, protect workers and regulate AI",By TRÂN NGUYỄN,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/california-ai-election-deepfakes-safety-regulations-eb6bbc80e346744dbb250f931ebca9f3,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California lawmakers approved a host of proposals this week aiming to regulate the artificial intelligence industry, combat deepfakes and protect workers from exploitation by the rapidly evolving technology.
The California Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, is voting on hundreds of bills during its final week of the session to send to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk. Their deadline is Saturday.
The Democratic governor has until Sept. 30 to sign the proposals, veto them or let them become law without his signature. Newsom signaled in July he will sign a proposal to crack down on election deepfakes but has not weighed in other legislation.
He warned earlier this summer that overregulation could hurt the homegrown industry. In recent years, he often has cited the state’s budget troubles when rejecting legislation that he would otherwise support.
Here is a look at some of the AI bills lawmakers approved this year.
Citing concerns over how AI tools are increasingly being used to trick voters and generate deepfake pornography of minors, California lawmakers approved several bills this week to crack down on the practice.
Lawmakers approved legislation to ban deepfakes related to elections and require large social media platforms to remove the deceptive material 120 days before Election Day and 60 days thereafter. Campaigns also would be required to publicly disclose if they’re running ads with materials altered by AI.

A pair of proposals would make it illegal to use AI tools to create images and videos of child sexual abuse. Current law does not allow district attorneys to go after people who possess or distribute AI-generated child sexual abuse images if they cannot prove the materials are depicting a real person.
Tech companies and social media platforms would be required to provide AI detection tools to users under another proposal.
California could become the first state in the nation to set sweeping safety measures on large AI models.
The legislation sent by lawmakers to the governor’s desk requires developers to start disclosing what data they use to train their models. The efforts aim to shed more light into how AI models work and prevent future catastrophic disasters.
Another measure would require the state to set safety protocols preventing risks and algorithmic discrimination before agencies could enter any contract involving AI models used to define decisions.
Inspired by the months-long Hollywood actors strike last year, lawmakers approved a proposal to protect workers, including voice actors and audiobook performers, from being replaced by their AI-generated clones. The measure mirrors language in the contract the SAG-AFTRA made with studios last December.
State and local agencies would be banned from using AI to replace workers at call centers under one of the proposals.
California also may create penalties for digitally cloning dead people without consent of their estates.
As corporations increasingly weave AI into Americans’ daily lives, state lawmakers also passed several bills to increase AI literacy.
One proposal would require a state working group to consider incorporating AI skills into math, science, history and social science curriculums. Another would develop guideline on how schools could use AI in the classrooms."
YKOHO7Y3GK_ZMCZZIE0RDNDO2C,Supreme Court won’t allow Oklahoma to reclaim federal money in dispute over abortion referrals,By MARK SHERMAN,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-oklahoma-family-planning-title-x-3df24e69294f513e68634e6d6a146cf1,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected Oklahoma’s emergency appeal seeking to restore a $4.5 million grant for family planning services in an ongoing dispute over the state’s refusal to refer pregnant women to a nationwide hotline that provides information about abortion and other options.
The brief order did not detail the court’s reasoning, as is typical, but says three justices — Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch — would have sided with Oklahoma.
Lower courts had ruled that the federal Health and Human Services Department’s decision to cut off Oklahoma from the funds did not violate federal law.
The case stems from a dispute over state abortion restrictions and federal grants provided under a family planning program known as Title X that has only grown more heated since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and many Republican-led states outlawed abortion.
Clinics cannot use federal family planning money to pay for abortions, but they must offer information about abortion at the patient’s request, under the federal regulation at issue. The Oklahoma Attorney General’s office did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
Oklahoma argues that it can’t comply with a requirement to provide abortion counseling and referrals because the state’s abortion ban makes it a crime for “any person to advise or procure an abortion for any woman.”

The administration said it offered an accommodation that would allow referrals to the national hotline, but the state rejected that as insufficient. The federal government then cut off the state’s Title X funds.
In 2021, the Biden administration reversed a ban on abortion referrals by clinics that accept Title X funds. The restriction was initially enacted during the Donald Trump administration in 2019, but the policy has swung back and forth for years, depending upon who is in the White House.
Tennessee is pursuing a similar lawsuit that remains in the lower courts. Oklahoma and 10 other states also are mounting a separate challenge to the federal regulation.
Oklahoma says it distributes the money to around 70 city and county health departments for family planning, infertility help and services for adolescents. For rural communities especially, the government-run health facilities can be “the only access points for critical preventative services for tens or even hundreds of miles,” Oklahoma said in its Supreme Court filing.

Z2XTDQNLFU_76P22MJJI068O9C,Ex-doctor pleads guilty to manslaughter in connection with suicide of upstate New York woman,By MICHAEL HILL,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/assisted-suicide-homicide-new-york-9c385103705504b06c374f66c46119a8,"KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) — An 85-year-old former doctor from Arizona charged for his role in the suicide of a woman in an upstate New York motel room pleaded guilty to manslaughter Tuesday under an agreement that spares him from prison.
Stephen Miller, of Tucson, was arrested earlier this year on a charge of second-degree manslaughter under a provision of New York law that allows the charge for intentionally causing or aiding another person’s suicide.
Under a plea agreement, Miller was sentenced to five years of probation after his guilty plea in state court. His attorney said Miller is infirm and did not want to die in prison.
Miller had traveled from Arizona to be with the woman at the time of her death at the motel in Kingston, about 80 miles (120 kilometers) north of New York City. The woman’s body was found Nov. 9 by housekeeping staff. Authorities concluded the woman had died “by means of assisted suicide,” according to the Ulster County district attorney’s office.
His attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, said after court that Miller simply provided comfort and “very slight technical assistance” to a woman who couldn’t live with the debilitating pain that had plagued her for decades. Lichtman has said the woman reached out to Miller because of his work with the advocacy group, Choice and Dignity.
“Technically, he violated the law,” Lichtman told reporters. “We accept that, but with the understanding that morally, Stephen Miller did nothing wrong.”

In court, Miller answered questions from Judge Bryan Rounds in a soft voice, mostly sticking to “yes” or “no” responses until the judge asked him: “Are you pleading guilty because you are, in fact, guilty of manslaughter in the second degree?”
“By your definition, yes,” Miller answered.
The judge asked the question again after explaining it was the definition found in state law. Miller then answered, “yes.”
Miller declined to speak to reporters after his appearance.
While Miller still supports legal assisted suicide, his attorney said he will not provide assistance in the future.
“That part of his life is over,” Lichtman said.
Miller had also been initially charged with two counts of assault. He pleaded not guilty in February, posted bail and returned to Arizona.
A text seeking comment was sent to the district attorney’s office.
Miller had previously lost his license to practice medicine upon his conviction for tax fraud in Texas, Lichtman has said. Miller was convicted in 2006 and sentenced to just under four years in prison, according to a Department of Justice news release at the time.
Several states allow medical aid in dying, though efforts to legalize it in New York have stalled in the state Legislature.

Z7ONWV1VUS_GO9MCHW7U0X02CR,Colombian truckers block highways in main cities in protest over increases in fuel prices,By MANUEL RUEDA,_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/colombia-truckers-protest-fuel-subsidies-ef0b6e13829b1e6f6e006e95509a2c9e,"BOGOTÁ, Colombia (AP) — Thousands of Colombians were forced to walk to work on Tuesday, as truckers in major cities blocked highways to protest a recent increase in the price of diesel fuel.
Truckers unions have said that plans by the government to eliminate diesel fuel subsidies would push their businesses to the brink of bankruptcy, while the administration of left-wing President Gustavo Petro argues it must phase out subsidies to cut a growing budget deficit and direct more funds to education and health.
On Saturday, the government raised the price of diesel fuel to around $2.90 per gallon, an increase of 50 cents, following numerous meetings with truckers unions.
In response, the unions have been holding protests around the country, which intensified on Tuesday, with roadblocks in the cities of Bogotá, Medellin and Cali, that have diminished the amount of food arriving at wholesale markets.
Diego Torres, a trucker who transports bricks in Bogotá, said that with the new fuel prices he would lose money with every load of construction material that he carries around the city. He said that truckers in Colombia are already facing other problems, including higher crime rates along rural roads.
“I am willing to stay at this protest for a day or two days or three,” Torres said, “because we are tired” of the difficult conditions.
Petro wrote on social media platform X that he would not let truckers unions “block” the country. The former activist, who has led numerous protests throughout his career, wrote Tuesday that fuel subsidies had to be removed in order to “reduce public debt” and “finance the health and education of Colombians.”

Subsidies for diesel fuel have been implemented in Colombia for decades, and previous governments have kept them in place, fearing that a removal could lead to massive protests and increases in food prices.
According to Colombia’s Finance Ministry, diesel fuel subsidies cost the Colombian government around $240 million each month paid out to the state oil company Ecopetrol.
Some economists in Colombia have suggested that Ecopetrol sell its diesel fuel for a cheaper price within the country, but that would cut deeply into the company’s margins, and affect shareholders of Ecopetrol, which is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
The government says it is planning to remove diesel fuel subsidies in three stages to enable transport companies to plan for the increase in prices. Officials have said, however, that they are willing to meet with truckers unions to discuss ways of compensating them for their higher operational costs.
The debate over fuel subsidies comes as the Finance Ministry gets ready to present a tax reform plan to Colombia’s congress that seeks to raise government revenues by $3 billion next year.
Officials have said they are planning to increase wealth taxes and taxes on personal income that does not come from wages. The finance ministry has also said it plans to increase sales taxes on hybrid cars and online betting.
During the first two years of Petro’s administration, the government’s annual budget has increased by around 30%, as he tries to boost spending on social welfare programs, and increases the number of public servants."
ZFQLAZ2TDY_BN3T0KPYY1OML0H,Why is Beijing interested in a mid-level government aide in New York State?,By HUIZHONG WU,_,20240905,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/linda-sun-chinese-influence-new-york-328b9d2862dac908a827f18f106e258e,"BANGKOK (AP) — The decision by New York prosecutors to charge a former aide to the New York governor this week with acting as an illegal agent for the Chinese government has raised concerns about China’s efforts to influence U.S. politics.
Linda Sun held numerous roles in New York state government, including deputy chief of staff for Gov. Kathy Hochul. She is accused of pushing Chinese interests at state functions, including allegedly blocking representatives from Taiwan from meeting the governor, in exchange for financial benefits worth millions of dollars.
Sun’s arrest on Tuesday is the latest, and perhaps most high profile, in a series of cases the U.S. Department of Justice has prosecuted in recent years to root out Beijing’s agents on U.S. soil.
While previous cases involved charges against suspected Chinese spies for reporting on and surveilling dissidents critical of the Communist Party, Tuesday’s case appeared to show how China is trying to directly influence U.S. politics in line with its interests, even at the local level.
China sees it as important to cultivate state-level relationships with U.S. officials, and has always done so.
Although the bilateral relationship between the U.S. and China has become increasingly tense, the two countries had cultivated extensive regional-level ties in the 2010s, with U.S. governors frequently visiting China to boost trade and cultural ties.

That’s taken a sharp 180-degree turn in recent years, as the U.S. government’s relationship with China grows more confrontational and being tough on China has become a bipartisan point of consensus. The White House and Congress are leveling high tariffs on Chinese products and limiting export of high-tech products to China.
Some states are even passing bills to actively ban China’s presence. Georgia, Florida, and Alabama are just some of the states that banned Chinese “agents” from buying real estate.
Seeking influence on the state level has “increased in importance as relations at the federal level have soured,” said Mareike Ohlberg, senior fellow in the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, who studies China. “Something is better than nothing.”
China’s Communist Party has a branch specifically tasked with overseas work, called the United Front. Under the United Front’s control are a multitude of groups which serve to engage overseas Chinese under the guise of social or industry groups. Well-known among these groups is the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, which itself oversees a number of smaller groups.
The groups seek to build membership overseas and engage with the Chinese diaspora, and has branches all over the world, from Africa to Southeast Asia to North America.
Willy Lam, a senior fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, said the Chinese government has a long history of targeting major U.S. cities and states with large Chinese populations such as New York, New Jersey, Los Angeles and San Francisco, where Beijing’s operatives have been working with established, “well-built” associations and trade groups for overseas Chinese.
It pays for those local groups for work with Beijing, while the setup spares Beijing a lot of legwork on the ground, Lam said.
Sun was linked with Shi Qianping, who has described himself as a standing committee member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, according to Chinese state media. Shi also held the role of the head of the U.S. Federation of Chinese-American Entrepreneurs, according to Xinhua.
Sun also engaged with regional-level branches of the Returned Overseas Chinese group, like in Jiangsu province, where Sun was born, according to the group.
Aside from these groups, there are also growing worries about overseas Chinese police stations, set up without the knowledge of the countries they operate in. Last year, New York police arrested two men for allegedly setting up a secret police station for a Chinese provincial police agency.
Sun’s case, which at first glance may seem the stuff of spy films, showed that China was interested in cultivating influence on a subtle level — for example by promoting messages in line with Beijing’s views.
Prosecutors said Sun solicited talking points from a Chinese official for a video Hochul recorded when she was lieutenant governor to wish people a happy Lunar New Year. She specifically kept Hochul from mentioning Chinese human rights issues in that video, prosecutors say. Sun also allegedly blocked representatives of Taiwan’s government from meeting with top New York state officials. China claims Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy, as part of its own territory and views any interaction between Taiwanese government representatives and other governments as an infringement of its sovereignty claim.
Speeches by Chinese President Xi Jinping and party documents have made it clear that one directive for the party’s overseas work is to rally overseas Chinese around the party’s goals, including urging them to “actively participate in and support” the causes of modernization and peaceful unification for their motherland.
The Chinese government also has been willing to exploit domestic U.S. issues, such as violence against Asian-Americans, to boost its messaging. Sun had claimed to be a representative for the Asian-American community.
“The Chinese government likes to claim to speak for all ethnic Chinese abroad,” said Audrye Wong, a Jeane Kirkpatrick Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. She said the Chinese government sometimes blurs the lines between legitimate cultural and community groups and influence operations.
China is often able to set the agenda when it comes to engagement at the local level. “There’s been quite a mismatch in terms of resources on the PRC side vs US side,” Ohlberg said. For example, the city of Shanghai has hundreds of staffers dedicated to international engagement, while U.S. states may only have a handful.
“There needs to be more strategic thinking going into this, more resources and knowledge, and then once you have that, you can decide,” she said.
Wong added that local governments should reach out to communities of Asian descent instead of relying on one person as a community liaison, as what seemed to have happened in Sun’s case, and “really build infrastructure at the local community level working with legitimate Asian American organizations.”

ZLPNR9K5IX_9Y19IAZ8AAS7WMY,UN nuclear watchdog warns conditions ‘very fragile’ at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia power plant,By DEREK GATOPOULOS and VOLODYMYR YURCHUK,_,20240903,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-grossi-russia-922afda41303b2bc97457646e7589c2f,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The head of the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog on Tuesday described the situation at Europe’s largest nuclear power plant as “very fragile” following fresh attacks near the site in central Ukraine, and vowed to expand the agency’s inspections to include critical electricity supplies.
Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, was making his 10th visit to Ukraine since the Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022.
He was headed to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant after talks in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and top energy officials.
“I think the situation – I have very often characterized it – as very fragile,” Grossi told reporters in the Ukrainian capital. “The station is again on the verge of being on a blackout. We’ve had eight of those in the past. A blackout (means) no power: no power, no cooling. No cooling, then maybe you have a disaster.”
Earlier, Grossi posted on X that he was on his way to Zaporizhzhia to “help prevent a nuclear accident.”
The Zaporizhzhia plant, which came under Russian control in the wake of its full-scale invasion, saw artillery shelling in the area on Monday that damaged the facility’s power access, according to its operator Energoatom, which blamed Russia for the attacks.
“Russian shelling damaged one of the two external overhead lines through which … the Zaporizhzhya NPP receives power from the Ukrainian power system,” the operator said in a post on Telegram. “In the event of damage to the second line, an emergency situation will arise,” the Ukrainian agency said, adding that technicians couldn’t access the site of the damage because of the “real threat of repeated shelling.”

Analysts say an explosion at the Zaporizhzhia plant would produce radiation and likely trigger panic, but the radiation risk beyond the immediate blast area would be relatively low and nothing like the scale of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Also, if the wind is in an easterly direction, radiation could be pushed toward Russia.
The Zaporizhzhia region is one of four — along with Donetsk, Kherson and Luhansk — in southern and eastern Ukraine that Russia partly, and illegally, annexed in September 2022, seven months after it invaded its neighbor.
The Vienna-based IAEA says ongoing attacks in the Zaporizhzhia area, as well as damage to Ukraine’s grid, pose threats to the power supply that’s vital to the country’s nuclear power stations. The watchdog said its staff at Zaporizhzhia recently had to shelter indoors because of reported drone threats in the area.
Other than Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine has three active nuclear plants.
Grossi, who is traveling with a team of IAEA experts and officials, began a round of meetings in Kyiv with a stop at the Ministry of Energy and talks with the minister, Herman Halushchenko. Grossi said he had accepted a Ukrainian request to expand inspections to include electricity substations providing power to Ukraine’s nuclear power plants. He did not give further details but told reporters: “This is a new dimension, an important dimension I hope, of our support here, which we discussed and agreed with President Zelenskyy just now.” ___ Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine, contributed.

ZMV60DI9A4_MU4OD3PFLQB63QC,Arlington cemetery controversy shines spotlight on Utah Gov. Spencer Cox’s sudden embrace of Trump,By HANNAH SCHOENBAUM,_,20240901,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/spencer-cox-trump-utah-governor-arlington-emetery-ee20ad030e170498664f6f8544ddf46a,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A few months ago, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox was one of the few prominent Republicans consistently keeping his distance from Donald Trump, whose brash style seemed to be the antithesis of a brand of politics Cox had carefully cultivated that centered on unity and respect.
Cox did not vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020, and told CNN in July that he would not vote for him this year. The governor said the then-president’s role in inciting the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol went too far.
Days later, after an assassination attempt on Trump at a Pennsylvania rally, Cox changed his mind.
Cox sent a letter to Trump explaining that his defiant response at the moment of the shooting had spurred a sudden reassessment and switch for Cox.
His turnabout bewildered political observers who, for the past decade, have watched Cox methodically build a persona as a moderate in the manner of Mitt Romney, the Utah senator who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, while climbing the ranks of state leadership.
Cox, 49, said in his note that he believed Trump could save the country “by emphasizing unity rather than hate.”
“You probably don’t like me much,” Cox wrote. “But I want you to know that I pledge my support.”
Trump has not in turn endorsed Cox for reelection.
The pair’s puzzling relationship was thrust into the spotlight again this past week when they put themselves at the center of a controversy at Arlington National Cemetery. After Trump’s staff had an altercation with a cemetery official, Cox broke rules — and likely federal law — in using a graveside photo with Trump in a campaign fundraising email.

Federal law prohibits campaign or election-related activities within the Army’s national cemeteries, and officials at Arlington said that rule had been shared widely before Monday’s ceremony honoring 13 service members, including one from Utah, who died in an airport bombing during the Afghanistan withdrawal three years ago.
Cox’s campaign issued a swift apology for politicizing the ceremony; Trump’s has insisted it had permission to film in a restricted area. A TikTok video of the visit shared by Trump includes scenes of him and Cox at the cemetery with a voiceover of the former president blaming the Biden administration for the “disaster” of the withdrawal.
The opposing responses highlight the disconnect between their political styles and reignite questions as to why Cox has chosen to stand by Trump, who said after the assassination attempt that he had no plans to change his ways.
“I’m confident that he was there to support a Utah family, and that’s a laudable goal, but in being there with Donald Trump, he got pulled into something that creates some ethical challenges,” said Chris Karpowitz, a political science professor at Brigham Young University. “He allowed himself to compromise his values, and he’s not the first politician aligning with Donald Trump to have found himself in that position.”
The sudden embrace by Cox, who is up for reelection in a race not expected to be close, is not sitting well with some of the Utah moderates he had worked to win over.
Kyle Douglas of Orem said he lost his trust in Cox when the governor chose to back a presidential candidate who does not share his values.
What to know about the 2024 Election
“I used to be proud that my governor was still one of the good guys,” Douglas said. “It’s so disappointing to see him sell out.”
Lucy Wright of Provo put her disgust more bluntly.
“Trump is a big orange stain on his legacy,” she said.
Karpowitz said he, too, was surprised by Cox’s switch, and recalled thinking the governor’s notion that Trump could be a unifying figure for the nation was “somewhat naive.” Like many in Utah, the professor said he found himself struggling to understand why Cox might have thought backing Trump would help the governor politically.
The decision risks Cox’s reputation with his moderate voting base while likely doing little to win over followers of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement, many of whom booed Cox at the state GOP convention this year.
Aligning with Trump has been known to bolster the political profiles of some Republicans, but the former president has not been quite as influential in Utah.
The state is a rare Republican stronghold that has half-heartedly embraced Trump, whose divisive rhetoric and comments about refugees and immigrants do not sit well with many members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. About half of Utah’s 3.4 million residents belong to the faith known widely as the Mormon church.
Cox, a Latter-day Saint, said he believes God had a hand in saving Trump’s life, even calling it a miracle.
At the time of the July 13 shooting, President Joe Biden was clinging to his party’s nomination in the face of unrelenting pressure from many Democrats to drop out as they feared he might be unable to win reelection after his disastrous debate against Trump in June.
Cox said in his letter to Trump that he was not looking for a Cabinet position or a role on the team, but the governor told The Atlantic he had come to realize he could not have broader influence within the party if he wasn’t on Trump’s side.
Cox has not publicly expressed a desire to run for national office, but he has worked to raise his profile beyond Utah by chairing the National Governors Association. His initiative as chairman, “Disagree Better,” focused on restoring civility in politics.
The governor’s endorsement of Trump came a month after Cox breezed to victory in the primary over ardent Trump supporter Phil Lyman, who espoused false claims of election fraud after the 2020 presidential election. Lyman remained defiant and encouraged his supporters to write his name on the November ballot instead of voting for Cox, who is expected to defeat his Democratic opponent even without the support of the state’s MAGA faction.
Cox is not the first moderate Republican, nor even the first from Utah, to be lured closer to Trump despite previous opposition.
Romney had been one of Trump’s most strident critics in the 2016 election, calling him a phony and a fraud. But after Trump’s victory, Romney met the president for dinner to discuss a top diplomatic job in Trump’s administration. After the meeting, he even praised Trump but has since reverted to being one of Trump’s fiercest Republican critics."
ZU8R83RMSU_XP9QR0G1Z4730G5,Drought forces Kenya’s Maasai and other cattle herders to consider fish and camels,"By ZELIPHA KIROBI, DESMOND TIRO and EVELYNE MUSAMBI",_,20240904,apnews.com,https://apnews.com/article/kenya-maasai-samburu-fish-camels-food-drought-08f4564e3475bcc8ef11afc065005aa1,"KAJIADO, Kenya (AP) — The blood, milk and meat of cattle have long been staple foods for Maasai pastoralists in Kenya, perhaps the country’s most recognizable community. But climate change is forcing the Maasai to contemplate a very different dish: fish.
A recent yearslong drought in Kenya killed millions of livestock. While Maasai elders hope the troubles are temporary and they will be able to resume traditional lives as herders, some are adjusting to a kind of food they had never learned to enjoy.
Fish were long viewed as part of the snake family due to their shape, and thus inedible. Their smell had been unpleasant and odd to the Maasai, who call semi-arid areas home.
“We never used to live near lakes and oceans, so fish was very foreign for us,” said Maasai Council of Elders chair Kelena ole Nchoi. “We grew up seeing our elders eat cows and goats.”
Among the Maasai and other pastoralists in Kenya and wider East Africa — like the Samburu, Somali and Borana — cattle are also a status symbol, a source of wealth and part of key cultural events like marriages as part of dowries.
But the prolonged drought in much of East Africa left carcasses of emaciated cattle strewn across vast dry lands. In early 2023, the Kenya National Drought Management Authority said 2.6 million livestock had died, with an estimated value of 226 billion Kenya shillings ($1.75 billion).
Meanwhile, increasing urbanization and a growing population have reduced available grazing land, forcing pastoralists to adopt new ways to survive.

In Kajiado county near Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, the local government is supporting fish farming projects for pastoralists — and encouraging them to eat fish, too.
Like many other Maasai women, Charity Oltinki previously engaged in beadwork and her husband was in charge of the family’s herd. But the drought killed almost 100 of their cows, and only 50 sheep of their 300-strong flock survived.
“The lands were left bare, with nothing for the cows to graze on,” Oltinki said. “So I decided to set aside a piece of land to rear fish and monitor how they would perform.”
The county government supplied her with pond liners, tilapia fish fingerlings and some feed. Using her savings from membership in a cooperative society, Oltinki secured a loan and had a well dug to ease the challenge of water scarcity.
After six months, the first batch of hundreds of fish was harvested, with the largest selling for up to 300 Kenyan shillings each ($2.30).
Another member of the Maasai community in Kajiado, Philipa Leiyan, started farming fish in addition to keeping livestock.
“When the county government introduced us to this fish farming project, we gladly received it because we considered it as an alternative source of livelihood,” Leiyan said.
The Kajiado government’s initiative started in 2014 and currently works with 600 pastoralists to help diversify their incomes and provide a buffer against the effects of climate change. There was initial reluctance, but the number of participants has grown from about 250 before the drought began in 2022.
“The program has seen some importance,” said Benson Siangot, director of fisheries in Kajiado county, adding that it also addresses issues of food insecurity and malnutrition.
The Maasai share their love for cattle with the Samburu, an ethnic group that lives in arid and semi-arid areas of northern Kenya and speaks a dialect of the Maa language that the Maasai speak.
The recent drought has forced the Samburu to look beyond cattle, too — to camels.
In Lekiji village, Abdulahi Mohamud now looks after 20 camels. The 65-year-old father of 15 lost his 30 cattle during the drought and decided to try an animal more suited to long dry spells.
“Camels are easier to rear as they primarily feed on shrubs and can survive in harsher conditions,” he said. “When the pasture dries out, all the cattle die.”
According to Mohamud, a small camel can be bought for 80,000 to 100,000 Kenyan shillings ($600 to $770) while the price of a cow ranges from 20,000 to 40,000 ($154 to $300).
He saw the camel’s resilience as worth the investment.
In a vast grazing area near Mohamud, 26-year-old Musalia Piti looked after his father’s 60 camels. The family lost 50 cattle during the drought and decided to invest in camels that they can sell whenever they need cattle for traditional ceremonies. Cows among the Samburu are used for dowries.
“You have to do whatever it takes to find cattle for wedding ceremonies, even though our herds may be smaller nowadays,” said Lesian Ole Sempere, a 59-year-old Samburu elder. Offering a cow as a gift to a prospective bride’s parents encourages them to declare their daughter as “your official wife,” he said.
