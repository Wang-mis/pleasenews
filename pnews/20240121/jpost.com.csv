1AXPC6HB9A_39IMCGGH9QCN1CU,"Iran has almost enough uranium for nuclear bomb, US expert reports",BENJAMIN WEINTHAL,"JANUARY 21, 2024 17:44",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-783088,"One of the world’s leading experts on nuclear weapons programs, American physicist David Albright, issued a report stating that Iran’s regime needs roughly a week to produce enough uranium for an atomic bomb.In his January 8 report titled “How quickly could Iran make nuclear weapons today?” Albright argues that “Iran can quickly make enough weapon-grade uranium for many nuclear weapons, something it could not do in 2003. Today, it would need only about a week to produce enough for its first nuclear weapon. It could have enough weapon-grade uranium for six weapons in one month, and after five months of producing weapon-grade uranium, it could have enough for twelve.”Albright, the founder and president of the prominent Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, noted that “Iran could also immediately start preparatory work on transforming the weapons-grade uranium into nuclear weapon components in anticipation of later receiving weapon-grade uranium.  “It accomplished a considerable amount of such work during the Amad Plan, and subsequently at civilian nuclear facilities at Esfahan during the last several years as part of Iran’s buildup of its nuclear program, including the production of a small amount of 20% enriched uranium metal, a material that can stand in for weapon-grade uranium.”Iran's current nuclear powerAlbright, who was a former UN weapons inspector in Iraq, wrote that “Iran’s growing nuclear weapons capability is often condemned, most recently in a December 28 joint statement by the United States and its close European allies. The occasion was the Iranian action to expand its output of 60% enriched uranium. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei views the Iran nuclear achievements, in Tehran, Iran June 11, 2023.  (credit: Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via REUTERS)“This level of enrichment is a hair’s breadth from 90% enriched or weapons-grade uranium, the enrichment level most desired for making nuclear weapons. That is also the enrichment level used in Iran’s nuclear weapons designs, which it nearly perfected during its crash nuclear weapons program in the early 2000s, codenamed the Amad Plan. This program was shut down in 2003 and replaced with a smaller, more dispersed nuclear weapons effort, with the decision to make them postponed.”Iran enriches uranium at a very high levelAfter Albright published his article, Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told the UAE-state-owned newspaper The National that “Iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state which is enriching uranium at this very, very high level – very close to weapons grade.” He added, “I’m not saying they have a nuclear weapon, I’m saying this is sensitive. And when you’re doing that … you abide by the rules.” AdvertisementAlbright warned that “Western intelligence agencies may not detect the start of Iran’s nuclear weaponization effort. Given all the complexities and conflicts in the Middle East today, Western intelligence agencies, including Israel’s, are stretched to the limit. The beginning stages of a quiet, low-level effort to build nuclear weapons could slip through unobserved.”The nuclear expert recommended that, “Given short warning times and few prospects of a nuclear deal, the United States and its allies have little choice other than focusing on a strategy to deter Iran from deciding to build nuclear weapons in the first place. Iran needs to be made fully aware via concrete demonstrations that building nuclear weapons will trigger quick, drastic actions by the international community, including military strikes.”According to Albright, “US military cooperation with Israel aimed at destroying Iran’s nuclear capabilities should be bolstered, ensuring Israel can decisively strike Iran’s nuclear sites on short notice if there are signs that Iran is moving to build nuclear weapons, including the ability to deliver a second strike if Iran reconstitutes those activities.“The priority should be assisting and building military capabilities with our allies and regional partners in the Middle East, with a US commitment to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and deter Iran from retaliation.”

22WHCCR50M_NWIKCNUVR761SXO,Qatar implies that Red Sea insecurity can only be fixed by Gaza ceasefire,DEBBIE MOHNBLATT/THE MEDIA LINE,"JANUARY 21, 2024 20:25",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-783113,"Addressing the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Qatar's Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said on Tuesday that the American and British attacks on the Houthis can only worsen the security situation in the Red Sea and that the real solution to the security issues there is ceasing the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org According to Al Thani, the Western military intervention will neither bring an end to nor contain the Houthi attacks but will only escalate them, and the sole solution is to defuse the conflict in Gaza.""We need to address the central issue, which is Gaza, in order to get everything else defused...if we are just focusing on the symptoms and not treating the real issues, [solutions] will be temporary,"" said Al Thani.  In context: Qatar is one of the world's largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporters, supplying large amounts of it to European countries, mainly Germany. The Gulf country supplies LNG to Europe in vessels that usually cross the Suez Canal to reach Europe much faster, saving about two weeks of travel. Shortly after the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, the Iran-backed Yemeni militia, the Houthis, attacked several shipping vessels sailing close to its coasts of the Red Sea on their way to cross the Suez Canal. Last weekend, the US and the UK started striking Houthi targets in response.Since the weekend, some vessels shipping Qatar's LNG have either stopped or deviated to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, making the travel significantly longer.

(credit: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERS)Qatari PM's statements align with the country's grand strategyDr. Ramu C.M., a senior geopolitical analyst at APAC Assistance with expertise in energy and international politics, told The Media Line that the Qatari prime minister's statements in Davos aligned with the country's foreign policy strategy. ""Qatar has a policy of not actively antagonizing any militant or terror group that is active across the Middle East. It naturally does not want its maritime gas exports to be a target of the Houthi ire,"" he said. AdvertisementHe noted that as opposed to other neighboring countries, Doha has maintained good relations with political Islam. ""The leaders of Qatar, not only for pragmatic reasons but also due to their lack of adverse experiences, have been content to support movements associated with political Islam, including Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood,"" added C.M.Cyril Widdershoven, a geopolitical and international oil-gas market specialist, said that this support allows Doha to place itself in a unique geopolitical position in both the Islamic world and on a global level.""Qatar, or at least large parts of the Qatari power circles, are behind the Hamas-Hezbollah-Iran-Houthi crowds, as they see a geopolitical opportunity to be the main interlocutor between them, Israel and the West,"" he told The Media Line. In terms of the potential threat that the halt of the passage of Qatari LNG through the Red Sea could pose to Europe's energy security, both analysts agree that, currently, it is not so significant. Widdershoven explained that, at present, Qatari LNG represents less than 11% of the total supply to Europe. He noted that this is due to the large American LNG supply as well as a lower gas demand in Europe. C.M. pointed out that since the Russia-Ukraine war started, Europe has diversified its energy supplies, lowering the chances of jeopardizing its energy security in case of a disruption such as the current one. Europe currently gets piped gas from Norway, Russia, though in reduced volumes through the Ukraine transit route, Algeria, the UK, and Azerbaijan. It also sources LNG from the US, Russia, Qatar, Algeria, and Norway, he explained.This is why he believes that interruptions to Qatari gas imports would not be very disruptive beyond immediate price impacts on the European gas trading hubs. ""This also is contingent on cold blasts that could suddenly trigger a demand surge for gas for residential heating,"" C.M. added.However, noted C.M., the security situation in the Red Sea may have some effects on the global prices of oil and gas. First, he noted that the war insurance premiums and disruptions to global supply chains and shipping lines are likely to increase further. Second, he added that the rerouting of the cargo ships through the Cape of Good Hope is expected to extend transit times, increase transportation costs, and strain global supply chains.""The financial impact on shipping lines, cargo owners, marine insurers, and reinsurers could be severe,"" he warned.That being said, C.M. asserted that despite tensions in the Red Sea, oil prices have so far been less impacted and have remained somewhat stable.He attributed this to several factors. Among them, he noted is that overall production has not been impacted, and alternative routes have been explored via the Cape of Good Hope. He also said that the stronger dollar is counteracting the disruptions in the Red Sea. This is why oil traders seem unconvinced that a major supply disruption is imminent, C.M. concluded.

He noted that this is due to the large American LNG supply as well as a lower gas demand in Europe. C.M. pointed out that since the Russia-Ukraine war started, Europe has diversified its energy supplies, lowering the chances of jeopardizing its energy security in case of a disruption such as the current one. Europe currently gets piped gas from Norway, Russia, though in reduced volumes through the Ukraine transit route, Algeria, the UK, and Azerbaijan. It also sources LNG from the US, Russia, Qatar, Algeria, and Norway, he explained.This is why he believes that interruptions to Qatari gas imports would not be very disruptive beyond immediate price impacts on the European gas trading hubs.

In context: Qatar is one of the world's largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporters, supplying large amounts of it to European countries, mainly Germany. The Gulf country supplies LNG to Europe in vessels that usually cross the Suez Canal to reach Europe much faster, saving about two weeks of travel. Shortly after the Israel-Hamas war began on October 7, the Iran-backed Yemeni militia, the Houthis, attacked several shipping vessels sailing close to its coasts of the Red Sea on their way to cross the Suez Canal. Last weekend, the US and the UK started striking Houthi targets in response.Since the weekend, some vessels shipping Qatar's LNG have either stopped or deviated to the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, making the travel significantly longer.

FRANTZMAN,"JANUARY 21, 2024 13:55",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/international/article-783056,"Iran was active in the region over the weekend, continuing to increase its threats to Israel and US forces. For instance, Iranian proxies in Iraq used ballistic missiles and rockets to attack Al-Asad Air Base in Iraq, where US forces are stationed. Several US personnel were lightly wounded because of the attack.US Central Command said “at approximately 6:30 p.m. (Baghdad time), on January 20, multiple ballistic missiles and rockets were launched by Iranian-backed militants in Western Iraq targeting Al-Asad Air Base. Most of the missiles were intercepted by the base’s air defense systems, while others impacted on the base. Damage assessments are ongoing. A number of U.S. personnel are undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries. At least one Iraqi service member was wounded.”Saturday was a busy day for Iran in the region because it suffered losses in Syria while it was also plotting and carrying out attacks in Iraq. Several members of the Iranian IRGC were killed in Damascus. This is not the only recent loss for Iran in Syria. In December, Iran’s Razi Mousavi, a senior IRGC member, was also killed in Syria. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led prayers at his funeral.  Iran also suffered a setback in Yemen. The Iranian-backed Houthis continue to target ships. However, on Saturday, “US Central Command forces conducted airstrikes against a Houthi anti-ship missile that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and was prepared to launch. US forces determined the missile presented a threat to merchant vessels and US Navy ships in the region, and subsequently struck and destroyed the missile in self-defense. This action will make international waters safer and more secure for US Navy and merchant vessels,” the US Central Command said.A boat of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) sails, at undisclosed place off the coast of Bandar Abbas, Iran August 22, 2019. (credit: NAZANIN TABATABAEE/WANA VIA REUTERS)That day, 20 Iranian-backed Hezbollah members also continued to threaten Israel. Israeli fighter jets “struck terrorist infrastructure, an observation post, and a launch post belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in the area of Al-Adisa in southern Lebanon. Furthermore, overnight, IDF tanks fired in order to remove a threat in the area of Mount Dov,” the IDF said on Saturday.Iran must consider its next stepsWeighing in all these incidents, the Iranian leadership therefore must consider their next steps in the region carefully. They are now trying to manage a very large and complex series of conflicts.This includes Gaza, the West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. This is a major challenge for them. Never has Iran had to manage so many active fronts. That is not to say Iran does not have decades of experience building up proxies in all these places. Iran has invested heavily in all these arenas. Iran’s resources must be taxed in dealing with all these arenas when they are ablaze. AdvertisementCan Iran maintain the same tempo in each arena? That is a key question. Iranian media is signaling that Iran is focused on the West Bank, particularly Jenin and other areas that the Palestinian Islamic Jihad operates.Iran has other interests as well. It recently launched a satellite into orbit. Iran media also focuses on internal disagreements within Israel’s wartime cabinet. Further, Tehran is closely monitoring Hamas’s recent demands, to see if it can keep Hamas in power in Gaza. This illustrates that Iran is weighing its next steps. Escalation in Syria, Iraq and the Red Sea, in which Iran may suffer more losses than it can easily replace, could be a challenge for Iran in the long-term.

Sen. Bernie Sanders’s recent move to force a vote on potentially limiting US military aid to Israel, though it lost, marks a significant dent in the long-standing bipartisan support for Israel in Congress, which will, without a doubt, hurt American interests and endanger American servicemen and American interests in the Middle East.By utilizing a rarely invoked law, Sanders was challenging the traditional approach to US support for Israel.Bernie Sanders responds to a question from a reporter  (credit: LUCAS JACKSON / REUTERS)Recent discussions on Capitol Hill regarding the denial of funding to Israel in favor of prioritizing support for Ukraine have sparked widespread concern and frustration among the American people. This decision, which seemingly serves political tactics over the safety and security of America and its allies in the Middle East, is not convincing for many.It is well known that Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East and plays a crucial role in combating terrorism and protecting US interests in the region. By denying or delaying necessary funding to Israel, Capitol Hill endangers the national security of the United States and its soldiers in the Middle East. AdvertisementIsrael fighting terrorism supports US's efforts in the Middle EastMoreover, Israel’s fight against terrorism directly supports the United States’s efforts in the region, ultimately safeguarding American lives and taxpayer dollars. Israel’s military and intelligence capabilities have been invaluable in preventing terrorist attacks and defending against hostile forces in the region. Furthermore, by supporting Israel, the United States effectively avoids engaging in a conflict that it would otherwise have to face on its own.Bottom line: Israel is on the front lines in the fight against tens of terror groups and radical groups that are proxies of Iran, with Iran openly stating its intent to use nuclear weapons against Israel and ultimately the United States calling Israel the small Satan and the US the big Satan.WITH ISRAEL being the only democracy in the region, it has been the sole key ally in the fight against terrorism in the Middle East. Let’s not forget the hundreds of billions of dollars and lives America lost in Iraq and Afghanistan, with not much to show for it.With more than 100 attacks by Houthis on US troops in the past month alone in the Middle East region on American army bases, it is clear that the threat of terrorism in the region is not just on Israel but on the US directly as well.Regarding the war in Ukraine, this is certainly important. However, it does not directly threaten US national security the same way the ongoing attacks and threats from terrorist groups in the Middle East do. US aid to Israel should not be contingent upon Ukrainian aid packages. Let’s not forget Europe, with almost all of its nations threatened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As many of those countries are nuclear-armed and have lots of money, it’s their obligation to step up to the plate and take the lead to support Ukraine, especially given the potential threat that the conflict poses to their own security and stability. United States taxpayers do not have to fit their bill, since European countries have their own resources.Wake up Capitol Hill and act like adults. Recognize that your decision to block or limit funding to Israel to protect yourself and US interests, as well as leverage a bill with other outside interests, is both unacceptable and childish. The ramifications of such a decision could have serious and far-reaching consequences for the safety and security of Americans around the world.As Americans, it is important to remember that Israel is fighting a war on behalf of the United States. If not Israel, we would need to fight these wars ourselves, which could cost us American lives instead of Israeli lives and many more taxpayer dollars. America must acknowledge that Israel has a track record of being sensitive and surgical in its military operations, risking its own men and women to take great precautions to minimize civilian casualties.

AdvertisementIsrael fighting terrorism supports US's efforts in the Middle EastMoreover, Israel’s fight against terrorism directly supports the United States’s efforts in the region, ultimately safeguarding American lives and taxpayer dollars. Israel’s military and intelligence capabilities have been invaluable in preventing terrorist attacks and defending against hostile forces in the region. Furthermore, by supporting Israel, the United States effectively avoids engaging in a conflict that it would otherwise have to face on its own.Bottom line: Israel is on the front lines in the fight against tens of terror groups and radical groups that are proxies of Iran, with Iran openly stating its intent to use nuclear weapons against Israel and ultimately the United States calling Israel the small Satan and the US the big Satan.WITH ISRAEL being the only democracy in the region, it has been the sole key ally in the fight against terrorism in the Middle East. Let’s not forget the hundreds of billions of dollars and lives America lost in Iraq and Afghanistan, with not much to show for it.With more than 100 attacks by Houthis on US troops in the past month alone in the Middle East region on American army bases, it is clear that the threat of terrorism in the region is not just on Israel but on the US directly as well.Regarding the war in Ukraine, this is certainly important. However, it does not directly threaten US national security the same way the ongoing attacks and threats from terrorist groups in the Middle East do. US aid to Israel should not be contingent upon Ukrainian aid packages. Let’s not forget Europe, with almost all of its nations threatened by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As many of those countries are nuclear-armed and have lots of money, it’s their obligation to step up to the plate and take the lead to support Ukraine, especially given the potential threat that the conflict poses to their own security and stability. United States taxpayers do not have to fit their bill, since European countries have their own resources.Wake up Capitol Hill and act like adults. Recognize that your decision to block or limit funding to Israel to protect yourself and US interests, as well as leverage a bill with other outside interests, is both unacceptable and childish. The ramifications of such a decision could have serious and far-reaching consequences for the safety and security of Americans around the world.As Americans, it is important to remember that Israel is fighting a war on behalf of the United States. If not Israel, we would need to fight these wars ourselves, which could cost us American lives instead of Israeli lives and many more taxpayer dollars. America must acknowledge that Israel has a track record of being sensitive and surgical in its military operations, risking its own men and women to take great precautions to minimize civilian casualties.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a press conference at the Ministry of Defense, in Tel Aviv on January 18, 2024 (credit: YARIV KATZ/POOL)International pressure on Israel mounts against backdrop of war in GazaInternational pressure on Israel, however, has increased both in Washington and Brussels due to the Gaza war with the EU’s 27 foreign ministers set to meet with their fellow counterparts on Monday.The following foreign ministers will be present: Israel Katz of Israel, Saudi Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud of Saudi Arabia, Ayman Safadi of Jordan, Sameh Shoukry of Egypt, and Riyad al-Maliki of the Palestinian Authority. The EU foreign ministers will also meet with Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit. AdvertisementAccording to a report in the Financial Times, the EU foreign ministers are also likely to discuss the possibility of imposing consequences on Israel if Netanyahu continues to reject Palestinian statehood.Before he departs for Brussels, Katz said he plans to promote Israel’s “diplomatic campaign to support the heroic IDF soldiers and defeat Hamas.” He added that he would work to mobilize the EU to press for the return of the hostages and to promote regional economic projects that would also serve to isolate Iran.The meeting comes as the Biden administration renewed its efforts for a Saudi normalization deal – linked this time to Palestinian statehood. Moderate Arab countries have also warned that they won’t finance the reconstruction of Gaza without a path to two states.In an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, Saudi prince Bin Farhan said that a “credible, irreversible process to a Palestinian state” was the only way to integrate Israel into the Middle East. “We are fully ready as Arab countries to engage in that conversation. I would hope that the Israelis would be as well.”

Moderate Arab countries have also warned that they won’t finance the reconstruction of Gaza without a path to two states.In an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, Saudi prince Bin Farhan said that a “credible, irreversible process to a Palestinian state” was the only way to integrate Israel into the Middle East. “We are fully ready as Arab countries to engage in that conversation. I would hope that the Israelis would be as well.”

6BK7XRPWC5_BA72WYW9A7N7BTX,What does the future hold for Israel's future war with Hezbollah? - analysis,YONAH JEREMY BOB,"JANUARY 21, 2024 13:54",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-783054,"Whoever is at a loss about what the future holds for the Israel-Hezbollah conflict should not feel bad. The constant threats, varying verbiage, and increasing number of attacks back and forth are extremely difficult to cut through and understand.However, after multiple recent visits to the North that included briefings with top officials, discussions with rank-and-file soldiers, and checking in with other key sources, The Jerusalem Post can “translate” and separate the important developments from the less crucial ones.Neither side is interested in general war First of all, despite a rise in threats from both the Israeli and the Hezbollah sides, neither is actually angling to open up a much larger general war anytime soon.  This sounds counterintuitive after days in which multiple top Israeli officials said that Israel and Hezbollah are closer to conflict than ever and Hezbollah Chief Hassan Nasrallah has himself rattled his saber more loudly in each speech. AN IDF soldier stands near the Israel-Lebanon border as a mobile artillery unit fires toward Hezbollah targets, on Monday.  (credit: RONEN ZVULUN/REUTERS)But if you compare Israeli and Hezbollah statements from several weeks ago, they were not that different.Most of it is a smokescreen for each side to try to gain the upper hand in the competition for who is perceived as winning so far and who will be able to declare victory whenever the conflict ends.Actions louder than wordsHowever, there are some actions and facts that matter far more than words.In recent weeks, the IDF has attacked close to 15 villages that Hezbollah was using for cover to fire on Israel’s North. AdvertisementDuring the middle of last week, the IDF significantly upped its level of attack when it fired on Hezbollah fighters and positions at the Wadi Saluki Village dozens of times in a matter of hours.Until then, the IDF had mostly done much smaller-scale attacks on the villages. This was after months during which the IDF did not strike the villages at all and had been willing only to attack Hezbollah rocket crews in open areas.This shift has hurt Hezbollah and forced it to recalibrate its calculations regarding how to continue firing on Israel; it was much more important than any verbiage.The result was that the IDF, as of around a month ago, had pushed about 50% of Hezbollah’s 6,000 Radwan forces back from the border with Israel, and that percentage is now closer to 75%, The Post has learned.The Post also understands that the IDF has been even more successful in destroying Hezbollah’s watchtowers on the border – destroying or damaging between 80 and 95% of them, depending on what one considers damaged versus destroyed.Besides carrying out that grand scale of military actions that changes the playing field, the IDF admitted to assassinating Hezbollah drone chief Ali Hussein Bergi, and the terrorist group has accused Jerusalem of killing Hezbollah’s Radwan chief, Wissam al-Tawil. These killings did not change the situation on the ground as much as the military actions did, but they were a direct hit on Nasrallah’s confidence, making it clearer than any verbiage that the IDF is willing to take off the gloves – even against top Hezbollah officials – if the terrorist group crosses certain redlines.War with Hezbollah unlikely in the foreseeable future Why, then, is a general war unlikely in the near future? From Nasrallah’s perspective, he does not need a bigger war to claim victory. He succeeded in forcing some 80,000 Israelis to evacuate the North and has shown that he can maintain fire on Israel for more than 100 days without making a dent in his arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and mortars.All he needs to do is try not to lose face or give up too much before a new ceasefire kicks into place.And while he views the world differently than Westerners, he certainly prefers not to have Beirut and Lebanon look like the significantly destroyed Gaza Strip.Israel and the IDF leadership, for their part, are highly split on what to do with Hezbollah.All of the key political and defense officials are in favor of trying to negotiate a diplomatic deal, according to which Hezbollah would withdraw 100% of its Radwan forces from the border with Israel, with war only as a second choice.However, some in the IDF think that a firm ultimatum and deadline should be given to Hezbollah sooner rather than later.Some top IDF officials who, before the war, might have been leaning more aggressively toward attacking Hezbollah very soon – with a preemptive strike to start what they viewed as an inevitable conflict on Israeli terms – now, counter-intuitively, may be willing to wait for a later date.While some IDF officials view Hezbollah’s actions – injecting itself into the war between Israel and Hamas and forcing the evacuation of Israel’s northern residents for over 100 days – as an effrontery that must be corrected immediately, others believe that Israel’s actions in the last month or so have altered the picture.Having pushed back such a substantial amount of Hezbollah’s forces, they feel the chance of the terrorist group mounting an attack is the lowest it has been in years and that it buys more time for the IDF to delay a preemptive strike to some more opportune moment in the distant future.Still, others are terrified of what Hezbollah can do to Israel’s home front if it releases its full arsenal, even though Israel would doubtlessly “win” such a conflict in terms of killing and destroying more Hezbollah forces and infrastructure in absolute terms. Put simply, they view Israel as less able than the Lebanese terrorist group to tolerate losses to the home front.Weather also matters, and fighting a big war mid-winter could hurt Israel’s ability to exploit its higher-quality military capabilities.Finally, some do not want to start a major fight with Hezbollah until either Khan Yunis is subdued, still months away, or at an even later date when Gaza is stabilized and beyond an immediate risk of Hamas returning to take over.Israeli actions have set Hezbollah back significantly, but have also been tailored to be clearly limited from upsetting Hezbollah beyond a certain point.A general war could still break out tomorrow if one side or another miscalculates and pushes the other too far. But in the meantime, readers will get a more accurate picture by watching the actions of both sides, both what they do and what they do not do, than by the bellicose speeches that continue to repeat themselves.

This sounds counterintuitive after days in which multiple top Israeli officials said that Israel and Hezbollah are closer to conflict than ever and Hezbollah Chief Hassan Nasrallah has himself rattled his saber more loudly in each speech.

(credit: RONEN ZVULUN/REUTERS)But if you compare Israeli and Hezbollah statements from several weeks ago, they were not that different.Most of it is a smokescreen for each side to try to gain the upper hand in the competition for who is perceived as winning so far and who will be able to declare victory whenever the conflict ends.Actions louder than wordsHowever, there are some actions and facts that matter far more than words.In recent weeks, the IDF has attacked close to 15 villages that Hezbollah was using for cover to fire on Israel’s North. AdvertisementDuring the middle of last week, the IDF significantly upped its level of attack when it fired on Hezbollah fighters and positions at the Wadi Saluki Village dozens of times in a matter of hours.Until then, the IDF had mostly done much smaller-scale attacks on the villages. This was after months during which the IDF did not strike the villages at all and had been willing only to attack Hezbollah rocket crews in open areas.This shift has hurt Hezbollah and forced it to recalibrate its calculations regarding how to continue firing on Israel; it was much more important than any verbiage.The result was that the IDF, as of around a month ago, had pushed about 50% of Hezbollah’s 6,000 Radwan forces back from the border with Israel, and that percentage is now closer to 75%, The Post has learned.The Post also understands that the IDF has been even more successful in destroying Hezbollah’s watchtowers on the border – destroying or damaging between 80 and 95% of them, depending on what one considers damaged versus destroyed.Besides carrying out that grand scale of military actions that changes the playing field, the IDF admitted to assassinating Hezbollah drone chief Ali Hussein Bergi, and the terrorist group has accused Jerusalem of killing Hezbollah’s Radwan chief, Wissam al-Tawil. These killings did not change the situation on the ground as much as the military actions did, but they were a direct hit on Nasrallah’s confidence, making it clearer than any verbiage that the IDF is willing to take off the gloves – even against top Hezbollah officials – if the terrorist group crosses certain redlines.War with Hezbollah unlikely in the foreseeable future Why, then, is a general war unlikely in the near future? From Nasrallah’s perspective, he does not need a bigger war to claim victory. He succeeded in forcing some 80,000 Israelis to evacuate the North and has shown that he can maintain fire on Israel for more than 100 days without making a dent in his arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and mortars.All he needs to do is try not to lose face or give up too much before a new ceasefire kicks into place.And while he views the world differently than Westerners, he certainly prefers not to have Beirut and Lebanon look like the significantly destroyed Gaza Strip.Israel and the IDF leadership, for their part, are highly split on what to do with Hezbollah.All of the key political and defense officials are in favor of trying to negotiate a diplomatic deal, according to which Hezbollah would withdraw 100% of its Radwan forces from the border with Israel, with war only as a second choice.However, some in the IDF think that a firm ultimatum and deadline should be given to Hezbollah sooner rather than later.Some top IDF officials who, before the war, might have been leaning more aggressively toward attacking Hezbollah very soon – with a preemptive strike to start what they viewed as an inevitable conflict on Israeli terms – now, counter-intuitively, may be willing to wait for a later date.While some IDF officials view Hezbollah’s actions – injecting itself into the war between Israel and Hamas and forcing the evacuation of Israel’s northern residents for over 100 days – as an effrontery that must be corrected immediately, others believe that Israel’s actions in the last month or so have altered the picture.Having pushed back such a substantial amount of Hezbollah’s forces, they feel the chance of the terrorist group mounting an attack is the lowest it has been in years and that it buys more time for the IDF to delay a preemptive strike to some more opportune moment in the distant future.Still, others are terrified of what Hezbollah can do to Israel’s home front if it releases its full arsenal, even though Israel would doubtlessly “win” such a conflict in terms of killing and destroying more Hezbollah forces and infrastructure in absolute terms. Put simply, they view Israel as less able than the Lebanese terrorist group to tolerate losses to the home front.Weather also matters, and fighting a big war mid-winter could hurt Israel’s ability to exploit its higher-quality military capabilities.Finally, some do not want to start a major fight with Hezbollah until either Khan Yunis is subdued, still months away, or at an even later date when Gaza is stabilized and beyond an immediate risk of Hamas returning to take over.Israeli actions have set Hezbollah back significantly, but have also been tailored to be clearly limited from upsetting Hezbollah beyond a certain point.A general war could still break out tomorrow if one side or another miscalculates and pushes the other too far. But in the meantime, readers will get a more accurate picture by watching the actions of both sides, both what they do and what they do not do, than by the bellicose speeches that continue to repeat themselves.

He succeeded in forcing some 80,000 Israelis to evacuate the North and has shown that he can maintain fire on Israel for more than 100 days without making a dent in his arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and mortars.All he needs to do is try not to lose face or give up too much before a new ceasefire kicks into place.And while he views the world differently than Westerners, he certainly prefers not to have Beirut and Lebanon look like the significantly destroyed Gaza Strip.Israel and the IDF leadership, for their part, are highly split on what to do with Hezbollah.All of the key political and defense officials are in favor of trying to negotiate a diplomatic deal, according to which Hezbollah would withdraw 100% of its Radwan forces from the border with Israel, with war only as a second choice.However, some in the IDF think that a firm ultimatum and deadline should be given to Hezbollah sooner rather than later.Some top IDF officials who, before the war, might have been leaning more aggressively toward attacking Hezbollah very soon – with a preemptive strike to start what they viewed as an inevitable conflict on Israeli terms – now, counter-intuitively, may be willing to wait for a later date.While some IDF officials view Hezbollah’s actions – injecting itself into the war between Israel and Hamas and forcing the evacuation of Israel’s northern residents for over 100 days – as an effrontery that must be corrected immediately, others believe that Israel’s actions in the last month or so have altered the picture.Having pushed back such a substantial amount of Hezbollah’s forces, they feel the chance of the terrorist group mounting an attack is the lowest it has been in years and that it buys more time for the IDF to delay a preemptive strike to some more opportune moment in the distant future.Still, others are terrified of what Hezbollah can do to Israel’s home front if it releases its full arsenal, even though Israel would doubtlessly “win” such a conflict in terms of killing and destroying more Hezbollah forces and infrastructure in absolute terms. Put simply, they view Israel as less able than the Lebanese terrorist group to tolerate losses to the home front.Weather also matters, and fighting a big war mid-winter could hurt Israel’s ability to exploit its higher-quality military capabilities.Finally, some do not want to start a major fight with Hezbollah until either Khan Yunis is subdued, still months away, or at an even later date when Gaza is stabilized and beyond an immediate risk of Hamas returning to take over.Israeli actions have set Hezbollah back significantly, but have also been tailored to be clearly limited from upsetting Hezbollah beyond a certain point.A general war could still break out tomorrow if one side or another miscalculates and pushes the other too far. But in the meantime, readers will get a more accurate picture by watching the actions of both sides, both what they do and what they do not do, than by the bellicose speeches that continue to repeat themselves.
The result was that the IDF, as of around a month ago, had pushed about 50% of Hezbollah’s 6,000 Radwan forces back from the border with Israel, and that percentage is now closer to 75%, The Post has learned.The Post also understands that the IDF has been even more successful in destroying Hezbollah’s watchtowers on the border – destroying or damaging between 80 and 95% of them, depending on what one considers damaged versus destroyed.Besides carrying out that grand scale of military actions that changes the playing field, the IDF admitted to assassinating Hezbollah drone chief Ali Hussein Bergi, and the terrorist group has accused Jerusalem of killing Hezbollah’s Radwan chief, Wissam al-Tawil.

Put simply, they view Israel as less able than the Lebanese terrorist group to tolerate losses to the home front.Weather also matters, and fighting a big war mid-winter could hurt Israel’s ability to exploit its higher-quality military capabilities.Finally, some do not want to start a major fight with Hezbollah until either Khan Yunis is subdued, still months away, or at an even later date when Gaza is stabilized and beyond an immediate risk of Hamas returning to take over.Israeli actions have set Hezbollah back significantly, but have also been tailored to be clearly limited from upsetting Hezbollah beyond a certain point.A general war could still break out tomorrow if one side or another miscalculates and pushes the other too far. But in the meantime, readers will get a more accurate picture by watching the actions of both sides, both what they do and what they do not do, than by the bellicose speeches that continue to repeat themselves.

8TF5R4BGLW_AJ9DV6FKGM4IE6Q,Concern for reservists returning to civilian life during Israel-Hamas war,GREER FAY CASHMAN,"JANUARY 21, 2024 19:28",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-783102,"Since October 7, President Isaac Herzog and his wife, Michal, have visited wounded soldiers in various hospitals around the country.As someone who is particularly concerned about the mental health of the nation, Michal Herzog, from the conversations that she has had with reservists, their spouses, and other members of their families, thought it essential to develop a forum dedicated to reservists who are being released from the army.Reservists return home to a new reality A forum event on Sunday began with a video of a family dinner that included the reservist who was home on leave and found it difficult to adjust. He kept on trying to eat the kind of meal he would never receive in the field, and people around the table kept arguing and getting up to slap him on the shoulder whenever he tried to put a forkful of food into his mouth.  Eventually, he got up, took the plate with the food still on it, and smashed it on the floor. Then, dressed in his army uniform and upset, he took his gun and said he was going back to the army for 60 days.In the background of the video was the music for the song “How good it is to come home.”The underlying message was that it’s not always so good because all of a sudden, the reservist’s life is again topsy turvy with a changed environment and a different set of challenges. Michal Herzog speaks during a ceremony at the president's house with representatives of the diplomatic delegations to Israel in Jerusalem. September 20, 2022 (credit: Arie Leib Abrams/Flash90)People who haven’t been called up are often insensitive to the reservists’ worries about work or university studies or both, not to mention mortgage payments. AdvertisementVery often, when the reservist is away on duty, the spouse is the family breadwinner. The spouse is often fearful about what could happen to the reservist, and this fear may lead to tensions when the reservist comes home.Nothing is like either partner imagined it would be.These and other issues were discussed by Michal Herzog, Chief Reserve Officer Brig.-Gen. Benny Ben Ari, Prof. Rivkah Tuval Mashiach, the chief psychologist at Natal, the Israel Trauma and Resilience Center; Guy Rotman, a reserve officer, who got married a year ago, and who returned home after more than two months in Gaza; attorney Vardit Damari Madar, the CEO of Kol Zchut, an organization that advises reservists and their families of their rights, and which since October 7 has had 1,300,000 queries; and a group of four wives of reservists, who participated in a panel discussion.Noting that all present shared a common concern, Herzog said that this was a vital gathering that she had been thinking about for weeks, about how to find the best way to relate to reservists who had been discharged and were coming home.Different reactions when returning homeSome have very mixed feelings. On the one hand, they miss their families, but on the other, they suffer the pain of loss of comrades in arms, she said.People come home with full hearts, but can’t take their minds off the battlefield and the people they’ve left behind, she continued, implying that some of these guilt feelings arise because they’ve left others to continue the job.“How can one concentrate on work or studies when the mind is elsewhere?” Herzog queried. “We have to be there for them and their families,” she insisted. “We have to give them tools and support.”Alluding to the fears and anxieties on the battleground, she said “It doesn’t stop when a door closes, or in the joy of homecoming. It keeps coming back.”In wartime, said Ben Ari, “you need a strong reserve corps to protect families and to defend the nation.” At the same time, he continued, it is essential to help the families and to help the reservists to once again find their places in a work environment. Rotman lost six comrades in arms and spoke of the impact felt by such losses. There’s also the problem of more than one family member being caught up in the war. Both he and his younger brother were in the same unit – a factor that weighed heavily on their parents.While most of the men in his unit could not think of anything other than returning home, once they got home, they missed the army. “Working together shoulder-to-shoulder not just a slogan,” said Rotman. “We are together in difficult conditions.”Tuval Mashiach warned of the significance of watching out for signs of trauma, in order to be able to provide suitable therapies as soon as possible, but he cautioned that someone experiencing trauma can be treated only if they want to be treated.Though each of the panelists faced individual challenges, there was consensus that what they all had in common was uncertainty.

A forum event on Sunday began with a video of a family dinner that included the reservist who was home on leave and found it difficult to adjust. He kept on trying to eat the kind of meal he would never receive in the field, and people around the table kept arguing and getting up to slap him on the shoulder whenever he tried to put a forkful of food into his mouth.  Eventually, he got up, took the plate with the food still on it, and smashed it on the floor. Then, dressed in his army uniform and upset, he took his gun and said he was going back to the army for 60 days.In the background of the video was the music for the song “How good it is to come home.”The underlying message was that it’s not always so good because all of a sudden, the reservist’s life is again topsy turvy with a changed environment and a different set of challenges.

AdvertisementVery often, when the reservist is away on duty, the spouse is the family breadwinner. The spouse is often fearful about what could happen to the reservist, and this fear may lead to tensions when the reservist comes home.Nothing is like either partner imagined it would be.These and other issues were discussed by Michal Herzog, Chief Reserve Officer Brig.-Gen. Benny Ben Ari, Prof. Rivkah Tuval Mashiach, the chief psychologist at Natal, the Israel Trauma and Resilience Center; Guy Rotman, a reserve officer, who got married a year ago, and who returned home after more than two months in Gaza; attorney Vardit Damari Madar, the CEO of Kol Zchut, an organization that advises reservists and their families of their rights, and which since October 7 has had 1,300,000 queries; and a group of four wives of reservists, who participated in a panel discussion.Noting that all present shared a common concern, Herzog said that this was a vital gathering that she had been thinking about for weeks, about how to find the best way to relate to reservists who had been discharged and were coming home.Different reactions when returning homeSome have very mixed feelings. On the one hand, they miss their families, but on the other, they suffer the pain of loss of comrades in arms, she said.People come home with full hearts, but can’t take their minds off the battlefield and the people they’ve left behind, she continued, implying that some of these guilt feelings arise because they’ve left others to continue the job.“How can one concentrate on work or studies when the mind is elsewhere?” Herzog queried. “We have to be there for them and their families,” she insisted. “We have to give them tools and support.”Alluding to the fears and anxieties on the battleground, she said “It doesn’t stop when a door closes, or in the joy of homecoming. It keeps coming back.”In wartime, said Ben Ari, “you need a strong reserve corps to protect families and to defend the nation.” At the same time, he continued, it is essential to help the families and to help the reservists to once again find their places in a work environment.

Early in 2023, he led several head-to-head polls against Trump.But the Florida governor's support has been declining for several months, due to flawed campaign strategy, his seeming lack of ease with voters on the campaign trail and Trump's so far unshakeable hold on much of the party's base.The end of DeSantis' bid means that former US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, is now the last Republican in the race with a shot - albeit a long one - of denying Trump the nomination. The winner of the Republican nominating contest will take on President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic nominee, in the general election in November.

(credit: REUTERS/BRIAN SNYDER)Leaves Nikki Haley as Trump's lone, longshot primary competitorMore than 70% of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump, according to most opinion polls. That put DeSantis in a position where he had to appeal to voters that still admired Trump, as well as those who passionately disliked him. AdvertisementDeSantis failed on both counts. He never successfully articulated to most Trump supporters why he was a better option, while Republicans looking to ditch the former president split their votes among multiple candidates. Haley, in particular, has been emerged as the favorite among moderate Republicans as the field has consolidated. Where DeSantis differed from Trump on policy, it was almost always to stake out a more conservative position. He signed a six-week abortion ban in Florida in April, which he eventually embraced on the campaign trail, even as it made some donors and moderate Republicans wary.DeSantis opposed additional US military assistance to Ukraine and took punitive actions against the Walt Disney Co. after the company spoke out against Florida legislation that limited discussion of gender and sexuality in classrooms.The Disney fight was one that pro-business critics within the party said DeSantis didn't need to wage.While many major donors threw their support behind DeSantis early on, they began to rebel as early as the summer.Robert Bigelow, who gave millions to the super PAC fundraising group backing DeSantis, told Reuters in August he was cutting off funding, turned off by the governor's uncompromising position on abortion.DeSantis' troubles began before he ever entered the race.In March, when Trump was indicted in New York on charges he conspired to conceal hush money payments to a porn star, the former president received a significant bump in the polls as Republicans rallied around him. Many of them believed Trump's claims that law enforcement officials were targeting him to keep him out of office.Several DeSantis allies say the governor waited too long to become a candidate, finally throwing his hat into the ring in May, over six months after Trump had done so. That left DeSantis open to blistering attacks by Trump, while the governor himself did little to defend himself, insisting he was not a candidate. When DeSantis did formally launch his White House run in May 2023, it was a glitch-filled disaster on Twitter, now known as X, an inauspicious start for a campaign predicated on the governor's executive competence.The campaign then overhired, burning through cash at a rapid rate. DeSantis let go of some 38 staffers in July and ousted his campaign manager in August, sowing a narrative of internal chaos that proved hard to shake.He outsourced much of the traditional work of a campaign to an outside super PAC, which can accept donations of unlimited size, but cannot coordinate with the campaign itself.The campaign and the PAC, known as Never Back Down, came to distrust one another. A series of back-to-back departures of senior staffers from the PAC in November and December created a sense of turmoil that furthered the narrative that the governor's campaign was mortally wounded.

DeSantis let go of some 38 staffers in July and ousted his campaign manager in August, sowing a narrative of internal chaos that proved hard to shake.He outsourced much of the traditional work of a campaign to an outside super PAC, which can accept donations of unlimited size, but cannot coordinate with the campaign itself.The campaign and the PAC, known as Never Back Down, came to distrust one another. A series of back-to-back departures of senior staffers from the PAC in November and December created a sense of turmoil that furthered the narrative that the governor's campaign was mortally wounded.

The article was posted on Iran’s Tasnim News on Saturday.There was one problem with their report.The “Israeli” whose image Tasnim News in Iran used and who they claimed to have harmed was half a world away at the time of the attacks and was not in the Middle East, let alone in Erbil. The Jerusalem Post confirmed this in a conversation with him.  Iran's claims about their attacksThe Iranian claims are part of their attempt to portray their attacks on Erbil on Monday, January 15, as targeting the “Mossad” or “Israeli spies.” In fact, Iran carried out an attack on the house of a Kurdish businessman named Peshraw Dizayee and murdered him as well as three other people, including Dizayee’s infant son.The attack also killed a Dutch citizen, and Holland summoned Iran’s ambassador following the attack.Iranian armed forces members march during a ceremony of the National Army Day parade in Tehran, Iran April 18, 2022 (credit: WANA NEWS AGENCY/REUTERS)Iran’s Tasnim News also published an article on Saturday showing Dizayee with a man who appears to be Berel Lazar, the chief rabbi of Russia, but the Iranian media used the image to headline an article about a businessman being a “strategic partner of Mossad.”This is another example of Iranian media using an image of a rabbi to imply somehow that any meeting with Jews is an example of the Kurdish businessman being linked to “spies.” This use of an image of a rabbi to “prove” links to “Mossad” is part of a wider use of antisemitic tropes by Iranian media that is linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. AdvertisementThe IRGC carried out the attack on Dizayee and his home in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan autonomous region of Iraq.The attack is one of several Iran has carried out on the Kurdistan region over the last several years, in which they have used missiles and drones to target either dissidents or whom they claim are “spies.”Iran has long claimed that the Kurdistan Region is linked to Israel or has pro-Israel elements within it. This is part of Iran’s decision to spread conspiracies against the Kurdish region because the Kurdistan region tends to be more pro-Western and is more diverse, open-minded, and tolerant.Iran seeks to destabilize the regionIran’s goal is to undermine the region and also weaken independent elements within it. As such, Iran both spreads conspiracies and carries out attacks.An article on Dizayee noted that he was an important businessman behind many important projects in the Kurdistan region. One of these is the Empire World construction project in Erbil. He also ran a company called Falcon Group and was involved in an important road project.Hana Jutiar, the wife of Dizayee, spoke to Kurdistan24 over the weekend to discuss the brutal attack on her home.The decision by Iran to spread new rumors about their strikes on Erbil several days after the attacks illustrates that they were surprised by the pushback following the murderous attack. Iran believed it had impunity to attack Erbil, but it now understands it needs to continue to claim the attacks harmed Israelis in order to bolster its case.There is no evidence for Iran’s baseless claims. The fact they used a photo of a man who wasn’t even in Erbil is an example of Iran’s propagandistic claims. Iran’s Tasnim News also claimed that the Kurdish businessman was linked to an Iranian dissident group led by Hussein Yazdanpanah. This group, the PAK or Kurdistan Freedom Party, played a key role in the war against ISIS.The coordinated articles at Tasnim were designed to excuse Iran’s attack on Erbil by using random images to make it seem Iran’s targeting of the Kurdish businessman had some legitimacy.

The IRGC carried out the attack on Dizayee and his home in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan autonomous region of Iraq.The attack is one of several Iran has carried out on the Kurdistan region over the last several years, in which they have used missiles and drones to target either dissidents or whom they claim are “spies.”Iran has long claimed that the Kurdistan Region is linked to Israel or has pro-Israel elements within it. This is part of Iran’s decision to spread conspiracies against the Kurdish region because the Kurdistan region tends to be more pro-Western and is more diverse, open-minded, and tolerant.Iran seeks to destabilize the regionIran’s goal is to undermine the region and also weaken independent elements within it. As such, Iran both spreads conspiracies and carries out attacks.An article on Dizayee noted that he was an important businessman behind many important projects in the Kurdistan region. One of these is the Empire World construction project in Erbil. He also ran a company called Falcon Group and was involved in an important road project.Hana Jutiar, the wife of Dizayee, spoke to Kurdistan24 over the weekend to discuss the brutal attack on her home.The decision by Iran to spread new rumors about their strikes on Erbil several days after the attacks illustrates that they were surprised by the pushback following the murderous attack. Iran believed it had impunity to attack Erbil, but it now understands it needs to continue to claim the attacks harmed Israelis in order to bolster its case.There is no evidence for Iran’s baseless claims. The fact they used a photo of a man who wasn’t even in Erbil is an example of Iran’s propagandistic claims.

Yet since Oct. 7, he says his research has been put on pause while he spends his time “just dealing with this.” ""This"" refers to fallout from the deadly Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. “A lot of conversations have had to be had, educating both inside and outside the Jewish community,” Paradise said in an interview this month. “That happens daily. People want to know, should we respond and should we respond in an uproar? The donors are in an uproar. Administrators need context.”  At Minnesota, various academic departments issued statements on the conflict that Paradise calls “dismaying,” and others called actionable. The university chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine plastered the doors of academic buildings with flyers bearing anti-Israel messages. A prominent Republican on the law faculty filed a civil rights complaint that this week resulted in a federal investigation.

When Paradise joined fellow scholars for a panel discussion about “Jews, Antisemitism and DEI: Campus Experiences” at the Association for Jewish Studies conference in San Francisco last month, emotions ran high.“We have problems” with the campus DEI office, said Amy Simon, an assistant professor of Holocaust Studies and European Jewish History at Michigan State University, where officials recently backed away from a project that would have addressed concerns about antisemitism. The office is known as the Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion, or IDI. “Sometimes they’re listening, but there’s never a real hearing from the top of the administration [or] the IDI either.” AdvertisementDEI is a shorthand for a framework that says employers and institutions should be welcoming to diverse applicants, especially people of color, women and the LGBTQ community. Campus DEI offices offer training to students and faculty in how to be welcoming to marginalized groups, provide support groups for women, people of color and LGBTQ students, and work with the administration in promoting and identifying diverse candidates for faculty and administration jobs. College campuses have had minority and multicultural affairs offices since the late 1960s and 1970s, focused largely on hiring more diverse faculty and staff and enrolling and retaining more students of color. In the mid-2000s, diversity officers who had been working in isolation formed the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. The organization’s membership has tripled to over 2,000 since July 2020, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, as universities reacted to the police murder of George Floyd and calls to address systemic racism.As the offices have grown — more than two-thirds of all major universities have chief diversity officers — and as a backlash to the 2020 reckoning on race has deepened, criticism has mounted against DEI. In recent years, it has become a prime target of a group of activists — mostly conservative, and some of them Jewish — who blame DEI for an antipathy toward what they see as traditional American values and a misguided focus on identity over merit in academia.One leader of the anti-DEI movement is Chris Rufo, a conservative activist who has argued that diversity initiatives undercut the values of the liberal arts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him to the board of the New College of Florida as part of an effort to remake it according to conservative values — and one of the first moves was to ax the DEI office. But it’s not just Florida: In 2023, Republican lawmakers in at least a dozen states proposed more than 30 bills targeting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in higher education.Since Oct. 7, some Jews who would not normally feel at home on the right have found themselves joining the ranks of DEI’s critics. At the Jewish studies conference, many scholars said their schools’ DEI offices ignored Jewish concerns — either not recognizing Jews as a minority or seeing them as white and privileged, and therefore not subject to marginalization. The seeming failure of many DEI programs to take Jews’ concerns seriously has led some Jewish leaders and conservative politicians to call for their dismantling. But others, particularly on the left, say the core values at the root of DEI initiatives are positive and the programs should be widened to include Jews.Major Jewish orgs say reform, don't abolish, but critics are skepticalNo major Jewish group has called for abolishing the programs.“We think it is an absolute mistake for anyone to say that DEI is the single cause of the explosion of anti-Jewish intolerance we are seeing,” Adam Neufeld, a senior vice president and chief impact officer at the Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview. “It is a part of it, we’re sure, but it’s not the sole force. Antisemitism has existed for millennia.” The ADL is working to improve rather than abolish DEI programs, he said, from privately consulting with campus administrators, to publicly calling out universities that don’t protect Jewish students and faculty, to supporting litigation in cases alleging schools have mishandled antisemitic incidents.That approach is a mistake in the eyes of DEI’s most vociferous Jewish critics — many of whom view the campus convulsions after Oct. 7 as proof that they are right. Some of them pointed to the pivotal congressional hearing in December featuring three university presidents, who stumbled when asked whether calls for “the genocide of Jews” would violate their campuses’ speech codes. Two of the presidents, Liz McGill of the University of Pennsylvania and Claudine Gay of Harvard, later stepped down. DEI is “the root cause of antisemitism at Harvard,” Bill Ackman, a Jewish hedge fund manager and Harvard donor who led the charge against Gay, said in a lengthy tweet cheering her ouster.“For Jews, there are obvious and glaring dangers in a worldview that measures fairness by equality of outcome rather than opportunity,” Bari Weiss wrote in a Tablet essay about how Jews should respond to Oct. 7. Weiss, who runs the news startup The Free Press, argued that under DEI, “equity” has come to mean that people are judged deserving according to their group identities. “If underrepresentation is the inevitable outcome of systemic bias, then overrepresentation — and Jews are 2% of the American population — suggests not talent or hard work, but unearned privilege.”Abraham Foxman, the former national director of the Anti-Defamation League, told Jewish Insider that DEI “cannot be fixed,” saying that “efforts by communal Jewish organizations to include the Jewish community or soften its impact on antisemitism have failed.” David Harris, the former CEO of the American Jewish Committee, also told Jewish Insider that he doesn’t believe that “outside efforts, however well-intentioned, that nibble around the edges or simply seek to add Jews to the DEI agenda, address the heart of the problem. DEI today poses a major challenge to liberal understanding of American societal aims.”Some prominent American Jews call for DEI to be abolished altogetherOther prominent Jews calling for the demise of DEI are Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer and pro-Israel activist; Mark Charendoff, president of the Maimonides Fund, and David L. Bernstein, a Jewish communal professional whose opposition to “wokism” led him to form the Jew­ish Insti­tute for Lib­er­al Val­ues.“It’s not that we don’t want to make campuses comfortable places for people of color and gays and lesbians. God forbid,” Bernstein said in an interview. “Unfortunately DEI quickly evolved into an ideological framework that tells people in no uncertain terms who are the oppressed and who are the oppressors. It tends to divide people into racial affinity groups, which can be very divisive. It often imposes political litmus tests with DEI statements that applicants must submit for getting a job or getting promoted.”Bernstein agrees with Weiss that DEI turns the relative academic and financial success of Jews against them by suggesting they are “riding on the backs of deprived minority groups.” Bernstein and others also cite a 2021 report from the Heritage Foundation on the “public communications” of DEI professionals, saying they showed a disproportionate tendency to “attack Israel.” “Against this backdrop, it’s not hard to see why so many DEI programs are loath to acknowledge the antisemitic nature of anti-Zionist behavior that so often leads to the harassment of Jewish students,” Tammi Rossman-Benjamin, co-founder and director of the pro-Israel AMCHA Initiative, wrote in a piece for Sapir, a journal of the Maimonides Fund.At many campuses, DEI offices have staff who are trained in investigating and resolving complaints about discrimination, and are the main address for such complaints. However, in a college survey the ADL conducted before Oct. 7, more than half of all students surveyed said they had completed DEI training, but only 18% of those said those trainings included topics specific to anti-Jewish prejudice. “That is a terrible and unacceptable situation,” said the ADL’s Neufeld. “It is dangerous, both in the sense that it excludes a historically persecuted people who are incredibly vulnerable and actually sends the signal that the exclusion is acceptable.”Jewish critics of DEI frequently say this exclusion is the result of an “oppressor/oppressed” framework that considers Jews as white and privileged, but tend to provide little evidence. Instead, campus insiders say, there are other structural reasons for the exclusion of Jews and antisemitism from DEI offices.“Judaism is seen as a religion, and DEI offices don’t touch religion in the sort of structural ecosystem of how the university works,” explained Samira Mehta, the director of Jewish Studies and an associate professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, during a session at the AJS conference. “The university chaplains’ office is in charge of religion and religious diversity. DEI is in charge of racial and gender diversity. DEI is also not so welcome to Islamophobia, except to the degree that they keep their eye on what’s happening to brown students.“And the people who come up through these offices do not have training in religious diversity and don’t know how to do it,” she continued. “Also the people who come up in those offices sometimes are coming up from queer and gender diversity standpoints.” Mehta referred to these as “all of those structural ways that antisemitism, while real, is not something they handle.”Lauren Strauss, a professor of modern Jewish history at American University, said that was the experience of Jewish students on her campus who faced antisemitism in their dorms and classes after Oct. 7. They were told that “they should go see a chaplain because this is a religious matter, not racial, ethnic or social prejudice, and outside the DEI office’s mandate,” she said at the AJS panel on DEI. (This week, an activist law firm filed suit against A.U. over its handling of incidents affecting Jewish students on campus.)Jewish faculty at A.U. have also pushed, with little success, for discussion of antisemitism, alongside sexism, homophobia and transphobia, in a core curriculum course for first-year students and transfers known as the American University Experience. Even after agreeing to one session on the Holocaust, the university’s Center for Diversity and Inclusion said it was optional. “The one bright spot in all this,” Strauss said, is the support she’s gotten from “a small group of Jewish studies and general studies scholars” and the campus Hillel director. Yet Strauss and the other scholars did not say they favored abolishing the programs. While it may be satisfying to condemn the ideology underpinning DEI, they said, campuses need departments whose task it is to increase diversity and make the marginalized feel welcome. Stacy Burdett, a consultant who helps corporations, colleges and nonprofits enhance DEI programming to address Jewish concerns, said calls to dismantle DEI offices also ignore the ways they in fact advance diversity.“It’s hard for me to imagine a discussion of DEI that isn’t cognizant of the role that gender equity plays in the DEI movement,” she said, offering one example. “And also that the Jewish community itself is a place where there is a paucity of women leaders.”Burdett said the current debate over DEI lacks the kind of nuance that Jewish groups brought to debates over a previous era’s civil rights issues, including quotas and affirmative action. “There’s no question that some of the ideological underpinnings of DEI in some institutions are flawed, and sort people in categories that Jews don’t neatly fit into. I think everyone in the Jewish community wants the American public square to be a safer place for Jews, and there are just different ways of getting at that,” she said. “But we’re in a very polarized debate between two groups of people, one of whom sees diversity as a threat, and the other that sees it as the strength of a pluralistic society.” At the University of Minnesota, Natan Paradise shares many of the critics’ views of DEI’s shortcomings. But he is wary of joining in attacks that he sees either as politically motivated or hostile to the very idea of racial or gender inclusion. “Those who want to dismantle DEI are acting in bad faith,” he said. “DEI does a lot of good. It does make a difference for students on campus. It could make more of a difference. It could make a better, more nuanced difference. But I think DEI plays a critical role on campuses.” He prefers forming relationships with administrators at the university’s Office for Equity and Diversity, and said there have been successes, including a freshman orientation course that now includes discussion of antisemitism, and a change in how the campus Office for Equity and Diversity classifies antisemitism on its website.“We are just not on their radar and we ought to be, and I have been working very hard at my institution to change that, and we’ve made quite a bit of progress,” he said about Jews on campus. “We have to be present in all the social justice initiatives, in order for us to be present when we need it. And when I mean relationships, that means being in the spaces with the people who are doing the work, so that they see you as an ally, and you can count on them as an ally. In too many instances, we just haven’t done it.”
""This"" refers to fallout from the deadly Hamas attack on Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. “A lot of conversations have had to be had, educating both inside and outside the Jewish community,” Paradise said in an interview this month. “That happens daily. People want to know, should we respond and should we respond in an uproar? The donors are in an uproar. Administrators need context.”  At Minnesota, various academic departments issued statements on the conflict that Paradise calls “dismaying,” and others called actionable. The university chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine plastered the doors of academic buildings with flyers bearing anti-Israel messages. A prominent Republican on the law faculty filed a civil rights complaint that this week resulted in a federal investigation. And the campus was roiled when a candidate for a senior position at the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion office gave a speech accusing Israel of genocide and denying reports that Hamas had committed sexual crimes in the Oct. 7 attacks.  Smith Hall at the University of Minnesota, facing west.

DEI is also not so welcome to Islamophobia, except to the degree that they keep their eye on what’s happening to brown students.“And the people who come up through these offices do not have training in religious diversity and don’t know how to do it,” she continued. “Also the people who come up in those offices sometimes are coming up from queer and gender diversity standpoints.” Mehta referred to these as “all of those structural ways that antisemitism, while real, is not something they handle.”Lauren Strauss, a professor of modern Jewish history at American University, said that was the experience of Jewish students on her campus who faced antisemitism in their dorms and classes after Oct. 7. They were told that “they should go see a chaplain because this is a religious matter, not racial, ethnic or social prejudice, and outside the DEI office’s mandate,” she said at the AJS panel on DEI. (This week, an activist law firm filed suit against A.U. over its handling of incidents affecting Jewish students on campus.)Jewish faculty at A.U. have also pushed, with little success, for discussion of antisemitism, alongside sexism, homophobia and transphobia, in a core curriculum course for first-year students and transfers known as the American University Experience. Even after agreeing to one session on the Holocaust, the university’s Center for Diversity and Inclusion said it was optional. “The one bright spot in all this,” Strauss said, is the support she’s gotten from “a small group of Jewish studies and general studies scholars” and the campus Hillel director. Yet Strauss and the other scholars did not say they favored abolishing the programs. While it may be satisfying to condemn the ideology underpinning DEI, they said, campuses need departments whose task it is to increase diversity and make the marginalized feel welcome. Stacy Burdett, a consultant who helps corporations, colleges and nonprofits enhance DEI programming to address Jewish concerns, said calls to dismantle DEI offices also ignore the ways they in fact advance diversity.“It’s hard for me to imagine a discussion of DEI that isn’t cognizant of the role that gender equity plays in the DEI movement,” she said, offering one example. “And also that the Jewish community itself is a place where there is a paucity of women leaders.”Burdett said the current debate over DEI lacks the kind of nuance that Jewish groups brought to debates over a previous era’s civil rights issues, including quotas and affirmative action. “There’s no question that some of the ideological underpinnings of DEI in some institutions are flawed, and sort people in categories that Jews don’t neatly fit into. I think everyone in the Jewish community wants the American public square to be a safer place for Jews, and there are just different ways of getting at that,” she said. “But we’re in a very polarized debate between two groups of people, one of whom sees diversity as a threat, and the other that sees it as the strength of a pluralistic society.” At the University of Minnesota, Natan Paradise shares many of the critics’ views of DEI’s shortcomings. But he is wary of joining in attacks that he sees either as politically motivated or hostile to the very idea of racial or gender inclusion. “Those who want to dismantle DEI are acting in bad faith,” he said. “DEI does a lot of good. It does make a difference for students on campus. It could make more of a difference. It could make a better, more nuanced difference. But I think DEI plays a critical role on campuses.” He prefers forming relationships with administrators at the university’s Office for Equity and Diversity, and said there have been successes, including a freshman orientation course that now includes discussion of antisemitism, and a change in how the campus Office for Equity and Diversity classifies antisemitism on its website.“We are just not on their radar and we ought to be, and I have been working very hard at my institution to change that, and we’ve made quite a bit of progress,” he said about Jews on campus. “We have to be present in all the social justice initiatives, in order for us to be present when we need it. And when I mean relationships, that means being in the spaces with the people who are doing the work, so that they see you as an ally, and you can count on them as an ally. In too many instances, we just haven’t done it.”
At Minnesota, various academic departments issued statements on the conflict that Paradise calls “dismaying,” and others called actionable. The university chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine plastered the doors of academic buildings with flyers bearing anti-Israel messages. A prominent Republican on the law faculty filed a civil rights complaint that this week resulted in a federal investigation. And the campus was roiled when a candidate for a senior position at the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion office gave a speech accusing Israel of genocide and denying reports that Hamas had committed sexual crimes in the Oct. 7 attacks.  Smith Hall at the University of Minnesota, facing west.

When Paradise joined fellow scholars for a panel discussion about “Jews, Antisemitism and DEI: Campus Experiences” at the Association for Jewish Studies conference in San Francisco last month, emotions ran high.“We have problems” with the campus DEI office, said Amy Simon, an assistant professor of Holocaust Studies and European Jewish History at Michigan State University, where officials recently backed away from a project that would have addressed concerns about antisemitism. The office is known as the Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion, or IDI. “Sometimes they’re listening, but there’s never a real hearing from the top of the administration [or] the IDI either.” AdvertisementDEI is a shorthand for a framework that says employers and institutions should be welcoming to diverse applicants, especially people of color, women and the LGBTQ community. Campus DEI offices offer training to students and faculty in how to be welcoming to marginalized groups, provide support groups for women, people of color and LGBTQ students, and work with the administration in promoting and identifying diverse candidates for faculty and administration jobs. College campuses have had minority and multicultural affairs offices since the late 1960s and 1970s, focused largely on hiring more diverse faculty and staff and enrolling and retaining more students of color. In the mid-2000s, diversity officers who had been working in isolation formed the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. The organization’s membership has tripled to over 2,000 since July 2020, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, as universities reacted to the police murder of George Floyd and calls to address systemic racism.As the offices have grown — more than two-thirds of all major universities have chief diversity officers — and as a backlash to the 2020 reckoning on race has deepened, criticism has mounted against DEI. In recent years, it has become a prime target of a group of activists — mostly conservative, and some of them Jewish — who blame DEI for an antipathy toward what they see as traditional American values and a misguided focus on identity over merit in academia.One leader of the anti-DEI movement is Chris Rufo, a conservative activist who has argued that diversity initiatives undercut the values of the liberal arts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him to the board of the New College of Florida as part of an effort to remake it according to conservative values — and one of the first moves was to ax the DEI office. But it’s not just Florida: In 2023, Republican lawmakers in at least a dozen states proposed more than 30 bills targeting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in higher education.Since Oct. 7, some Jews who would not normally feel at home on the right have found themselves joining the ranks of DEI’s critics. At the Jewish studies conference, many scholars said their schools’ DEI offices ignored Jewish concerns — either not recognizing Jews as a minority or seeing them as white and privileged, and therefore not subject to marginalization. The seeming failure of many DEI programs to take Jews’ concerns seriously has led some Jewish leaders and conservative politicians to call for their dismantling. But others, particularly on the left, say the core values at the root of DEI initiatives are positive and the programs should be widened to include Jews.Major Jewish orgs say reform, don't abolish, but critics are skepticalNo major Jewish group has called for abolishing the programs.“We think it is an absolute mistake for anyone to say that DEI is the single cause of the explosion of anti-Jewish intolerance we are seeing,” Adam Neufeld, a senior vice president and chief impact officer at the Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview. “It is a part of it, we’re sure, but it’s not the sole force. Antisemitism has existed for millennia.” The ADL is working to improve rather than abolish DEI programs, he said, from privately consulting with campus administrators, to publicly calling out universities that don’t protect Jewish students and faculty, to supporting litigation in cases alleging schools have mishandled antisemitic incidents.That approach is a mistake in the eyes of DEI’s most vociferous Jewish critics — many of whom view the campus convulsions after Oct. 7 as proof that they are right. Some of them pointed to the pivotal congressional hearing in December featuring three university presidents, who stumbled when asked whether calls for “the genocide of Jews” would violate their campuses’ speech codes. Two of the presidents, Liz McGill of the University of Pennsylvania and Claudine Gay of Harvard, later stepped down. DEI is “the root cause of antisemitism at Harvard,” Bill Ackman, a Jewish hedge fund manager and Harvard donor who led the charge against Gay, said in a lengthy tweet cheering her ouster.“For Jews, there are obvious and glaring dangers in a worldview that measures fairness by equality of outcome rather than opportunity,” Bari Weiss wrote in a Tablet essay about how Jews should respond to Oct. 7. Weiss, who runs the news startup The Free Press, argued that under DEI, “equity” has come to mean that people are judged deserving according to their group identities. “If underrepresentation is the inevitable outcome of systemic bias, then overrepresentation — and Jews are 2% of the American population — suggests not talent or hard work, but unearned privilege.”Abraham Foxman, the former national director of the Anti-Defamation League, told Jewish Insider that DEI “cannot be fixed,” saying that “efforts by communal Jewish organizations to include the Jewish community or soften its impact on antisemitism have failed.” David Harris, the former CEO of the American Jewish Committee, also told Jewish Insider that he doesn’t believe that “outside efforts, however well-intentioned, that nibble around the edges or simply seek to add Jews to the DEI agenda, address the heart of the problem. DEI today poses a major challenge to liberal understanding of American societal aims.”Some prominent American Jews call for DEI to be abolished altogetherOther prominent Jews calling for the demise of DEI are Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer and pro-Israel activist; Mark Charendoff, president of the Maimonides Fund, and David L. Bernstein, a Jewish communal professional whose opposition to “wokism” led him to form the Jew­ish Insti­tute for Lib­er­al Val­ues.“It’s not that we don’t want to make campuses comfortable places for people of color and gays and lesbians. God forbid,” Bernstein said in an interview. “Unfortunately DEI quickly evolved into an ideological framework that tells people in no uncertain terms who are the oppressed and who are the oppressors. It tends to divide people into racial affinity groups, which can be very divisive. It often imposes political litmus tests with DEI statements that applicants must submit for getting a job or getting promoted.”Bernstein agrees with Weiss that DEI turns the relative academic and financial success of Jews against them by suggesting they are “riding on the backs of deprived minority groups.” Bernstein and others also cite a 2021 report from the Heritage Foundation on the “public communications” of DEI professionals, saying they showed a disproportionate tendency to “attack Israel.” “Against this backdrop, it’s not hard to see why so many DEI programs are loath to acknowledge the antisemitic nature of anti-Zionist behavior that so often leads to the harassment of Jewish students,” Tammi Rossman-Benjamin, co-founder and director of the pro-Israel AMCHA Initiative, wrote in a piece for Sapir, a journal of the Maimonides Fund.At many campuses, DEI offices have staff who are trained in investigating and resolving complaints about discrimination, and are the main address for such complaints. However, in a college survey the ADL conducted before Oct. 7, more than half of all students surveyed said they had completed DEI training, but only 18% of those said those trainings included topics specific to anti-Jewish prejudice. “That is a terrible and unacceptable situation,” said the ADL’s Neufeld. “It is dangerous, both in the sense that it excludes a historically persecuted people who are incredibly vulnerable and actually sends the signal that the exclusion is acceptable.”Jewish critics of DEI frequently say this exclusion is the result of an “oppressor/oppressed” framework that considers Jews as white and privileged, but tend to provide little evidence. Instead, campus insiders say, there are other structural reasons for the exclusion of Jews and antisemitism from DEI offices.“Judaism is seen as a religion, and DEI offices don’t touch religion in the sort of structural ecosystem of how the university works,” explained Samira Mehta, the director of Jewish Studies and an associate professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, during a session at the AJS conference. “The university chaplains’ office is in charge of religion and religious diversity.

Weiss, who runs the news startup The Free Press, argued that under DEI, “equity” has come to mean that people are judged deserving according to their group identities. “If underrepresentation is the inevitable outcome of systemic bias, then overrepresentation — and Jews are 2% of the American population — suggests not talent or hard work, but unearned privilege.”Abraham Foxman, the former national director of the Anti-Defamation League, told Jewish Insider that DEI “cannot be fixed,” saying that “efforts by communal Jewish organizations to include the Jewish community or soften its impact on antisemitism have failed.” David Harris, the former CEO of the American Jewish Committee, also told Jewish Insider that he doesn’t believe that “outside efforts, however well-intentioned, that nibble around the edges or simply seek to add Jews to the DEI agenda, address the heart of the problem. DEI today poses a major challenge to liberal understanding of American societal aims.”Some prominent American Jews call for DEI to be abolished altogetherOther prominent Jews calling for the demise of DEI are Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer and pro-Israel activist; Mark Charendoff, president of the Maimonides Fund, and David L. Bernstein, a Jewish communal professional whose opposition to “wokism” led him to form the Jew­ish Insti­tute for Lib­er­al Val­ues.“It’s not that we don’t want to make campuses comfortable places for people of color and gays and lesbians. God forbid,” Bernstein said in an interview. “Unfortunately DEI quickly evolved into an ideological framework that tells people in no uncertain terms who are the oppressed and who are the oppressors. It tends to divide people into racial affinity groups, which can be very divisive. It often imposes political litmus tests with DEI statements that applicants must submit for getting a job or getting promoted.”Bernstein agrees with Weiss that DEI turns the relative academic and financial success of Jews against them by suggesting they are “riding on the backs of deprived minority groups.” Bernstein and others also cite a 2021 report from the Heritage Foundation on the “public communications” of DEI professionals, saying they showed a disproportionate tendency to “attack Israel.” “Against this backdrop, it’s not hard to see why so many DEI programs are loath to acknowledge the antisemitic nature of anti-Zionist behavior that so often leads to the harassment of Jewish students,” Tammi Rossman-Benjamin, co-founder and director of the pro-Israel AMCHA Initiative, wrote in a piece for Sapir, a journal of the Maimonides Fund.At many campuses, DEI offices have staff who are trained in investigating and resolving complaints about discrimination, and are the main address for such complaints. However, in a college survey the ADL conducted before Oct. 7, more than half of all students surveyed said they had completed DEI training, but only 18% of those said those trainings included topics specific to anti-Jewish prejudice. “That is a terrible and unacceptable situation,” said the ADL’s Neufeld. “It is dangerous, both in the sense that it excludes a historically persecuted people who are incredibly vulnerable and actually sends the signal that the exclusion is acceptable.”Jewish critics of DEI frequently say this exclusion is the result of an “oppressor/oppressed” framework that considers Jews as white and privileged, but tend to provide little evidence. Instead, campus insiders say, there are other structural reasons for the exclusion of Jews and antisemitism from DEI offices.“Judaism is seen as a religion, and DEI offices don’t touch religion in the sort of structural ecosystem of how the university works,” explained Samira Mehta, the director of Jewish Studies and an associate professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, during a session at the AJS conference. “The university chaplains’ office is in charge of religion and religious diversity. DEI is in charge of racial and gender diversity. DEI is also not so welcome to Islamophobia, except to the degree that they keep their eye on what’s happening to brown students.“And the people who come up through these offices do not have training in religious diversity and don’t know how to do it,” she continued. “Also the people who come up in those offices sometimes are coming up from queer and gender diversity standpoints.” Mehta referred to these as “all of those structural ways that antisemitism, while real, is not something they handle.”Lauren Strauss, a professor of modern Jewish history at American University, said that was the experience of Jewish students on her campus who faced antisemitism in their dorms and classes after Oct. 7. They were told that “they should go see a chaplain because this is a religious matter, not racial, ethnic or social prejudice, and outside the DEI office’s mandate,” she said at the AJS panel on DEI. (This week, an activist law firm filed suit against A.U. over its handling of incidents affecting Jewish students on campus.)Jewish faculty at A.U. have also pushed, with little success, for discussion of antisemitism, alongside sexism, homophobia and transphobia, in a core curriculum course for first-year students and transfers known as the American University Experience. Even after agreeing to one session on the Holocaust, the university’s Center for Diversity and Inclusion said it was optional. “The one bright spot in all this,” Strauss said, is the support she’s gotten from “a small group of Jewish studies and general studies scholars” and the campus Hillel director. Yet Strauss and the other scholars did not say they favored abolishing the programs. While it may be satisfying to condemn the ideology underpinning DEI, they said, campuses need departments whose task it is to increase diversity and make the marginalized feel welcome. Stacy Burdett, a consultant who helps corporations, colleges and nonprofits enhance DEI programming to address Jewish concerns, said calls to dismantle DEI offices also ignore the ways they in fact advance diversity.“It’s hard for me to imagine a discussion of DEI that isn’t cognizant of the role that gender equity plays in the DEI movement,” she said, offering one example. “And also that the Jewish community itself is a place where there is a paucity of women leaders.”Burdett said the current debate over DEI lacks the kind of nuance that Jewish groups brought to debates over a previous era’s civil rights issues, including quotas and affirmative action. “There’s no question that some of the ideological underpinnings of DEI in some institutions are flawed, and sort people in categories that Jews don’t neatly fit into. I think everyone in the Jewish community wants the American public square to be a safer place for Jews, and there are just different ways of getting at that,” she said. “But we’re in a very polarized debate between two groups of people, one of whom sees diversity as a threat, and the other that sees it as the strength of a pluralistic society.” At the University of Minnesota, Natan Paradise shares many of the critics’ views of DEI’s shortcomings. But he is wary of joining in attacks that he sees either as politically motivated or hostile to the very idea of racial or gender inclusion. “Those who want to dismantle DEI are acting in bad faith,” he said. “DEI does a lot of good. It does make a difference for students on campus. It could make more of a difference. It could make a better, more nuanced difference. But I think DEI plays a critical role on campuses.” He prefers forming relationships with administrators at the university’s Office for Equity and Diversity, and said there have been successes, including a freshman orientation course that now includes discussion of antisemitism, and a change in how the campus Office for Equity and Diversity classifies antisemitism on its website.“We are just not on their radar and we ought to be, and I have been working very hard at my institution to change that, and we’ve made quite a bit of progress,” he said about Jews on campus. “We have to be present in all the social justice initiatives, in order for us to be present when we need it. And when I mean relationships, that means being in the spaces with the people who are doing the work, so that they see you as an ally, and you can count on them as an ally. In too many instances, we just haven’t done it.”
“We have problems” with the campus DEI office, said Amy Simon, an assistant professor of Holocaust Studies and European Jewish History at Michigan State University, where officials recently backed away from a project that would have addressed concerns about antisemitism. The office is known as the Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion, or IDI. “Sometimes they’re listening, but there’s never a real hearing from the top of the administration [or] the IDI either.” AdvertisementDEI is a shorthand for a framework that says employers and institutions should be welcoming to diverse applicants, especially people of color, women and the LGBTQ community. Campus DEI offices offer training to students and faculty in how to be welcoming to marginalized groups, provide support groups for women, people of color and LGBTQ students, and work with the administration in promoting and identifying diverse candidates for faculty and administration jobs. College campuses have had minority and multicultural affairs offices since the late 1960s and 1970s, focused largely on hiring more diverse faculty and staff and enrolling and retaining more students of color. In the mid-2000s, diversity officers who had been working in isolation formed the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. The organization’s membership has tripled to over 2,000 since July 2020, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education, as universities reacted to the police murder of George Floyd and calls to address systemic racism.As the offices have grown — more than two-thirds of all major universities have chief diversity officers — and as a backlash to the 2020 reckoning on race has deepened, criticism has mounted against DEI. In recent years, it has become a prime target of a group of activists — mostly conservative, and some of them Jewish — who blame DEI for an antipathy toward what they see as traditional American values and a misguided focus on identity over merit in academia.One leader of the anti-DEI movement is Chris Rufo, a conservative activist who has argued that diversity initiatives undercut the values of the liberal arts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him to the board of the New College of Florida as part of an effort to remake it according to conservative values — and one of the first moves was to ax the DEI office. But it’s not just Florida: In 2023, Republican lawmakers in at least a dozen states proposed more than 30 bills targeting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in higher education.Since Oct. 7, some Jews who would not normally feel at home on the right have found themselves joining the ranks of DEI’s critics. At the Jewish studies conference, many scholars said their schools’ DEI offices ignored Jewish concerns — either not recognizing Jews as a minority or seeing them as white and privileged, and therefore not subject to marginalization. The seeming failure of many DEI programs to take Jews’ concerns seriously has led some Jewish leaders and conservative politicians to call for their dismantling. But others, particularly on the left, say the core values at the root of DEI initiatives are positive and the programs should be widened to include Jews.Major Jewish orgs say reform, don't abolish, but critics are skepticalNo major Jewish group has called for abolishing the programs.“We think it is an absolute mistake for anyone to say that DEI is the single cause of the explosion of anti-Jewish intolerance we are seeing,” Adam Neufeld, a senior vice president and chief impact officer at the Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview. “It is a part of it, we’re sure, but it’s not the sole force. Antisemitism has existed for millennia.” The ADL is working to improve rather than abolish DEI programs, he said, from privately consulting with campus administrators, to publicly calling out universities that don’t protect Jewish students and faculty, to supporting litigation in cases alleging schools have mishandled antisemitic incidents.That approach is a mistake in the eyes of DEI’s most vociferous Jewish critics — many of whom view the campus convulsions after Oct. 7 as proof that they are right. Some of them pointed to the pivotal congressional hearing in December featuring three university presidents, who stumbled when asked whether calls for “the genocide of Jews” would violate their campuses’ speech codes.

Weiss, who runs the news startup The Free Press, argued that under DEI, “equity” has come to mean that people are judged deserving according to their group identities. “If underrepresentation is the inevitable outcome of systemic bias, then overrepresentation — and Jews are 2% of the American population — suggests not talent or hard work, but unearned privilege.”Abraham Foxman, the former national director of the Anti-Defamation League, told Jewish Insider that DEI “cannot be fixed,” saying that “efforts by communal Jewish organizations to include the Jewish community or soften its impact on antisemitism have failed.” David Harris, the former CEO of the American Jewish Committee, also told Jewish Insider that he doesn’t believe that “outside efforts, however well-intentioned, that nibble around the edges or simply seek to add Jews to the DEI agenda, address the heart of the problem. DEI today poses a major challenge to liberal understanding of American societal aims.”Some prominent American Jews call for DEI to be abolished altogetherOther prominent Jews calling for the demise of DEI are Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer and pro-Israel activist; Mark Charendoff, president of the Maimonides Fund, and David L. Bernstein, a Jewish communal professional whose opposition to “wokism” led him to form the Jew­ish Insti­tute for Lib­er­al Val­ues.“It’s not that we don’t want to make campuses comfortable places for people of color and gays and lesbians. God forbid,” Bernstein said in an interview. “Unfortunately DEI quickly evolved into an ideological framework that tells people in no uncertain terms who are the oppressed and who are the oppressors. It tends to divide people into racial affinity groups, which can be very divisive. It often imposes political litmus tests with DEI statements that applicants must submit for getting a job or getting promoted.”Bernstein agrees with Weiss that DEI turns the relative academic and financial success of Jews against them by suggesting they are “riding on the backs of deprived minority groups.” Bernstein and others also cite a 2021 report from the Heritage Foundation on the “public communications” of DEI professionals, saying they showed a disproportionate tendency to “attack Israel.” “Against this backdrop, it’s not hard to see why so many DEI programs are loath to acknowledge the antisemitic nature of anti-Zionist behavior that so often leads to the harassment of Jewish students,” Tammi Rossman-Benjamin, co-founder and director of the pro-Israel AMCHA Initiative, wrote in a piece for Sapir, a journal of the Maimonides Fund.At many campuses, DEI offices have staff who are trained in investigating and resolving complaints about discrimination, and are the main address for such complaints. However, in a college survey the ADL conducted before Oct. 7, more than half of all students surveyed said they had completed DEI training, but only 18% of those said those trainings included topics specific to anti-Jewish prejudice. “That is a terrible and unacceptable situation,” said the ADL’s Neufeld. “It is dangerous, both in the sense that it excludes a historically persecuted people who are incredibly vulnerable and actually sends the signal that the exclusion is acceptable.”Jewish critics of DEI frequently say this exclusion is the result of an “oppressor/oppressed” framework that considers Jews as white and privileged, but tend to provide little evidence. Instead, campus insiders say, there are other structural reasons for the exclusion of Jews and antisemitism from DEI offices.“Judaism is seen as a religion, and DEI offices don’t touch religion in the sort of structural ecosystem of how the university works,” explained Samira Mehta, the director of Jewish Studies and an associate professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, during a session at the AJS conference. “The university chaplains’ office is in charge of religion and religious diversity. DEI is in charge of racial and gender diversity. DEI is also not so welcome to Islamophobia, except to the degree that they keep their eye on what’s happening to brown students.“And the people who come up through these offices do not have training in religious diversity and don’t know how to do it,” she continued. “Also the people who come up in those offices sometimes are coming up from queer and gender diversity standpoints.” Mehta referred to these as “all of those structural ways that antisemitism, while real, is not something they handle.”Lauren Strauss, a professor of modern Jewish history at American University, said that was the experience of Jewish students on her campus who faced antisemitism in their dorms and classes after Oct. 7. They were told that “they should go see a chaplain because this is a religious matter, not racial, ethnic or social prejudice, and outside the DEI office’s mandate,” she said at the AJS panel on DEI. (This week, an activist law firm filed suit against A.U. over its handling of incidents affecting Jewish students on campus.)Jewish faculty at A.U. have also pushed, with little success, for discussion of antisemitism, alongside sexism, homophobia and transphobia, in a core curriculum course for first-year students and transfers known as the American University Experience. Even after agreeing to one session on the Holocaust, the university’s Center for Diversity and Inclusion said it was optional. “The one bright spot in all this,” Strauss said, is the support she’s gotten from “a small group of Jewish studies and general studies scholars” and the campus Hillel director. Yet Strauss and the other scholars did not say they favored abolishing the programs. While it may be satisfying to condemn the ideology underpinning DEI, they said, campuses need departments whose task it is to increase diversity and make the marginalized feel welcome. Stacy Burdett, a consultant who helps corporations, colleges and nonprofits enhance DEI programming to address Jewish concerns, said calls to dismantle DEI offices also ignore the ways they in fact advance diversity.“It’s hard for me to imagine a discussion of DEI that isn’t cognizant of the role that gender equity plays in the DEI movement,” she said, offering one example. “And also that the Jewish community itself is a place where there is a paucity of women leaders.”Burdett said the current debate over DEI lacks the kind of nuance that Jewish groups brought to debates over a previous era’s civil rights issues, including quotas and affirmative action. “There’s no question that some of the ideological underpinnings of DEI in some institutions are flawed, and sort people in categories that Jews don’t neatly fit into. I think everyone in the Jewish community wants the American public square to be a safer place for Jews, and there are just different ways of getting at that,” she said. “But we’re in a very polarized debate between two groups of people, one of whom sees diversity as a threat, and the other that sees it as the strength of a pluralistic society.” At the University of Minnesota, Natan Paradise shares many of the critics’ views of DEI’s shortcomings. But he is wary of joining in attacks that he sees either as politically motivated or hostile to the very idea of racial or gender inclusion. “Those who want to dismantle DEI are acting in bad faith,” he said. “DEI does a lot of good. It does make a difference for students on campus. It could make more of a difference. It could make a better, more nuanced difference. But I think DEI plays a critical role on campuses.” He prefers forming relationships with administrators at the university’s Office for Equity and Diversity, and said there have been successes, including a freshman orientation course that now includes discussion of antisemitism, and a change in how the campus Office for Equity and Diversity classifies antisemitism on its website.“We are just not on their radar and we ought to be, and I have been working very hard at my institution to change that, and we’ve made quite a bit of progress,” he said about Jews on campus. “We have to be present in all the social justice initiatives, in order for us to be present when we need it. And when I mean relationships, that means being in the spaces with the people who are doing the work, so that they see you as an ally, and you can count on them as an ally. In too many instances, we just haven’t done it.”
As the offices have grown — more than two-thirds of all major universities have chief diversity officers — and as a backlash to the 2020 reckoning on race has deepened, criticism has mounted against DEI. In recent years, it has become a prime target of a group of activists — mostly conservative, and some of them Jewish — who blame DEI for an antipathy toward what they see as traditional American values and a misguided focus on identity over merit in academia.One leader of the anti-DEI movement is Chris Rufo, a conservative activist who has argued that diversity initiatives undercut the values of the liberal arts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him to the board of the New College of Florida as part of an effort to remake it according to conservative values — and one of the first moves was to ax the DEI office. But it’s not just Florida: In 2023, Republican lawmakers in at least a dozen states proposed more than 30 bills targeting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in higher education.Since Oct. 7, some Jews who would not normally feel at home on the right have found themselves joining the ranks of DEI’s critics. At the Jewish studies conference, many scholars said their schools’ DEI offices ignored Jewish concerns — either not recognizing Jews as a minority or seeing them as white and privileged, and therefore not subject to marginalization. The seeming failure of many DEI programs to take Jews’ concerns seriously has led some Jewish leaders and conservative politicians to call for their dismantling. But others, particularly on the left, say the core values at the root of DEI initiatives are positive and the programs should be widened to include Jews.Major Jewish orgs say reform, don't abolish, but critics are skepticalNo major Jewish group has called for abolishing the programs.“We think it is an absolute mistake for anyone to say that DEI is the single cause of the explosion of anti-Jewish intolerance we are seeing,” Adam Neufeld, a senior vice president and chief impact officer at the Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview. “It is a part of it, we’re sure, but it’s not the sole force. Antisemitism has existed for millennia.” The ADL is working to improve rather than abolish DEI programs, he said, from privately consulting with campus administrators, to publicly calling out universities that don’t protect Jewish students and faculty, to supporting litigation in cases alleging schools have mishandled antisemitic incidents.That approach is a mistake in the eyes of DEI’s most vociferous Jewish critics — many of whom view the campus convulsions after Oct. 7 as proof that they are right. Some of them pointed to the pivotal congressional hearing in December featuring three university presidents, who stumbled when asked whether calls for “the genocide of Jews” would violate their campuses’ speech codes. Two of the presidents, Liz McGill of the University of Pennsylvania and Claudine Gay of Harvard, later stepped down.

They were told that “they should go see a chaplain because this is a religious matter, not racial, ethnic or social prejudice, and outside the DEI office’s mandate,” she said at the AJS panel on DEI. (This week, an activist law firm filed suit against A.U. over its handling of incidents affecting Jewish students on campus.)Jewish faculty at A.U. have also pushed, with little success, for discussion of antisemitism, alongside sexism, homophobia and transphobia, in a core curriculum course for first-year students and transfers known as the American University Experience. Even after agreeing to one session on the Holocaust, the university’s Center for Diversity and Inclusion said it was optional. “The one bright spot in all this,” Strauss said, is the support she’s gotten from “a small group of Jewish studies and general studies scholars” and the campus Hillel director. Yet Strauss and the other scholars did not say they favored abolishing the programs. While it may be satisfying to condemn the ideology underpinning DEI, they said, campuses need departments whose task it is to increase diversity and make the marginalized feel welcome. Stacy Burdett, a consultant who helps corporations, colleges and nonprofits enhance DEI programming to address Jewish concerns, said calls to dismantle DEI offices also ignore the ways they in fact advance diversity.“It’s hard for me to imagine a discussion of DEI that isn’t cognizant of the role that gender equity plays in the DEI movement,” she said, offering one example. “And also that the Jewish community itself is a place where there is a paucity of women leaders.”Burdett said the current debate over DEI lacks the kind of nuance that Jewish groups brought to debates over a previous era’s civil rights issues, including quotas and affirmative action. “There’s no question that some of the ideological underpinnings of DEI in some institutions are flawed, and sort people in categories that Jews don’t neatly fit into. I think everyone in the Jewish community wants the American public square to be a safer place for Jews, and there are just different ways of getting at that,” she said. “But we’re in a very polarized debate between two groups of people, one of whom sees diversity as a threat, and the other that sees it as the strength of a pluralistic society.” At the University of Minnesota, Natan Paradise shares many of the critics’ views of DEI’s shortcomings. But he is wary of joining in attacks that he sees either as politically motivated or hostile to the very idea of racial or gender inclusion. “Those who want to dismantle DEI are acting in bad faith,” he said. “DEI does a lot of good. It does make a difference for students on campus. It could make more of a difference. It could make a better, more nuanced difference. But I think DEI plays a critical role on campuses.” He prefers forming relationships with administrators at the university’s Office for Equity and Diversity, and said there have been successes, including a freshman orientation course that now includes discussion of antisemitism, and a change in how the campus Office for Equity and Diversity classifies antisemitism on its website.“We are just not on their radar and we ought to be, and I have been working very hard at my institution to change that, and we’ve made quite a bit of progress,” he said about Jews on campus. “We have to be present in all the social justice initiatives, in order for us to be present when we need it. And when I mean relationships, that means being in the spaces with the people who are doing the work, so that they see you as an ally, and you can count on them as an ally. In too many instances, we just haven’t done it.”
The seeming failure of many DEI programs to take Jews’ concerns seriously has led some Jewish leaders and conservative politicians to call for their dismantling. But others, particularly on the left, say the core values at the root of DEI initiatives are positive and the programs should be widened to include Jews.Major Jewish orgs say reform, don't abolish, but critics are skepticalNo major Jewish group has called for abolishing the programs.“We think it is an absolute mistake for anyone to say that DEI is the single cause of the explosion of anti-Jewish intolerance we are seeing,” Adam Neufeld, a senior vice president and chief impact officer at the Anti-Defamation League, said in an interview. “It is a part of it, we’re sure, but it’s not the sole force. Antisemitism has existed for millennia.” The ADL is working to improve rather than abolish DEI programs, he said, from privately consulting with campus administrators, to publicly calling out universities that don’t protect Jewish students and faculty, to supporting litigation in cases alleging schools have mishandled antisemitic incidents.That approach is a mistake in the eyes of DEI’s most vociferous Jewish critics — many of whom view the campus convulsions after Oct. 7 as proof that they are right. Some of them pointed to the pivotal congressional hearing in December featuring three university presidents, who stumbled when asked whether calls for “the genocide of Jews” would violate their campuses’ speech codes. Two of the presidents, Liz McGill of the University of Pennsylvania and Claudine Gay of Harvard, later stepped down. DEI is “the root cause of antisemitism at Harvard,” Bill Ackman, a Jewish hedge fund manager and Harvard donor who led the charge against Gay, said in a lengthy tweet cheering her ouster.“For Jews, there are obvious and glaring dangers in a worldview that measures fairness by equality of outcome rather than opportunity,” Bari Weiss wrote in a Tablet essay about how Jews should respond to Oct. 7. Weiss, who runs the news startup The Free Press, argued that under DEI, “equity” has come to mean that people are judged deserving according to their group identities. “If underrepresentation is the inevitable outcome of systemic bias, then overrepresentation — and Jews are 2% of the American population — suggests not talent or hard work, but unearned privilege.”Abraham Foxman, the former national director of the Anti-Defamation League, told Jewish Insider that DEI “cannot be fixed,” saying that “efforts by communal Jewish organizations to include the Jewish community or soften its impact on antisemitism have failed.” David Harris, the former CEO of the American Jewish Committee, also told Jewish Insider that he doesn’t believe that “outside efforts, however well-intentioned, that nibble around the edges or simply seek to add Jews to the DEI agenda, address the heart of the problem. DEI today poses a major challenge to liberal understanding of American societal aims.”Some prominent American Jews call for DEI to be abolished altogetherOther prominent Jews calling for the demise of DEI are Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer and pro-Israel activist; Mark Charendoff, president of the Maimonides Fund, and David L. Bernstein, a Jewish communal professional whose opposition to “wokism” led him to form the Jew­ish Insti­tute for Lib­er­al Val­ues.“It’s not that we don’t want to make campuses comfortable places for people of color and gays and lesbians. God forbid,” Bernstein said in an interview. “Unfortunately DEI quickly evolved into an ideological framework that tells people in no uncertain terms who are the oppressed and who are the oppressors. It tends to divide people into racial affinity groups, which can be very divisive. It often imposes political litmus tests with DEI statements that applicants must submit for getting a job or getting promoted.”Bernstein agrees with Weiss that DEI turns the relative academic and financial success of Jews against them by suggesting they are “riding on the backs of deprived minority groups.” Bernstein and others also cite a 2021 report from the Heritage Foundation on the “public communications” of DEI professionals, saying they showed a disproportionate tendency to “attack Israel.” “Against this backdrop, it’s not hard to see why so many DEI programs are loath to acknowledge the antisemitic nature of anti-Zionist behavior that so often leads to the harassment of Jewish students,” Tammi Rossman-Benjamin, co-founder and director of the pro-Israel AMCHA Initiative, wrote in a piece for Sapir, a journal of the Maimonides Fund.At many campuses, DEI offices have staff who are trained in investigating and resolving complaints about discrimination, and are the main address for such complaints. However, in a college survey the ADL conducted before Oct. 7, more than half of all students surveyed said they had completed DEI training, but only 18% of those said those trainings included topics specific to anti-Jewish prejudice. “That is a terrible and unacceptable situation,” said the ADL’s Neufeld. “It is dangerous, both in the sense that it excludes a historically persecuted people who are incredibly vulnerable and actually sends the signal that the exclusion is acceptable.”Jewish critics of DEI frequently say this exclusion is the result of an “oppressor/oppressed” framework that considers Jews as white and privileged, but tend to provide little evidence. Instead, campus insiders say, there are other structural reasons for the exclusion of Jews and antisemitism from DEI offices.“Judaism is seen as a religion, and DEI offices don’t touch religion in the sort of structural ecosystem of how the university works,” explained Samira Mehta, the director of Jewish Studies and an associate professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, during a session at the AJS conference. “The university chaplains’ office is in charge of religion and religious diversity. DEI is in charge of racial and gender diversity.

However, in a college survey the ADL conducted before Oct. 7, more than half of all students surveyed said they had completed DEI training, but only 18% of those said those trainings included topics specific to anti-Jewish prejudice. “That is a terrible and unacceptable situation,” said the ADL’s Neufeld. “It is dangerous, both in the sense that it excludes a historically persecuted people who are incredibly vulnerable and actually sends the signal that the exclusion is acceptable.”Jewish critics of DEI frequently say this exclusion is the result of an “oppressor/oppressed” framework that considers Jews as white and privileged, but tend to provide little evidence. Instead, campus insiders say, there are other structural reasons for the exclusion of Jews and antisemitism from DEI offices.“Judaism is seen as a religion, and DEI offices don’t touch religion in the sort of structural ecosystem of how the university works,” explained Samira Mehta, the director of Jewish Studies and an associate professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, during a session at the AJS conference. “The university chaplains’ office is in charge of religion and religious diversity. DEI is in charge of racial and gender diversity. DEI is also not so welcome to Islamophobia, except to the degree that they keep their eye on what’s happening to brown students.“And the people who come up through these offices do not have training in religious diversity and don’t know how to do it,” she continued. “Also the people who come up in those offices sometimes are coming up from queer and gender diversity standpoints.” Mehta referred to these as “all of those structural ways that antisemitism, while real, is not something they handle.”Lauren Strauss, a professor of modern Jewish history at American University, said that was the experience of Jewish students on her campus who faced antisemitism in their dorms and classes after Oct. 7. They were told that “they should go see a chaplain because this is a religious matter, not racial, ethnic or social prejudice, and outside the DEI office’s mandate,” she said at the AJS panel on DEI. (This week, an activist law firm filed suit against A.U. over its handling of incidents affecting Jewish students on campus.)Jewish faculty at A.U. have also pushed, with little success, for discussion of antisemitism, alongside sexism, homophobia and transphobia, in a core curriculum course for first-year students and transfers known as the American University Experience. Even after agreeing to one session on the Holocaust, the university’s Center for Diversity and Inclusion said it was optional. “The one bright spot in all this,” Strauss said, is the support she’s gotten from “a small group of Jewish studies and general studies scholars” and the campus Hillel director. Yet Strauss and the other scholars did not say they favored abolishing the programs. While it may be satisfying to condemn the ideology underpinning DEI, they said, campuses need departments whose task it is to increase diversity and make the marginalized feel welcome. Stacy Burdett, a consultant who helps corporations, colleges and nonprofits enhance DEI programming to address Jewish concerns, said calls to dismantle DEI offices also ignore the ways they in fact advance diversity.“It’s hard for me to imagine a discussion of DEI that isn’t cognizant of the role that gender equity plays in the DEI movement,” she said, offering one example. “And also that the Jewish community itself is a place where there is a paucity of women leaders.”Burdett said the current debate over DEI lacks the kind of nuance that Jewish groups brought to debates over a previous era’s civil rights issues, including quotas and affirmative action. “There’s no question that some of the ideological underpinnings of DEI in some institutions are flawed, and sort people in categories that Jews don’t neatly fit into. I think everyone in the Jewish community wants the American public square to be a safer place for Jews, and there are just different ways of getting at that,” she said. “But we’re in a very polarized debate between two groups of people, one of whom sees diversity as a threat, and the other that sees it as the strength of a pluralistic society.” At the University of Minnesota, Natan Paradise shares many of the critics’ views of DEI’s shortcomings. But he is wary of joining in attacks that he sees either as politically motivated or hostile to the very idea of racial or gender inclusion. “Those who want to dismantle DEI are acting in bad faith,” he said. “DEI does a lot of good. It does make a difference for students on campus. It could make more of a difference. It could make a better, more nuanced difference. But I think DEI plays a critical role on campuses.” He prefers forming relationships with administrators at the university’s Office for Equity and Diversity, and said there have been successes, including a freshman orientation course that now includes discussion of antisemitism, and a change in how the campus Office for Equity and Diversity classifies antisemitism on its website.“We are just not on their radar and we ought to be, and I have been working very hard at my institution to change that, and we’ve made quite a bit of progress,” he said about Jews on campus. “We have to be present in all the social justice initiatives, in order for us to be present when we need it. And when I mean relationships, that means being in the spaces with the people who are doing the work, so that they see you as an ally, and you can count on them as an ally. In too many instances, we just haven’t done it.”
That approach is a mistake in the eyes of DEI’s most vociferous Jewish critics — many of whom view the campus convulsions after Oct. 7 as proof that they are right. Some of them pointed to the pivotal congressional hearing in December featuring three university presidents, who stumbled when asked whether calls for “the genocide of Jews” would violate their campuses’ speech codes. Two of the presidents, Liz McGill of the University of Pennsylvania and Claudine Gay of Harvard, later stepped down. DEI is “the root cause of antisemitism at Harvard,” Bill Ackman, a Jewish hedge fund manager and Harvard donor who led the charge against Gay, said in a lengthy tweet cheering her ouster.“For Jews, there are obvious and glaring dangers in a worldview that measures fairness by equality of outcome rather than opportunity,” Bari Weiss wrote in a Tablet essay about how Jews should respond to Oct. 7. Weiss, who runs the news startup The Free Press, argued that under DEI, “equity” has come to mean that people are judged deserving according to their group identities. “If underrepresentation is the inevitable outcome of systemic bias, then overrepresentation — and Jews are 2% of the American population — suggests not talent or hard work, but unearned privilege.”Abraham Foxman, the former national director of the Anti-Defamation League, told Jewish Insider that DEI “cannot be fixed,” saying that “efforts by communal Jewish organizations to include the Jewish community or soften its impact on antisemitism have failed.” David Harris, the former CEO of the American Jewish Committee, also told Jewish Insider that he doesn’t believe that “outside efforts, however well-intentioned, that nibble around the edges or simply seek to add Jews to the DEI agenda, address the heart of the problem. DEI today poses a major challenge to liberal understanding of American societal aims.”Some prominent American Jews call for DEI to be abolished altogetherOther prominent Jews calling for the demise of DEI are Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer and pro-Israel activist; Mark Charendoff, president of the Maimonides Fund, and David L. Bernstein, a Jewish communal professional whose opposition to “wokism” led him to form the Jew­ish Insti­tute for Lib­er­al Val­ues.“It’s not that we don’t want to make campuses comfortable places for people of color and gays and lesbians. God forbid,” Bernstein said in an interview. “Unfortunately DEI quickly evolved into an ideological framework that tells people in no uncertain terms who are the oppressed and who are the oppressors. It tends to divide people into racial affinity groups, which can be very divisive. It often imposes political litmus tests with DEI statements that applicants must submit for getting a job or getting promoted.”Bernstein agrees with Weiss that DEI turns the relative academic and financial success of Jews against them by suggesting they are “riding on the backs of deprived minority groups.” Bernstein and others also cite a 2021 report from the Heritage Foundation on the “public communications” of DEI professionals, saying they showed a disproportionate tendency to “attack Israel.” “Against this backdrop, it’s not hard to see why so many DEI programs are loath to acknowledge the antisemitic nature of anti-Zionist behavior that so often leads to the harassment of Jewish students,” Tammi Rossman-Benjamin, co-founder and director of the pro-Israel AMCHA Initiative, wrote in a piece for Sapir, a journal of the Maimonides Fund.At many campuses, DEI offices have staff who are trained in investigating and resolving complaints about discrimination, and are the main address for such complaints.

I think everyone in the Jewish community wants the American public square to be a safer place for Jews, and there are just different ways of getting at that,” she said. “But we’re in a very polarized debate between two groups of people, one of whom sees diversity as a threat, and the other that sees it as the strength of a pluralistic society.” At the University of Minnesota, Natan Paradise shares many of the critics’ views of DEI’s shortcomings. But he is wary of joining in attacks that he sees either as politically motivated or hostile to the very idea of racial or gender inclusion. “Those who want to dismantle DEI are acting in bad faith,” he said. “DEI does a lot of good. It does make a difference for students on campus. It could make more of a difference. It could make a better, more nuanced difference. But I think DEI plays a critical role on campuses.” He prefers forming relationships with administrators at the university’s Office for Equity and Diversity, and said there have been successes, including a freshman orientation course that now includes discussion of antisemitism, and a change in how the campus Office for Equity and Diversity classifies antisemitism on its website.“We are just not on their radar and we ought to be, and I have been working very hard at my institution to change that, and we’ve made quite a bit of progress,” he said about Jews on campus. “We have to be present in all the social justice initiatives, in order for us to be present when we need it. And when I mean relationships, that means being in the spaces with the people who are doing the work, so that they see you as an ally, and you can count on them as an ally. In too many instances, we just haven’t done it.”
Other prominent Jews calling for the demise of DEI are Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer and pro-Israel activist; Mark Charendoff, president of the Maimonides Fund, and David L. Bernstein, a Jewish communal professional whose opposition to “wokism” led him to form the Jew­ish Insti­tute for Lib­er­al Val­ues.“It’s not that we don’t want to make campuses comfortable places for people of color and gays and lesbians. God forbid,” Bernstein said in an interview. “Unfortunately DEI quickly evolved into an ideological framework that tells people in no uncertain terms who are the oppressed and who are the oppressors. It tends to divide people into racial affinity groups, which can be very divisive. It often imposes political litmus tests with DEI statements that applicants must submit for getting a job or getting promoted.”Bernstein agrees with Weiss that DEI turns the relative academic and financial success of Jews against them by suggesting they are “riding on the backs of deprived minority groups.” Bernstein and others also cite a 2021 report from the Heritage Foundation on the “public communications” of DEI professionals, saying they showed a disproportionate tendency to “attack Israel.” “Against this backdrop, it’s not hard to see why so many DEI programs are loath to acknowledge the antisemitic nature of anti-Zionist behavior that so often leads to the harassment of Jewish students,” Tammi Rossman-Benjamin, co-founder and director of the pro-Israel AMCHA Initiative, wrote in a piece for Sapir, a journal of the Maimonides Fund.At many campuses, DEI offices have staff who are trained in investigating and resolving complaints about discrimination, and are the main address for such complaints. However, in a college survey the ADL conducted before Oct. 7, more than half of all students surveyed said they had completed DEI training, but only 18% of those said those trainings included topics specific to anti-Jewish prejudice. “That is a terrible and unacceptable situation,” said the ADL’s Neufeld. “It is dangerous, both in the sense that it excludes a historically persecuted people who are incredibly vulnerable and actually sends the signal that the exclusion is acceptable.”Jewish critics of DEI frequently say this exclusion is the result of an “oppressor/oppressed” framework that considers Jews as white and privileged, but tend to provide little evidence. Instead, campus insiders say, there are other structural reasons for the exclusion of Jews and antisemitism from DEI offices.“Judaism is seen as a religion, and DEI offices don’t touch religion in the sort of structural ecosystem of how the university works,” explained Samira Mehta, the director of Jewish Studies and an associate professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, during a session at the AJS conference. “The university chaplains’ office is in charge of religion and religious diversity. DEI is in charge of racial and gender diversity. DEI is also not so welcome to Islamophobia, except to the degree that they keep their eye on what’s happening to brown students.“And the people who come up through these offices do not have training in religious diversity and don’t know how to do it,” she continued. “Also the people who come up in those offices sometimes are coming up from queer and gender diversity standpoints.” Mehta referred to these as “all of those structural ways that antisemitism, while real, is not something they handle.”Lauren Strauss, a professor of modern Jewish history at American University, said that was the experience of Jewish students on her campus who faced antisemitism in their dorms and classes after Oct. 7. They were told that “they should go see a chaplain because this is a religious matter, not racial, ethnic or social prejudice, and outside the DEI office’s mandate,” she said at the AJS panel on DEI. (This week, an activist law firm filed suit against A.U. over its handling of incidents affecting Jewish students on campus.)Jewish faculty at A.U. have also pushed, with little success, for discussion of antisemitism, alongside sexism, homophobia and transphobia, in a core curriculum course for first-year students and transfers known as the American University Experience. Even after agreeing to one session on the Holocaust, the university’s Center for Diversity and Inclusion said it was optional. “The one bright spot in all this,” Strauss said, is the support she’s gotten from “a small group of Jewish studies and general studies scholars” and the campus Hillel director. Yet Strauss and the other scholars did not say they favored abolishing the programs.

They were told that “they should go see a chaplain because this is a religious matter, not racial, ethnic or social prejudice, and outside the DEI office’s mandate,” she said at the AJS panel on DEI. (This week, an activist law firm filed suit against A.U. over its handling of incidents affecting Jewish students on campus.)Jewish faculty at A.U. have also pushed, with little success, for discussion of antisemitism, alongside sexism, homophobia and transphobia, in a core curriculum course for first-year students and transfers known as the American University Experience. Even after agreeing to one session on the Holocaust, the university’s Center for Diversity and Inclusion said it was optional. “The one bright spot in all this,” Strauss said, is the support she’s gotten from “a small group of Jewish studies and general studies scholars” and the campus Hillel director. Yet Strauss and the other scholars did not say they favored abolishing the programs. While it may be satisfying to condemn the ideology underpinning DEI, they said, campuses need departments whose task it is to increase diversity and make the marginalized feel welcome. Stacy Burdett, a consultant who helps corporations, colleges and nonprofits enhance DEI programming to address Jewish concerns, said calls to dismantle DEI offices also ignore the ways they in fact advance diversity.“It’s hard for me to imagine a discussion of DEI that isn’t cognizant of the role that gender equity plays in the DEI movement,” she said, offering one example. “And also that the Jewish community itself is a place where there is a paucity of women leaders.”Burdett said the current debate over DEI lacks the kind of nuance that Jewish groups brought to debates over a previous era’s civil rights issues, including quotas and affirmative action. “There’s no question that some of the ideological underpinnings of DEI in some institutions are flawed, and sort people in categories that Jews don’t neatly fit into. I think everyone in the Jewish community wants the American public square to be a safer place for Jews, and there are just different ways of getting at that,” she said. “But we’re in a very polarized debate between two groups of people, one of whom sees diversity as a threat, and the other that sees it as the strength of a pluralistic society.” At the University of Minnesota, Natan Paradise shares many of the critics’ views of DEI’s shortcomings. But he is wary of joining in attacks that he sees either as politically motivated or hostile to the very idea of racial or gender inclusion. “Those who want to dismantle DEI are acting in bad faith,” he said. “DEI does a lot of good. It does make a difference for students on campus. It could make more of a difference. It could make a better, more nuanced difference. But I think DEI plays a critical role on campuses.” He prefers forming relationships with administrators at the university’s Office for Equity and Diversity, and said there have been successes, including a freshman orientation course that now includes discussion of antisemitism, and a change in how the campus Office for Equity and Diversity classifies antisemitism on its website.“We are just not on their radar and we ought to be, and I have been working very hard at my institution to change that, and we’ve made quite a bit of progress,” he said about Jews on campus. “We have to be present in all the social justice initiatives, in order for us to be present when we need it. And when I mean relationships, that means being in the spaces with the people who are doing the work, so that they see you as an ally, and you can count on them as an ally. In too many instances, we just haven’t done it.”
“That is a terrible and unacceptable situation,” said the ADL’s Neufeld. “It is dangerous, both in the sense that it excludes a historically persecuted people who are incredibly vulnerable and actually sends the signal that the exclusion is acceptable.”Jewish critics of DEI frequently say this exclusion is the result of an “oppressor/oppressed” framework that considers Jews as white and privileged, but tend to provide little evidence. Instead, campus insiders say, there are other structural reasons for the exclusion of Jews and antisemitism from DEI offices.“Judaism is seen as a religion, and DEI offices don’t touch religion in the sort of structural ecosystem of how the university works,” explained Samira Mehta, the director of Jewish Studies and an associate professor of Women and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, during a session at the AJS conference. “The university chaplains’ office is in charge of religion and religious diversity. DEI is in charge of racial and gender diversity.

But he is wary of joining in attacks that he sees either as politically motivated or hostile to the very idea of racial or gender inclusion. “Those who want to dismantle DEI are acting in bad faith,” he said. “DEI does a lot of good. It does make a difference for students on campus. It could make more of a difference. It could make a better, more nuanced difference. But I think DEI plays a critical role on campuses.” He prefers forming relationships with administrators at the university’s Office for Equity and Diversity, and said there have been successes, including a freshman orientation course that now includes discussion of antisemitism, and a change in how the campus Office for Equity and Diversity classifies antisemitism on its website.“We are just not on their radar and we ought to be, and I have been working very hard at my institution to change that, and we’ve made quite a bit of progress,” he said about Jews on campus. “We have to be present in all the social justice initiatives, in order for us to be present when we need it. And when I mean relationships, that means being in the spaces with the people who are doing the work, so that they see you as an ally, and you can count on them as an ally. In too many instances, we just haven’t done it.”

HEWN2INSGT_7YY0QC7EZWA50X9,Netanyahu: We reject ‘outright’ Hamas demands for hostage deal,TOVAH LAZAROFF,"JANUARY 21, 2024 18:51",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-783098,"Israel has “utterly” rejected Hamas’s demand that the IDF end its military campaign in Gaza in exchange for the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday night.“To date we have returned home 110 of the hostages,” Netanyahu said, emphasizing that Israel is “committed to returning all of them.“This is one of the goals of the war and the military pressure is a necessary condition to achieving it,” Netanyahu stated.  “I utterly reject the Hamas monsters’ capitulation terms,” Netanyahu said. He explained that the terrorist group has demanded an end to the war, a complete IDF withdrawal from Gaza, the retention of its control of Gaza, and the release of the participants in the October 7 attack against Israel.In that attack over 1,200 people were massacred and another 250 were taken hostage. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant flies above the skies of Gaza with the Israeli Air Force, January 21, 2024 (credit: DEFENSE MINISTRY)'Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel'“Were we to agree to this – our soldiers would have fallen in vain,” Netanyahu declared. “Were we to agree to this – we would not be able to ensure the security of our citizens.“We would be unable to safely restore the evacuees to their homes and the next October 7 would be only a question of time. Advertisement“I am not prepared to accept such a mortal blow to the security of Israel; therefore, we will not agree to this,” Netanyahu said.He spoke following the publication of a Wall Street Journal report of a renewed US drive together with mediating countries Egypt and Qatar to secure a hostage deal for the remaining 132 people held in Gaza, including a one-year-old baby.According to The Wall Street Journal, a three-phase deal was on the table covering 90 days, in which Israeli civilians would be freed in exchange for the release of Palestinian terrorists jailed by Israel.Israel would also have to withdraw the IDF from Gaza’s towns and cities, restore freedom of movement in the enclave, end drone surveillance, and double the amount of goods entering the Strip.The second would involve the release of additional Palestinian prisoners in exchange for female IDF soldiers, plus the bodies of dead hostages.During the third phase, Hamas would free male soldiers plus Israeli men of combat age, as Israel pulls some of its forces out of Gaza.There would also be talks for a permanent cease-fire, an Israel-Saudi normalization deal, and a two-state resolution to the conflict.Netanyahu on Sunday repeated his opposition, clearly stated already on Thursday, for the creation of a Palestinian state. On Sunday, Netanyahu stressed that he had explained this to US President Joe Biden when they spoke on Friday morning.“I emphasized to President Biden our determination to achieve all the goals of the war, and to ensure that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel,” he said.“That is why I insist that, after we achieve complete victory, after we eliminate Hamas,” there will not be groups in Gaza that finance, educate, or dispatch terrorists.Eisenkot: the likelihood of a military hostage rescue is extremely low“Gaza must be demilitarized, under Israel’s full security control,” he declared, “I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of the Jordan River.”He stressed that he has defended this position in the face of great international and domestic pressure.“My insistence is what has prevented – over the years – the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have constituted an existential danger to Israel,” Netanyahu said. “As long as I am prime minister, I will continue to strongly insist on this.”Netanyahu challenged Israeli politicians, that “if someone has a different position, they should show leadership and candidly state their position to the citizens of Israel.”Israel under his leadership, Netanyahu said, will continue “the war on all fronts and in all sectors. We are not giving immunity to any terrorist: not in Gaza, not in Lebanon, not in Syria, and not anywhere. Whoever tries to harm us, we will harm him.”Netanyahu spoke amid growing speculation that the war’s goals may not be attainable, particularly given reports that Hamas’s fighting forces and store of arms have not suffered a fatal blow, and as such the war could continue for many months.The prime minister is under pressure both from his international allies and portions of the Israeli public, including the relatives of the hostages, to make a deal on the presumption that this is the only way to ensure that the captives return alive.Minister Gadi Eisenkot (National Unity), who is a former IDF chief of staff and lost his son in the Hamas war, said that the hostages can only be returned through a deal.In an interview with the Channel 12 program “Uvda” over the weekend, he was asked whether the hostages could be released in a rescue mission similar to the 1976 IDF operation that freed around 100 hostages in Entebbe, Uganda.“The hostages are scattered in such a way – even underground – that the likelihood [of such an operation] is extremely low,” Eisenkot said.“We are still making efforts and looking for every opportunity, but the likelihood is low and to say that this is how it will happen is to sow an illusion.”Reuters contributed to this report.

On Sunday, Netanyahu stressed that he had explained this to US President Joe Biden when they spoke on Friday morning.“I emphasized to President Biden our determination to achieve all the goals of the war, and to ensure that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israel,” he said.“That is why I insist that, after we achieve complete victory, after we eliminate Hamas,” there will not be groups in Gaza that finance, educate, or dispatch terrorists.Eisenkot: the likelihood of a military hostage rescue is extremely low“Gaza must be demilitarized, under Israel’s full security control,” he declared, “I will not compromise on full Israeli security control over all the territory west of the Jordan River.”He stressed that he has defended this position in the face of great international and domestic pressure.“My insistence is what has prevented – over the years – the establishment of a Palestinian state that would have constituted an existential danger to Israel,” Netanyahu said. “As long as I am prime minister, I will continue to strongly insist on this.”Netanyahu challenged Israeli politicians, that “if someone has a different position, they should show leadership and candidly state their position to the citizens of Israel.”Israel under his leadership, Netanyahu said, will continue “the war on all fronts and in all sectors. We are not giving immunity to any terrorist: not in Gaza, not in Lebanon, not in Syria, and not anywhere. Whoever tries to harm us, we will harm him.”Netanyahu spoke amid growing speculation that the war’s goals may not be attainable, particularly given reports that Hamas’s fighting forces and store of arms have not suffered a fatal blow, and as such the war could continue for many months.The prime minister is under pressure both from his international allies and portions of the Israeli public, including the relatives of the hostages, to make a deal on the presumption that this is the only way to ensure that the captives return alive.Minister Gadi Eisenkot (National Unity), who is a former IDF chief of staff and lost his son in the Hamas war, said that the hostages can only be returned through a deal.In an interview with the Channel 12 program “Uvda” over the weekend, he was asked whether the hostages could be released in a rescue mission similar to the 1976 IDF operation that freed around 100 hostages in Entebbe, Uganda.“The hostages are scattered in such a way – even underground – that the likelihood [of such an operation] is extremely low,” Eisenkot said.“We are still making efforts and looking for every opportunity, but the likelihood is low and to say that this is how it will happen is to sow an illusion.”Reuters contributed to this report.

Whoever tries to harm us, we will harm him.”Netanyahu spoke amid growing speculation that the war’s goals may not be attainable, particularly given reports that Hamas’s fighting forces and store of arms have not suffered a fatal blow, and as such the war could continue for many months.The prime minister is under pressure both from his international allies and portions of the Israeli public, including the relatives of the hostages, to make a deal on the presumption that this is the only way to ensure that the captives return alive.Minister Gadi Eisenkot (National Unity), who is a former IDF chief of staff and lost his son in the Hamas war, said that the hostages can only be returned through a deal.In an interview with the Channel 12 program “Uvda” over the weekend, he was asked whether the hostages could be released in a rescue mission similar to the 1976 IDF operation that freed around 100 hostages in Entebbe, Uganda.“The hostages are scattered in such a way – even underground – that the likelihood [of such an operation] is extremely low,” Eisenkot said.“We are still making efforts and looking for every opportunity, but the likelihood is low and to say that this is how it will happen is to sow an illusion.”Reuters contributed to this report.

HNHODHKT61_YQ4IJAB30CEXQAC,Is there a rift in Israel’s war cabinet?,AYELET FRISH,"JANUARY 20, 2024 23:14",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-783015,"It has been 105 days since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and over three months since Israel launched its comprehensive military operation in the Gaza Strip. As the operation transitioned into a new phase- a more precise, tactical strategy with less Israeli forces on the ground in Gaza- it is important to understand what has been accomplished thus far, and what lies ahead for decision makers in Israel. Israel is set on accomplishing its war objectives of dismantling Hamas and returning all Israeli captives, and its leadership has reinstated that it will not back down before these objectives have been accomplished.Operational status updates:The IDF ground operation began in the densely populated northern part of the Gaza Strip, a terror-heavy territory housing two Hamas brigades and 12 battalions, including hundreds of terrorists who committed the massacre of Israelis on October 7. Israel has made immense efforts to evacuate Gazan civilians from the battle zones to ensure that they will not be used as human shields by Hamas terrorists. In air raids prior to the ground entrance, the Israeli Air Force targeted terror infrastructure including hundreds of underground facilities, outlook posts and rigged buildings, reducing Hamas’ capabilities before the ground troops entered the Strip. With accurate intelligence and in accordance to international law, in the first days of combat, Israel significantly reduced Hamas’ ability to retaliate.  At the onset of the ground offensive, IDF troops successfully encircled the city of Jabalya in northern Gaza, later taking control of Gaza City and the rest of the northern region. A combined force consisting of over 200 tanks, combat brigades, combat engineering units and special forces entered the Strip, closely guided by IDF intelligence tracking developments in real time, providing intel enabling troops to effectively attack and safely maneuver inside the battle zone. Ground troops work in sync with Israel’s Air Force and military intelligence, with drones, UAVs and fighter aircrafts providing intel from above the ground and striking down targets, while using live intel from ground troops for its precision strikes. The close cooperation between the military forces is unprecedented and has been consistent throughout the entire operation. Israel has proven that when its ground troops, air force, navy and intelligence apparatus work together in synchronicity, it is able to effectively and tactically target posts, eliminate terror cells, and deter the enemy. But more time is needed. On Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant noted that Israel has concluded the intensive phase of its offensive in northern Gaza, and that the concentrated fighting in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, will also end soon. In the ‘third phase’ of the war, which is expected to take up to six months, specialized Israeli units will carry out tactical operations. This third phase will consist of slow but steady progress as IDF forces advance house by house, street by street, and tunnel shaft by tunnel shaft, gradually eliminating Hamas. AdvertisementStrategic Advisor, Ayelet Frish (Credit: SIVAN FARAG)As Israeli troops continue fighting close-range battles across the Strip in urban areas- in buildings, schools and hospitals, which house Hamas’ underground terror tunnel network, with tunnel shafts serving as the entry points into the subterranean city of terror- tunnels provide Hamas operatives protection, enabling them to move quicky and safely underground and surprise Israeli forces. Let us remember that the tunnels serve as the home of Hamas’ command-and-control centers and weapon depots and production facilities. The New York Times reported this week that the Hamas tunnels in Gaza, which were estimated to have been 250 miles in total, are now believed to be between 350 and 450 miles, while the Gaza Strip itself is only 25 miles at its longest point. The report also claims that officials estimate that there are approximately 5,700 tunnel shafts hidden across Gaza. Some tunnels are wide enough to drive cars inside them, and a seven-story deep tunnel was uncovered by the IDF, showcasing the scope and the complexity of the tunnel system. The IDF has destroyed hundreds of tunnels and entry shafts using classified military technology developed over the years and  since the start of the war.Throughout the operation, troops have confiscated Hamas intelligence including computers, hard drives, maps and communication devices, amounting in over 70,000 million files, according to the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit. In addition, many Hamas militants have surrendered and have also provided critical information during interrogations.In recent days, Israel’s Prime Minister, Defense Minister and IDF Chief of Staff have all reaffirmed to the Israeli public, and to the world, that the war will take time, and there are many months of fighting ahead.The successes of the IDF in the war to date have enabled the army to withdraw large numbers of reserve forces. The return of reservists to the workforce, many of whom work in high-tech, will help the Israeli economy recover somewhat from the costs of the war, which are estimated at $220 million per day. And, in the event that the situation in the north deteriorates further, these reservists can quickly be deployed in a war against Hezbollah if needed. The psychological warfare that Hamas has been conducting against the Israeli public, with the release of videos of hostages in body bags and announcements of the death of captives, has taken its toll. Hamas is trying to deliver a clear message through these videos- if Israel continues fighting, more captives will die, mounting pressure on the Israeli government to agree to a ceasefire deal for their return.This week, a rift appears to have developed in Israel’s war cabinet about the country’s conduct in Gaza, dividing the war cabinet members into two camps - Benny Gantz, head of the National Unity party, together with Gadi Eisenkot, an MK from National Unity, both of whom formerly served as IDF Chief of Staff - against Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi.On Sunday, during a war cabinet meeting, Eisenkot was reported to have said, “We need to stop lying to ourselves. We need to show courage and lead a major agreement that will bring the abductees home. There is no need to continue to march blindly while the abductees are there. This is a critical time to make brave decisions. Otherwise, we have nothing to look for here.”   From the reports, it appears that Gantz and Eisenkot are pushing for a policy that would end fighting in return for the release of Israeli hostages, which they seem to believe is the only effective way to get them out. In Eisenkot’s view, the IDF is strong enough to take a break from the fighting now to ensure the return of the captives, and will be able to confront Hamas again in the future, effectively ending the current war.On the opposing side, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi are backing the position that the continuation of the military operation, putting further pressure on Hamas, is the only way to ensure the eventual release of the captives. A lengthy ceasefire, in their opinion, will weaken Israel strategically. In a war of terror, they believe, taking a ‘shortcut’ – giving in to the demands of terrorists – will lead to future hostage-taking and another massacre of Israelis.From their vantage point, only the continued application of military pressure will lead to the freeing of captives. This is what led to the hostage release deals thus far, they claim.Netanyahu, Gallant, and Halevi believe that while sanctifying and preserving life is an essential part of the Israeli DNA, pausing or ending the war in exchange for the return of the hostages would be a major mistake. There are several goals to the war, and they do not always converge. One aim is bringing back the hostages, but another is dismantling the military capabilities of Hamas to ensure that they cannot pose a threat to Israel. If Hamas is allowed to retain its military capabilities- rearm and restructure during a ceasefire- residents of the Gaza Envelope communities will never be able to return to their towns and kibbutzim.Moreover, Iran and its proxies – Hamas, Hezbollah, the Huthis, Islamic Jihad, ISIS, and terror cells in Iraq and Syria – are waiting to see how Israel reacts. According to this point of view, if Israel were to pause or end the fighting in order to free hostages while leaving Hamas’ weaponry and leadership intact, Israel’s enemies would take notice. They will see that Israel is vulnerable to hostage-taking and it will only be a matter of time before the next Iran-sponsored attack or kidnapping occurs. Continuing the fighting enables Israel to retain its power of deterrence. After the events of October 7, Israel must have zero tolerance for terror.Bringing back the captives is closely tied to continuing the fight against Hamas. Only this will deter our enemies and will provide a clear message to Iran and its proxies that Israel will not give in to terror. It will force Yahya Sinwar to abandon his dream that, somehow, the IDF will give up on Gaza, enabling Hamas to retain its power for him and his successors. According to this school of thought, military pressure is the most effective way to the ensure the release of Israeli captives and deter Israel’s enemies from pursuing further attacks.    It is important to mention that Israel’s leaders are not indifferent or insensitive to the hostages and their families. They have spent countless hours strategizing ways to get them out of Gaza, both in internal discussions and in international negotiations. Unfortunately, this war has tested Israeli leadership, presenting them with tough and critical decisions that impact the lives and survival of the captives, soldiers, evacuated Israeli civilians and the Israeli society as a whole. The State of Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East, is being tested as a whole- its leadership, army and civilians. Each decision is due to change the future of the Jewish State, and the stakes are high. Let us hope that the third stage of the war will lead to stability in Israel, Gaza and the entire region.

Hamas is trying to deliver a clear message through these videos- if Israel continues fighting, more captives will die, mounting pressure on the Israeli government to agree to a ceasefire deal for their return.This week, a rift appears to have developed in Israel’s war cabinet about the country’s conduct in Gaza, dividing the war cabinet members into two camps - Benny Gantz, head of the National Unity party, together with Gadi Eisenkot, an MK from National Unity, both of whom formerly served as IDF Chief of Staff - against Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi.On Sunday, during a war cabinet meeting, Eisenkot was reported to have said, “We need to stop lying to ourselves. We need to show courage and lead a major agreement that will bring the abductees home. There is no need to continue to march blindly while the abductees are there. This is a critical time to make brave decisions. Otherwise, we have nothing to look for here.”   From the reports, it appears that Gantz and Eisenkot are pushing for a policy that would end fighting in return for the release of Israeli hostages, which they seem to believe is the only effective way to get them out. In Eisenkot’s view, the IDF is strong enough to take a break from the fighting now to ensure the return of the captives, and will be able to confront Hamas again in the future, effectively ending the current war.On the opposing side, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi are backing the position that the continuation of the military operation, putting further pressure on Hamas, is the only way to ensure the eventual release of the captives. A lengthy ceasefire, in their opinion, will weaken Israel strategically. In a war of terror, they believe, taking a ‘shortcut’ – giving in to the demands of terrorists – will lead to future hostage-taking and another massacre of Israelis.From their vantage point, only the continued application of military pressure will lead to the freeing of captives. This is what led to the hostage release deals thus far, they claim.Netanyahu, Gallant, and Halevi believe that while sanctifying and preserving life is an essential part of the Israeli DNA, pausing or ending the war in exchange for the return of the hostages would be a major mistake. There are several goals to the war, and they do not always converge. One aim is bringing back the hostages, but another is dismantling the military capabilities of Hamas to ensure that they cannot pose a threat to Israel. If Hamas is allowed to retain its military capabilities- rearm and restructure during a ceasefire- residents of the Gaza Envelope communities will never be able to return to their towns and kibbutzim.Moreover, Iran and its proxies – Hamas, Hezbollah, the Huthis, Islamic Jihad, ISIS, and terror cells in Iraq and Syria – are waiting to see how Israel reacts. According to this point of view, if Israel were to pause or end the fighting in order to free hostages while leaving Hamas’ weaponry and leadership intact, Israel’s enemies would take notice. They will see that Israel is vulnerable to hostage-taking and it will only be a matter of time before the next Iran-sponsored attack or kidnapping occurs. Continuing the fighting enables Israel to retain its power of deterrence. After the events of October 7, Israel must have zero tolerance for terror.Bringing back the captives is closely tied to continuing the fight against Hamas. Only this will deter our enemies and will provide a clear message to Iran and its proxies that Israel will not give in to terror. It will force Yahya Sinwar to abandon his dream that, somehow, the IDF will give up on Gaza, enabling Hamas to retain its power for him and his successors. According to this school of thought, military pressure is the most effective way to the ensure the release of Israeli captives and deter Israel’s enemies from pursuing further attacks.    It is important to mention that Israel’s leaders are not indifferent or insensitive to the hostages and their families. They have spent countless hours strategizing ways to get them out of Gaza, both in internal discussions and in international negotiations. Unfortunately, this war has tested Israeli leadership, presenting them with tough and critical decisions that impact the lives and survival of the captives, soldiers, evacuated Israeli civilians and the Israeli society as a whole. The State of Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East, is being tested as a whole- its leadership, army and civilians. Each decision is due to change the future of the Jewish State, and the stakes are high. Let us hope that the third stage of the war will lead to stability in Israel, Gaza and the entire region.
In air raids prior to the ground entrance, the Israeli Air Force targeted terror infrastructure including hundreds of underground facilities, outlook posts and rigged buildings, reducing Hamas’ capabilities before the ground troops entered the Strip. With accurate intelligence and in accordance to international law, in the first days of combat, Israel significantly reduced Hamas’ ability to retaliate.  At the onset of the ground offensive, IDF troops successfully encircled the city of Jabalya in northern Gaza, later taking control of Gaza City and the rest of the northern region. A combined force consisting of over 200 tanks, combat brigades, combat engineering units and special forces entered the Strip, closely guided by IDF intelligence tracking developments in real time, providing intel enabling troops to effectively attack and safely maneuver inside the battle zone. Ground troops work in sync with Israel’s Air Force and military intelligence, with drones, UAVs and fighter aircrafts providing intel from above the ground and striking down targets, while using live intel from ground troops for its precision strikes. The close cooperation between the military forces is unprecedented and has been consistent throughout the entire operation. Israel has proven that when its ground troops, air force, navy and intelligence apparatus work together in synchronicity, it is able to effectively and tactically target posts, eliminate terror cells, and deter the enemy. But more time is needed. On Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant noted that Israel has concluded the intensive phase of its offensive in northern Gaza, and that the concentrated fighting in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, will also end soon. In the ‘third phase’ of the war, which is expected to take up to six months, specialized Israeli units will carry out tactical operations. This third phase will consist of slow but steady progress as IDF forces advance house by house, street by street, and tunnel shaft by tunnel shaft, gradually eliminating Hamas. AdvertisementStrategic Advisor, Ayelet Frish (Credit: SIVAN FARAG)As Israeli troops continue fighting close-range battles across the Strip in urban areas- in buildings, schools and hospitals, which house Hamas’ underground terror tunnel network, with tunnel shafts serving as the entry points into the subterranean city of terror- tunnels provide Hamas operatives protection, enabling them to move quicky and safely underground and surprise Israeli forces. Let us remember that the tunnels serve as the home of Hamas’ command-and-control centers and weapon depots and production facilities. The New York Times reported this week that the Hamas tunnels in Gaza, which were estimated to have been 250 miles in total, are now believed to be between 350 and 450 miles, while the Gaza Strip itself is only 25 miles at its longest point. The report also claims that officials estimate that there are approximately 5,700 tunnel shafts hidden across Gaza. Some tunnels are wide enough to drive cars inside them, and a seven-story deep tunnel was uncovered by the IDF, showcasing the scope and the complexity of the tunnel system. The IDF has destroyed hundreds of tunnels and entry shafts using classified military technology developed over the years and  since the start of the war.Throughout the operation, troops have confiscated Hamas intelligence including computers, hard drives, maps and communication devices, amounting in over 70,000 million files, according to the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit. In addition, many Hamas militants have surrendered and have also provided critical information during interrogations.In recent days, Israel’s Prime Minister, Defense Minister and IDF Chief of Staff have all reaffirmed to the Israeli public, and to the world, that the war will take time, and there are many months of fighting ahead.The successes of the IDF in the war to date have enabled the army to withdraw large numbers of reserve forces.

According to this school of thought, military pressure is the most effective way to the ensure the release of Israeli captives and deter Israel’s enemies from pursuing further attacks.    It is important to mention that Israel’s leaders are not indifferent or insensitive to the hostages and their families. They have spent countless hours strategizing ways to get them out of Gaza, both in internal discussions and in international negotiations. Unfortunately, this war has tested Israeli leadership, presenting them with tough and critical decisions that impact the lives and survival of the captives, soldiers, evacuated Israeli civilians and the Israeli society as a whole. The State of Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East, is being tested as a whole- its leadership, army and civilians. Each decision is due to change the future of the Jewish State, and the stakes are high. Let us hope that the third stage of the war will lead to stability in Israel, Gaza and the entire region.
On Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant noted that Israel has concluded the intensive phase of its offensive in northern Gaza, and that the concentrated fighting in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, will also end soon. In the ‘third phase’ of the war, which is expected to take up to six months, specialized Israeli units will carry out tactical operations. This third phase will consist of slow but steady progress as IDF forces advance house by house, street by street, and tunnel shaft by tunnel shaft, gradually eliminating Hamas. AdvertisementStrategic Advisor, Ayelet Frish (Credit: SIVAN FARAG)As Israeli troops continue fighting close-range battles across the Strip in urban areas- in buildings, schools and hospitals, which house Hamas’ underground terror tunnel network, with tunnel shafts serving as the entry points into the subterranean city of terror- tunnels provide Hamas operatives protection, enabling them to move quicky and safely underground and surprise Israeli forces. Let us remember that the tunnels serve as the home of Hamas’ command-and-control centers and weapon depots and production facilities. The New York Times reported this week that the Hamas tunnels in Gaza, which were estimated to have been 250 miles in total, are now believed to be between 350 and 450 miles, while the Gaza Strip itself is only 25 miles at its longest point. The report also claims that officials estimate that there are approximately 5,700 tunnel shafts hidden across Gaza. Some tunnels are wide enough to drive cars inside them, and a seven-story deep tunnel was uncovered by the IDF, showcasing the scope and the complexity of the tunnel system. The IDF has destroyed hundreds of tunnels and entry shafts using classified military technology developed over the years and  since the start of the war.Throughout the operation, troops have confiscated Hamas intelligence including computers, hard drives, maps and communication devices, amounting in over 70,000 million files, according to the IDF Spokesperson’s Unit. In addition, many Hamas militants have surrendered and have also provided critical information during interrogations.In recent days, Israel’s Prime Minister, Defense Minister and IDF Chief of Staff have all reaffirmed to the Israeli public, and to the world, that the war will take time, and there are many months of fighting ahead.The successes of the IDF in the war to date have enabled the army to withdraw large numbers of reserve forces. The return of reservists to the workforce, many of whom work in high-tech, will help the Israeli economy recover somewhat from the costs of the war, which are estimated at $220 million per day. And, in the event that the situation in the north deteriorates further, these reservists can quickly be deployed in a war against Hezbollah if needed. The psychological warfare that Hamas has been conducting against the Israeli public, with the release of videos of hostages in body bags and announcements of the death of captives, has taken its toll. Hamas is trying to deliver a clear message through these videos- if Israel continues fighting, more captives will die, mounting pressure on the Israeli government to agree to a ceasefire deal for their return.This week, a rift appears to have developed in Israel’s war cabinet about the country’s conduct in Gaza, dividing the war cabinet members into two camps - Benny Gantz, head of the National Unity party, together with Gadi Eisenkot, an MK from National Unity, both of whom formerly served as IDF Chief of Staff - against Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi.On Sunday, during a war cabinet meeting, Eisenkot was reported to have said, “We need to stop lying to ourselves. We need to show courage and lead a major agreement that will bring the abductees home. There is no need to continue to march blindly while the abductees are there. This is a critical time to make brave decisions. Otherwise, we have nothing to look for here.”   From the reports, it appears that Gantz and Eisenkot are pushing for a policy that would end fighting in return for the release of Israeli hostages, which they seem to believe is the only effective way to get them out. In Eisenkot’s view, the IDF is strong enough to take a break from the fighting now to ensure the return of the captives, and will be able to confront Hamas again in the future, effectively ending the current war.On the opposing side, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi are backing the position that the continuation of the military operation, putting further pressure on Hamas, is the only way to ensure the eventual release of the captives. A lengthy ceasefire, in their opinion, will weaken Israel strategically. In a war of terror, they believe, taking a ‘shortcut’ – giving in to the demands of terrorists – will lead to future hostage-taking and another massacre of Israelis.From their vantage point, only the continued application of military pressure will lead to the freeing of captives. This is what led to the hostage release deals thus far, they claim.Netanyahu, Gallant, and Halevi believe that while sanctifying and preserving life is an essential part of the Israeli DNA, pausing or ending the war in exchange for the return of the hostages would be a major mistake. There are several goals to the war, and they do not always converge. One aim is bringing back the hostages, but another is dismantling the military capabilities of Hamas to ensure that they cannot pose a threat to Israel. If Hamas is allowed to retain its military capabilities- rearm and restructure during a ceasefire- residents of the Gaza Envelope communities will never be able to return to their towns and kibbutzim.Moreover, Iran and its proxies – Hamas, Hezbollah, the Huthis, Islamic Jihad, ISIS, and terror cells in Iraq and Syria – are waiting to see how Israel reacts. According to this point of view, if Israel were to pause or end the fighting in order to free hostages while leaving Hamas’ weaponry and leadership intact, Israel’s enemies would take notice. They will see that Israel is vulnerable to hostage-taking and it will only be a matter of time before the next Iran-sponsored attack or kidnapping occurs. Continuing the fighting enables Israel to retain its power of deterrence. After the events of October 7, Israel must have zero tolerance for terror.Bringing back the captives is closely tied to continuing the fight against Hamas. Only this will deter our enemies and will provide a clear message to Iran and its proxies that Israel will not give in to terror.

It will force Yahya Sinwar to abandon his dream that, somehow, the IDF will give up on Gaza, enabling Hamas to retain its power for him and his successors. According to this school of thought, military pressure is the most effective way to the ensure the release of Israeli captives and deter Israel’s enemies from pursuing further attacks.    It is important to mention that Israel’s leaders are not indifferent or insensitive to the hostages and their families. They have spent countless hours strategizing ways to get them out of Gaza, both in internal discussions and in international negotiations. Unfortunately, this war has tested Israeli leadership, presenting them with tough and critical decisions that impact the lives and survival of the captives, soldiers, evacuated Israeli civilians and the Israeli society as a whole. The State of Israel, the only true democracy in the Middle East, is being tested as a whole- its leadership, army and civilians. Each decision is due to change the future of the Jewish State, and the stakes are high. Let us hope that the third stage of the war will lead to stability in Israel, Gaza and the entire region.
The psychological warfare that Hamas has been conducting against the Israeli public, with the release of videos of hostages in body bags and announcements of the death of captives, has taken its toll. Hamas is trying to deliver a clear message through these videos- if Israel continues fighting, more captives will die, mounting pressure on the Israeli government to agree to a ceasefire deal for their return.This week, a rift appears to have developed in Israel’s war cabinet about the country’s conduct in Gaza, dividing the war cabinet members into two camps - Benny Gantz, head of the National Unity party, together with Gadi Eisenkot, an MK from National Unity, both of whom formerly served as IDF Chief of Staff - against Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi.On Sunday, during a war cabinet meeting, Eisenkot was reported to have said, “We need to stop lying to ourselves. We need to show courage and lead a major agreement that will bring the abductees home. There is no need to continue to march blindly while the abductees are there. This is a critical time to make brave decisions. Otherwise, we have nothing to look for here.”   From the reports, it appears that Gantz and Eisenkot are pushing for a policy that would end fighting in return for the release of Israeli hostages, which they seem to believe is the only effective way to get them out. In Eisenkot’s view, the IDF is strong enough to take a break from the fighting now to ensure the return of the captives, and will be able to confront Hamas again in the future, effectively ending the current war.On the opposing side, Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Herzl Halevi are backing the position that the continuation of the military operation, putting further pressure on Hamas, is the only way to ensure the eventual release of the captives. A lengthy ceasefire, in their opinion, will weaken Israel strategically. In a war of terror, they believe, taking a ‘shortcut’ – giving in to the demands of terrorists – will lead to future hostage-taking and another massacre of Israelis.From their vantage point, only the continued application of military pressure will lead to the freeing of captives. This is what led to the hostage release deals thus far, they claim.Netanyahu, Gallant, and Halevi believe that while sanctifying and preserving life is an essential part of the Israeli DNA, pausing or ending the war in exchange for the return of the hostages would be a major mistake. There are several goals to the war, and they do not always converge. One aim is bringing back the hostages, but another is dismantling the military capabilities of Hamas to ensure that they cannot pose a threat to Israel. If Hamas is allowed to retain its military capabilities- rearm and restructure during a ceasefire- residents of the Gaza Envelope communities will never be able to return to their towns and kibbutzim.Moreover, Iran and its proxies – Hamas, Hezbollah, the Huthis, Islamic Jihad, ISIS, and terror cells in Iraq and Syria – are waiting to see how Israel reacts. According to this point of view, if Israel were to pause or end the fighting in order to free hostages while leaving Hamas’ weaponry and leadership intact, Israel’s enemies would take notice. They will see that Israel is vulnerable to hostage-taking and it will only be a matter of time before the next Iran-sponsored attack or kidnapping occurs. Continuing the fighting enables Israel to retain its power of deterrence. After the events of October 7, Israel must have zero tolerance for terror.Bringing back the captives is closely tied to continuing the fight against Hamas.

HVPHY0PTTV_V6OEEIIHE7DFN27,Israeli ministers bash one another as cabinet meeting descends into chaos,ALEX WINSTON,"JANUARY 21, 2024 17:53",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-783090,"In a heated session during Sunday's cabinet meeting, ministers once again found themselves entangled in disputes and arguments. While the initial agenda focused on security updates and the ongoing war, tensions rose as ministers took verbal jabs at each other.At the start of the discussion, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant departed for a security meeting with IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi. During this time, General Eliezer Toledano presented a security overview to the remaining ministers. Tourism Minister Haim Katz raised questions about the number of Hamas terrorists killed, prompting a sarcastic response from Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli. ""Maybe we'll just send Haim Katz to Gaza, who is full of criticism; maybe he'll bring Sinwar?"" Chikli asked. ""Or we'll send [former prime minister Naftali] Bennett to bring Sinwar.""  National Missions Minister Orit Struck shifted the discussion, questioning the lack of emphasis on the IDF's achievements and the apparent disconnect with the public perception of success. Chikli urged her to address diplomatic channels, leading to Prime Minister Netanyahu's intervention, where Chikli provided Struck with a direct address for her concerns. Israeli minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli speaks at the AJC Global Forum in Tel Aviv, on June 14, 2023. (credit: MIRIAM ALSTER/FLASH90)Later in the meeting, discussions turned to the appointment of Likud MK May Golan as Social Equality Minister following Chikli's recent resignation. A bitter conflict unfolded between Golan and Chikli, primarily revolving around the transfer of the department for socio-economic development in Bedouin society. Golan opposed moving it from the Social Equality Ministry to Chikli's Diaspora Ministry, citing a perceived lack of connection between Bedouin issues and the diaspora.""There is no connection between the Bedouin sector and the issues related to it and the Diaspora,"" Golan argued.   AdvertisementChikli expressed skepticism about the need for a specialized office for women's status, stating, ""I don't understand the need for a special office for the status of women. What is historical about that?""'Women are 50% of the population!'""Maybe it's not your base! But women are 50% of the population! There is incorrect terminology when talking about the status of women!"" Golan argued as she passionately defended the importance of promoting women's status.In response to the escalating tension, Netanyahu addressed Golan, highlighting the attacks he faces and advising her to learn to ignore them. Stressing the significance of promoting women's status, he proposed renaming the ministry to ""The Ministry for Social Equality and Women's Status."" The meeting underscored the ongoing challenges within the cabinet, with ministers openly expressing divergent views on critical issues.""For me, 'social equality' is far more than a pair of words; it encapsulates an entire world!"" Golan said in a statement later on Sunday. ""As a single mother's daughter who grew up in South Tel Aviv, grappling daily with outdated opinions and discrimination, I have often heard the phrase, 'You're not one of us.' Whether on the street, at school, or in social gatherings, it seems some people only believe in equality when it comes to those similar to them.""With my entry into the Social Equality Ministry, I am obligated to be a voice for those whose voices may not be heard,"" Golan stated. ""As I emphasized in the recent government meeting where I was officially appointed, it is time to shift from high-flown rhetoric about equality to tangible action.""In response to the misleading terminology implying the complete abolishment of the Advancement of the Status of Women Ministry, I clarify that what is being eliminated is the office within the ministry. Now, one office will merge, and the authority for promoting women's status will merge with the Social Equality Ministry under my leadership. Let it be clear: I will continue with all my might to promote the status of all women in Israel, as demanded in the 2024 budget.""

IR6NW0C01L_5YI978LXGOSVN96,Israel has eliminated 20% to 30% of Hamas’s fighters - WSJ,JERUSALEM POST STAFF,"JANUARY 21, 2024 09:28",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-783036,"Israel has eliminated 20% to 30% of Hamas’s fighters in Gaza, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing estimates from US intelligence agencies. This figure is lower than the Israeli goal, the publication added.The WSJ, citing an Israeli estimate, added that, prior to the war, Hamas's strength lay at around 30,000 fighters. Last week, the IDF reported that 9,000 of this total had been killed.Enough ammunition to continue fighting for monthsDespite much of Gaza being in ruins, new assessments show the terror group is still far from being vanquished, the WSJ said.   Hamas’s tactics have shifted since the beginning of the war, with the terror group focusing its guerilla warfare on smaller groups and lurking behind traps they set for IDF soldiers. According to the US estimate, Hamas has enough ammunition and weapons to enable it to continue attacking the IDF in Gaza for months. In addition, a classified US report shows evidence that in a bid to reinstate its control, Hamas is reconstituting its police force within Gaza City, as per the WSJ. Israeli soldiers operate in the Gaza Strip amid the ongoing conflict with Hamas, January 16, 2024  (credit: IDF SPOKESPERSON'S UNIT)Additionally, the US estimates that some 10,500 to 11,700 terrorists have been wounded and could soon be combat-ready again.  AdvertisementThe IDF has reportedly slightly different numbers and estimates that 16,000 terrorists have been wounded, half of whom are incapacitated and unable to return to fight. Reviewing war goals Israeli officials have recognized Hamas’s prime goal as survival, notwithstanding the losses it has sustained, the report continued. The numbers come amid US pressure on Israel to reduce the scale of operations in Gaza and the overall aim of the war from the complete destruction of the terror group to its elimination as a threat.The US has also requested that the IDF shift its actions to targeting primarily Hamas leadership, the WSJ concluded.

Consequently, the understanding of “never again” was more benign and broader in scope, reflecting the glow of renewed life and Jewish greater acceptance in the Diaspora, while Israel grew by leaps and bounds.

This redemption occurred in the midst (and was a partial cause) of the triumph of democracy over totalitarianism.Note: Democracy is good for Jews, especially because it makes room for differences, for entrepreneurial initiatives, and particularist communities as well as a variety of cultures and religions.

Israel had been unable to prevent the October 7 massacre.Yet Israel has the power and the will to defeat Hamas and other existential enemies and restore its deterrence power. When the dust settles, Jews will find that they have more allies and political support among the nations. Therefore, “never again” remains a powerful and important policy guide.However, it must be understood in a less naive way. Never again does not mean that there will be no significant antisemitism or even existential threats aimed at Jewry or the State of Israel.

Since 2015, the General Assembly has adopted 140 resolutions criticizing Israel compared to 68 critical resolutions against all other countries in the world.In Europe, antisemitism lived on in far Right (and neo-Nazi) circles. In America, antisemitism survived alongside white supremacist and other discredited world views, in circles beyond the pale. In the Trump administration, these views surfaced with a vengeance. Conspiracy theories abounded in these circles and such theories often attach to Jews or tropes about Jews.In recent decades, a “woke” philosophy gained strength on the Left, especially in academia. White people were all in the oppressor class. People of color, indigenous people and minorities suffering discrimination were in the oppressed class. Group membership defined morality. Whatever oppressors did was wrong, whatever the oppressed did was right. Intersectionality developed as an ethics corollary. All discriminated minorities stood together and should support each other. Jews were labeled white to give them the label of oppressorJEWS WERE labeled as white, (by definition meaning oppressors) – dismissing past persecution of Jews or their record supporting the rights of people of color and other minorities. Israel was labeled “white” and “colonialist’” (ignoring the 50% plus Israelis who were Arab Jews or Ethiopian). The Palestinians were classified as people of color. The fact that Israel was the only democracy in the Middle East and that Israeli Jews were way ahead on women’s and rights of the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community were dismissed.All these forces blew up in a perfect storm of antisemitism and anti-Zionism in the support for Hamas’s October 7 massacre. Particularly unnerving to Jews was that younger Americans, in significant percentages, accepted the Palestinian narrative that Israel was the oppressor and that Hamas tactics were legitimate “resistance” rather than despicable atrocities.Out of shock and depression, some Israelis said that “never again” was an empty, meaningless slogan. Israel had been unable to prevent the October 7 massacre.Yet Israel has the power and the will to defeat Hamas and other existential enemies and restore its deterrence power. When the dust settles, Jews will find that they have more allies and political support among the nations. Therefore, “never again” remains a powerful and important policy guide.However, it must be understood in a less naive way. Never again does not mean that there will be no significant antisemitism or even existential threats aimed at Jewry or the State of Israel. It means that Jewry has been given a license to protect itself against its enemies in a spirit guided by the lessons of the Holocaust.In Israel, Jews – have taken power and are ready (to paraphrase former president John F. Kennedy) “to pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of the Jewish people and the Jewish state.”Some will say that the price is too high and they cannot bear the burden of Jewishness.The vast majority of Jews understand that we will have to give our all and sacrifice some of our best lives to live our destiny. The hopeful truth is that the Jewish people have done this before and can do it again.The writer is a leading Jewish thinker who has written on post-Holocaust theology, the State of Israel, and the ethics of Jewish power.

KL78OKPAWB_S6SNFV4TV5I2SPS,Israel needs seeds for new leadership to take over after war with Hamas - opinion,SHERWIN POMERANTZ,"JANUARY 21, 2024 04:19",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-782987,"Ever since the beginning of the war with Hamas, I have been writing a daily blog summarizing what is happening here and providing updated information to a worldwide audience. One of the things I, along with a huge swath of our citizenry, have been thinking about is: what happens after the war ends? While there seems to be a large majority of Israelis who believe we need new political leadership, and I am part of that group as well, we don’t hear new names. We don’t hear specifics about those very capable and qualified leaders of industry, academia, and the nonprofit sector who, until now, have chosen not to get involved in the leadership of the state.That may have been an acceptable position before October 7 but no longer. When this war is over, we will need the best and the brightest to step up and give a couple of years of their lives to the construct that will be the new Israel; dynamic, vibrant, and as full of promise for the future as we were in the past.  Recently, I began to identify people who could be part of this cadre of new leaders and bring their backgrounds to the attention of my readers so that everyone would realize that our talent pool is nothing short of amazing. Potential new leadersHere are six brief examples of potential new leaders in alphabetical order so no one will think I am preferencing one over the other. (Note: none of the people profiled has been made aware that I am doing this but all the data is in the public domain.) Eli Carmon, CFO & COO of Microsoft Israel R&D leads the finance, real estate, security, procurement, legal, employee experience, and IT functions for all of Microsoft Israel’s R&D sites. Prior to his current role, he served as director of the Business Controller Group of Microsoft Middle East and Africa. Before that, he was the CFO of Microsoft Israel (sales and marketing), senior manager at KPMG Israel, and a manager of the TASE’s Research Unit. Carmon holds a BA in Accounting and Economics from Bar Ilan University and an MA in Economics from New Zealand’s Otago University.YANIV GARTY was most recently vice president and general manager of Intel Israel and the Product Lines GM of the Next Generation and Solutions (NGS) group there. In that role, Garty was responsible for shaping and driving the NGS strategy for technological and product solutions, from vision to realization. As the general manager of Intel Israel, he oversaw all of the company’s Israel activities and operations (with 12,000 employees here they are the largest private employer in the country). AdvertisementGarty has also served in multiple engineering, business, and managerial positions in communication companies including Serconet, Optibase, and Orckit. He holds a BS in Electrical Engineering and an MBA, both from Tel Aviv University. Nehemia (Chemi) Peres is a managing partner and co-founder of Pitango, Israel’s largest venture capital fund. Prior to Pitango, Peres held managerial positions at Decision Systems Israel (DSI) and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). Peres also served for 10 years as an Israeli Air Force pilot. He currently serves on the boards of numerous Pitango portfolio companies and as chairperson of the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation. In 2020, he co-founded and steered the Covid-19 relief Israeli Solidarity Fund. The son of former president of Israel, Shimon Peres, he is well familiar with how the political system works here. He holds a BSc in Industrial Engineering and an MBA, both from Tel Aviv University. Oded Rose has been CEO of the Israel-America Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) since 2016. Previously, he served as CEO of Flow Industries for eight years, and as VP of Marketing and Sales of Atlantium Ltd. He has also served on the boards of directors of over 20 Israeli companies.Rose is also the CEO of the Eastern Mediterranean International School Foundation, whose main activity was establishing Israel’s EMIS international boarding school, bringing together high school students worldwide for a two-year International Baccalaureate (IB) program (11th-12th grades). Twenty percent of the students are Israeli, 20% are non-Israeli Arab and Muslim students, and 60% are from over 40 countries. He holds an MS in Medical Research from Tel Aviv University’s School of Medicine, an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, as well as an MA in International Studies from the same university. Knesset workers release 136 balloons to signify the hostages in captivity, January 14, 2024 (credit: NOAM MOSHKOWITZ/KNESSET SPOKESPERSON)Dr. Tomer Simon is the chief scientist of the Microsoft Israel R&D Center. Previously, he was the national technology officer at Microsoft Israel, and before that, the futurist and senior director of Academic Research and Innovation in Amdocs. Simon brings more than 20 years of experience in the technology and IT worlds, including technology research, software development, and management, having established numerous large development centers. Today, Simon works with a large range of executives in the defense and private sectors, building organizational and national-level strategies. He is also a member of four governmental steering committees on internet infrastructure, academy-industry relations, digital talent, and the future of education in the age of AI.KAREN TAL is the CEO of Amal, a secular educational network whose mission is to serve Israelis of all religions. Forty percent of Amal’s 81 high schools and colleges are located in Arab or Druze communities. In all, over 30,000 students and 2,500 teachers are part of Amal schools. Tal, 59, immigrated to Israel from Morocco as a young child and grew up in Jerusalem. Her background and experience put her in a unique position to deal with the monumental challenge of helping Israeli children of all ethnic backgrounds heal from the national trauma of war.Tal also transformed the Bialik-Rogozin School in south Tel Aviv into one of Israel’s most successful educational models.

While there seems to be a large majority of Israelis who believe we need new political leadership, and I am part of that group as well, we don’t hear new names. We don’t hear specifics about those very capable and qualified leaders of industry, academia, and the nonprofit sector who, until now, have chosen not to get involved in the leadership of the state.That may have been an acceptable position before October 7 but no longer. When this war is over, we will need the best and the brightest to step up and give a couple of years of their lives to the construct that will be the new Israel; dynamic, vibrant, and as full of promise for the future as we were in the past.

In 2011, she won Israel’s National Education Prize, and HBO made a film about the school called Strangers No More, which won an Oscar for best short documentary.

LJSHEDTJ7Q_Q4U13XRWTPQLNGS,Benefits of purchasing fresh fruit this Tu Bishvat,JUDY SIEGEL-ITZKOVICH,"JANUARY 21, 2024 18:32",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-783096,"Instead of buying sugared and dried fruit from Turkey and other countries hostile to Israel, the Israel Plants Production and Marketing Board recommends serving fresh fruits and nuts on Tu Bishvat – the New Year of Trees – that is being marked on Thursday. The custom of buying dried fruits originated with Jews who lived in the diaspora and suffered from a lack of fresh fruit in the winter season, so they consumed dried fruit brought from Israel instead.No need to purchase dried fruit for this year's holidayBut today, when one can find on supermarket and grocery store shelves dozens of types of fresh fruit produced in the country. “There is no reason to continue consuming imported and processed dried fruit, some of which are high in added sugar, preservatives, and food coloring, while the fresh fruit is completely natural and rich in vitamins and many nutritional values, without any food coloring or industrial processing.   The council emphasizes that there are currently many fresh Israeli fruits on the shelves, including bananas, apples, oranges, strawberries, pears, kiwi, clementine, melon, persimmon, grapefruit, pomegranate, pomelo, red grapefruit, and more.The Israeli-grown date dries on the tree naturally without the need for added sugar or preservatives.Further benefits of purchasing fresh fruit in Israel According to Rani Bar-Nes, the head of the fruits division of the Israel Plants Production and Marketing Board and a farmer who grows fruit (peaches, nectarines, pomegranates, plums, persimmons and more), “most of the agricultural work is done within the borders of the country, and since the outbreak of the war, many farmers both from the south of the country and from the north, have been affected by the current attacks over the borders.""  (credit: INGIMAGE)""Many growers are being recruited into the reserves, there are many growing areas that have been damaged and some that cannot be reached at all, and there is also a great shortage of workers who can carry out the agricultural work. But despite all these, there is an abundance of Israeli fruits on the shelves. Recently, the law to mark the country of origin for agricultural produce also came into effect, so it is easier than ever to identify Israeli produce on the shelves. Therefore, in preparation for Tu Bishvat, we call on the Israeli public to prefer fresh fruits produced in the country with high health and nutritional values over the imported dried fruits. In this way, they will both maintain their health and support the local economy and Israeli growers,” Bar-Nes urged.  AdvertisementDr. Maya Roseman, clinical nutritionist and scientific advisor to the council, added that “compared to dried fruits, the nutritional value of the fresh fruits is much higher. The amount of vitamins in the fresh fruits is immeasurably high, especially when it comes to vitamin C, which is especially important for preventing diseases during the winter and transition seasons and is found only in fresh fruits and not in dried fruits at all and is not found in dried fruits at all. Beyond that, most dried fruits (except organic ones) contain chemicals such as iron sulfate that are preservatives or color enhancers. These harm our health and are completely unnecessary. The conclusion - it is most healthful and tastiest to eat fresh fruit, even when the dried fruit is offered to us in tempting and colorful abundance.” Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >>

But today, when one can find on supermarket and grocery store shelves dozens of types of fresh fruit produced in the country. “There is no reason to continue consuming imported and processed dried fruit, some of which are high in added sugar, preservatives, and food coloring, while the fresh fruit is completely natural and rich in vitamins and many nutritional values, without any food coloring or industrial processing.   The council emphasizes that there are currently many fresh Israeli fruits on the shelves, including bananas, apples, oranges, strawberries, pears, kiwi, clementine, melon, persimmon, grapefruit, pomegranate, pomelo, red grapefruit, and more.The Israeli-grown date dries on the tree naturally without the need for added sugar or preservatives.Further benefits of purchasing fresh fruit in Israel According to Rani Bar-Nes, the head of the fruits division of the Israel Plants Production and Marketing Board and a farmer who grows fruit (peaches, nectarines, pomegranates, plums, persimmons and more), “most of the agricultural work is done within the borders of the country, and since the outbreak of the war, many farmers both from the south of the country and from the north, have been affected by the current attacks over the borders.""  (credit: INGIMAGE)""Many growers are being recruited into the reserves, there are many growing areas that have been damaged and some that cannot be reached at all, and there is also a great shortage of workers who can carry out the agricultural work. But despite all these, there is an abundance of Israeli fruits on the shelves. Recently, the law to mark the country of origin for agricultural produce also came into effect, so it is easier than ever to identify Israeli produce on the shelves. Therefore, in preparation for Tu Bishvat, we call on the Israeli public to prefer fresh fruits produced in the country with high health and nutritional values over the imported dried fruits. In this way, they will both maintain their health and support the local economy and Israeli growers,” Bar-Nes urged.  AdvertisementDr. Maya Roseman, clinical nutritionist and scientific advisor to the council, added that “compared to dried fruits, the nutritional value of the fresh fruits is much higher.

MVJ90T5142_IQ13YQB6C2NZLB7,New exhibits at Hostage Square make Tel Aviv Museum a healing space,WALLA!,"JANUARY 21, 2024 04:06",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-783027,"Proof of the power of art to touch the depths of the heart can be found today at the entrance to the Tel Aviv Museum. In the most emotional square in Tel Aviv, art can be found at every corner: from figurines to a model of a tunnel, dozens of installations in Hostage Square do everything to instill in passers-by the need to shout and demand that the nightmare end.These initiatives grew independently, without a direct connection to the museum, although it provided the families headquarters with gathering spaces and assistance as much as possible. The echoes of the war and the disaster of October 7 are also well felt within the Tel Aviv Museum, as well as in its plans for the coming year, which were presented at a press conference last Thursday.Ironically, the war took hold of the Tel Aviv Museum while presenting the exhibition ""Amos Gitai: Kippur, Requiem for War,"" on the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War and following the director's famous film.  The surprise attack by Hamas put the Mossad into emergency mode. Alberto Giacomotti's exhibition was quickly dismantled. Particularly valuable pictures, by Picasso or Van Gogh for example, were quickly moved to warehouses, where they still lie waiting for peacetime. The museum itself was even closed for a few weeks.

(credit: FLASH90/CHAIM GOLDBERG)With its reopening, the Tel Aviv Museum began to return to normal, but a little differently. Along with several exhibitions currently showing, such as the exhibition showcasing Shalom Saba's works that had been planned, the museum looks ahead and tries to steer the ship in an unpredictable era.Planning for the futureCurrently, peace is not in sight and it is difficult to plan for future exhibits. Among the challenges at hand include a decrease in income and the number of visitors, the public climate that is not necessarily free for culture, and also the cold shoulder that the international art community shows to Israel. The museum says that no artist from around the world has asked to have his works removed, but they point out that one artist, who previously exhibited at the museum, preferred that his work not be screened again now.In the meantime, the museum is focusing inward, re-examining its role as an Israeli institution in this period. Beyond the assistance to the family headquarters in the entrance plaza, this is reflected in a variety of activities for evacuee communities in the north and south, in their temporary accommodation and accommodation in the institution itself, and in the distribution of tens of thousands of activity kits to such centers throughout the country. AdvertisementAt the same time, the museum announced its ""healing space"" initiative, within the framework of which the museum's education department is looking for ways to provide a space for art therapy, creativity and recovery for the survivors, the injured and the many victims of trauma from the disaster. This is in collaboration with the civil defense, arts schools, therapists and medical teams.""The entrance through the Hostage Square creates a direct and open line between the general public and the museum, and the physical and emotional distance between the interior and the exterior is shrinking, and naturally, the museum's displays are all charged with additional layers of meaning,"" says Tanya Cohen-Uziali, CEO of the Tel Museum Aviv for Art. ""We are constantly working to initiate, assist, and ensure for the hundreds of thousands of visitors who pass through the museum's gates every year, that this iconic cultural institution will be responsive to the spirit of the times and accessible to all."" Several other exhibitions are planned at Hostage Square throughout the year.

P1WH2CK4VT_H3LPQKVY1U6QIJ1,It's essential that Israel also focus on terror threats in West Bank - editorial,JPOST EDITORIAL,"JANUARY 21, 2024 05:58",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-783004,"It is essential that Israel focus on the rising terrorist threats in the West Bank. Palestinian terrorist groups are seeking to exploit the war in Gaza and tensions with Hezbollah to increase their arsenals in the West Bank and erode the Palestinian Authority.Following the Hamas attack on October 7 there have been increased threats from the West Bank. Israel has operated to try to stymie those threats via arrests of Hamas activists and other terrorists. However, a recent upsurge in violence in the West Bank illustrates that the threat is growing and it could spill over.The spillover from the West Bank could occur in various ways. First of all, it could affect Palestinian cities and lead to the weakening of the Palestinian Authority.  The Palestinian Authority already faces many threats from groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It also has internal voices who backed the Hamas genocidal massacre and have tried to play both sides, by pretending to be moderates who can work toward peace, and backing Hamas terrorists.Meanwhile the average people in the West Bank have also been force-fed propaganda about how Hamas has been able to achieve deals with Israel, such as the release of Palestinian prisoners. All of this creates a toxic mix that could lead to more support for extremist groups. Israeli forces operate in Tulkarm, in the West Bank, January 18, 2024 (credit: IDF SPOKESPERSON'S UNIT)The Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) eliminated terrorists in Balata camp in Nablus last week. The terrorists in Balata had planned to carry out an “imminent, large-scale terrorist attack,” the IDF said. Balata is a hot bed of terrorism, like many of the congested Palestinian former refugee camps that have become neighborhoods in various cities.International organizations often turn a blind eye to this extremism, and as in Gaza, they have not confronted the extremism and terror threats in places like Balata. This means the tragedy of Gaza is repeated in the West Bank, as groups like Hamas, PIJ, and others prey on the people and push them to attack Israel. AdvertisementFor instance, the terrorist eliminated last week in Balata was named Amed Abdullah Abu-Shalal and he was taken out with a precision airstrike. The IDF and Shin Bet should be applauded for this precision and taking out these threats before they grow. The IDF has said that Abu-Shalal was responsible for carrying out a number of terrorist attacks over the last year. These terrorists threaten areas throughout Israel and Jewish communities far from Balata. For example, one attack that had its origins in Balata, struck Jerusalem.Balata, in Nablus, is only one of several terrorist centers in the West Bank. Another is Tulkarm.Last weekLast week the IDF also spent more than 40 hours in a counter-terror operation in that city. Our forces examined numerous buildings and found more than 400 explosive devices and seized illegal weapons. Five manufacturing sites where explosives were made were also uncovered. This shows that the kind of terrorist infrastructure that Hamas created in Gaza, is now popping up in the West Bank.We must fight this terrorist infrastructure and the groups behind it with the utmost severity. It is a clear and present danger to the citizens of Israel. We have spent 100 days fighting in Gaza after the consequences of not taking Hamas seriously led to the massacre of 1,200 people and the kidnapping of 240 others. We must not underestimate the threats that can also grow out of cities in the West Bank.To defeat West Bank terror we must be vigilant. That means dismantling not just the weapons labs and targeting the terror leaders, but also tracking all the weapons smuggling that brings modern rifles to the terrorists in the West Bank.Over the last year and a half, it has become clear that there has been a flood of illegal weapons – primarily M-16 style rifles – to cities in the West Bank. The smuggling networks must be disbanded. The weapons must be traced, and if it is found that they have been stolen from places in Israel, we must investigate and prosecute those responsible.The illegal weapons trade, like the Hamas threat, has been ignored for too long. The West Bank requires focus and investment to ensure that the extremists can’t seize control of cities and that we are not just playing “whack-a-mole” against terrorists in various cities.

For example, one attack that had its origins in Balata, struck Jerusalem.Balata, in Nablus, is only one of several terrorist centers in the West Bank. Another is Tulkarm.Last weekLast week the IDF also spent more than 40 hours in a counter-terror operation in that city. Our forces examined numerous buildings and found more than 400 explosive devices and seized illegal weapons. Five manufacturing sites where explosives were made were also uncovered. This shows that the kind of terrorist infrastructure that Hamas created in Gaza, is now popping up in the West Bank.We must fight this terrorist infrastructure and the groups behind it with the utmost severity. It is a clear and present danger to the citizens of Israel. We have spent 100 days fighting in Gaza after the consequences of not taking Hamas seriously led to the massacre of 1,200 people and the kidnapping of 240 others. We must not underestimate the threats that can also grow out of cities in the West Bank.To defeat West Bank terror we must be vigilant. That means dismantling not just the weapons labs and targeting the terror leaders, but also tracking all the weapons smuggling that brings modern rifles to the terrorists in the West Bank.Over the last year and a half, it has become clear that there has been a flood of illegal weapons – primarily M-16 style rifles – to cities in the West Bank. The smuggling networks must be disbanded. The weapons must be traced, and if it is found that they have been stolen from places in Israel, we must investigate and prosecute those responsible.The illegal weapons trade, like the Hamas threat, has been ignored for too long. The West Bank requires focus and investment to ensure that the extremists can’t seize control of cities and that we are not just playing “whack-a-mole” against terrorists in various cities.
The Palestinian Authority already faces many threats from groups like Palestinian Islamic Jihad. It also has internal voices who backed the Hamas genocidal massacre and have tried to play both sides, by pretending to be moderates who can work toward peace, and backing Hamas terrorists.Meanwhile the average people in the West Bank have also been force-fed propaganda about how Hamas has been able to achieve deals with Israel, such as the release of Palestinian prisoners. All of this creates a toxic mix that could lead to more support for extremist groups.

The terrorists in Balata had planned to carry out an “imminent, large-scale terrorist attack,” the IDF said. Balata is a hot bed of terrorism, like many of the congested Palestinian former refugee camps that have become neighborhoods in various cities.International organizations often turn a blind eye to this extremism, and as in Gaza, they have not confronted the extremism and terror threats in places like Balata. This means the tragedy of Gaza is repeated in the West Bank, as groups like Hamas, PIJ, and others prey on the people and push them to attack Israel.

QOCGINHCDD_JRJ2CFYXNIOF170,Law & Order takes on the Hamas-Israel conflict,HANNAH BROWN,"JANUARY 21, 2024 20:17",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/culture/article-783111,"The original Law & Order (as well as its spinoffs) has always taken inspiration from headlines, so it shouldn’t come as a big surprise that the first episode of its 23rd season (which aired in the US on January 18 and which will be shown in Israel on Hot Zone on January 23 at 10:45 p.m. and on Hot VOD and Next TV), tackles the response to the war between Hamas and Israel on a New York college campus.Since it’s network television, it tries to cover all the bases in the controversy without causing any actual offense, but given that show’s creator and one of the co-writers of this episode, Dick Wolf, is Jewish and that its most beloved characters tend to be wise and skeptical of violence and self-righteousness, it isn’t surprising that it tips its hat toward the Israeli position. It opens with a shot of posters showing hostages abducted by Hamas, defaced by red paint. If you want the episode to surprise you, stop reading here, because there will be some spoilers. After we see the posters, Nathan Alpert (Scott Bryce), the Jewish president of the fictitious Hudson University, walks past them, talking on the phone to his wife about his fear that he will be accused of plagiarism in his academic work, an obvious reference to recently resigned former Harvard president, Claudine Gay.  If he forgot to cite a single article correctly, he worries, his career will be over. Distracted when he sees some keffiya-clad students spray-painting stars of David on a shuttered bagel kiosk, he tells them to stop and is stabbed to death by an assailant who comes from a different direction and tosses a card with the word, “Traitor” written on it onto his body before fleeing. Credits roll, with the familiar and much-imitated bong-bong theme, much loved by crime show fans and canines (you can go to YouTube to see many videos of dogs barking along to it).  Law & Order takes on the Hamas-Israel conflict,  (credit: Courtesy of Hot Zone and Next TV)A donor character who even looks like Bill Ackman“Nate was a firm believer in free speech,” his wife tells the detectives Vincent Riley (Reid Scott) and Jalen Shaw (Mehcad Brooks). “He didn’t think it was his job to articulate his personal opinions. He thought it might disrupt campus discourse.” The first suspect is Phillip Klein (Jason Babinsky), a nervous, obviously Jewish academic who has been tearing down pro-Palestinian posters when the detectives find him.He is a politically conservative professor who is furious at the university for firing him, and he says was inspired to threaten to kill the liberal college president after watching news reports coming out of Israel. Klein points out that Alpert had no problem commenting on George Floyd’s death and is angry he stayed silent about Israel, in spite of being Jewish, and that a group of influential donors were demanding he resign. AdvertisementA wealthy donor with an airtight alibi who even looks like Bill Ackman says he had been pressuring Alpert to ban a student group that supports Hamas. Chloe (Alexa Wisener), an actress and influencer who has family in Gaza who is involved with the pro-Hamas group , has called the president a puppet of the Zionists. When they ask her a few questions, some students accuse the detectives of “being in the pocket of the Israeli government.” The eventual defendant is Cameron Lawson (Braxton Fannin), a wealthy, WASPy student. Israeli actress Odelya Halevi plays Samantha Maroun, a Lebanese assistant district attorney, intent on catching the killer. While she doesn’t agree with Chloe and Cameron, she opines that they aren’t crazy. Later, Chloe is shot dead while chanting, “From the river to the sea,” at a rally, and the shooter turns out to be – Klein. He shouts, “Never again!” as the detectives corner him, and is killed after he shoots at them. Dancy muses, “When did expressing your beliefs become so fraught?” and Maroun replies, “When it comes to Israel and Palestine? Forever.” They learn that Chloe and Cameron were under the sway of the charismatic professor, Kendra Nasser (Tehmina Sunny). Chloe’s bewildered boyfriend says he feels she “brainwashed them . . preaching and manipulating . . . She’s hardcore, too. She thought October 7 was justified. I mean, I support innocent Palestinians but come on. That was a flat-out act of terror.”The district attorney’s office decides that Cameron was “doing Nasser’s bidding,” and they decide to go after her as well. When assistant district attorney Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy) worries about “the optics,” Sam Waterson as DA Jack McCoy the sole holdover from the original series, says, in his Sam Waterston way, “Let me worry about the optics, you worry about the case.” After some damning testimony against her, Nasser asserts, “The Jewish elite will stop at nothing to silence me. They’re terrified of Middle Easterners with a platform and brain so they’ll do anything to squelch free debate.” Eventually, although she says she was proud her student killed, she is exonerated and as she leaves the courtroom – uncharacteristically silent – a brawl breaks out between her supporters and detractors. Maroun and Price discuss the case, and Maroun says it will never be over. Unfortunately, McCoy isn’t on hand with a comforting aphorism.The melodramatic and fast-paced show hits almost every note you could possibly expect from combining coverage of American campuses following the outbreak of the war against Hamas, and it is even handed in that there is a killer from each faction. But in the end, the noxious professor, who doesn’t even come close to expressing views as vile about the October 7 massacre by Hamas of Israelis (and quite a few foreigners) as real professors have, but she still comes off as an overwhelmingly negative figure.If the the waves of antisemitism crashing over American academia soon come to an end – as some predict they will – this may be the last Law & Order episode on these themes. If not, stay tuned.

TGJK4SEEW7_ZOGFAIH87TI3THR,Sara Netanyahu tried to oust Israel's Eylon Levy from spokesperson role - report,JERUSALEM POST STAFF,"JANUARY 21, 2024 20:24",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-783112,"Sara Netanyahu tried to have government spokesperson Eylon Levy removed from his role for participating in the Israeli judicial reform protests before the Israel-Hamas War, N12 reported on Sunday night.Tweets from the time of the weekly protests by Levy have reportedly circulated among the prime minister’s inner circle, and have upset some.Sara Netanyahu’s attempt to remove Levy sparked a backlash. The Movement for Quality Government in Israel requested that the government legal advisor issue guidelines defining the area in which she is permitted to intervene in governmental affairs.  “The law does not define any public status or area of responsibility for the spouse of the prime minister,” the organization’s chairman, Dr. Eliad Shraga said. “As of this moment, Mrs. Netanyahu has not submitted herself to the voter test and does not hold any public office and, therefore, cannot interfere in anything that has not been specifically defined for her to interfere in. The State of Israel is not a monarchical state, and the prime minister’s wife is not a queen. We demand clear guidelines and an end to the laissez-faire approach that allows the prime minister’s wife free rein in managing the state.”The chairman of the subcommittee for foreign policy and information, MK Ze’ev Elkin, has now sent a letter to the director of public diplomacy, Moshik Aviv, following the publication of rumors that Eylon Levy’s briefings were to be reduced, and even terminated.The letter reads, “During the discussions we held in the subcommittee, the name of Eylon Levy, a speaker in the hasbara (public diplomacy) system, came up several times in positive contexts. During the tour of the subcommittee in the hasbara system, you yourself mentioned Levy’s work as worthy of praise.“We were surprised to hear a report in the media according to which it was decided to reduce Levy’s briefings to the foreign media and that his impeachment is even being considered in light of pressure from foreign parties,” the letter continues. “If a quick and detailed response to this letter is not received, we will be forced to put the issue on the committee’s agenda.” AdvertisementLevy has become a face of the Israeli government in media outlets across the world as Israel battles to save its public image after the Hamas atrocities of October 7 and the subsequent ground invasion of Gaza.

The Public Diplomacy Department operates in a professional manner.”Levy, who previously served as international media advisor to President Isaac Herzog, became an international viral sensation while representing the Israeli government in an interview with Sky News anchor Kay Burley.Levy's past criticism of Netanyahu's governmentLevy has criticized many members of this current Netanyahu-led government, and participated in the protests against the judicial reforms.Asked if this background doesn’t contradict service as a government spokesperson, he told The Jerusalem Post in December, Levy answered, “I don’t think that personal, private, or political opinions about issues that aren’t even on the agenda at the moment are relevant.“On October 7, we experienced the deadliest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. And in an incredible moment in Jewish history, after a year in which we were at each other’s throats, Israeli society as a whole rose to the challenge. And we dropped our Jewish wars. We put them to the side. And as they say in Hebrew, I came under the stretcher to support the war effort.”In the Sky News interview, Burley asked whether the hostage deal, which would trade 150 Palestinian security prisoners in exchange for just 50 hostages held by Hamas – or three Palestinians for every captive – meant that Israel valued Palestinian lives at one-third the value of Israeli ones. Levy answered, with arched eyebrows in a look of shock, and said that the comment was “an astonishing accusation. If we could release one prisoner for every hostage, we would do that. We are operating in horrific circumstances,” he said.“We’re not choosing to release these prisoners who have blood on their hands. We are talking about people who have been convicted of stabbing and shooting attacks,” Levy stressed.

“We were surprised to hear a report in the media according to which it was decided to reduce Levy’s briefings to the foreign media and that his impeachment is even being considered in light of pressure from foreign parties,” the letter continues. “If a quick and detailed response to this letter is not received, we will be forced to put the issue on the committee’s agenda.” AdvertisementLevy has become a face of the Israeli government in media outlets across the world as Israel battles to save its public image after the Hamas atrocities of October 7 and the subsequent ground invasion of Gaza.

And in an incredible moment in Jewish history, after a year in which we were at each other’s throats, Israeli society as a whole rose to the challenge. And we dropped our Jewish wars. We put them to the side. And as they say in Hebrew, I came under the stretcher to support the war effort.”In the Sky News interview, Burley asked whether the hostage deal, which would trade 150 Palestinian security prisoners in exchange for just 50 hostages held by Hamas – or three Palestinians for every captive – meant that Israel valued Palestinian lives at one-third the value of Israeli ones. Levy answered, with arched eyebrows in a look of shock, and said that the comment was “an astonishing accusation. If we could release one prisoner for every hostage, we would do that. We are operating in horrific circumstances,” he said.“We’re not choosing to release these prisoners who have blood on their hands.

TQKAMHN59H_MS62BB8M4FFG0DO,Captive-bred vultures can improve flight and migration performance,JUDY SIEGEL-ITZKOVICH,"JANUARY 21, 2024 06:08",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/science/article-782994,"Being held captive during one’s early development – if you’re a bird – can improve life experiences and performance, according to ornithologists at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) in Beersheba.Two types of experiences affect the behavioral skills of animals: their environment during early development and later on. The ornithologists followed Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus) during migration – a critical and challenging period for them – and investigated how their flying skills developed by examining their performance using high-resolution GPS tracking.The use of tools is rare in birds, and besides using a pebble as a hammer, Egyptian vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for building their nests. The vultures breed in temperate climates and migrate south in winter, while tropical populations mostly stay in one place. These raptors, which soar over long distances and are known to ornithologists as the “white scavenger,” or “pharaoh’s chicken,” are widely distributed from the Iberian Peninsula, North Africa, West Asia, and India.  They feed mainly on dead animals, but when given the chance, they will catch and make a meal of reptiles, small birds, and mammals. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by tossing a large pebble onto them.Populations of this species declined in the 20th century, and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.A cinereous vulture (A. monachus) photographed by SPNI's Nadav Israeli (credit: NADAV ISRAELI/THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF NATURE)These findings have just been published in the journal Current Biology under the title, “Early and accumulated experience shape migration and flight in Egyptian vultures.” The research group included Prof. Nir Sapir from the University of Haifa, Prof. Thomas Mueller from Frankfurt University and the Senckenberg Research Center in Germany, and Ohad Hatzofe, a bird ecologist at the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.Vultures were assessedThe vultures were assessed using GPS transmitters for 127 autumn migrations of 65 different birds. The two groups were quite different in terms of their early life experiences: one group was raised in captivity and the other in the wild. The birds in both groups improved their flight and migration performances as they gained experience. However, the improvements observed were most evident for vultures raised in captivity. AdvertisementDuring their first migration, the captive-bred birds were less efficient but were able to catch up with the migration performance of those raised in the wild as early as the second migration. Thus, the experience gained helped offset the shortcomings of their experiences at an early stage. Just as it is harder for humans to learn a language when they are older, the vultures that hatched in captivity and were set free at a later age found it difficult to learn the necessary flying and roaming skills, but eventually, they caught up with those that learned earlier.“We were able to generate data on the vultures’ migration and flying skills. The data made it possible to learn about the value of early experience and acquired experience and their impact on the ability of birds to cope with challenging periods such as migration,” explained Dr. Ron Efrat, one of the lead investigators who recently completed his doctoral studies in the laboratory of Prof. Oded Berger-Tal of BGU’s Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research. “It seems that birds, like humans, are also affected by their life experiences,” he concluded.

The city's resilience is not confined to its physical infrastructure alone; it radiates from the tenacity of its citizens, each embodying an unwavering commitment to safeguard their home. From the crowded markets to the tranquil neighborhoods, Tel Aviv pulsates with a spirit that refuses to be subdued by the echoes of conflict. Thought the ongoing war with Hamas, the city's residents, a diverse mosaic of backgrounds and beliefs, find common ground in their shared love for Tel Aviv, forming an unbreakable bond that bolsters the city's defenses and fortifies its spirit.  (credit: Tal Givoni)The Response to Global Antisemitism“In response to the war and the rise of antisemitism, many large real estate companies understand that there is an increased demand for properties in Israel’s more upscale communities, and especially in Tel Aviv’s Old North,” explains Tamir Lulu. “We are seeing an increased trend of Jews in the diaspora who are looking for a stronger connection to the community within Israel.”The Anti-Defamation League reported a 337% increase in antisemitic incidents in the United States alone over the past year, significantly exacerbated in the aftermath of the October 7th events.  The United Kingdom showed a 537% increase, 818% in the Netherlands and 961% in Brazil.  While these are unprecedented statistics in recent years, the prevalence of antisemitism is deep seeded throughout the history of Zionism and the Jewish nation.  Understandably the number of new immigrants dropped to just under 2,000 in October and November, according to the Israel Ministry of Immigration and Integration, but are preparing for a significant increase in Jewish immigration in the upcoming year, according to the ministry’s head Ofir Sofer.  According to Sofer, there has been an 149% increase in inquiries for immigration from France and 81% from the United States, a direct correlation to the rise of antisemitism.  The unfortunate truth is that Jewish people around the world are becoming increasing more aware that they are being targeted for their identity, a disgusting libel of Jewish dual loyalty that has repeated itself throughout generations.  It is a difficult quandary to choose between uprooting your life and starting over in a foreign country, with a foreign language and different customs.  Fortunately, major urban centers like Tel Aviv eliminate those trepidations by offering an elevated quality of living together with an economic and cultural mecca in a globalized community of immigrants from around the world.    (credit: Tal Givoni)The Intersection of Community and ComfortMany ardent Zionists have already opted to invest in smaller vacation or seasonal homes, allowing them to experience the best that Tel Aviv has to offer, from the vivacious communal spirit to the white sandy beaches and glistening waters of the Mediterranean Sea, to world class culinary and cultural hotspots.  While this affords them the opportunity to get a taste of Israel without leaving their lives behind, it has also proven to be quite lucrative economically as well as for their own personal sense of security given the rise of antisemitism.  But for those seeking to build a home in the Jewish homeland, the larger luxury apartments that are quickly disappearing in Israel’s urban capital rival those in the most desirable cities in the world. Most luxury high rise building projects in Tel Aviv are built from torn down apartment homes with outdated infrastructure, already owned by veteran residents, a process known as Pinui Binui, and the added floors are then sold to new investors or homeowners.  However, the idyllic Old North neighborhood in Tel Aviv, categorized by its treelined streets and charming local bistros and cafes offers the rare opportunity for ground permits for brand new buildings, whose value will certainly increase due to lack of availability.There is limited opportunity for this level of real estate investment, both due to the competitive market in Israel and the statistical upward trends of real estate value following the major wars over the course of Israel’s history.  According to Globes, real estate sales had slowed even before the start of the war on October 7th, and even more so in the months following, making the next year a crucial period for savvy investors and aspiring Tel Aviv homeowners.  In 1973, a year after the Yom Kippur War, housing prices rose 39% and another 28% in 1975.  Following the Gulf War in 1992, the average price for an apartment increased by 32%, and in 2008, two years after the Second Lebanese War, prices rose by 7% and continued steadily over the next decade.  (credit: Tal Givoni)Over the past years, Tel Aviv has been on the cusp of a major urban revolution, redefining the cityscape to boast modern high-rise buildings, transforming the public transportation system with a comprehensive light rail and metro system and robust pedestrian and bicycle paths.  The Old North has already defined itself as one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Tel Aviv, the intersection of convenience, comfort and culture.  The stigma that living in Israel means sacrificing standard of living to be able to live the Zionist dream has become a thing of the past, as Israel’s coastal metropolis affords the best of both worlds.  “New immigrants are looking to live within a community and a place where they have everything.  Tel Aviv has become a mix of new immigrants and international cultures where you instantly can feel at home,” explains Lulu, adding that internationals no longer need to worry about feeling like a foreigner in the Jewish State, “You now have luxury residences with a club room and gym right in your building.  Outside, you have your local cafes and restaurants, your bank and office and exciting nightlife and recreational activities, just mere steps away.”Tel Aviv is truly the city that never stops, and its work hard play hard mentality is infectious, making it one of the most exciting places to live in the world.  Between the thriving high-tech sector, enveloping community life, access to the best urban living has to offer, and not to mention beautiful weather year-round, the idea of living in Israel is not just a practical solution in response to the global rise in antisemitism, but an all-inclusive urban lifestyle.  Israeli flags flying proudly from lush balconies are not a political statement, but a national identity- one that embraces the multicultural traditions of the Jewish people around the world and celebrates the beauty of Zionism, without fear.  But as the city continues to transform and grow, there has become an increased interest from both Israelis and internationals in owning a home in Israel’s cultural hub.  If Tel Aviv’s towering cranes and nonstop construction are any indication, the future of this Mediterranean Metropolis will exceed the wildest dreams of early modern Zionism.For more Info. on projects in Tel Aviv +972 58-444-1222This article was written in cooperation with Triple

VZ5IH0UO74_AYX1K6TS9JN2OLZ,Who is winning the shadow war between Israel and Iran? - analysis,YONAH JEREMY BOB,"JANUARY 21, 2024 19:41",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-783104,"This weekend, Hojatollah Omidvar, who served as the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Quds Force intelligence unit in Syria, was assassinated in the Damascus area, allegedly by Israel.Omidvar’s deputy and three other senior officials were killed in the same strike.Back in June, The Washington Post reported that Omidvar, also known as Haj Sadegh and Yousef Omidzadeh, “identified US Humvee and Cougar armored vehicles in Syria” to have his henchmen attack them. He was also believed to be deeply involved in coordinating attacks against Israel.  This came after the assassination on December 26, also attributed to Israel, of Sayyed Reza Mousavi, a senior commander in the IRGC. That assassination was also in the vicinity of the Syrian capital of Damascus.Mousavi was even senior to Omidvar and was responsible for coordinating the financing and logistics of transferring weapons from Tehran to proxies in Syria. (L-R) Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (credit: REUTERS)He was also considered extremely close to Qasem Soleimani, the former head of the Quds Force who was killed by a US drone, aided by aspects of Israeli intelligence, in January 2020.Other major assassinations recently attributed to Israel in Lebanon were of Hamas deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri and Hezbollah’s Radwan chief Wissam al-Tawil. AdvertisementThe only major assassination Israel took credit for publicly was of Hezbollah drone chief Ali Hussein Bergi, which it justified by saying he had directly orchestrated recent escalatory attacks on sensitive Israeli army bases and Israeli civilians.Despite the public silence, The Jerusalem Post understands that the IDF has undertaken thousands of operations in Syria in recent years to prevent Tehran from mounting a new dangerous front on another of Israel’s borders and that senior ranks do not leave Iranian officials immune.In fact, with the most intense part of the Gaza invasion already completed weeks ago, The Post understands that the air force has been more freed up for several other missions in the region.This continually growing list of assassinations, as well as a mid-December massive cyber attack on Iran’s gas stations, presuming they were carried out by Israel, are sending multiple messages to the Islamic Republic.The most obvious one is to stay out of Syria.A 'price tag' for IranBut the attacks are likely also a “price tag” for the Islamic Republic to make it pay for its sponsorship of Hamas and Hezbollah.Even though the ayatollahs had no direct connection to the October 7 Hamas invasion of Israel, Iran provided funding, logistics help, and training for Gaza’s terrorist rulers for years, and since the conflict started has ordered attacks on Israel by Hezbollah in Lebanon, proxies in Syria, and the Houthis of Yemen. For decades there was a shadow war between Israel and Iran, but if it ever traveled into the territory of Iran proper, it was usually only related to the ayatollahs’ nuclear weapons program.There were always some exceptions, including some Iranian officials assassinated in April-June 2022, but the recent wave of targeted killings suggests conflict between the countries has entered a new phase.Tehran has wanted to draw real blood from Jerusalem for years and finally succeeded on October 7, as well as since then with its other proxies.For the ayatollahs, making as many as 250,000 Israelis evacuate their homes on multiple fronts is also as much a victory as the number of Israelis its proxies have killed.Iran has also struck back, going after Israelis in India and other countries.Also, Iran said it retaliated against the Mossad or Mossed-aligned Kurdish groups in Iraq last week with long-range missile strikes.All of that could have been a smokescreen for the Islamic Republic to last out against opposition groups, which it also did against groups in Syria and Pakistan.But it showed a greater readiness by Iran to flex its military might, with less fear of the destabilizing consequences.There is also the gradually escalating fight between the Houthis and Iranian proxies in Iraq versus the US and some allies, for their support for the Jewish state during this war.The final front is the nuclear weapons one, where IAEA chief of nuclear inspections Rafael Grossi on Friday all but threw his arms up in exasperation at being at a dead end in trying to get Tehran to restore full transparency over its suspicious nuclear activities.With all of the many fronts it can act on, and while neither Israel nor the US has a silver bullet answer for how to resolve the threats posed by Iran, except the nuclear front, Jerusalem and Washington DC seem to have the upper hand.On the nuclear front, they have not come to a strategy of how to halt Iran’s nuclear enrichment now for around three years running. There, America and the Jewish state for now seem to have sufficed with a threat to attack if Iran tries to cross the line to finalize production of a nuclear weapon.Yet, on the other fronts, far more senior Iranian officials and critical assets, and those of their proxies, are going up in smoke than on the Israeli and American side.The question that is still unanswered is: how to return stability to the region in a way that will leave Israeli security improved to avoid the possibility of another October 7 or similar repeat.

This came after the assassination on December 26, also attributed to Israel, of Sayyed Reza Mousavi, a senior commander in the IRGC. That assassination was also in the vicinity of the Syrian capital of Damascus.Mousavi was even senior to Omidvar and was responsible for coordinating the financing and logistics of transferring weapons from Tehran to proxies in Syria.

A 'price tag' for IranBut the attacks are likely also a “price tag” for the Islamic Republic to make it pay for its sponsorship of Hamas and Hezbollah.Even though the ayatollahs had no direct connection to the October 7 Hamas invasion of Israel, Iran provided funding, logistics help, and training for Gaza’s terrorist rulers for years, and since the conflict started has ordered attacks on Israel by Hezbollah in Lebanon, proxies in Syria, and the Houthis of Yemen.

ZCOB22YEYP_6XM5TOSLB17XYJG,Why is Netanyahu clashing with the US over a Palestinian state? - analysis,HERB KEINON,"JANUARY 21, 2024 21:58",20240121,jpost.com,https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-783123,"There is something surreal about all the renewed talk of a Palestinian state.Less than four months after Hamas launched a savage attack on Israel – killing 1,200 people, taking 240 people hostage, destroying communities, raping women, mutilating bodies, and sparking a significant war – news sites are reporting on the tension between Washington and Jerusalem over a two-state solution.Suddenly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is talking about a pathway toward two states as a condition for a broad, new Middle East structure that will have Saudi Arabia formalizing ties with Israel. Suddenly, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after discussing the issue with US President Joe Biden, is saying a Palestinian state will never happen under his watch. Suddenly, five senators are announcing that they are in favor of conditioning emergency supplemental aid to Israel on Netanyahu, reaffirming support for a Palestinian state.  A war between Israel and the 'Palestinian State of Gaza'A few weeks ago, former National Security Council head Giora Eiland said that one of Israel’s public diplomacy errors since October 7 was casting this war as one between Israel and Hamas.Wrong, he said; this is a war between the State of Israel and the Palestinian State of Gaza. Since Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005, that strip of land has been under the Palestinians’ exclusive control, first by the Palestinian Authority and then, as a result of a bloody coup in 2007, by Hamas.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden (credit: REUTERS/KEVIN LAMARQUE AND ALEX KOLOMOISKY/POOL)For nearly two decades, Israel has not controlled Gaza, has not ruled there, has had no say over the government that the Palestinians themselves voted in, and has been unable to prevent the build-up of a small army with significant capabilities.The Palestinians had a mini-state in Gaza, and in Ariel Sharon’s original conception, when he prompted Israel’s withdrawal from the area, this was to be a test case as to whether that state could eventually extend to the West Bank as well. AdvertisementOn October 7, Israel saw how well that worked out, and what this mini-Palestinian state had wrought. Israelis saw what a Palestinian entity, fed on fanatical ideology, was able to accomplish. Israelis saw what this Palestinian entity was, what it sanctified, what it worked for, what it dreamed of, and what it was capable of carrying out.And what they saw is not something that will encourage them to say in the future, “Hey, this worked great; let’s duplicate it elsewhere.”Or, as no less a one-time two-state advocate than President Isaac Herzog said Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, “If you ask an average Israeli now about his or her mental state, nobody in his right mind is willing now to think about what will be the solution of the peace agreements.”Israelis, he said, have “lost trust in the peace processes because they see that terror is glorified by our neighbors.”In other words, for the vast majority of Israelis right now, talking about a two-state solution – while the hostages are still being held, while Israel is fighting on various fronts, and while Palestinian polls are giving Hamas a staggering amount of support in the West Bank – is just a pipe dream.Elections in Israel, US dictating Palestinian state talkSO WHY is all the Palestinian state talk re-percolating? Because of elections, both in Israel and the US.In the US, Biden knows Israel, knows what Israel suffered on October 7, and knows that Israel is in no mood now for the creation of a Palestinian state. As Blinken himself said at Davos, “It’s hard to overstate the psychological impact on the country as a whole of what happened on that day.”Yet Biden, Blinken, and the White House’s national security spokesman, John Kirby, continue to discuss it. Tellingly, however, they are not talking about it as something lurking just around the corner. As Kirby said in a briefing on Friday, Biden, in conversation with Netanyahu the night before, “reiterated his strong conviction in the viability of a two-state solution – understanding, of course, that we’re not going to get there tomorrow, that there’s an active conflict going on, and that we want to make sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself.”Biden himself said something telling over the weekend when quizzed about Netanyahu’s rejection of a two-state solution at a press conference Thursday night. Biden said that “there are a number of types of two-state solutions,” and that “there are a number of countries that are members of the UN that still do not have their own military.”Back in 2009, when Netanyahu accepted the contours of a two-state solution in his famous Bar-Ilan speech, he stressed that this state must both recognize Israel as a Jewish state and be demilitarized. Over the years, this position morphed into talk about a “state-minus,” meaning the Palestinians will have all the powers to govern themselves and none of the powers to threaten Israel, and that security will have to remain in Israel’s hands.By saying that “there are a number of types of two-state solutions,” and that not all countries need a military, Biden – knowingly or not – seemed to be inching in that direction.But if this is something that is not going to happen any time soon, why is the Biden administration pushing the idea at all right now? The November elections play a role.Remember when a few months ago, before October 7, there was a great deal of discussion about Biden brokering a major Mideast deal that would have the Saudis normalize ties with Israel? One of the explanations for the timing back then was that Biden hoped to pull off a major foreign policy coup before the November election that could assist him in securing a re-election.Hamas tried to destroy that possibility with its October 7 attack, but the administration is now trying to revive it.This explains all the recent chatter about Saudi Arabia’s willingness to still consider a deal with Israel if a Palestinian state is part of the package. And Biden’s political calculation remains the same: being able to revitalize the plan could help him in November, and dangling out the prospect of a Palestinian state could help him retain those in his party who are furious over his support of Israel during the war.Likewise, the issue is being used for political gain in Israel as well.This came out clearly at Netanyahu’s Thursday press conference when he said that only he could prevent the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state. “Those who speak of the day after Netanyahu are talking about the creation of a Palestinian state, led by the Palestinian Authority,” he warned.“Israel needs security control [over] all territory west of the Jordan [River],” Netanyahu said. “This collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can you do?”He said that Israel’s prime minister “needs to be capable of saying no to our friends,” leaving the impression that only he can do so.NO NEW DATE has been given for early elections, but Netanyahu’s turning this into an issue – even publicly turning this into a point of contention with the White House – is an indication that he is getting ready for a campaign. If, in the past, one of Netanyahu’s tickets was presenting himself as Mr. Security, as the person that the country could rely on to keep it safe, after October 7, that argument has lost its resonance. He needs a new ticket, and preventing a Palestinian state is the one he seems to have chosen.

Because of elections, both in Israel and the US.In the US, Biden knows Israel, knows what Israel suffered on October 7, and knows that Israel is in no mood now for the creation of a Palestinian state. As Blinken himself said at Davos, “It’s hard to overstate the psychological impact on the country as a whole of what happened on that day.”Yet Biden, Blinken, and the White House’s national security spokesman, John Kirby, continue to discuss it. Tellingly, however, they are not talking about it as something lurking just around the corner. As Kirby said in a briefing on Friday, Biden, in conversation with Netanyahu the night before, “reiterated his strong conviction in the viability of a two-state solution – understanding, of course, that we’re not going to get there tomorrow, that there’s an active conflict going on, and that we want to make sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself.”Biden himself said something telling over the weekend when quizzed about Netanyahu’s rejection of a two-state solution at a press conference Thursday night. Biden said that “there are a number of types of two-state solutions,” and that “there are a number of countries that are members of the UN that still do not have their own military.”Back in 2009, when Netanyahu accepted the contours of a two-state solution in his famous Bar-Ilan speech, he stressed that this state must both recognize Israel as a Jewish state and be demilitarized. Over the years, this position morphed into talk about a “state-minus,” meaning the Palestinians will have all the powers to govern themselves and none of the powers to threaten Israel, and that security will have to remain in Israel’s hands.By saying that “there are a number of types of two-state solutions,” and that not all countries need a military, Biden – knowingly or not – seemed to be inching in that direction.But if this is something that is not going to happen any time soon, why is the Biden administration pushing the idea at all right now? The November elections play a role.Remember when a few months ago, before October 7, there was a great deal of discussion about Biden brokering a major Mideast deal that would have the Saudis normalize ties with Israel? One of the explanations for the timing back then was that Biden hoped to pull off a major foreign policy coup before the November election that could assist him in securing a re-election.Hamas tried to destroy that possibility with its October 7 attack, but the administration is now trying to revive it.This explains all the recent chatter about Saudi Arabia’s willingness to still consider a deal with Israel if a Palestinian state is part of the package. And Biden’s political calculation remains the same: being able to revitalize the plan could help him in November, and dangling out the prospect of a Palestinian state could help him retain those in his party who are furious over his support of Israel during the war.Likewise, the issue is being used for political gain in Israel as well.This came out clearly at Netanyahu’s Thursday press conference when he said that only he could prevent the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state. “Those who speak of the day after Netanyahu are talking about the creation of a Palestinian state, led by the Palestinian Authority,” he warned.“Israel needs security control [over] all territory west of the Jordan [River],” Netanyahu said. “This collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can you do?”He said that Israel’s prime minister “needs to be capable of saying no to our friends,” leaving the impression that only he can do so.NO NEW DATE has been given for early elections, but Netanyahu’s turning this into an issue – even publicly turning this into a point of contention with the White House – is an indication that he is getting ready for a campaign. If, in the past, one of Netanyahu’s tickets was presenting himself as Mr. Security, as the person that the country could rely on to keep it safe, after October 7, that argument has lost its resonance. He needs a new ticket, and preventing a Palestinian state is the one he seems to have chosen.
The Palestinians had a mini-state in Gaza, and in Ariel Sharon’s original conception, when he prompted Israel’s withdrawal from the area, this was to be a test case as to whether that state could eventually extend to the West Bank as well.

One of the explanations for the timing back then was that Biden hoped to pull off a major foreign policy coup before the November election that could assist him in securing a re-election.Hamas tried to destroy that possibility with its October 7 attack, but the administration is now trying to revive it.This explains all the recent chatter about Saudi Arabia’s willingness to still consider a deal with Israel if a Palestinian state is part of the package. And Biden’s political calculation remains the same: being able to revitalize the plan could help him in November, and dangling out the prospect of a Palestinian state could help him retain those in his party who are furious over his support of Israel during the war.Likewise, the issue is being used for political gain in Israel as well.This came out clearly at Netanyahu’s Thursday press conference when he said that only he could prevent the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state. “Those who speak of the day after Netanyahu are talking about the creation of a Palestinian state, led by the Palestinian Authority,” he warned.“Israel needs security control [over] all territory west of the Jordan [River],” Netanyahu said. “This collides with the idea of sovereignty. What can you do?”He said that Israel’s prime minister “needs to be capable of saying no to our friends,” leaving the impression that only he can do so.NO NEW DATE has been given for early elections, but Netanyahu’s turning this into an issue – even publicly turning this into a point of contention with the White House – is an indication that he is getting ready for a campaign. If, in the past, one of Netanyahu’s tickets was presenting himself as Mr. Security, as the person that the country could rely on to keep it safe, after October 7, that argument has lost its resonance. He needs a new ticket, and preventing a Palestinian state is the one he seems to have chosen.
In the US, Biden knows Israel, knows what Israel suffered on October 7, and knows that Israel is in no mood now for the creation of a Palestinian state. As Blinken himself said at Davos, “It’s hard to overstate the psychological impact on the country as a whole of what happened on that day.”Yet Biden, Blinken, and the White House’s national security spokesman, John Kirby, continue to discuss it. Tellingly, however, they are not talking about it as something lurking just around the corner. As Kirby said in a briefing on Friday, Biden, in conversation with Netanyahu the night before, “reiterated his strong conviction in the viability of a two-state solution – understanding, of course, that we’re not going to get there tomorrow, that there’s an active conflict going on, and that we want to make sure Israel has what it needs to defend itself.”Biden himself said something telling over the weekend when quizzed about Netanyahu’s rejection of a two-state solution at a press conference Thursday night. Biden said that “there are a number of types of two-state solutions,” and that “there are a number of countries that are members of the UN that still do not have their own military.”Back in 2009, when Netanyahu accepted the contours of a two-state solution in his famous Bar-Ilan speech, he stressed that this state must both recognize Israel as a Jewish state and be demilitarized.

Is what happens at my school a field-wide trend or unique to my school? How do I know what salary I should be asking for the position I’m negotiating? Are there tuition affordability models that I should be considering for my school? How are others handling the Israeli students who have enrolled since October 7? Those questions, and many more, are ones that we have researched.Borrowing the Qualtrics model, Prizmah strategically focuses on Operational (O) and Experience (X) data. Examples of O data are school financial, operational, enrollment, and development metrics. These are usually derived from objective, measurable processes. X data, on the other hand, is how people think and feel. It’s about the human experience. The most effective leaders look to both O and X data to inform their strategic decision-making. We help day school leaders access and learn from both through three avenues of support that we provide.   Data-driven decision-making for school leaders: Day school leaders steeped in their school’s finances may find themselves or their boards asking for comparative school data. How much do other schools budget for financial aid? What percent of revenue should come from net tuition and other revenue sources? How much are similar schools spending on teacher professional development?The answers to these questions lay in O data. Benchmarking operational data helps schools understand how peer schools are performing and their areas of strength and growth. School leaders look at salary ranges while considering their staff’s salaries and raises. Technology concept with cyber security internet and networking - encrypted data (credit: FLICKR)Advancement data enables development professionals to set fundraising goals. Admission professionals compare their yield rate, acceptance rate, and attrition rate to peer schools. The data can show schools where they have room for growth, which helps determine priorities and how they can be focusing their time most effectively. Heads of school, executive directors, COOs, and CFOs use the data to understand where their tuition stands in the marketplace, how much other schools spend on salaries (as a percentage of their budget), and what percent of revenue comes from tuition and other sources.This year, 120 US Jewish day schools entered data into DASL (Data Analysis for School Leadership), accessing free custom benchmarking data to help with some of those hard strategic financial decisions.  AdvertisementLandscape researchLandscape research for the field: In conversations with school leaders, we know that there are broader issues and trends at play that impact schools. Prizmah conducts landscape research for Jewish day-school professionals, lay leaders, funders, and day-school adjacent organizations with field-wide data that can shape informed perspectives on our field. Landscape research helps us understand those issues, offering a holistic understanding of the school environment and empowering informed decision-making. Through landscape research we can identify and name challenges, leading to problem-solving and equipping school leaders with critical information that can help schools adapt and serve as a valuable tool for long-term planning. Driven by emergent issues in the field, Prizmah conducts pulse surveys throughout the year to surface specific trends and in-depth qualitative data. RECENT PULSE surveys have focused on the impact of the war in Israel on day-school enrollment and development. These pulse surveys help school leaders understand what decisions other schools are making and how their experience is the same or differs from other schools. They also help the broader community understand aspects of day schools that they don’t usually have a window to. According to this research, 95% of schools that responded had received inquiries and/or enrollment from temporary Israeli students, and some schools are seeing an increase in inquiries from public and independent-school transfer students. An earlier pulse survey identified additional support schools needed to assist these students, influencing funders’ decisions to extend financial assistance to the schools. Our in-depth qualitative research captures the experiences of specific day-school stakeholders. By shining a light on specific areas of focus, such as the experiences of board members (executive summary, 2020, “Unlocking Leadership: Obstacles and Opportunities for Improved Day School Volunteer Leadership”) we have learned what the obstacles and opportunities are.  Seizing the moment: Transferring to Jewish Day School During COVID-19 homed in on the experiences of parents who transferred their kids to day school during the pandemic, offering a distinctive perspective on how parents make decisions about what school their children attend.  Modeling data-driven decision-making: At Prizmah, we model what it means to be a data-driven organization by using data to craft organizational strategy, define programmatic goals, and evaluate and measure impact. After webinars, cohort programs, and gatherings, we solicit participant feedback through surveys and use that data to inform and improve future offerings. We utilize school data, collected from DASL, pulse surveys and other research to make strategic decisions. We envision a world where day school leaders seamlessly integrate X and O data and research into their practice to enhance their effectiveness as leaders, sustaining vibrant Jewish education for our community. As we look to the horizon, we are dreaming of more ways to support schools with data and research with parent and staff satisfaction surveys that will link the experience side of schools with the operation side of schools.  The integration of robust data analysis and strategic research offers a powerful toolkit for school leaders. Armed with these insights, leaders can navigate the intricate landscape of education with precision, making informed decisions that lead to better outcomes for their school community.

As we look to the horizon, we are dreaming of more ways to support schools with data and research with parent and staff satisfaction surveys that will link the experience side of schools with the operation side of schools.  The integration of robust data analysis and strategic research offers a powerful toolkit for school leaders. Armed with these insights, leaders can navigate the intricate landscape of education with precision, making informed decisions that lead to better outcomes for their school community.

Landscape research for the field: In conversations with school leaders, we know that there are broader issues and trends at play that impact schools. Prizmah conducts landscape research for Jewish day-school professionals, lay leaders, funders, and day-school adjacent organizations with field-wide data that can shape informed perspectives on our field. Landscape research helps us understand those issues, offering a holistic understanding of the school environment and empowering informed decision-making. Through landscape research we can identify and name challenges, leading to problem-solving and equipping school leaders with critical information that can help schools adapt and serve as a valuable tool for long-term planning. Driven by emergent issues in the field, Prizmah conducts pulse surveys throughout the year to surface specific trends and in-depth qualitative data. RECENT PULSE surveys have focused on the impact of the war in Israel on day-school enrollment and development. These pulse surveys help school leaders understand what decisions other schools are making and how their experience is the same or differs from other schools. They also help the broader community understand aspects of day schools that they don’t usually have a window to. According to this research, 95% of schools that responded had received inquiries and/or enrollment from temporary Israeli students, and some schools are seeing an increase in inquiries from public and independent-school transfer students. An earlier pulse survey identified additional support schools needed to assist these students, influencing funders’ decisions to extend financial assistance to the schools. Our in-depth qualitative research captures the experiences of specific day-school stakeholders. By shining a light on specific areas of focus, such as the experiences of board members (executive summary, 2020, “Unlocking Leadership: Obstacles and Opportunities for Improved Day School Volunteer Leadership”) we have learned what the obstacles and opportunities are.  Seizing the moment: Transferring to Jewish Day School During COVID-19 homed in on the experiences of parents who transferred their kids to day school during the pandemic, offering a distinctive perspective on how parents make decisions about what school their children attend.  Modeling data-driven decision-making: At Prizmah, we model what it means to be a data-driven organization by using data to craft organizational strategy, define programmatic goals, and evaluate and measure impact.

The US, Qatar, and Egypt are spearheading efforts for a hostage deal and a ceasefire.  Sinwar is believed to be hiding deep underground in Hamas's southern Gazan tunnels complex, surrounded by Nukhba commandos who led attacks on October 7, and with Israeli hostages, using them as human shields as the IDF's noose tightens.

It is estimated that Israel has eliminated around one-quarter of Hamas's military force, according to the WSJ.On the other hand, Hamas's political leadership, including Haniyeh, which is based in the Qatari capital, Doha, has continued to engage in talks with Qatar and Egypt, aiming to secure Hamas's relevance in the rule of post-war Gaza. This leadership has also expressed a willingness to demilitarize in Gaza, a stance strongly opposed by Sinwar, as indicated by Egyptian officials, the WSJ stated.  AdvertisementIsrael remains steadfast in opposing any role for Hamas in a future Gaza government, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has attempted to rule out allowing the Fatah-controlled Palestinian Authority to rule in Gaza.
