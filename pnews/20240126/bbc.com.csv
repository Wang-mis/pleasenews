0492476NWJ_73Z0LWYSVBXLH8L,Lancaster church marks slave trade link with sculptures of girl,By Stuart Pollitt & Rumeana Jahangir,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-68032243,"The vicar of Lancaster says her church wants to be ""honest"" about its links to the slave trade, as it hosts sculptures of an 11-year-old enslaved girl.
The Rev Leah Vasey-Saunders said depictions of Sophia Fileen, baptised at Lancaster Priory in 1799, was ""part of our journey"" in addressing history.
The church has also chosen not to remove graffiti about its slave trade links from a protest in 2020.
Lancaster was the fourth largest UK port in the transatlantic slave trade.
Three sculptures of Sophia are now being displayed in collaboration with arts organisation Facing the Past, which works to ""redress omissions"" in how Lancaster has marked its part in the trade.
Lancaster Priory said it wanted to highlight the ""crimes against humanity"" by people associated with the church.
Lancaster Priory - along with other churches - is among several British institutions examining their links to the transatlantic slave trade, including the Royal Family, banks and universities.
Ms Vasey-Saunders told BBC North West Tonight it was ""really important that we are telling stories about the past"".
Referring to her church, she said: ""It's something that we want to acknowledge, we don't want to hide it. We want to be honest about it.""
Ms Vasey-Saunders said visitors sometimes asked why the sculptures were being hosted in the church.
""The minute you say these are part of our journey in addressing the history that we have in connection with transatlantic slavery, people go, 'Ah, oh yeah, that makes perfect sense.'""
Schoolchildren from Sierra Leone - from where it is believed more than 400,000 people were kidnapped and taken as part of the transatlantic slave trade - were involved in making three sculptures of Sophia.
The young girl was among at least 76 black Africans on the church registers.
She was baptised on 15 February 1799, recorded as ""a negro aged 11 years of Lancaster"".
One of the children involved in the sculpture project said she was ""very excited because I was able to be part of making memories of Sophia"".
Sam Ud-din, from Facing the Past, added they were involved in other schemes to ""improve the education"" in Lancaster's schools, and were also considering developing the city's current walking trail about the slave trade.
""We've been looking at whether or not there should be permanent new monuments,"" he added.

0FPAA1DKQH_LQ52VTUOAHS1NV9,French police officer cleared of insulting sex crime victim,_,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68095693,"A French policeman who called a female sexual assault complainant a ""whore"" has been let off by a police court.
The incident happened in February 2022 when the woman filed her complaint at a Paris police station.
The officer later rang her and left a voicemail message about paperwork but his insults were accidentally recorded after he thought he had hung up.
The case sparked criticism about the way victims of sexual abuse are treated by police in France.
During the hearing, the court was to asked consider that the officer made the insults to himself or to his colleagues, and that they were not aimed directly at the woman.
It was requested that the officer be acquitted or be given an exemption due to his previous exemplary record.
A female judge ruled that the comments had not amounted to a sexist insult and acquitted the officer.
The woman's lawyer, Arie Alimi, told the AFP news agency that her client would appeal.
""The judiciary continues to protect police officers,"" she said.
The officer, who was suspended for four months and then transferred, apologised to the woman during the trail - saying he was ""really sorry"" she heard the ""unfortunate comments"".
He also said that he had to beg Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin to keep his job.
Mr Darmanin was among those to express outrage over the case, saying at the time it came to light that the officer no longer had a place in the police.
He told the Europe 1 radio station in February 2022 that the man had ""smeared all the women who try to file a complaint, when it is in our best interest to tell them to come to the police stations to do so"".
Mr Darmanin also said the officer had also ""dirtied and spat on the uniform of the Republic and his 250,000 other police and gendarme colleagues"".
The woman's original assault complaint is being investigated, French media group bfmtv reported.

0OJUV3DGWE_RNSJL7W1BJZCR4V,Asante Gold: UK to loan back Ghana's looted 'crown jewels',By Katie Razzall,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68066877,"The UK is sending some of Ghana's ""crown jewels"" back home, 150 years after looting them from the court of the Asante king.
A gold peace pipe is among 32 items returning under long-term loan deals, the BBC can reveal.
The Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) is lending 17 pieces and 15 are from the British Museum.
Ghana's chief negotiator said he hoped for ""a new sense of cultural co-operation"" after generations of anger.
Some national museums in the UK - including the V&A and the British Museum - are banned by law from permanently giving back contested items in their collections, and loan deals such as this are seen as a way to allow objects to return to their countries of origin.
But some countries laying claim to disputed artefacts fear that loans may be used to imply they accept the UK's ownership.
Tristram Hunt, director of the V&A, told the BBC that the gold items of court regalia are the equivalent of ""our Crown Jewels"".
The items to be loaned, most of which were taken during 19th-Century wars between the British and the Asante, include a sword of state and gold badges worn by officials charged with cleansing the soul of the king.
Mr Hunt said when museums hold ""objects with origins in war and looting in military campaigns, we have a responsibility to the countries of origin to think about how we can share those more fairly today.
""It doesn't seem to me that all of our museums will fall down if we build up these kind of partnerships and exchanges.""
However, Mr Hunt insisted the new cultural partnership ""is not restitution by the back door"" - meaning it is not a way to return permanent ownership back to Ghana.
The three-year loan agreements, with an option to extend for a further three years, are not with the Ghanaian government but with Otumfo Osei Tutu II - the current Asante king known as the Asantehene - who attended the Coronation of King Charles last year.
The Asantehene still holds an influential ceremonial role, although his kingdom is now part of Ghana's modern democracy.
The items will go on display at the Manhyia Palace Museum in Kumasi, the capital of the Asante region, to celebrate the Asantehene's silver jubilee.
The Asante gold artefacts are the ultimate symbol of the Asante royal government and are believed to be invested with the spirits of former Asante kings.
They have an importance to Ghana comparable to the Benin Bronzes - thousands of sculptures and plaques looted by Britain from the palace of the Kingdom of Benin, in modern-day southern Nigeria. Nigeria has been calling for their return for decades.
Nana Oforiatta Ayim, special adviser to Ghana's culture minister, told the BBC: ""They're not just objects, they have spiritual importance as well. They are part of the soul of the nation. It's pieces of ourselves returning.""
She said the loan was ""a good starting point"" on the anniversary of the looting and ""a sign of some kind of healing and commemoration for the violence that happened"".
UK museums hold many more items taken from Ghana, including a gold trophy head that is among the most famous pieces of Asante regalia.
The Asante built what was once one of the most powerful and formidable states in west Africa, trading in, among others, gold, textiles and enslaved people.
The kingdom was famed for its military might and wealth. Even now, when the Asantehene shakes hands on official occasions, he can be so weighed down with heavy gold bracelets that he sometimes has an aide whose job is to support his arm.
Europeans were attracted to what they later named the Gold Coast by the stories of African wealth and Britain fought repeated battles with the Asante in the 19th Century.
In 1874 after an Asante attack, British troops launched a ""punitive expedition"", in the colonial language of the time, ransacking Kumasi and taking many of the palace treasures.
Most of the items the V&A is returning were bought at an auction on 18 April 1874 at Garrards, the London jewellers who maintain the UK's Crown Jewels.
They include three heavy cast-gold items known as soul washers' badges (Akrafokonmu), which were worn around the necks of high ranking officials at court who were responsible for cleansing the soul of the king.
Angus Patterson, a senior curator at the V&A, said taking these items in the 19th Century ""was not simply about acquiring wealth, although that is a part of it. It's also about removing the symbols of government or the symbols of authority. It's a very political act"".
The British Museum is also returning on loan a total of 15 items, some of them looted during a later conflict in 1895-96, including a sword of state known as the Mpomponsuo.
There is also a ceremonial cap, known as a Denkyemke, richly decorated with gold ornaments. It was worn by senior courtiers at coronations and other major festivals.
The British Museum is also lending a cast-gold model lute-harp (Sankuo), which was not looted, to highlight its almost 200-year-old connection with the Asantehenes.
The sankuo was presented to the British writer and diplomat Thomas Bowdich in 1817, who said it was intended as a gift from the Asantehene to the museum to demonstrate the wealth and status of the Asante nation.
Can you loan objects back to a country that says you stole them?
It's a solution to UK legal restrictions that may not be acceptable to countries which say they want to right a historic wrong.
The issue of the Parthenon Sculptures, or Elgin Marbles as they were named in the UK, is the best-known example.
Greece has long demanded the return of these classical sculptures that are displayed in the British Museum. Its chair of trustees, George Osborne, recently said that he was looking for a ""practical, pragmatic and rational way forward"" and was exploring a partnership that, in essence, puts the question of who actually owns the classical sculptures to one side.
This agreement with the Asantehene is another version of that; a compromise that works for the Asante king and is possible within the parameters of British law.
Just as Nigeria would be unlikely to accept a loan of the Benin Bronzes, it would have been difficult for Ghana's government to accept this kind of agreement.
But Mr Hunt said the deals between the V&A, the British Museum and the Manhyia Palace Museum ""cut through the politics. It doesn't solve the problem, but it begins the conversation"".
Ms Oforiatta Ayim, the Ghana culture minister's adviser, said ""of course"" people will be angry at the idea of a loan and they hoped to see items eventually returned permanently to Ghana.
""We know the objects were stolen in violent circumstances, we know the items belong to the Asante people,"" she said.
The British government has a ""retain and explain"" stance for state-owned institutions, which means contested objects are kept and their context is explained.
Neither the Conservative nor Labour parties have signalled any interest in changing current legislation. The British Museum Act of 1963 and the National Heritage Act of 1983 prevent museum trustees at some high-profile institutions from ""deaccessioning"" items in their collections.
Mr Hunt is advocating a change in the law. He would like to see ""more freedom for museums, but then a kind of backstop, a committee where we would have to appeal if we wanted to restitute items"".
Some have raised concerns this would mean British museums losing some of their most prized items in future. Or as a previous culture secretary, Michelle Donelan, put it to me in relation to a return of the Parthenon Sculptures, that it would ""open the gateway to the question of the entire contents of our museums"".
But Mr Hunt said the ownership of very few of the V&A's collection of 2.8 million items has been disputed.
Another fear is that contested items that go on loan will never be returned.
Ghana's chief negotiator Ivor Agyeman-Duah scotched that. ""You stick to agreements that you have, you don't go against them,"" he said.
There are other beautiful Asante gold items in the UK. The Wallace Collection includes the trophy head which is among the most famous Asante treasures. It too was taken by British forces and bought at the 1874 auction.
The Royal Collection also holds objects including another gold trophy head in the form of a mask. This type of item represented defeated enemies; the trophies were attached by a hoop to ceremonial swords in the state regalia.
Will they ever be on show in Ghana in future? Mr Agyeman-Duah is taking it one step at a time.
But as Britain is increasingly confronting the cultural legacy of its colonial past, these types of agreements may be a diplomatic and practical way to address the past and create better relationships in the future - if both sides can accept the terms.

0OU12NPXNO_33JR83RGV2CVL5S,Boris Nadezhdin: Putin's would-be opponent vows to end Ukraine war,By Robert Greenall,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68095968,"This video can not be played
Watch: 'Putin has made mistakes', Kremlin challenger says in BBC exclusive
A would-be challenger to Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he would end the war in Ukraine on day one of his presidency.
Boris Nadezhdin told the BBC he was unlikely to win 17 March elections but Mr Putin would not last six more years.
But he offered a vision of a Russia without the incumbent, where conflicts would end and relations were restored.
""Putin has made a lot of mistakes, not just with the special military operation,"" Mr Nadezhdin says.
Mr Putin has headed Russia since the beginning of the millennium, his rule becoming increasingly authoritarian.
He has won several presidential elections comfortably, but in recent years no serious opposition has been allowed. The Kremlin maintains that elections are fair and he is genuinely popular.
Opposition leader Alexey Navalny, once seen as a major threat to the president's authority, has been in jail since 2021.
Other opponents have been assassinated, jailed, or forced into exile.
But Mr Nadezhdin, a local councillor for more than three decades, is seen as a former insider of the regime whose criticism of the Kremlin has so far been tolerated.
His team says he has gathered more than 100,000 signatures, enough to stand as a candidate.
He believes he will be allowed to stand in the elections, although unconfirmed sources say anti-war candidates will be barred.
This was the case with former TV journalist Yekaterina Duntsova, whose candidacy was blocked in December.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday that Mr Nadezhdin was not seen as a rival but would be allowed to stand if he met the necessary conditions.
The veteran politician says he has been criticising Mr Putin for the last 10 years.
""He practically destroyed the key institutions of the modern state of Russia. My job will be to restore these institutions,"" said Mr Nadezhdin.
""My first task will be to stop the conflict with Ukraine, and then to restore normal relations between Russia and the Western community.""
Mr Nadezhdin, who name is similar to ""nadezhda"", the Russian word for hope, said he had the support of ""dozens of millions of people"".
""There is a Russian saying - your appetite comes when you start eating,"" he says.
He said that as recently as two weeks ago, no-one would have believed he could collect enough signatures.
""My aim is to change Russia. I may not be president on 17 March but I should have the best result.""
He said that at the start of the war only 15-20% of people were against it but now the ""majority of Russians"" wanted peace.
He said he aimed to make Russia a ""great, peaceful and free country"".
""I am absolutely sure that Putin will not rule Russia six years more, because more and more people understand he is dragging Russia along the track of militarism, authoritarianism, isolation,"" Mr Nadezhdin says.

The US and UK have conducted a fresh series of joint air strikes against eight Houthi targets in Yemen.
The strikes targeted an underground storage site and Houthi missile and surveillance capability, the Pentagon said.
The Iran-backed Houthis have been targeting ships they say are linked to Israel and the West that travel through the important Red Sea trade route.
The US and UK said they are trying to protect the ""free flow of commerce""."
1JL3EUSI6O_P7HAA0RQN993Z7H,Navy Seals presumed dead after anti-Houthi mission,By Kathryn Armstrong,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68053528,"Two US Navy Seals who went missing during an operation to seize Iranian-made weapons - bound for Houthis in Yemen - are now presumed dead, the US military says.
The incident took place on 11 January when commandos were boarding a ship off the coast of Somalia.
According to media reports, one was swept away and the second jumped in to save him.
US Central Command said attempts were being made to recover the bodies.
""We mourn the loss of our two Naval Special Warfare warriors, and we will forever honour their sacrifice and example,"" said the head of Central Command (Centcom), Gen Michael Erik Kurilla.
The US Navy identified the two as 27-year-old Navy Special Warfare Operator 2nd Class Nathan Gage Ingram and 37-year-old Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Christopher J Chambers.
Air and naval units from the US, Japan and Spain spent 10 days searching an area of more than 21,000 sq miles (54,000 sq km) to try to find the commandos, with the help of oceanographers and meteorologists.
Navy Seals are members of a specialist maritime military force responsible for tasks including reconnaissance and carrying out covert operations.
""These Seals represented the very best of our country, pledging their lives to protect their fellow Americans,"" US President Joe Biden said in a statement on Monday.
""Our hearts go out to the family members, loved ones, friends, and shipmates who are grieving for these two brave Americans.""
Military officials told the Associated Press the first Seal, Ingram, was swept into heavy seas during the night mission as they were boarding an unflagged dhow - a traditional sailing ship - where the weapons were discovered.
The second, Chambers, entered the water to try to save him.
Capt Blake L Chaney, commander of Naval Special Warfare Group 1, said in a statement that the two Navy Seals ""were exceptional warriors, cherished teammates, and dear friends to many within the Naval Special Warfare community"".
""Chris and Gage selflessly served their country with unwavering professionalism and exceptional capabilities,"" Capt Chaney said.
Centcom said last week that warheads for Houthi medium-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles, as well as parts for air defence systems, were among the items seized.
It added that initial analysis indicated the components were for missiles that have been used by the Iran-backed Houthis to target vessels travelling through the Red Sea recently.
The supply, sale and transfer of weapons to the Houthis is considered a violation of a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution, as well as international law.
Dozens of vessels have been targeted in the Houthi attacks, leading hundreds of cargo ships and tankers to be rerouted around the southern tip of Africa to avoid the strikes.
The Houthis, who support Hamas, say they are only targeting vessels with connections to Israel following the start of the war in Gaza. However, some of the ships they have hit have had no clear connection to Israel.
They have also begun attacking ships associated with the US and UK after both countries launched airstrikes against Houthi positions in Yemen in retaliation to the Red Sea attacks. The group controls the country's north, the capital Sanaa and the Red Sea coastline.
Both the US and UK say they are not seeking a conflict with the Houthis but are trying to protect the international trade route.

Lindsay O'Neill and her siblings have been awarded Â£250,000 in damages for the suffering endured by their late father.
John McGuinness was a resident at Nazareth Lodge from the age of five to seven.
His daughter said he had finally received justice.
""He's believed,"" Ms O'Neill told BBC News NI. ""That is the best thing that's come out of this.""
This video can not be played
'My father endured unimaginable abuse at children's home'
Mr McGuinness took legal action against the Sisters of Nazareth, the religious order that ran Nazareth Lodge on Ravenhill Road in south Belfast.
He died from a heart attack in 2020 at the age of 59 - before the case could reach its conclusion.
Last week, awarding damages, a High Court judge said Mr McGuinness's life had been ""blighted"" by the treatment he suffered at the children's home.
Mr McGuinness said a number of nuns assaulted him and alleged a handyman who worked at the home subjected him to regular sexual assaults in the toilets.
When contacted by BBC News NI, the Sisters of Nazareth said it had no comment.
Ms O'Neill, who took on her father's case after his death, said he was ""told if you tell anybody anything, bad things are going to happen to your mum"".
""The whole depravity of it all. Thinking that he was going to be kept safe. And it was actually nuns that did it. It's just awful.""
She said her father ""struggled a lot"" in life.
""I think when I got older and understood it, I realised my daddy's got problems because of what happened to him.
""Trying to get over it, daily. On a good day he was great. But we didn't get a chance to get a good day every day because of what he went through and experienced.""
Mrs O'Neill added: ""If that hadn't have happened to my daddy, he would have had a completely different life. We all would have. And they've robbed him of that.""
During the legal proceedings, the defendants argued that the form of alleged corporal punishment used when Mr McGuinness was a resident had been ""appropriate and commensurate to the accepted educational practices"".
Solicitor Claire McKeegan, who represented Mr McGuinness, told BBC News NI: ""His case was accepted by the court - he was believed in full, which was something that was so important to him the whole way along.
""He wanted to get justice, he wanted to get accountability and he wanted, like so many other survivors of historical institutional abuse, to be believed and vindicated.""
She said that while the Â£250,000 in damages awarded to Mr McGuinness' family may seem high, ""the sad thing is that it is recognition of the pain and suffering that John endured and carried throughout his life"".
""So it is not a windfall for his family. It is justice.""
Mr McGuinness's case is the latest to emerge from abuse carried out at children's homes in Northern Ireland.
The Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) Inquiry studied allegations of abuse in 22 homes and other residential institutions between 1922 to 1995.
These were facilities run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children's charity Barnardo's.
The public inquiry, led by the late Sir Anthony Hart, found that there was widespread abuse and mistreatment of young residents across the institutions.

1PPZGYCZ01_T79RVS22OEG71FI,Czech Republic MPs vote to tighten gun laws,By Rob Cameron,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68110357,"MPs in the Czech Republic have approved an amendment tightening gun legislation, a month after the worst mass shooting in the country's history.
The amendment - which was proposed before the killings - must still pass through the senate and be signed by the president, and will not come into force until 2026.
It's far from revolutionary. So would it even have made a difference?
When a 24-year-old graduate student with a history of depression shot dead 14 people at Charles University in December, he did so as a licenced gun user with eight legally-owned weapons.
Police believe his victims - students and staff - were killed with a pistol, but the shooter was also carrying an AR-10 semi-automatic assault rifle.
That gun became a symbol of the attack when he was captured on video with it, roaming the balustrade of the Arts Faculty and taking potshots at passers-by, injuring several.
Moments later he threw the rifle down to the cobbled pavement and turned yet another weapon - a shotgun - on himself.
It later transpired he had acquired seven of the weapons in quick succession in the spring of 2023. No-one questioned the purchases; he had no criminal record and he held a valid gun licence.
No alarm bells were rung, nor could they be. There is no central control mechanism to warn the police that someone is amassing an arsenal.
The gun licence had also been acquired relatively recently - and easily.
The application has to be signed by a doctor, but they are unlikely to have known about the man's reported history of psychiatric problems. These would have been treated by a psychiatrist with no legal obligation to inform the doctor of them.
The legal amendment - proposed long before the shooting - could close some of these loopholes. It envisages a revamped online register of both guns and their owners. Doctors - including psychiatrists - should have access to it.
Gun shops will be legally required to report purchases they deem suspicious. The system should also flag people acquiring numerous weapons.
Police will also be able to seize weapons as a precaution, for example if their owners make threats on social media. Remarkably it is not currently in their power to do so.
But there will still be no mandatory psychological tests to obtain a gun licence, as is common in other countries. Czech doctors can - but do not have to - request them before signing the form.
There may be further amendments toughening up the legislation on its journey through parliament. But they are almost certain to leave untouched the fundamental right to carry a weapon in the first place - an odd obsession in one of the safest countries in Europe.
In 2021, the Czech Constitution was amended to include the right to bear arms in self-defence after a massive petition campaign that was prompted by EU moves to limit the possession of weapons, including legal ones.
There are now more than 300,000 licenced gun owners - and more than a million guns - in the Czech Republic, a country of 10.7 million people.
The Czechs are a nation of deer and wild boar hunters - not to mention biathlon fans. But the vast majority of licences are granted for personal protection, not for hunting or competitive shooting.
Why they need them for the streets of Prague and Brno is unclear.

""It was devastating. Suddenly, I didn't have an income""
A County Fermanagh man has received Â£75,000 after his former employer settled an age discrimination case.
Seamus Gillespie, 62, worked for WD Irwin and Sons bakery from 1991 until he was made redundant in August 2022.
The case, supported by the Equality Commission, was settled without admission of liability by the company.
WD Irwin and Sons said it was strongly committed to equality and prided itself on its commitment to diversity in the workplace.
Mr Gillespie alleged he was told the company was looking for younger people from a blue-chip background in terms of future recruitment.
He believed the company thought the age of staff within the business was problematic.
""I knew that was leaving my position vulnerable,"" Mr Gillespie told BBC News NI.
The former sales manager further alleged that he was told he would lose certain accounts when the vacant position of business unit controller was filled.
This, he believed, led to a significant reduction in his workload, diminishing his role and leaving him vulnerable to potential future redundancy.
In August 2022, Mr Gillespie was informed of a project involving changes in distribution.
He believed he should have been included in relevant discussions because it impacted on his work.
The following month, Mr Gillespie was informed his position was at risk of redundancy, with him being the sole member of the redundancy pool.
During subsequent redundancy meetings, he alleged comments were made about the necessity of injecting ""new blood"" into the business and concerns were raised about the uniform age profile within the senior management team.
Despite his appeal, Mr Gillespie was ultimately made redundant.
""I was very happy working in the company. I loved what I was doing. I certainly had no plans to retire,"" he said.
""It was just devastating. All of a sudden that you didn't have an income, security. You didn't have any basic hope for the future.
""I worked for Irwins for over 30 years. I enjoyed my job, I was a dedicated, hardworking and loyal employee, with lots of experience.
""But it was very clear to me, following discussions with management, that my career with the company was over.""
""I'm glad my case is now settled, although I would rather that none of this had happened in the first place,"" he added.
""People of an age have a lot of experience and they can make very good decisions and be great mentors to people coming into the business.""
Chief commissioner Geraldine McGahey said Mr Gillespie ""still had a lot to offer"" his former employer.
""Seamus gave 30 years of his working life to Irwin's bakery. He felt that his age was a problem for his employer and believes that was why he was made redundant,"" she said.
""In Northern Ireland it is unlawful to discriminate against employees because of their age.
""Older workers have experience, skills and attributes that our economy needs to thrive. They are assets to their employers, just like every other employee.
""It is imperative that employers have robust policies and practices in place to prevent any potential instances of age discrimination and that staff are adequately trained to use them.""
In setting the case without admission, WD Irwin and Sons Ltd denied any liability.
It reaffirmed its ""strong commitment to the principle of equality"" and agreed to liaise with the commission to review policies, practices and procedures - an outcome that Mr Gillespie said he was ""heartened"" to hear.
""WD Irwin & Sons has always prided itself on its commitment to diversity in the workplace,"" a spokesperson said.

1WI9K4WEBG_9PNGGULPP1T67IL,Darya Trepova: Russian woman jailed for 27 years for cafe bomb killing,By Robert Greenall,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68095875,"Russian woman Darya Trepova has been sentenced to 27 years in jail for the killing of pro-war blogger Vladlen Tatarsky last April.
Tatarsky was killed by a bomb in a statuette Trepova gave him, as he was about to give a talk in St Petersburg. Dozens were injured in the blast.
Trepova, 26, denied the charges, saying she thought the statuette contained a listening device.
She said she had acted on the orders of a Ukrainian contact, and was set up.
The sentence is one of the harshest imposed on a woman in Russia's history.
The attack on Tatarsky, 40, (real name Maxim Fomin) happened on 2 April, 2023.
Trepova was charged with ""a terrorist act carried out by an organised group causing intentional death"" and the ""illegal possession of explosive devices by an organised group"".
Russian investigators have accused Ukraine of being behind the attack, and Ukrainian officials have neither confirmed nor denied this.
But Trepova gave evidence in court that she was following orders from a man in Ukraine known as Gestalt (German for ""shape""). His identity is not known.
She said she made contact with him via Ukraine-based journalist Roman Popkov. She is opposed to Russia's war in Ukraine and had been seeking to go there to work as a journalist.
Trepova said that under Gestalt's instruction she gained Tatarsky's trust, introducing herself to him as an art student named Anastasia Kriulina and attending his talks.
In March Gestalt sent her the statuette, she said, assuring her that it contained a wiretap and a tracker. She said she expressed concern that it might contain a bomb.
""I feel great pain and shame that my gullibility and my naivety led to such catastrophic consequences. I didn't want to hurt anyone,"" Trepova told the court this week, quoted by Reuters.
""I feel especial pain and shame that a terrorist act was carried out by my own hands.""
Tatarsky was a well-known blogger with more than half a million followers, and had a criminal past.
Born in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, he said he joined Russian-backed separatists when they released him from jail, where he was serving time for armed robbery.
He was part of a pro-Kremlin military blogger community that has taken on a relatively high-profile role since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.
Tatarsky was among those who have gone so far as to criticise the Russian authorities, slamming the military and even President Vladimir Putin for setbacks on the battlefield.
But he was posthumously awarded the Order of Courage by Mr Putin.
Trepova's sentencing comes just after another controversial pro-war figure, the former commander of Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine Igor Girkin, was sentenced to four years in jail for ""calls to carry out extremist activities"".

224HBKNJYX_N2PL0YH1SCV2XJ0,"In Ukraine's river war, drones mean nowhere is safe",By James Waterhouse,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67991772,"There are few places from where you can see Russian-occupied territory with the naked eye in Ukraine.
The western bank of the Dnipro river in the city of Kherson is one of them.
You can't see the Russian troops on the other low, marshy riverbank, but you know they're there.
Incoming artillery fire as we arrive at an abandoned building serves as a sharp reminder.
There is nothing new about shelling in war. But the unit we're meeting deals with one of the key innovations of this invasion: drones.
As we hug the side of the building and take cover in the stairwell, we're led inside from the freezing winter winds to the warmth of a militarised living room.
The smell of a strawberry vape hangs above these Ukrainian soldiers, sitting on armchairs with looks of quiet focus and cans of Monster energy drink. You imagine the floral wallpaper wasn't their choice.
Artem, a 20-year-old pilot, suddenly sits up. They're told the Russians have launched drones from across the water.
""It's from a location known to us,"" explains Tymur, commander of the Samosud squad in Ukraine's 11th National Guard Brigade.
""Our goal is to destroy the pilots. We have the coordinates, so we're flying there right now.""
There are at least a dozen drones on the floor - all loaded with grenades. A cat, the unit's unofficial mascot, nuzzles against one of the propellers.
One drone is taken outside as Artem puts on his VR headset.
We watch on the TV as he flies it across the river into occupied territory. From this vantage point, there are no obvious signs of life.
A few kilometres later, Artem's drone arrives at an industrial area. It passes a warehouse before hovering next to a block of flats.
He eventually spots an antenna next to a window in the stairwell, and flies straight into it. The screen turns blue. Artem exhales and removes his headset.
""When we first did this it was emotional,"" says Artem. ""Now this is business as usual.""
""I didn't get enough time to play computer games before [the full-scale invasion]. Now I'm catching up!""
They launch another drone but the screen turns blue as soon as it crosses the river. The Russians have turned on their jamming system.
A third then makes the same journey. This time it makes it through, and Artem returns to the block of flats.
He's able to confirm the antenna was destroyed. With 10 minutes of battery life left, he flies off to see what else he can detect, or destroy.
His unit has been targeting a main road which the Russians use to deliver supplies. Civilians are banned from driving there, so the Ukrainian drone pilots hit anything with wheels.
Artem spots a Russian checkpoint and flies towards it. Unfortunately for him, they use a jamming gun and the screen turns blue as he gets close. He exhales again.
""No matter how many times we hit the same places, [the Russians] are constantly replenished,"" says Tymur. ""They're kind of fearless.""
With each drone costing around $500 (Â£396), it's a constant cycle of launch, seek and destroy.
The returns however can be significant. Tymur says his team once destroyed an S-350 air defence missile system worth $136m.
Drones mean the Russians can't hide anywhere within 10km (six miles) of the front line.
But, crucially, the invaders are doing exactly the same to the Ukrainians.
Under constant drone surveillance and enemy bombardment, life has gradually drained from Kherson's streets. Aside from a limited crossing further up the Dnipro near the town of Krynky, Ukrainian attacks here are only probing, and require patience.
READ: Outnumbered and outgunned by Russians in brutal riverside battle
In a snow-covered park in Kherson, we meet a mobile air-defence team under an archway. We're told to move in small groups because of watching Russian drones.
As we stride forward in our body armour, dog-walkers turn away from us with a slight look of confusion.
""My call sign is King,"" says a unit deputy commander in the 124th Territorial Defence Brigade, with a fist bump. They're gathered around a UK-registered truck with a .50 calibre machine gun mounted on the back.
""We work 24/7,"" he says. ""We destroy all kinds of drones, mainly Iranian-made Shaheds.""
""Russia's factories are on a military footing. They are constantly increasing their power. At this point, it's relentless.""
So does King think Ukrainian forces could cross the river in large numbers this year?
""It's hard to think about,"" he replies. ""We're just doing our jobs to make sure it happens as soon as possible.""
With major military packages trapped under political disagreements in the US and European Union, Ukraine is having to adapt, and look inwards.
A new Â£2.5bn military aid package from the UK has been welcomed here, with Â£200m of that earmarked specifically for drones. But President Volodymyr Zelensky has also pledged to make a million of them within the borders of Ukraine.
On the outskirts of Kherson in an icy field, pilots practise drone flights with plastic bottles tied beneath them, in place of grenades.
It takes just 14 hours of training to qualify as a drone pilot. Ukraine's government is encouraging people to take part in free training, as well as to manufacture drones at home to send to the front.
Through his balaclava, Stitch explains their importance in this war of attrition.
""We are engaged in a struggle of technologies, an arms race: who will be the first to invent what, who will assemble something cool,"" the drone commander says.
It's widely accepted that several innovations now need to happen at once for the front lines to change significantly.
Ukraine's commander-in-chief Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyy told the Economist magazine in November that Russia and Ukraine had ""reached the level of technology that puts us into a stalemate"".
The problem for Ukraine has never been what has been supplied by allies, but when.
""During the First World War, aviation was born,"" says Stitch. ""Now we are starting the future war of drones, which maybe in two decades will turn the tide of any war.""

2DXMGJ3CN7_GZAIV6BGFM65DS6,Ghana coup plot: Soldiers among six sentenced to death by hanging,By Wycliffe Muia,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68090780,"Six Ghanaians, including three soldiers, have been sentenced to death by hanging for their involvement in a coup plot three years ago.
This was the first treason trial in Ghana since 1966 when post-independence leader Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown.
The six were arrested in 2021 while testing weapons in the capital, Accra, to allegedly topple the government.
The group, including a gunsmith, pleaded not guilty during a trial that captured the attention of the nation.
Defence lawyers said they would appeal against the ruling in the Supreme Court.
Three other people, including a senior police officer and two military officers, were acquitted.
There was a heavy security deployment outside the High Court in Accra during the sentencing on Wednesday.
The court found the six guilty of high treason and conspiracy to commit high treason.
The men were arrested with locally manufactured guns, improvised explosive devices and AK-47 rifles, according to court documents.
State prosecutors said the group had planned to organise protests, ostensibly to topple President Nana Akufo-Addo's government ahead of the 2020 general elections.
The court said it found the evidence against the men, including intercepted communications and testimonies, compelling.
Attorney General Godfred Yeboah Dame, who led the prosecution, praised the court verdict as ""significant"".
""The constitution of Ghana as the fundamental law of the country, which has sustained the stability of the nation, frowns seriously upon any attempt to overthrow a government and that is why that offence [treason] is punishable by death,"" Mr Dame said.
Ghana had last carried out an execution in 1992 when it returned to democratic rule.
Last year lawmakers last year voted to abolish the death penalty for ordinary crimes, replacing it with a life sentence.

2VGFQ8C96H_9M6BRP6L4IDQ6VN,Medibank hack: Russian sanctioned over Australia's worst data breach,By Tiffanie Turnbull,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-68064850,"A Russian man has been named and sanctioned for his role in Australia's worst data breach.
The personal information of 9.7m Australians was stolen from the country's largest health insurer, Medibank, in late 2022.
Sensitive documents, including abortion records, were then posted online.
The cyber sanctions - the first of their kind in Australia - include financial penalties and a travel ban for Aleksandr Ermakov.
Little has been made public about Mr Ermakov, but Australian intelligence authorities say he is part of the infamous Russian cyber-crime gang REvil - which has been linked to attacks across Europe, the US and UK.
Announcing the measures on Tuesday, Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil described the Medibank hack as ""the single most devastating cyber-attack we have experienced as a nation"".
""Literally millions of people having personal data about themselves, their family members, taken from them and cruelly placed online for others to see,"" she said.
""These people are cowards and scumbags... we'll unveil who you are and we'll make sure you're accountable.""
Authorities are still investigating the breach, Ms O'Neil added, and more people may face penalties.
It is the first time the government has used cyber sanctions legislation, passed in 2021, which applies financial punishments to people involved in significant online attacks.
Australia has faced a string of large data breaches in recent years, but few - if any - have rocked the country like the Medibank hack.
The cyber criminals had stolen login details which granted them access to all of Medibank's customer data - including the medical records of everyone from athletes and media figures to the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
They began posting the data online after the insurer - with the government's support - refused to pay a ransom.
They first released a set of files named ""good-list"" and ""naughty-list"" which contained, among other things, people's health claims data - including records of treatment for mental health or addiction - as well as names, addresses, birthdates, and government ID numbers.  Soon after they posted: ""added one more file abortions.csv..."", about some customer's end of pregnancy procedures.
Medibank at the time apologised for what it called the ""malicious weaponisation"" of private information, with CEO David Koczkaro warning that the data release could stop people from seeking medical assistance.
Several class actions - which argue the firms should have better protected such sensitive data - have since been launched.

3FE1ZBKS3G_V6BS6R5YONICXGP,Saudi Arabia to get first alcohol shop in more than 70 years,By Graeme Baker,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68085190,"Saudi Arabia has said it will open a shop in Riyadh selling alcohol to a select band of non-Muslim expats, the first to open in more than 70 years.
The clientele will be limited to diplomatic staff, who have for years imported booze in sealed official packages known as diplomatic pouches.
Saudi officials said the shop would counter ""the illicit trade of alcohol"".
Prohibition has been law since 1952, after one of King Abdulaziz's sons drunkenly shot dead a British diplomat.
The new store will be located in Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter west of the city centre, according to a document seen by the AFP and Reuters news agencies.
A source familiar with the plans told Reuters the shop was expected to open within weeks. There will be limitations, however:
However - according to the document seen by AFP - these will not be particularly stringent.
Patrons will be limited to 240 ""points"" of alcohol per month. One litre of spirits will be worth six points, one litre of wine three points and one litre of beer one point.
There are also no suggestions that the clientele will be widened to ""ordinary"" foreigners in the kingdom without diplomatic privileges, who officially have no access to alcohol.
While alcohol will become part of Riyadh life, drinkers would be wise to be mindful of where they drink and how they behave afterwards.
Under current Saudi law, penalties for consumption or possession of alcohol can include fines, jail time, public flogging and deportation for unauthorised foreigners.
The document also said authorities are planning a ""new regulatory framework"" that would also allow ""specific quantities"" of alcohol to be brought in by diplomats to ""put an end to... an uncontrolled exchange of such goods"", it added.
For years diplomatic staff have had to use their ""pouches"", which cannot be tampered with by authorities in their host country, to bring in limited amounts of alcohol.
The moves are the latest in a series of initiatives known as ""Vision 2030"" to liberalise Saudi society under the crown prince and de facto ruler of the country, Mohammed bin Salman.
Other Gulf states operate similar alcohol regimes.
However, the UAE and Qatar also allow the sale of alcohol to non-Muslims over 21 in hotels, clubs and bars.
There is no suggestion from the Saudi document that the government there is considering doing the same.
While alcohol is forbidden under Islam, Saudi Arabia had until 1952 held a conciliatory attitude to its presence inside the kingdom.
That changed after Mishari bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, a prince, shot dead Cyril Ousman, the British vice-consul in Jeddah, in 1951 for refusing to pour him another drink at a function.
A year later, King Abdulaziz imposed a total ban on alcohol. Mishari was convicted of murder.

3ZC48OXX6J_ZNA848PHYKJ1G2E,South Korea: First lady's Dior bag shakes country's leadership,By Kelly Ng,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68090638,"The controversy over South Korean First Lady Kim Keon Hee allegedly accepting a luxury bag gift has thrown its ruling People Power Party (PPP) into disarray.
Spy camera footage released late last year appeared to show a pastor presenting a Dior bag to her.
Some analysts say the scandal threatens the prospects of President Yoon Suk Yeol's party in April's elections.
Voters want an explanation from Mr Yoon, polls show, while the opposition has used the issue to attack him.
The video, published by left-wing YouTube channel Voice of Seoul, is reported to have been secretly filmed by the pastor Choi Jae-young using a camera embedded in his watch.
It appeared to show Mr Choi walking to a store to purchase the greyish-blue calfskin bag, with a receipt putting its cost at 3m won ($2,200; Â£1,800). Mr Choi then visits Covana Contents, a company in Seoul owned by the first lady, where Ms Kim then asks the pastor, ""Why do you keep bringing me these things?""
The bag was allegedly given to the first lady in September 2022, according to local media.
While the video does not explicitly show Ms Kim accepting the gift, the Korea Herald reported that the presidential office confirmed receipt of the bag and said that it was ""being managed and stored as a property of the government.""
Mr Yoon's office is reportedly planning to address the issue ""as early as this month"", Yonhap news agency reported, citing unnamed sources.
A recent poll showed that 69% of the country's eligible voters want an explanation from the president about his wife's actions. An earlier poll in December showed 53% of respondents believed her behaviour was inappropriate.
The scandal is blowing up just three months before South Korea's legislative elections. It also comes as Mr Yoon's approval ratings have been inching up after dropping steadily over the past year.
Seoul-based political analyst Rhee Jong-hoon has described it as a ""political bombshell"".
""The Kim Keon Hee risks are only going to get bigger,"" he told Reuters news agency.
South Korean law makes it illegal for public officials and their spouses to receive gifts worth more than 1m won in one go, or a total of 3m won within a fiscal year.
The opposition Democratic Party has also seized on the issue to attack Mr Yoon and his party.
""It makes no sense for the presidential office and the ruling party to continue to ignore this and talk as if an apology will end the matter,"" said opposition leader Hong Ik-pyo.
And last week, Kim Kyung-yul, another PPP leader, compared the first lady with Marie Antoinette, the notorious French queen known for her extravagant ways.
It is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding South Korea's 51-year-old first lady.
The opposition has long accused Ms Kim of being involved in stock price manipulation. Earlier this month, Mr Yoon vetoed a bill calling for his wife to be investigated over these allegations.
Last year, Seoul's government scrapped an expressway project amid allegations that its construction would financially benefit Ms Kim's family by raising the prices of land that they own.
The scandal has also caused rifts within Mr Yoon's party.
The president is said to have pushed for his party's leader Han Dong-hoon to resign after Mr Han commented that the controversy ""can be a matter of public concern"".
""Basically, the matter was a planned set-up using a spy cam. However, there were several misdeeds in handling the issues,"" the Korea Times quoted Mr Han as saying.
Both men appear to have mended their relationship and Mr Han remains in the party.
Mr Yoon's initial reaction could have been politically costly, Sogang University political science professor Kim Jae-chun told The Straits Times.
""Did he, in a fit of pique, call his chief of staff, and say, 'Just go' to that guy... I mean, you only have 77 days left to the election [as at Jan 24],"" he said.
Mr Han is widely considered a protÃ©gÃ© and close associate of Mr Yoon and is tipped to be a presidential candidate in 2027.

Six people were arrested on Wednesday, including the alleged ringleader from Albania. A stash of jewellery, watches, cash and weapons was found.
The gang is alleged to have carried out 71 thefts from luxury homes and businesses mostly in Marbella.
Police say the suspects were ""highly skilled"" in robberies and break-ins.
""With their knowledge of military techniques, they used strict personal security and counter-surveillance measures while moving around on foot or in vehicles, changing direction or making unexpected stops,"" a police statement alleges.
""They were also trained to access any type of property, regardless of the height of its walls and perimeters, and to act quickly and efficiently,"" it adds.
The alleged ringleader is believed to have taken part in all the robberies, always carrying a firearm. Police described him as an expert in ""boarding [vessels] and counter-surveillance"".
Houses in the city of MÃ¡laga, as well as the towns of Estepona and Torremolinos were also targeted by the gang.
In at least four of the robberies police say physical violence was used.
Police say they were able to apprehend the suspects with the help of a local businessman.
The nationalities of the other five alleged gangsters have not been publicly released.

The supermarket chain has 300 forecourts attached to superstores with half of those already unmanned.
Another 82 are to go cash-free, with 14 already having been converted since December last year, according to the supermarket.
It said all of its workers at the sites would be redeployed by this summer.
Only forecourts adjacent to Asda superstores will be affected, the supermarket chain added.
An Asda spokesperson said the changes were being made as more than nine in 10 payments made at superstore forecourts were made via card or contactless device.
It added: ""The colleagues who worked on these sites are moving into the store so they can better serve our customers"".
The supermarket said conversions had begun in December, with the changeover expected to complete ""later in 2024"".
There have been calls for the Prime Minister to replicate new legislation in Ireland that will force businesses to accept cash.
Supermarkets, pharmacies and corner shops will have to accept physical cash under rules signed off by politicians in Ireland on Tuesday.
Other types of shops and retailers are exempt, with the rules expected to come into effect later this year.
There are indications that cash use is on the rise, with the British Retail Consortium (BRC) reporting recently that cash purchases had grown in 2022 for the first time in 10 years.
It said shoppers were keeping a close eye on their budgets while prices rise, echoing a report by banks showing a slight rebound.
Cash was used in 19% of transactions in 2022, according to the BRC, up from 15% the previous year.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will look into whether the deal could harm consumers by leading to reduced choice or higher prices.
The combined group would be the UK's biggest mobile network with about 27 million customers.
The firms said the deal would result in an additional investment of Â£11bn in the UK.
""We strongly believe that the proposed merger of Vodafone and Three will significantly enhance competition by creating a combined business with more resources to invest in infrastructure to better compete with the two larger converged players,"" said Vodafone UK chief executive Ahmed Essam.
Meanwhile, Three said the deal would speed up the rollout of 5G, and give customers more reliable coverage.
""Thanks to this transaction, 95% of the population and every school and hospital will be covered by standalone 5G by the end of the decade,"" said Three UK chief executive Robert Finnegan.
""We are confident that this transaction will deliver significant benefits to our customers, the country and competition, and we look forward to working closely with the CMA as they review our notification.""
But the Unite union has estimated bills could rise by as much as Â£300 per year if it goes ahead.
The UK currently has four major mobile operators - Vodafone, Three, EE (which is part of BT), and Virgin Media O2.
Three general counsel Stephen Lerner has previously told the Business and Trade Committee that there are ""no merger related price rises"" in the firms' joint business plan, and he was confident the CMA would approve the deal.
Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight, said the merger ""makes sense"", but he expected the firms to make some concessions.
""The entity would have to provide solutions on areas like network sharing, rather than create another problem for the market,"" he said.
""While a precedent has already been set following the failed Three/O2 deal, let's see if the authorities have a change of heart.
""Both parties need to demonstrate that this is genuinely in the interest of UK plc, the economy, and consumers for it to have a chance of getting over the line.""
The CMA has asked third parties - such as other network operators - to submit their views on the planned merger, and how it could affect competition.
""This deal would bring together two of the major players in the UK telecommunications market, which is critical to millions of everyday customers, businesses and the wider economy,"" said CMA chief executive Sarah Cardell.
""The CMA will assess how this tie-up between rival networks could impact competition before deciding next steps.
""We now have 40 working days to complete this formal Phase 1 investigation, before publishing our findings and any next steps.""

Aditya Verma made the comment on Snapchat on his way to the island of Menorca with friends in July 2022.
The message, sent before Mr Verma departed Gatwick airport, read: ""On my way to blow up the plane (I'm a member of the Taliban).""
Mr Verma told a Madrid court on Monday: ""The intention was never to cause public distress or cause public harm.""
If found guilty, the university student faces a hefty bill for expenses after two Spanish Air Force jets were scrambled.
Mr Verma's message was picked up by the UK security services who flagged it to Spanish authorities while the easyJet plane was still in the air.
A court in Madrid heard it was assumed the message triggered alarm bells after being picked up via Gatwick's Wi-Fi network.
Shortly after, the court was told two Spanish F-18 fighter jets were sent to flank the aircraft.
One jet followed the plane until it landed at Menorca, where the plane was searched extensively.
Mr Verma, who was 18 at the time, was arrested. He was kept in a police cell for two days and was later released on bail, the court was told.
Back in the UK, he was questioned by the British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6, before he returned home to Orpington, Kent.
Appearing in court on Monday, Mr Verma - who is now studying economics at Bath University - said the message was ""a joke in a private group setting"".
""It was just sent to my friends I was travelling with on the day,"" he said.
Pressed about the purpose of the message, Mr Verma said: ""Since school, it's been a joke because of my features... It was just to make people laugh.""
Asked what he thought when he saw the fighter jets flanking the plane, Mr Verma said: ""The Russia-Ukraine war was happening so I thought it was a military exercise related to [that] conflict.""
He said that the plane's pilot made an announcement, telling passengers that the fighter jets had been scrambled because of a distress signal that had been sent by mistake.
Police experts told the court that they combed Mr Verma's phone and, although they found that he had researched clashes between Pakistan and India and the possibilities of an Islamic State attack in that area, they did not find anything of interest that linked Mr Verma to jihadist radicalism.
Mr Verma is not facing terrorism charges or a possible jail term, but could be fined up to â¬22,500 (Â£19,300) if found guilty and the Spanish defence ministry is demanding â¬95,000 in expenses.
The court told the BBC that a verdict in Mr Verma's case would come in the next few days."

4RBQQW4D92_N9O63VGNY20C259,Colorado pastor accused of multimillion dollar crypto scheme,By Brandon Drenon,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68072665,"A Colorado pastor and his wife have been charged with duping hundreds of local Christians in a multimillion dollar cryptocurrency scheme.
Prosecutors accuse pastor Eli Regalado and his wife, Kaitlyn, of fraudulently raising over $3m (Â£2.4m) by selling ""practically worthless"" crypto.
The Regalados pocketed at least $1.3m in the alleged scheme between June 2022 and April 2023, prosecutors say.
Mr Regalado said his plan was inspired by God, according to court filings.
The pastor said that ""God told him directly that investors would become wealthy"" by investing into INDXcoin, a cryptocurrency created, marketed, and sold by the Regalados, according to the complaint.
INDXcoin was offered to Denver-area Christians through the Kingdom Wealth Exchange, an online cryptocurrency exchange owned and operated by the Regalados.
The couple ""had no experience in cryptocurrency"", the complaint said, and a third-party auditor found INDXcoin to be ""unsafe, unsecure and riddled with technical problems"".
""Despite that report, the Regalados allegedly continued to promote the INDXcoin as a low-risk, high-profit investment,"" it said.
""In reality, the INDXcoin was illiquid and practically worthless"" and the couple used the funds for ""their lavish lifestyle"".
This included a Range Rover, luxury handbags, jewellery, boat rentals and snowmobile adventures, according to officials.
Colorado Securities Commissioner Tung Chan has filed civil fraud charges for violations of anti-fraud protections under the Colorado Securities Act.
She said her department was tipped off after multiple complaints by people who had invested in INDXcoin and had lost money.
Mr Relagado addressed the allegations in a video statement released on Friday.
""The reason that [Colorado] is saying that it's worthless is because there is no exit for people who have bought,"" he said, acknowledging that the cryptocurrency investors who have tried to withdraw funds have been unable to.
""We launched an exchange. The exchange technology failed. Things went down hill, and from that point forward, we've just been waiting on the Lord literally for a miracle.""
On the allegation that Mr Relagado and his wife received $1.3m, the pastor said that was true.
""But out of that $1.3m, half of it went to the IRS and $200,000 went to a home remodel that the Lord told us to do,"" he said.
Many viewers left words of encouragement in the comments on the video, including ""prayers going up"" and ""hang in there, stay strong"".
The BBC has reached out to the Regalados for comment.
In the criminal complaint, Colorado prosecutors have asked for preliminary and injunctive relief, damages for investors and for a constructive trust to be placed on the Relagados' property.
They are scheduled to appear in Denver District Court next week."
4RJO102DYM_U53H57T8S3Y7Z56,Giraffe Benito escapes extreme temperatures for new home,By Bernd Debusmann Jr.,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-68061512,"A giraffe named Benito has left his home in Mexico's arid north to begin a 2,000km-trip (1,200 miles) to more temperate climates further south.
Benito's voyage follows a long campaign by activists who warned that he was suffering in the extreme climates of the border city of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez.
To reach his new home, Benito is travelling in a purpose-built 5m-tall container.
Some activists shouted ""we love you"" as he began his trip.
Until his departure, the three-year-old Benito had been kept in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez's Parque Central zoo.
Activists had long warned that the city's desert climate - which can reach a a sweltering 42C (108F) in the summer and dip as low as freezing in the winter - was difficult for giraffes and that the zoo was not properly equipped to handle the animals.
A second giraffe which was kept at the zoo, Modesto, died in 2022.
The operation to move Benito began early on Monday morning, when the container in which he will travel was loaded onto a truck.
Benito had been allowed to familiarise himself with the container over the weekend.
The container is designed so that he can peek his head out from inside but can be covered with a tarp to protect him from the elements and potentially stressful sights and sounds.
The trip to his new home - a safari park in the state of Puebla - is expected to take approximately 50 hours.
Frank Carlos Camacho, the director of the safari park where Benito is headed, said that the container had cameras and sensors installed to allow his keepers to monitor him, as well as enough alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and water to keep him fed along the way.
""We can check his temperature, and even talk to him through a microphone that's inside the container,"" Mr Camacho said. ""He's very well.""
At his new home in Puebla's African Safari park, visitors will be able to see him in a more natural habitat from all-terrain vehicles.
In an interview with Mexico's Animal Politico news outlet, activist Perla Iris GuzmÃ¡n - a member of the ""Let's Save Benito"" collective -  thanked ""all the people who made this movement grow"".
""This is an accomplishment of the entire JuÃ¡rez community,"" she said. ""[They] believed in us and went to the zoo to see what we meant about the 'little' animals.""

While details of her new role are unclear, she will continue official duties with the imperial family.
The 22-year-old princess is not in line of succession as Japanese law allows only men to ascend to the throne.
Japan has the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world.
In a statement, Princess Aiko said that she has ""always had an interest"" in the Red Cross, while her new employer added that it wants ""to thoroughly make preparations so that the princess can work at ease"".
The organisation has close ties with the imperial family, with previous empresses serving as honorary presidents.
In October, Princess Aiko visited the society with her parents to observe an exhibition on its relief activities following the 1923 Tokyo earthquake. In recent years, she has also expressed her sympathies to victims and survivors of natural disasters in Japan.
She is currently in her final year of study at Gakushuin University's Faculty of Letters, majoring in Japanese language and literature. The princess is generally well regarded by the Japanese public, many of whom have welcomed her new role.
Princess Aiko's mother, Empress Masako, is known as a ""career woman"" princess and empress in Japan.
Educated at Harvard and Oxford, the empress is a former diplomat fluent in several languages.
In 1993, she became only the second commoner, after former Empress Michiko, to marry the first in line to the Japanese throne.
But once married, speculation raged over if and when she would produce a male heir.

From 2019 - An explainer on why Princess Aiko, the only child of Japan's Crown Prince Naruhito, will not ascend the throne because she is female
The birth of Princess Aiko in 2001 was much celebrated but did not resolve the succession issue.
The Japanese government then began debating whether to change the law to allow women to ascend to the throne.
Five years later, Emperor Naruhito's younger brother welcomed a baby boy, Prince Hisahito, to avert the succession crisis.
But the pressure on then Crown Princess Masako was evident as she disappeared from public view for more than a decade.
In 2004, then Crown Prince Naruhito told journalists in unusually strong comments that his wife had ""completely exhausted herself"" trying to adapt to palace life.
The palace then announced that the princess was suffering from an ""adjustment disorder"", widely assumed to be a reference to depression.
In recent years, the family of Prince Hisahito, who is second in line to the throne after his father, has attracted much coverage by Japanese tabloids.
His older sister, former princess Mako, married a commoner, Kei Komuro, and moved to the US after leaving the imperial family.
An alleged money dispute between Mr Komuro's mother and her former fiancÃ©, who claimed mother and son had failed to repay a debt to him, almost threatened their marriage as public perception of the couple soured.
Mr Komuro's New York state bar exam results were treated as breaking news in Japan until he passed on his third try in 2022.
The tabloid spotlight on the Akishino family has meant that local media often makes comparisons between the princesses.
When Princess Aiko was asked about her cousin Mako's marriage in 2022, she said: ""For me, marriage still seems far in the future and I haven't really thought of it. I have no particular thought of my ideal partner, but (the ability to) make each other smile seems perfect.""

5FI3Z319C0_VPO773K5HYHINDM,Downed plane: Still unanswered questions amid Ukraine and Russia claims,By Sarah Rainsford,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68089698,"This video can not be played
The BBC has verified this video showing the moment a Russian aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region
There are shooting wars and there are information wars and countries that are fighting do battle on both fronts.
For the rest of us, it can make establishing facts very difficult.
But whilst that's true in this war as in any, it's important to remember that Russia specifically has a long history of brazen lies and disinformation.
That was proven with the shooting down of MH17 and the Salisbury Novichok poisonings, to name just two major incidents in the past decade.
Even the full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched on a lie: the false claim that a ""Nazi"" regime was putting Russian speakers here at risk of ""genocide"".
That doesn't mean every word from the Russian Defence Ministry and the Kremlin is untrue - or from MPs and the state media.
But they often are, so they need checking carefully before repeating.
This time, the reports that an Il-76 transport plane had crashed first appeared on Russian state news agencies.
They quoted the Defence Ministry in Moscow claiming that dozens of Ukrainian prisoners of war had been on board the flight, on their way to a prisoner exchange.
Kyiv did not confirm that and from Russia there was no proof.
A Russian MP, Andrei Kartapolov, began expanding on the statement almost immediately, even suggesting Ukraine might have used a Patriot missile to hit the Ilyushin plane.
That would mean a Western-supplied weapon - a big claim, with as yet no evidence to support it.
As such talk grew louder and spread around the world, Ukraine still made no comment.
Russia's noise inevitably filled the silence.
In Kyiv, we started to hear rumours that a prisoner swap had been planned for today - then confirmation of that from a source. But no-one in Kyiv would say so officially.
Everyone we called for information told us, ""not yet"", or ""we're checking information"" or ""just wait"". For eight hours, there was nothing.
That didn't stop the speculation from Russia, including wild claims that Ukraine had killed its own soldiers on purpose. The supposed rationale for that is so twisted, it's not worth repeating.
But dismissing such talk doesn't mean dismissing the chance that Ukraine has made a terrible mistake. After all, we do know the plane came down - and Ukraine has the capacity for that.
Early on, the Ukrainska Pravda news website quoted an armed forces source saying it was ""their job"", and that the plane had been carrying Russian S300 missiles. A success, in other words.
That was later corrected, to say the source had not been corroborated.
Then this evening, we finally got two official statements.
They came from the General Staff and from Ukrainian Military Intelligence, and together amount to acknowledgement that Ukraine may have shot the plane down - though neither said so directly.
Ukraine stresses that it has no reliable information about who was on board. But it did confirm that a prisoner swap was planned for Wednesday and didn't happen.
It also said that Russia usually provides information on the route and transport that's to be used for a swap, to make sure it's safe.
This time, Ukraine says, there was none of that.
The General Staff statement amounted to a justification for firing on such a plane - without saying openly what it did.
Russia has increased its missile attacks from Belgorod lately, especially on Kharkiv where it has killed and injured dozens of civilians. Transport planes like that one that crashed on Wednesday morning deliver the weapons that are then launched across the border.
So this evening there are some answers, more hints and lots of claims. But there are still questions.
We can't be sure yet who or what was on the plane that came down. We don't know how much more officials here in Kyiv may already know and not be saying.
If there were Ukrainian soldiers on board the transport plane, then Russia will eventually have to provide the proof. And Ukraine will have to give fuller answers.
Because there will be thousands of families across this country tonight, who have soldier relatives in Russia as prisoners of war, who are now waiting - and worrying.

5IZWW02AIR_GDBYIZVR0UOE14O,Peter Navarro: Ex-Trump adviser sentenced for contempt of Congress,By Max Matza,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68086757,"This video can not be played
Watch: Ex-Trump trade adviser speaks after prison sentence
Peter Navarro, former trade adviser to Donald Trump, has been sentenced to four months in prison and a $9,500 (Â£7,500) fine for contempt of Congress.
Navarro was convicted in September after he ignored a subpoena from a House committee investigating alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
Federal prosecutors said he ""chose allegiance to former President Donald Trump over the rule of law"".
Navarro has filed an appeal and vowed to take the case to the Supreme Court.
Prosecutors had asked that Navarro, 74, serve a six-month sentence. His lawyers claimed he was ""not an insurrectionist"" and requested that he serve no jail time.
Navarro was served with a subpoena by a US House of Representatives select committee in February 2022.
But he did not hand over any of the requested emails or documents or appear to testify before the Democratic-led panel.
When contacted by the committee, Navarro said Mr Trump had instructed him to cite executive privilege. This is a legal principle that allows certain White House communications to be kept under private.
But the judge ruled that there was no evidence that Mr Trump could have requested that, or that executive privilege could have permitted Navarro to ignore the committee's summons.
He was found guilty by the 12-member jury after four hours of deliberations, following a trial in Washington DC last year that lasted two days.
Addressing the court on Thursday, Judge Amit Mehta said he had a ""great deal of respect"" for Navarro, adding that it is ""disappointing how he behaved"".
""It's those kinds of statements from somebody who knows better â¦ that contribute to why our politics are so corrosive. It is regrettable.""
The judge also noted the work Navarro did with US businesses to speed up production of Covid-19 protective equipment during the pandemic, saying ""I do think the country owes you a debt of gratitude to you for your work with the coronavirus"".
In his 2021 book, In Trump Time, Navarro said he was the architect of a strategy to challenge the 2020 election results, claiming widespread voter fraud.
The plan was for congressional Republicans to delay certification of President Joe Biden's victory.
The House committee said Navarro's claims of massive ballot fraud had been exposed as baseless by state and local officials.
Navarro, addressing the judge, said he was ""disappointed"" that he was not permitted to raise an executive privilege defence.
""The minute that violence erupted on Capitol Hill was one of the worst moments of my life,"" he said.
Judge Mehta said that Navarro's actions sought to thwart ""a significant effort by Congress to get to the bottom of a terrible day in the country's history"".
""They had a job to do and you made it harder. It is really that simple,"" he added.
Navarro, speaking to reporters after his sentencing, said he was ""caught in a battle between two competing branches of government"", referring to Congress and the White House.
He called his case ""destined for the Supreme Court"", saying it should decide ""whether a senior White House aide and alter ego of the president can be compelled to testify by Congress"".
His case has parallels with another Trump aide who was convicted of defying the 6 January committee.
Former Trump campaign strategist Steve Bannon was convicted of two counts of contempt for refusing the House committee's legal summons in July 2022.
Bannon was also sentenced to four months in jail, but has remained free while his defence team appeals against the conviction.

5MS1JN89OQ_CMPCGDFJGDK93ET,Top Arizona Republican quits over leaked tape offer to Kari Lake,By Max Matza,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68089618,"Arizona's Republican party chairman has quit over a leaked tape in which he is heard apparently trying to induce a Senate candidate to quit the race.
On the audio, Jeff DeWit asks Kari Lake if there is ""any number"" that would make her take a political ""pause"" as ""very powerful people"" want her out.
In his resignation letter, he denied any bribery and said Ms Lake had released a ""selectively edited"" tape.
Ms Lake narrowly lost her 2022 race for Arizona governor.
The right-wing firebrand and ally of Donald Trump is now running for the seat currently occupied by independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema.
Arizona Republicans have long worried that Ms Lake's combative style of politics may turn off moderate voters and lose the race, potentially costing Republicans control of the Senate.
In the tape, recorded during a meeting at her house 10 months ago, Mr DeWit tells Ms Lake there are ""very powerful people that want to keep you out"".
He does not name them, but says they are ""back East"".
""I'll tell you what I'm offering you,"" he says, suggesting that she could be put on the payroll of a company in exchange for a two-year ""pause"".
He repeatedly asks her not to tell anyone about their conversation.
""Is there a number at which..."", he says, before Ms Lake interrupts.
""I could be bought? No,"" she replies.
When Mr DeWit says he has doubts that Mr Trump will win the presidential election because of fundraising issues in the state, she disagrees.
""This is about defeating Trump and I think that's a bad, bad thing for our country,"" she argues.
Ms Lake, who had called for Mr DeWit to resign after the tape emerged, welcomed his departure.
""We want ethical leaders,"" she posted on X on Wednesday. ""Time to root-out the corruption at ALL levels - both inside and outside our party.""
Mr DeWit, a former state treasurer, worked for Mr Trump's campaigns in 2016 and 2020.
In his resignation letter on Wednesday, he said that Ms Lake's team had delivered him an ultimatum - ""resign or face the release of a new, more damaging recording"".
He said that since their conversation, Ms Lake ""has been on a mission to destroy me"".
""Contrary to accusations of bribery, my discussions were transparent and intended to offer perspective, not coercion,"" he says.
Mr DeWit is not the only Republican state party leader to leave office this month.
Florida's chairman was voted out by party members after allegations of sexual assault.
Christian Ziegler was cleared by police of rape last week, but could still face a voyeurism charge.
In Michigan, Republicans voted to remove Kristina Karamo as party chair due to infighting and fundraising issues.

Watch: Trump rivals line up to back him after New Hampshire
Donald Trump shared the stage at his New Hampshire victory party on Tuesday night with a team of former rivals and young conservative stars.
Tim Scott and Vivek Ramaswamy, who ran against and criticised Mr Trump just months ago, served as headliners.
Speculation has grown that they may seek future White House posts - and many have suggested Mr Scott could even be a potential running mate.
Still, Mr Trump introduced the men by taking a couple of jabs at them.
He introduced Mr Ramaswamy and said he would only allow him to speak ""if he promised to do it in a minute or less"". This was likely a dig at the biotech entrepreneur's numerous loquacious moments on the Republican debate stage.
In a moment that drew more attention and a slightly awkward silence at the watch party, Mr Trump suggested that Mr Scott ""must really hate"" Nikki Haley, since the former South Carolina governor appointed him to his Senate seat in 2013.
Mr Scott moved quickly in a bid to salvage the moment by stepping to the lectern, grinning widely and shouting: ""I just love you!""
Though their presence appeared to re-emphasise their endorsement of him and illustrate a united Republican front, the former president's comments towards his colleagues attracted attention online.
Pundits have characterised the moments as politically cruel and reminiscent of Mr Trump's poor treatment of past surrogates.
Many have drawn parallels to Mr Trump's treatment of former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Texas Senator Ted Cruz - both men challenged the former president in the 2016 election cycle before ultimately endorsing him.
At the time, Mr Trump made jokes at both men's expense despite their support and often forced them to stand by his side, leading to numerous embarrassing internet memes from their time campaigning for him.
Despite the awkward moments after the New Hampshire primary, Mr Scott appeared on numerous news shows on Wednesday morning to make his pitch for Mr Trump. He declined, however, to speak to his future ambitions in a possible Trump White House.
""The only conversation I've had with the president about being vice-president was that I'll never ask you to be a vice-president,"" he said on CBS Mornings on Wednesday. ""I'll never ask you to be a part of your cabinet.""
Unlike Mr Scott, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis - another former rival for the Republican nomination who then endorsed the former president - appears uninterested in joining the surrogate line.
Since leaving the race shortly after the Iowa caucus, Mr DeSantis has backed Mr Trump but also noted the candidate's many vulnerabilities. He said there was a clear enthusiasm problem among Republican voters, who he said are slow to back the former president.
""When I have people come up to me who voted for Reagan in '76 and have been conservative their whole life say that they don't want to vote for Trump again, that's a problem,"" he said in a radio interview on Tuesday.
He has also vowed to kill a Florida bill that would help the former president with his many legal costs, a symbolic legislative blow to Mr Trump.
But it has become quite clear that Mr Trump is consolidating Republican support. He flooded New Hampshire with surrogates, capturing much-needed media and voter attention.
Another former rival for the nomination, Doug Burgum, Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, Ohio Senator JD Vance, Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, the former president's son Eric Trump, Arizona Senate candidate Kari Lake and many others made the rounds in recent days.
Ms Haley, who has had much fewer endorsements, struggled to match that pace as voters cast their ballots here on Tuesday.
Now, with a loss in New Hampshire and Mr Trump earning further endorsements, the former UN ambassador is facing growing calls from a deep bench of Republicans to drop out of the race and back Trump.
""I think she has run a great campaign,"" Ronna McDaniel, the Republican Party chairwoman, said on Fox News of Nikki Haley. ""But I do think there is a message that is coming out from the voters, which is very clear: 'we need to unite around our eventual nominee', which is going to be Donald Trump.""

6039MCFJ52_252ZE22BQDQFVAM,ExxonMobil sues investors to block climate petition,By Mariko Oi,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68052440,"Oil giant ExxonMobil has sued climate activist investors in a bid to prevent their climate proposal from going to a vote at its annual investor meeting.
The complaint is against Follow This and Arjuna Capital, which have called on Exxon to step up the pace of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Exxon says the US and Dutch investors are driven by an ""extreme agenda"".
It is rare for companies to go to court to block shareholder motions and this is the first time Exxon has done so.
If the Texas-based firm wins the case, it would have a significant impact on future shareholder petitions.
Listed firms usually debate the merits of individual proposals with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
But critics say the US financial regulator varies its advice depending on which administration is in office.
For example, the number of motions by environmental activists has risen significantly in recent years, according to the SEC.
Follow This and Arjuna Capital want Exxon to set so-called Scope 3 targets to reduce emissions produced by users of its oil and gas.
Exxon currently aims to reach net zero by 2050 for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which is the pollution from its production processes and the energy it consumes. However it is the only one of the five Western oil majors which does not have Scope 3 targets.
Exxon says the proposal by Follow This and Arjuna violates SEC rules for investor petitions.
The company has told the BBC that ""the breakdown of the shareholder proposal process, one that allows proponents to advance their agendas through a flood of proposals, does not serve the interests of investors"".
Exxon is asking a judge in the US district court in Texas to exclude the Scope 3 proposal by in its proxy statement.
The firm has asked for a decision by 19 March, in time for its annual shareholder meeting on 29 March.

66T4AGI90K_FTT2O0EV001JT76,"Royal Mail could deliver on three days, regulator says",By Michael Race,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68067702,"Royal Mail could reduce the number of days it delivers letters from six per week to five or even three, under proposals to reform the service.
A report from the regulator said the postal service was ""getting out of date"" and action needed to be taken.
Ofcom said another option would be extending the number of days it takes for most letters to be delivered.
Royal Mail said its current delivery network was ""not sustainable"" and that reform was ""urgently needed"".
The company, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, is legally obliged to deliver a one-price-goes-anywhere universal service, which means it has to deliver letters six days per week, Monday to Saturday, and parcels Monday to Friday.
In recent years, the volume of letters being posted has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels, while parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable.
Royal Mail's performance has also deteriorated, with customers regularly not receiving letters about medical appointments and legal documents on time.
Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom's chief executive, said the regulator was sharing options for reforming the service, putting them out for ""national discussion"", with an update scheduled for the summer.
""Something's got to give, or the service is going to be too costly, and either stamp prices will go up or it will become unsustainable,"" she told BBC Breakfast.
The government has said it does not support the idea of scrapping postal deliveries on Saturdays.
Kevin Hollinrake, the postal services minister, told the BBC Royal Mail needed to ""up their game"" and that the government was ""happy to have a conversation"" about reforms.
But he insisted that Saturday deliveries were ""sacrosanct"" and that a six-day service would remain.
On Wednesday the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said the government was ""absolutely committed"" to ensuring the Royal Mail's universal service obligations remained as they were.
Ofcom estimated the company could save between Â£100m and Â£200m a year if delivery days were cut to five per week, and between Â£400m and Â£650m if there were just three postal days.
However, reforming the postal service by cutting delivery days would require the government and parliament to change the current legislation.
Are you affected by the issues raised in this story? Get in touch.
An alternative option would be to to reduce the speed of delivery for most letters to within three days. That would save Â£150 to Â£650m, Ofcom said, but the regulator said there would still need to be a next-day service available for any urgent letters.
Under Ofcom's current rules, each year Royal Mail is required to deliver 93% of First Class post within one working day and 98.5% of Second Class within three working days, but in 2022/23 the company only delivered 73.7% of First Class and 90.7% of Second Class mail on time.
That has left many customers dissatisfied, among them Peter Rimmer, from Ormskirk, Lancashire, who told the BBC he already only seems to get post once a week.
The former communications director, 78, said his post arrives in a bundle from a different postie each time.
Last week a Christmas card arrived that had been posted on the 8 December with the correct address and first class stamp on it. ""It's not a regular service,"" he said.
Royal Mail has previously made clear it would like to shift from delivering six days a week to five, from Monday to Friday only. The business, which is owned by International Distribution Services plc, posted a Â£319m loss in the first half of the current financial year.
Martin Seidenberg, Royal Mail's group chief executive, said a ""lack of action"" on reforms before, now meant the business faced a ""much more serious situation"".
But the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represent posties, said the union would not sign up to a three-day delivery service, claiming it would ""destroy"" Royal Mail and ""impact thousands of jobs"".
The UK was ""not alone"" in needing to reform its postal service, Ofcom said. It noted Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Denmark had either reduced delivery days or extended delivery times for letters in recent years.
But Dame Melanie said neither reducing delivery days nor extending delivery times would represent an ""easy pass"" for the company as it would still have to meet set delivery targets.
Ofcom said the company's recent poor performance, which led it being fined Â£5.6m for missing its delivery targets, showed that people were not currently getting a reliable service. The regulator said its research showed people valued affordability and reliability the most when it came to letter postage.
Morgan Wild, interim director of policy at the charity Citizens Advice, said any changes to the universal postal service must prioritise consumers, ""not Royal Mail's bottom line"".
""We agree that improving reliability is essential,"" he added. ""Cutting services won't automatically make letter deliveries more reliable, so we must see proposals to tackle the cause of Royal Mail's persistent failings.""

6DYZZ9BJVW_DJZPECZKB3MV4HD,Adani Ports: The Tamil Nadu villagers taking on a billionaire's port plan,By K Subagunam,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67942639,"Thousands of villagers in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu are fighting a proposal to expand a port owned by billionaire Gautam Adani, one of the world's richest men.
The villagers, most of whom make a living through fishing, say the port expansion in Kattupalli - a small village located in Tiruvallur district along the Bay of Bengal coast - would submerge their lands and wreak havoc on their livelihoods. Adani Ports denies this.
The 330-acre multi-purpose port - originally built by Indian conglomerate Larson & Toubro (L&T) - was acquired by Adani Ports in 2018.
The company later proposed to expand it more than 18-fold to an area of 6,110 acres by claiming portions of land along the coast.
According to the company's master plan, the expansion would increase the port's cargo capacity from 24.6 metric tonnes to 320 metric tonnes per year and develop new rail and road networks that would boost trade connectivity in the region.
But fisher people in at least 100 towns and villages located on the coast say this would gravely impact their work. ""The number of fish varieties found here has already gone down significantly. Any kind of expansion would further deplete its population,"" claims Rajalakshmi, a fisherwoman from the region.
The expansion has met with resistance from environmentalists as well, who claim the plan would lead to massive coastal erosion and a loss of biodiversity, especially of the indigenous fish species and the crabs, prawns and small turtles found in the region.
Environmentalist Meera Shah claims it could also ""destroy"" Pulicat lake, the second-largest saltwater lake in the country.
At the moment, the coastal stretch acts as a barrier between the lake and the Bay of Bengal. But the region has been experiencing widespread environmental pollution and coastal erosion in recent years, Mr Shah added.
If more construction is undertaken here, the coast would shrink further, ""leading the lake and the sea to merge"".
A spokesperson from Adani Port, however, rejected the allegations and called them ""misplaced"".
A senior company official, who wanted to stay anonymous, told BBC Tamil that locals ""are not against the expansion of the port"" and alleged the protests were being led by people ""with ulterior motives for publicity"".
""Individuals opposed to the expansion do not base their claims on any primary data. Some good NGOs involved in protecting the environment may have some genuine questions, which will be addressed during the [mandatory] environmental clearance process,"" the official added.
Protests against the port expansion first broke out in 2018 and have continued intermittently over the years.
The agitation intensified again in September, when the state government started the process of giving environmental clearance to the project, paving the way for the expansion work to begin.
In the same month, the state's Pollution Control Board was forced to postpone a mandatory public hearing for the project amid strong protests.
According to the master plan, of the 6,110 acres needed for the expansion, 2,000 acres would be acquired from the sea, while the remaining land would be taken from the coastal area.
The company says it will reclaim parts of the sea by filling it with sand and include them in the port area. It also plans to deepen a portion of the sea and create a sea wall around it so that more ships can move along the coast.
Experts warn this could have devastating consequences for the region's ecology.
The east coast of India - and the Tamil Nadu coast in particular - does not have the geographical landscape suitable for port construction, let alone an expansion, claims Dr Ilango Lakshmanan, a professor of hydrogeology at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.
""This would disrupt the coastal topography and lead to more sea erosion,"" he added.
A senior company spokesperson rejected the claim and said that sea erosion in the region could not be linked to the port's construction alone.
""States like Gujarat and Maharashtra, where some of the major ports in the country are located, have lower rates of sea erosion compared to the east coast,"" the spokesperson said.
But some industry experts also say the expansion plan should not be dismissed entirely as it would benefit the state's economy and bring more employment.
""Kattupalli port was facing losses and started making profits only after the Adani takeover. An expansion would bring in more ships, which, in turn, will increase its economic scale,"" Valliappan Nagappan, the former president of Hindustan Chamber of Commerce, an independent trade organisation, said.
""However, the company must ensure that locals are well-compensated and relocated [if required] properly, without any impact on their livelihoods,"" Mr Nagappan added.
But protesters say they are not convinced.
""We are ready to face anything in our fight against the project. Our livelihoods should be protected at all costs,"" Vijaya, a fisherwoman from Pulicat, said.
Protesters blame the Tamil Nadu government for not doing enough to safeguard their interests.
Many claim that before the state elections, Chief Minister MK Stalin repeatedly promised he would scrap the expansion plan, but nothing has happened since he came to power in 2021. The BBC has reached out to the chief minister's office and the state's environment minister for comment.
This is not the first time that a port run by Adani Ports has invited protests.
In 2022, massive protests erupted in the fishing villages of the neighbouring state of Kerala against the construction of a port managed by the company in partnership with the local government.
The protest was later called off in December after the state government promised to pay each of those who were to be displaced a monthly compensation.
At Kattupalli, port authorities have been wooing the local community by offering them free medical aid and promising them jobs.
""We are in touch with the villagers and communities around the port area and they are very much interested in the project and getting jobs,"" the unnamed Adani Ports senior executive cited above said.
The protesters, however, say that they are being cautious.
""If they want to give us medicines and take our land, we will not let it happen,"" one of them said.

6L6T7K510B_5FTEKIOD7BWWLAU,Post Office accused of cover-up over secret Horizon documents,By Andy Verity,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68079300,"Post Office bosses secretly decided in April 2014 to sack forensic accountants who had found bugs in their IT system, documents obtained by the BBC show.
They also reveal the government had knowledge of the decision, taken by a Post Office board sub-committee, codenamed ""Project Sparrow"".
Former sub-postmaster Alan Bates said it was further proof of a ""total cover-up"".
The Post Office said it would be inappropriate to comment.
Downing Street said it was taking the reports ""extremely seriously"".
The independent forensic accountants Second Sight played a key role in exposing the scandal, finding flaws in the Horizon computer system which generated false evidence of cash shortfalls at sub-post offices, leading to wrongful prosecutions of sub-postmasters.
Post Office bosses kept insisting their systems were robust.
But they made a concession following pressure from MPs, offering to set up a mediation scheme to deal with what they said was a small number of cases.
The documents reveal the Post Office planned to pay a total of only Â£1m in ""token payments"", or compensation, to sub-postmasters as it suppressed evidence of computer bugs in 2014.
But it was a vast underestimation of the eventual cost of the scandal, which is now expected to be more than Â£1bn.
Details of the Project Sparrow discussions were not disclosed in evidence to sub-postmasters as they challenged the Post Office through the courts in 2017-2019.
""It's been a cover-up from start to finish,"" said Alan Bates. ""That's coming out now. It's undeniable.
""And this is what we've been up against all the way. We've always known they were covering up - it's just been very difficult to find proof,"" he added.
The secret plan to sack Second Sight is revealed in the minutes of two Project Sparrow meetings in April 2014.
The minutes were released in heavily redacted form in 2021 after former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells disclosed the existence of Project Sparrow.
Now the BBC has obtained the unredacted minutes, showing what the Post Office didn't want the public to see.
The Project Sparrow sub-committee was led by Post Office chair Alice Perkins and included chief executive Paula Vennells, alongside the Post Office's most senior internal lawyer, general counsel Chris Aujard, and Richard Callard, a senior civil servant at UK Government Investments, then a division of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
The unredacted minutes for 9 April 2014 show the sub-committee asking for a paper to be prepared on the role of Second Sight and ""options to support them or reduce their role"".
Three weeks later, on 30 April 2014, they agree on a plan to bring the investigation of sub-postmasters' cases ""within the control of the Post Office"", removing Second Sight from its role of investigating sub-postmasters' cases independently.
However, that decision was kept secret from Parliament and the public as the Post Office claimed Second Sight's independent review supported its approach to sub-postmasters' complaints. The Post Office was then seeking to defuse the scandal through a mediation scheme, which excluded many victims from compensation.
Your device may not support this visualisation
Nine months before the committee met, Second Sight submitted a report on 8 July 2013 identifying computer bugs that raised doubts over the reliability of Horizon data used to prosecute sub-postmasters.
A week later, on 15 July 2013, the Post Office was warned in formal advice written by its own lawyer Simon Clarke that it was in breach of its legal duties because sub-postmasters who had been prosecuted should have been told about the bugs.
The next day, 16 July 2013, the Post Office board expressed concern that Second Sight's review exposed the business to claims of wrongful convictions.
Yet the Project Sparrow minutes from April 2014 show Paula Vennells, Alice Perkins and the other members discussed closing or speeding up the mediation scheme and planning to pay minimal compensation to sub-postmasters.
That followed advice from lawyers Linklaters that they had only ""very limited liability in relation to financial redress"".
The minutes show the committee asking for a paper to brief them on making ""token payments"" to sub-postmasters applying to the mediation scheme, trumpeted in public at the time by ministers as a solution to sub-postmasters' complaints.
""The cost of all cases in the scheme going to mediation would be in the region of Â£1m,"" the unredacted minutes state.
Members of the committee knew sub-postmasters wouldn't be happy and that there was a ""real risk"" that ""many applicants will remain dissatisfied at the end of the process"".
On 30 April 2014, following advice from Chris Aujard, the committee decided not to make any ""ex gratia"" payments - meaning payments to struggling sub-postmasters to help them while their cases were examined.
They also asked for a paper to be prepared on options for closing or speeding up the mediation scheme.
Second Sight's interim report in 2013 did say that it had found no systemic flaws in the Horizon system. But the word ""systemic"" had a specific meaning - that no flaws could be found in every single post office branch.
What the Post Office didn't say was that it also made an unwelcome finding, identifying incidents where defects or bugs in the Horizon software ""gave rise to 76 branches being affected by incorrect balances or transactions which took some time to identify and correct"".
On 17 December 2014, Jo Swinson, the former Liberal Democrat MP who served as Postal Affairs minister in the coalition government at the time, answered a parliamentary debate on the scandal. She pointed to the independent role of Second Sight.
The following year, in March 2015, as it prepared to submit its full report, 11 months after the decision had been taken, Second Sight's contract was terminated and the Post Office brought investigation of the sub-postmasters' cases in-house.
Lord Arbuthnot, a former MP and vocal critic of the handling of victims in this scandal told the BBC that the government has to take responsibility ""for everything that went wrong"" in relation to the sub-postmasters.
""It's a distinctly corrupt, murky story that goes right the way into government and it's deeply worrying,"" he said.
The prime minister's spokesperson said on Friday it was ""right"" that there was an inquiry ongoing and pointed out that the reports related to a previous administration.
""It is for the inquiry to establish culpability and to look at what lessons have to be learned. For the government's part we are co-operating and supporting the inquiry fully,"" the spokesperson added.
Alice Perkins and Paula Vennells didn't respond to requests for comment.
Linklaters also did not comment.
Chris Aujard and Richard Callard said through public relations advisers that they would not comment while the inquiry was ongoing.
UK Government Investments declined to comment.
Jo Swinson said: ""The latest revelations about the Project Sparrow meetings and decisions show the extent of the cover-up by Post Office Ltd - they were kept secret from Parliament and the public, and from ministers too.
""Not only did the Post Office directors, including the government official, choose not to tell ministers, they instead briefed the opposite. Repeatedly they told me that Post Office Ltd had never seen anything that would undermine any of their prosecutions, something that we now know is simply not true.""
A Post Office spokesperson said: ""We never discuss individuals and it would be inappropriate to comment on allegations being made outside of the Inquiry, whose role it is to consider all of the evidence on the issues it is examining and independently reach conclusions.
""We fully share the Public Inquiry's aims to get to the truth of what happened in the past and accountability.""

6T3FPCALE7_85VJ4UXJNWS2OI5,Nikki Haley finally gets her solo showdown with Donald Trump in New Hampshire,By Anthony Zurcher,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68052806,"This video can not be played
Watch: Whatâs at stake for Trump and Haley in New Hampshire?
With Ron DeSantis suspending his presidential campaign on Sunday, Nikki Haley gets the one-on-one match-up with Donald Trump for which she's been longing.
""At one point in this campaign, there were 14 of us running,"" she says in an email fundraising pitch, sent out shortly after the DeSantis news broke.
""But today, it's officially a two-person race between me and Donald Trump!""
Ms Haley's showdown with Mr Trump in the state-by-state contest to choose a Republican presidential candidate may not turn out exactly as she hoped, however. The way the 14-person field has thinned of late has played out mostly to the former president's advantage.
First, Mr DeSantis edged ahead of Ms Haley for second place in Iowa's caucuses, denying her any substantial momentum boost heading into New Hampshire, which votes on Tuesday.
The day after Mr Trump's huge win in Iowa, another presidential rival, Vivek Ramaswamy, withdrew from the race and endorsed Mr Trump, giving him an extra round of headlines.
Now Mr DeSantis is out of the picture, as well. Like Mr Ramaswamy, he has endorsed Mr Trump, although with a bit less fervour. The Florida governor reserved most of his passion for Ms Haley - and not in a good way.
He called the former US ambassador to the UN part of ""the old Republican guard of yesteryear - a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism"". It was a line of attack - Haley the elite-loving globalist - that has been the centrepiece of Mr Trump's attack on his former Cabinet member over the past few days.
It took six days for the DeSantis campaign to churn through the stages of political grief and arrive at acceptance. But his decision to back out when he did, and the way he did, might have helped sealed Mr Trump's victory.
This video can not be played
Watch: Highs and lows of Ron DeSantis's presidential bid
Most public-opinion surveys indicate that a clear majority of voters who support Mr DeSantis view Mr Trump as the next best option, suggesting that his withdrawal will end up being a boon to the former president.
A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released earlier on Sunday, for instance, found 62% of those in the state who backed Mr DeSantis named Mr Trump as their second choice, while only 30% named Ms Haley.
Those aren't great numbers for the former South Carolina governor who has been focusing on New Hampshire for months as the place she believes will give her campaign the boost necessary to seriously challenge Mr Trump.
In theory, her strategy was sound. The state's Republican primary is open to independent voters as well as members of the party, allowing moderates who may not like Mr Trump's brand of conservative populism to have a say. The state also has a higher number of college graduates in its population, 37%, which is one of Ms Haley's strongest demographics.
She's seen her support rise in the state over recent months, as she's become the clear alternative for those who don't favour the former president. There's little doubt she brings the people skills that DeSantis lacked and has also chosen a different path to the former Florida governor, who positioned himself to the right of Mr Trump.
In policy and tone, her campaign has been described as something of a throwback to a pre-Trump era in the Republican Party. There is more compromise in her message and she has largely stayed away from grievance politics and conspiracy theories. And she supports continuing US funding of the Ukraine war.
But not being Trump and delivering a more moderate message may not be enough.
If she fails to beat him in New Hampshire, it is difficult to see where she might prevail - even in her South Carolina home, where the former president is immensely popular and has the support of almost every other state Republican official.
The lament among anti-Trump Republicans has always been that a majority in the party didn't want to see him as the nominee again, but the field against him was simply too divided. If they could only unite behind one candidate, the argument went, victory would be within reach.
In New Hampshire, on Tuesday, that theory will finally be put to the test."
7AKCJEZI5A_PV9SX07B453D73I,Ex-Fujitsu boss admits calling Horizon 'Fort Knox',_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68068949,"A former head of Fujitsu UK has admitted that he told former Post Office boss, Paula Vennells, that the Horizon IT system was like ""Fort Knox"".
However, Duncan Tait told the BBC his comment was not related to who had remote access to Post Office branch accounts.
Ms Vennells informed MPs in 2020 that she was told branch accounts could only be changed by sub-postmasters.
However, it has since emerged the accounts could be accessed remotely.
A public inquiry into the Post Office scandal is currently ongoing.
In a statement to the BBC, Mr Tait said: ""As the public inquiry is already aware, I did refer to Fort Knox in a conversation with Paula Vennells - this was in relation to the cyber and physical security of Horizon and was unrelated to the remote access issue.""
More than 900 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted after the faulty Horizon software wrongly made it look like money was missing from their branches.
Some sub-postmasters and postmistresses were jailed, others were bankrupted and some have since died following what has been described as the biggest miscarriage of justice in UK history.
Last week, Nick Read, chief executive of the Post Office, was criticised for not knowing when the company first knew that remote access to sub-postmasters' Horizon systems was possible.
When prosecutions were taking place, Fujitsu had told the Post Office that no-one, apart from sub-postmasters themselves, could access or alter Horizon records - meaning the blame for mistakes could only rest with sub-postmasters. But that turned out to be untrue.
Speaking to MPs on the Business Committee four years ago, Ms Vennells said: ""I remember being told by Fujitsu's then chief executive when I raised it with him that the system was 'like Fort Knox'"" - a reference to the US military base which holds a large proportion of the US's gold reserves.
""He had been a trusted outsource partner and had the reputation of a highly competent technology sector chief executive,"" she said. ""His word was important to me.""
The scandal has been pushed back into the spotlight following the ITV drama Mr Bates vs the Post Office.
In his statement, Mr Tait said: ""As I have said before, I am appalled by the harsh treatment of the sub-postmasters and postmistresses.
""I fully support the inquiry and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further ahead of giving my evidence.
""This has been a terrible miscarriage of justice and like others at Fujitsu, I am sorry for the damage that has been done to the sub-postmasters and postmistresses' lives and any role that Fujitsu played in that.""
Last week, the boss of Fujitsu's European arm, Paul Paterson, told the public inquiry into the scandal that the company had ""clearly let society down, and the sub-postmasters down"".
Mr Patterson admitted there had been ""bugs, errors and defects"" with the Horizon software ""right from the very start"".
Why were hundreds of Post Office workers prosecuted?"
7KP28B45A6_E5XIU64S46TG08I,Gaza war: ICJ to rule on call for Israel to stop military action,By Anna Holligan and Raffi Berg,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68059715,"The UN's top court is to decide whether to issue emergency measures ordering Israel to halt its operations in Gaza.
The session of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Friday is part of a case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel is committing genocide.
Both countries testified when the case opened two weeks ago. Israel has vehemently rejected the allegation.
A ruling against Israel is not enforceable by the court but would be politically significant.
More than 25,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed and tens of thousands injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, since Israel began its offensive, triggered by an unprecedented attack on Israel by the group.
The Hamas attack on 7 October killed about 1,300 people, mainly civilians. The attackers also took about 250 people back to Gaza as hostages.
South Africa, which strongly supports the Palestinians, asked the court to issue nine provisional measures, including a halt to military activity by Israel, while it considers the accusation of genocide. A ruling on the latter is not expected for a long time, possibly years.
Israel reacted with outrage to the genocide allegation, accusing South Africa of distorting the truth. It said it had a right to defend itself and was targeting Hamas fighters, not Palestinian civilians.
It asked the judges to dismiss South Africa's request which it said was based on ""grossly distorted"" and baseless allegations of a non-existent genocide.
In reaching a ruling on Friday, the 17 judges - 15 permanent justices, plus one each from South Africa and Israel - must answer two questions:
Also, the judges are not limited to South Africa's specific requests. The panel could simply instruct Israel to ensure its actions comply with international law and to ensure that it does not do anything to impede deliveries of food, water or medicines.
The ICJ, though, only has the power to issue advisory opinions. And while its rulings are in theory legally binding, they are not enforceable by the court. If Friday's ruling go against Israel, it is almost certain to be ignored.
It would, however, place additional political pressure on Israel to work towards a ceasefire, and will intensify pressure on Israel's strongest international allies to do what they can behind the scenes to find a resolution and guarantee humanitarian assistance gets to where it is needed."
866ZF430HZ_UUBITBR9HL1H2SN,Death penalty: Kenneth Eugene Smith says wait for untested execution like 'torture',By Tom Bateman,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68053917,"Kenneth Eugene Smith is set to become the first person in the US to be executed by nitrogen gas. As he spends his final days on death row, he says he is haunted by thoughts of the untested procedure.
Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of methods of execution, which could upset some readers.
The first time Kenneth Eugene Smith was about to die, Alabama's executioners had several hours to kill him.
They bound the condemned man to a gurney in the so-called ""death chamber"" of Holman Correctional Facility and tried to inject him with a lethal blend of chemicals.
But they failed.
Unable to raise a vein, which Smith's lawyers said left him with numerous incisions, they abandoned the attempt as the clock hit midnight and the state's death warrant expired.
That was November 2022. Now, Alabama will try to kill him again.
This time, the US state has authorised a plan to suffocate Smith by strapping an air-tight mask over his face and forcing him to inhale pure nitrogen, an inert gas that would starve his body of oxygen.
The UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights last week said the never-before-used method could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and called for a halt.
A final appeal ruling is still outstanding after a federal court rejected his lawyers' request for an injunction. Smith is due to be executed on Thursday.
Smith was one of two men convicted in 1989 of murdering a preacher's wife, Elizabeth Sennett, who was stabbed and beaten to death in a $1,000 (Â£786) killing-for-hire. He is one of the only men in modern America to be taken twice for execution, and the first to face nitrogen gassing.
""My body is simply breaking down, I keep losing weight,"" Smith told the BBC in a written answer to questions we put to him via an intermediary.
Face-to-face meetings between journalists and death row prisoners are prohibited in Alabama. We reached him by telephone late last week, but he asked not to proceed with an interview as he said he had become seriously unwell.
""I'm nauseous all the time. Panic attacks hit regularly... This is just a small part of what I've been dealing with daily. Torture, basically,"" he wrote. He called for Alabama to ""stop [the execution]. Before it's too late"".
The state maintains that nitrogen gas execution will cause unconsciousness quickly but it has not presented any plausible evidence.
Medical experts and campaigners have warned about the risk of catastrophic mishaps, ranging from violent convulsions to survival in a vegetative state, and even the possibility of gas leaking from the mask and killing others in the room, including Mr Smith's religious advocate.
""I'm certain that Kenny's not afraid to die, he's made that very clear. But I think he's afraid that he will be even further tortured in the process,"" says his spiritual advisor Rev Dr Jeff Hood. He has signed a legal waiver from the state spelling out the dangers of a nitrogen leak.
""I'll be a number of feet from him, and I have been warned repeatedly by various medical experts that I'm risking my life to do this. If there's any sort of leak in the hose, if there's any sort of leak from the mask, from the seal around his face, it could certainly lead to nitrogen leaking into the room,"" Dr Hood told the BBC.
That amounts to an intolerable level of danger, says one expert who co-authored an investigation sent to the UN.
Nitrogen makes up 78% of the air we breathe, passing in and out of the body harmlessly with every breath. But breathing pure nitrogen slowly deprives the body's cells and organs of oxygen, causing them to break down and eventually leading to death, said Dr Joel Zivot, an associate professor in anaesthesiology at Emory University's School of Medicine.
He warns of unintended risks from the presence of pure nitrogen changing the oxygen-to-nitrogen ratio in the execution chamber, especially as Smith could hold his breath or move his head against the mask, or the equipment could leak.
""Some of it will be exhaled [by Smith] along with carbon dioxide and some of it may leak out of the mask. And I think that that presents a real and material danger to this execution,"" Dr Zivot said.
The Alabama Department of Corrections appears to have attempted to address this concern in the waiver form it sent to Dr Hood.
It says there are ""wall-mounted oxygen sensors"" in the execution chamber. But it also warns the spiritual advisor of the generic risks posed when nitrogen rapidly displaces oxygen causing ""loss of consciousness without warning"". It urges him to stay at least three feet away from Smith at all times, warning of a ""small area risk"" of ""nitrogen outflow"".
Dr Zivot believes the risk assessment amounts to a form of pseudo science, since execution by nitrogen has never been attempted, and it is not clear how long it will take Smith to die.
""There is no science. This is just really pulling anecdotes and imagining and trying to think of what may occur based upon, again, other pieces of information that are really not at all a scientific inquiry.""
Dr Zivot also accused the Alabama authorities of a ""terrible"" track record of ""cruel"" executions.
""I guess I have to conclude that Kenneth Smith must be the worst man in America, because Alabama is so hell bent on killing him, that they're willing to kill other people to kill him,"" Dr Zivot told the BBC.
""Imagine the firing squad where all the witnesses are lined up next to the person you're about to execute, and you get them all to sign waivers, because it turns out that the guys you've got are not very good shots, and so it's possible that they might shoot you too. So these are some of the things I can imagine that could happen with nitrogen gas,"" he said.
""What we do know about nitrogen gas is that in an early study with healthy volunteers, almost all of them at about 15 into 20 seconds of breathing had a generalised seizure,"" he said.
In such a scenario, Smith could lose consciousness or suffer a series of violent spasms.
Alabama has one of the highest per capita execution rates in the US and has 165 people currently on death row.
Since 2018, the state has been responsible for three botched attempts at lethal injection in which the condemned inmates survived. The failures led to an internal review which largely placed blame on the prisoners themselves.
It said their lawyers had tried to save their lives by ""running out the clock"" with eleventh hour court appeals for stays of execution. The review said this caused ""unnecessary deadline pressure"" for their executioners.
This time, the team will get a longer ""time frame,"" rather than a midnight deadline, to execute Smith.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, who has the power to halt judicial killings, declined to comment on the expert warnings and the allegations against the state. The Attorney General's office called the UN's concerns ""as unfounded as Smith's"".
It said in a statement: ""The trial court examined Smith's challenge, heard from multiple medical experts, and determined that Smith's concerns about nitrogen hypoxia were 'speculative' and 'theoretical'.""
It added: ""We intend to proceed with his execution on January 25th.""
Republican state lawmaker Reed Ingram, who voted in favour of authorising execution by nitrogen gas, rejected the UN's criticism.
""I don't know about degrading, I don't know about inhumane, I think we're improving. I think the process may be better than what he did to the victim,"" he told the BBC.
""Our governor is a Christian. She's debated this whole thing and she thinks it's measured. I'm sure it's heavy on her mind, but it's the law,"" he said.
The BBC approached the family of Elizabeth Sennett, who said they would not make any comment until Thursday.
In 1996 a jury recommended life in prison without parole for Smith, but the judge overruled them and sentenced him to death. At his trial he admitted to being present when the victim was killed, but says he did not take part in the attack.

8SHFJVOJNL_PMWWXENFBDV76IS,Ukraine death toll rises to 18 after Russian missile attacks,By Sarah Rainsford in Kyiv & Paul Kirby,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68066309,"This video can not be played
Watch: Man pulled from rubble of home in Kharkiv
Eighteen people were killed and 130 injured in Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian cities on Tuesday morning, President Volodymyr Zelensky says.
He said 139 houses were damaged, and the death toll could rise as more people may be trapped under the rubble.
Officials in Ukraine's second biggest city of Kharkiv in the north-east, earlier said eight people were killed, including an eight-year-old girl.
In Pavlohrad, central Dnipropetrovsk region, one woman was killed.
In the capital Kyiv, 22 people were injured, and a number of cars set on fire, local officials said earlier.
""Ordinary life is what modern Russia considers a threat to itself. This state is a typical terrorist,"" President Zelensky said in his video address on Tuesday night.
Kharkiv was particularly badly hit in the morning attacks, with Mayor Ihor Terekhov saying that part of a block of flats was destroyed and rescue workers were searching the rubble for survivors.
The sky over the city turned burnt orange with fire after the strikes, which used multiple kinds of Russian missiles. The city is very close to the Russian border - it's difficult to intercept the missiles in the air.
Kharkiv resident Natalia told the BBC she doesn't remember things being this ""loud"" since the start of the war: ""My house shook. It was all very loud. There were explosions, then another ten seconds - and another bang.""
""Many people are without power and heating. Other than fear and hatred, at this moment I feel nothing,"" she said.
On Tuesday evening, another seven people were injured in a new Russian missile attack, Mr Terekhov said.
In Kyiv, the air raid went on for more than two-and-a-half hours in the morning, the longest since 2 January. Several other people were hurt when a block of flats caught fire and another was damaged.
A spokesman said a young woman was pulled from the rubble. Initially rescuers thought she had died, but she is now in hospital in intensive care. Most of the casualties were in Kyiv's central Solomianskyi and western Sviatoshynskyi districts.
In Sviatoshynskyi district, several residential buildings were damaged. Hours after the attacks, emergency services told the BBC they were still on the scene and looking for explosives as it was suspected there may be part of a missile that did not detonate.
Three other regions of Kyiv were also damaged by falling debris after air defences intercepted the Russian missiles during the attack. The office of mayor Vitaliy Klitschko said 13 people - including three children - were being treated in hospital.
Elsewhere in the city, when the attack was over, city residents emerged from their bomb shelters and homes to check the damage.
In areas lucky enough not to be hit this time, people went about their morning as usual. Shops opened up, and roads and streets were busy.
At a hospital the BBC visited, staff kept working through the air raid, even though they heard the explosions and felt the doors rattle.
But at the site of the missile attack on Tuesday afternoon, emergency workers were picking through the debris where large fragments fell on a block of flats.
All the flats at one end of the building were blackened by fire, some of the balconies badly smashed. There were piles of furniture and belongings in the snow in the street.
Behind the police cordon, local residents, including curious children, were also examining the damage.
Tetyana, who had come from a few streets away, said her family had spent the early morning air raid in the bathroom of their flat - hoping they would be safer, further from any windows.
""At the start of the war we thought we would get used to this, but you never do,"" she told the BBC. ""It's scary every single time."" A few months ago, their own building was damaged by shrapnel when a drone was shot down over the city.
Ukraine's military said it had destroyed 22 of 44 ballistic and cruise missiles launched by Russia overnight.
Missile strikes on Ukraine's cities are now a deadly reality of this war and attacks have intensified in recent weeks.
Reflecting Ukrainian concerns that its demands for weapons are not being met by Western allies, the head of the presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, published a video of the damage in Kharkiv and said: ""Kharkiv. We are not just a 'fortress'. We need weapons!""
Ukrainian forces have in the past week targeted Russian energy infrastructure, including unprecedented attacks on an oil terminal in its second city St Petersburg.
Energy company Novatek has had to halt some of its operations after a fire at its Ust-Luga Baltic Sea export complex."
8URPQK7JYY_JMYE61ZKDKLIB3C,Russian jet crashes carrying Ukrainian PoWs - Moscow,By Laura Gozzi & Paul Kirby,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68080529,"This video can not be played
The BBC has verified this video showing the moment a Russian aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region
A Russian Ilyushin-76 military transport plane has crashed in the southern Belgorod region near Ukraine.
Russia's ministry of defence said 65 captured Ukrainian military were on the plane heading to the area for a prisoner exchange.
Ukrainian military intelligence later released a statement accusing Russia of putting the lives of prisoners of war at risk.
It said it had not been told it had to ensure safe airspace over Belgorod.
The Ukrainian statement is being seen as a tacit acknowledgement that it shot the plane down.
Ria Novosti news agency said another nine people were on the plane, including six crew.
Video shared on social media showed a plane going down followed by an explosion and a fireball near the village of Yablonovo, 70km (44 miles) to the north-east of the city of Belgorod, at around 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT).
The regional governor in Russia's Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, said the plane crashed in a field near a residential area and that everyone on board had died.
Ukraine's general staff, quoted by the Ukrainska Pravda website, said initially that the plane was transporting missiles for Russia's S-300 air defence systems. It made no mention of prisoners of war.
None of the details surrounding those on board can be independently verified, but Ukraine's military intelligence appeared to acknowledge that Ukrainian captive soldiers may have been on board.
It said in a statement it was Russia's responsibility ""to ensure the safety of our defenders under the agreements that had been reached"", but that on this occasion it had not been informed that the airspace had to be safeguarded ""at the defined time"", as on numerous previous occasions.
""This can point to Russia's deliberate actions aimed at putting the lives and safety of the PoWs under threat,"" it added.
Ahead of the planned prisoner exchange, Ukrainian officials said the captured Russian military servicemen were ""delivered to the agreed location in time to be exchanged, and they were safe there"".
Russia's defence ministry said the swap had been due to take place on Wednesday afternoon at a border checkpoint 100km to the west of Belgorod.
The defence ministry said a military transport plane had taken off from Chkalovsky air base north-east of Moscow en route to Belgorod, alleging that Ukraine's air force had fired two anti-aircraft missiles from the Lyptsi area south of the Ukrainian border.
The Ukrainian government body in charge of prisoners of war warned that Russia was ""actively carrying out special information operations against Ukraine, which are aimed at destabilising Ukrainian society"".
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's parliamentary human rights commissioner, appealed to Ukrainians to trust only official sources: ""Do not be fooled by provocations. More detailed information will be provided later.""
Andrei Kartapolov, chairman of Russia's parliamentary defence committee, claimed there had been a second plane in the air transporting 80 Ukrainian prisoners, although that plane had then changed course.
""There can now be no talk of any other [prisoner] exchanges,"" Mr Kartapolov told Russian TV.
Ukraine and Russia have taken part in a number of prisoner exchanges since the start of the war.
The biggest swap so far took place earlier this month, when Ukraine freed 248 Russian prisoners of war and Russia released 230 people in a deal mediated by the United Arab Emirates.
More than 8,000 Ukrainians, both civilian and military, are still being held by Russia, according to Ukraine's Coordination HQ on the Treatment of PoWs, which says tens of thousands of others are still missing.
A nationwide air raid alert was briefly in place across Ukraine shortly after news of the Il-76 crash emerged.
Belgorod, which is located approximately 25 miles (40km) north of the border with Ukraine, has suffered dozens of casualties from air strikes and drones since the war in Ukraine began.
In December, 25 people were killed and 100 were injured following an air strike - although Ukraine insisted that only military infrastructure had been targeted and blamed Russian air defences for fragments falling on the city.
Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and the war is grinding on as it approaches its third year.
Last week, Russia claimed to have captured a village close to the devastated city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. Kyiv has not confirmed the claim.
Meanwhile, Russian air attacks have intensified in recent weeks. On Tuesday, 18 people were killed and 130 were injured in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.
Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov has warned that while Ukrainian forces are suffering from a shortage of ammunition, Russia has used more than 600 missiles and more than 1,000 drones in the past two months.
For its part, Ukraine is fighting mostly by using drones. At the weekend, a drone attack caused an explosion at a major gas export terminal near the city of St Petersburg.

917YTI3G84_LJB6FETMTMGX1SB,Mr Ibu's hospital funds: Children of Nollywood actor John Okafor arrested,By Mansur Abubakar,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68098357,"Two of popular Nigerian actor John Okafor's children have been arrested for allegedly stealing money raised to pay for his hospital fees last year.
Known as Mr Ibu, the 62-year-old had a leg amputated in November after fans had donated to a crowd-funding scheme.
His son Daniel Okafor and adopted daughter Jasmine Chioma are accused of hacking into his phone and taking $60,700 (Â£47,800) for themselves.
The pair have not commented since their arrest in the city of Lagos.
The police issued a statement about their arrest and their investigation into the alleged fraud after the siblings appeared at a bailing hearing on Thursday.
A court said the two could be freed if a $17,000 bond was posted. They remain in custody.
The police's criminal investigation unit said it had discovered that they had allegedly installed an app on their father's phone after the fund-raising began.
This allegedly enabled them to start transferring money out of his account.
They are expected to appear in court on 11 March for the next hearing.
Mr Ibu's health issues first came to public attention last October, when the family posted a video on social media of the Nollywood star celebrating in hospital. In the clip he asked his fans for help with medical bills, eliciting a huge response.
The actor became famous 20 years ago in the Nigerian comedy Mr Ibu - which became his nickname. It is still regarded as one of the best Nigerian performances in a comic role.
He went on to act in several other notable movies in Nollywood, as Nigeria's multi-billion-dollar film industry is known, in a career that has spanned more than two decades.
The star told a local newspaper a few years ago that he had a total of 13 children some of whom were adopted.

95DOX3HEQY_KA5ZK1DLOOJGTSE,The bomb-hunters scouring UK waters for unexploded weapons,By Laurence Cawley,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-67946213,"Hundreds of thousands of unexploded bombs and mines carpet the seabed off the UK's coast. Many are known about and mapped, but plenty more are not, posing a potential danger to those working at sea. It is Lee Gooderham's business to find them.
The map projected onto a screen at an industrial estate in Norfolk is the result of 12 years' work.
As Mr Gooderham, founder of Hethel-based Ordtek, zooms in on the English Channel and the southern North Sea, thousands of tiny red dots emerge like scattered confetti.
""Each of those dots is a reported munition,"" he says. ""We are talking hundreds of thousands of items.""
What the map does not show are all the unknown munitions still lurking on the seabed.
""We are finding unexploded ordnance and dealing with it on a daily basis,"" Mr Gooderham says.
""There are many that we don't know about.""
Despite being dropped - or dumped - decades ago, unexploded ordnance (UXO) continues to pose a very real danger to those working in our waters.
""The real problem is when fishing vessels and dredgers encounter unexploded ordnance,"" says Mr Gooderham.
""That is when it becomes dangerous.""
In 2020, fishing vessel Galwad-Y-Mor was thrown into the air when a World War Two bomb exploded 25 miles (40km) north of Cromer, Norfolk.
Five crew members were injured, including one left blinded in one eye.
Skipper Lewis Mulhearn, 39, won a bravery award for saving the lives of his crew.
Mr Mulhearn, who suffered multiple injuries, died in January 2023.
Mr Gooderham's clients, however, are not from the fishing industry, but the offshore and renewables sector.
""Some of their early sites in particular were in high-risk UXO areas, such as Thames Gateway, Gunfleet Sands and those type of areas,"" says Mr Gooderham, whose firm is one of a small number offering consultancy for UXO.
""All of a sudden they were looking to put cables and assets out into the sea in these high-risk areas and, of course, they hadn't really considered that there could be UXO there.
""Scroby Sands, Gunfleet Sands, London Array - all of those got built, very near shore, in high-risk areas.""
The job of finding UXO starts with desk-based work and archive research.
""Once we know there is a risk there and there is a problem, a survey is carried out,"" Mr Gooderham says.
""This involves sending out a vessel with geophysical equipment, a magnetometer, and we oversee that - we are on board the vessel.
""We'll get the data back to the office where it will be processed and they'll say 'We think this is a bomb, that is a bomb, this is a bomb - you need to do something about it.'""
If bombs can be avoided by a minimum of 10m (32ft), they can be left in situ.
""By the time it is on the seabed, it is safe. It is not going to blow up, unless it is interfered with,"" says Mr Gooderham.
""If it cannot be avoided, we use another vessel with a remotely-operated underwater vehicle (ROV).""
Before munitions are detonated, the ROV gently moves sea life, such as crabs and lobsters, out of harm's way.
An example of the bomb-hunting process hangs on the wall of Ordtek's offices.
The munition fragment was found at Race Bank, off the Norfolk coast.
""In this situation we had this target, we predicted it was a bomb and it was, it was this German mine in 25m (82ft) of water, 700kg (1,500lbs) of explosives,"" says Mr Gooderham.
""It made a 50m (164ft) to 70m (229ft) plume when detonated.""
Once the item is destroyed, any debris over 30cm (12in) wide must be collected and properly disposed of.
The whole process, says Mr Gooderham, can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.
""What is really interesting is when we get abnormal finds, like these dump sites that we did not know were there,"" he says.
""On one project we came across a 4,000lb (1,800kg) bomb, which is very rare. It was a very big bomb, it was British but why it was there we just don't know.
""It was so big it could not be destroyed because of various permit-related issues. It remains there and it is monitored. That was a surprise - when you find a 4,000-pounder, it is a big moment.
""The largest ones you usually come across are the 1,000lb (450kg) bombs.
""The German munitions we come across are often as good as the day they were dropped. The integrity of the explosive within remains intact.""
But clearing the entire seabed would be nearly impossible, he says.
""The German government is looking at this at the moment and it is an unbelievable task.
""They predicted it would take 300 years to clear the seabed of munitions from World War Two and it would cost numbers that are off the chart.
""The interesting thing we are seeing are the numbers of unrecorded dump sites all the way from Gunfleet Sands up to the Hornsea Project, which are level with Hull.
""It is not a very good look for the British military; at the end of World War Two, they just got rid of it.""
While the renewables and offshore energy sectors pay for the work of firms like Ordtek, Mr Gooderham is keen his team's mine-mapping work is available to others working at sea.
They include people like fourth-generation fisherman Steve Stoker, who has caught dozens of unexploded bombs off the Essex coast.
""I caught two in a week once,"" says Mr Stoker.
""You usually know when you've caught a bomb in your nets and you mark it on your GPS and keep away.
""We don't come across them as often now, mainly because we don't wander as far, because there is not as much fish about so we tend to stick in one area.""
His great aunt and great uncle, Horace and Lily Stoker, were killed by a mine in the 1940s while out trawling.
""I know of a couple of boats which have had a bomb explode. One, in Lowestoft, had the bomb go off in the net and it blew the engine off its bed,"" he says.
He also remembers the days when fishermen were paid for the UXO they came across.
""We used to get a lot of unexploded bombs at the entrance to the Thames,"" Mr Stoker says. ""We used to get money for it because they did not want us to chuck them away.
""The Royal Navy used to come down. They'd stay at The Victory [a pub]; they were good old boys and we had some good laughs with them.
""You would put a buoy on it and then leave them [the ordnance] somewhere shallow, take the Royal Navy out to them and they would set the charge and you'd go a certain distance out and they would detonate it.
""They used to go a hell of a way up in the air.
""Then it all changed and they didn't want you to take them out any more - instead they wanted the police to take them out.""
Despite the inherent dangers of unexploded munitions, Mr Stoker says he has ""never been worried about them, really"".
""I used to take a day off from school to go out with my dad and blow a bomb up,"" he says.
""It was quite a regular thing. I learned not to be afraid of them and to not worry.""
A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ""At the end of World War Two, munitions were disposed of in a variety of places and they continue to be discovered to this day.
""Our explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) teams always respond and deal appropriately with any materials discovered.""

97HT56NS0M_QRCKHF5IC298TCL,Boeing boss faces Washington grilling after blow-out,By Natalie Sherman & Tom Espiner,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68082728,"The head of Boeing is facing questions from lawmakers in Washington as pressure mounts to explain the mistakes that led to a panel breaking off one of its planes this month.
Boss Dave Calhoun told reporters ahead of the meetings that he was prepared to share ""everything I can"".
But he declined to comment on a report that said the part had been improperly installed at one of the firm's plants.
The anonymous account was posted online and reported by the Seattle Times.
The post, from someone claiming to work at Boeing, described the production of Boeing's 737 planes as ""a rambling, shambling, disaster waiting to happen"".
It said the firm's records showed that the four bolts meant to hold the door plug in place were not installed when Boeing delivered the 737 Max 9 plane to customer Alaska Airlines.
On 5 Jan, just eight weeks later, the panel blew off shortly after take-off, terrifying passengers, and forcing an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport.
No serious injuries were reported but lawsuits have been filed by customers since the incident, accusing the company of negligence.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has grounded 171 other 737 Max 9 planes with similar designs for inspection, forcing the cancellation of thousands of flights.
It also recently recommended airlines inspect Boeing's older 737-900ER models, which use the same door design as Max 9s, though it did not order the planes out of service.
The whistleblower account said Boeing should have halted 737 manufacturing due to an ""alarming"" number of issues surfacing on the planes during inspections.
In the case of this particular plane, it said Boeing and Spirit staff at a Boeing factory in Washington worked to identify and repair issues ahead of the delivery. The whistleblower says that in the course of that work, the bolts were removed.
But according to the post, a final inspection of the door never occurred, which the account blames on a breakdown in communication, in part due to Boeing's use of two different computer systems to report and sign-off on issues.
Boeing staff were the ones who removed the bolts, according to The Seattle Times, which said the information was from a different anonymous source.
Mr Calhoun referred questions to the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the incident.
Leaders at Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which have two of the biggest 737 Max 9 fleets, have expressed major frustration with Boeing as the groundings create chaos and added costs.
In an interview with NBC News, Alaska Airlines boss Ben Minicucci said there was ""no doubt"" that the aeroplane came ""off the production line with a faulty door"". He said airline inspections since the incident found ""many"" loose bolts.
""I'm more than frustrated and disappointed,"" he said. ""I am angry.""
The comments underscore the difficult task ahead of Boeing to restore confidence among its airline customers and the flying public, which had already been shaken after fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving its planes killed 346 people.
The FAA is currently investigating Boeing's manufacturing process and reviewing its current system for approving planes, which delegates some of those powers to Boeing.
Online travel agent Kayak recently reported that searches from users trying to avoid Boeing 737 Max planes had jumped 15-fold since the accident.
Mr Calhoun told reporters that he recognised the seriousness of the concerns.
""We fly safe planes - we don't put [aeroplanes] in the air we don't have 100% confidence in,"" he said. ""I'm here today in the spirit of transparency.""
The incident has drawn attention to other issues cropping up on Boeing planes, including the nose wheel of a different Boeing plane model, a 757, which popped off as it was lining up for takeoff in the US on Saturday.
None of the 184 passengers or six crew members were hurt when the wheel fell off the Delta Air Lines flight from Atlanta and rolled down a hill, the FAA said in a notice.
The plane had been scheduled to fly to Bogota in Colombia, and passengers were put on a replacement flight, Delta Air Lines said.
It apologised to customers, and said the ""event remains under investigation"".
Boeing, which ended 757 deliveries in 2004, declined to comment on the incident.
Responding to the ongoing situation with Max 9s, Boeing's Stan Deal, its chief executive of commercial aeroplanes, said the plane maker had ""let down our airline customers and are deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers"".
A spokesman said the firm had ""announced a series of immediate actions to strengthen quality"" including more inspections.
Boeing has also named a retired US Navy admiral, Kirkland H. Donald, to lead a comprehensive quality review of its commercial aeroplane operation.

980PQS2Q25_F5RYQEGJULQFWS7,Namibia's President Hage Geingob going to US for cancer treatment,_,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68081732,"Namibia's President Hage Geingob, 82, is flying to the US to receive ""specialised"" medical treatment for cancer, his office has said.
It comes less than a week after his office said that medical tests revealed that he had ""cancerous cells"".
The 82-year-old would receive ""novel therapy"" in the US for a week, before returning to continue with his treatment in Namibia, his office added.
Vice-President Nangolo Mumba will be acting president during his absence.
Concerns about Mr Geingob's health have been growing, with reports saying that he admitted last year that he had become frail.
""You see how I'm standing here? It means I'm tired and I'm not feeling well,"" the privately owned Namibian newspaper quoted him as telling journalists.
Mr Geingob is due to step down at the end of his two terms later this year.
In a statement on Tuesday, the vice-president of the governing Swapo party, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, said Mr Geingob was in ""good spirits"" and receiving ""good medical attention"".
She appealed to Namibians to allow Mr Geingob and his family to focus on his recovery and healing process without speculation.
The president's office said he would return from the US on 2 February, and 95% of the treatment for the cancerous cells would be carried out in Namibia.
Last week, it said that doctors had done a colonoscopy and a gastroscopy on the president. This was followed by a biopsy, which revealed cancerous cells.
His office did not give further details of Mr Geingob's condition, but said at the time that he would continue with his presidential duties.
Mr Geingob underwent an aortic operation last year, while in 2014 he revealed that he had survived prostate cancer.
Namibia is due to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in November.
Swapo, which has been in power since independence in 1990, has chosen Mrs Nandi-Ndaitwah as its presidential candidate.
She is currently also Namibia's deputy prime minister, and will become the country's first female president if she wins.

9MPKER9P50_GHM1WAKUJTCZKOF,"Russia risked lives in downed plane, Volodymyr Zelensky says",By Laura Gozzi & Paul Kirby,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68083739,"This video can not be played
The BBC has verified this video showing the moment a Russian aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Moscow of ""playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners"", after a deadly plane crash in western Russia.
He demanded an international inquiry after Wednesday's crash in the Belgorod region near Ukraine's border.
Russia said there were no survivors after Kyiv had downed the Il-76 plane with 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, six Russian crew and three escorts.
Moscow claimed the Ukrainians were being flown for a prisoner exchange.
Ukraine's military intelligence (GUR) said it had not been told to ensure safe airspace, as on previous occasions.
The GUR comments have been seen as a tacit acknowledgement that Ukraine shot the military transport plane down, although it stressed it had no reliable information about who was on board and warned the incident may have involved ""planned and deliberate actions by Russia"".
In his video address late on Wednesday, President Zelensky said it was ""obvious that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, with the feelings of their relatives and with the emotions of our society"".
The Ukrainian leader, who has cancelled a planned regional trip linked to his birthday on Thursday, stressed that ""all clear facts must be established"".
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov condemned the downing of the plane as a ""monstrous act"", according to Russian news agencies. He told reporters that if Mr Zelensky meant an international inquiry into ""the criminal actions of the Kyiv regime"", it was definitely needed.
Video shared on social media showed a plane going down followed by an explosion and a fireball near the village of Yablonovo, 70km (44 miles) to the north-east of the city of Belgorod, at about 11:00 local time (08:00 GMT).
Belgorod regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said the plane crashed in a field near a residential area and that everyone on board had died.
Ukraine's general staff, quoted by the Ukrainska Pravda website, said initially that the plane was transporting missiles for Russia's S-300 air defence systems. It made no mention of PoWs.

On this occasion it said it had not been informed that the airspace had to be safeguarded ""at the defined time, which is something that had happened on numerous occasions before"".
""This can point to Russia's deliberate actions aimed at putting the lives and safety of the PoWs under threat,"" it added.
Ukraine and Russia have taken part in a number of prisoner swaps since the start of the war.
Ukrainian air force chief Mykola Oleschuk warned that throughout Wednesday Russian propaganda had tried to discredit Ukraine internationally. Ukraine had the right to destroy Russia's means of aerial attacks, he said.
Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's second city Kharkiv with S-300 guided missiles from the Belgorod region in recent days.
Eight people were killed in a series of missiles strikes on Tuesday and another attack was launched overnight into Thursday.
Ahead of Wednesday's planned prisoner exchange, Ukrainian officials said the captured Russian military servicemen were ""delivered to the agreed location in time to be exchanged, and they were safe there"".
Russia's defence ministry said the swap had been due to take place on Wednesday afternoon at a border checkpoint 100km (60 miles) to the west of Belgorod.
The ministry said a military transport plane had taken off from Chkalovsky air base north-east of Moscow en route to Belgorod, alleging that Ukraine's air force had fired two anti-aircraft missiles from the Lyptsi area south of the Ukrainian border.

""There can now be no talk of any other [prisoner] exchanges,"" Mr Kartapolov told Russian TV.
The biggest prisoner exchange since the start of the war took place earlier this month, when Ukraine freed 248 Russian prisoners of war and Russia released 230 people in a deal mediated by the United Arab Emirates.
More than 8,000 Ukrainians, both civilian and military, are still being held by Russia, according to Ukraine's Coordination HQ on the Treatment of PoWs, which says tens of thousands of others are still missing.
Belgorod, which is located approximately 25 miles (40km) north of the border with Ukraine, has suffered dozens of casualties from air strikes and drones since the war in Ukraine began.
In December, 25 people were killed and 100 were injured following an air strike - although Ukraine insisted that only military infrastructure had been targeted and blamed Russian air defences for fragments falling on the city.
Russia's war in Ukraine is grinding on as it approaches its third year.
Last week, Russia claimed to have captured a village close to the devastated city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. Kyiv has not confirmed the claim.
Meanwhile, Russian air attacks have intensified in recent weeks. On Tuesday, 18 people were killed and 130 were injured in missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.

A6CST534U2_6JSB0PAPS6075Z6,Why private helicopters are still in demand,By Michael Dempsey,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67635051,"How many children draw helicopters and aeroplanes dreaming of being pilots or designing their own aircraft one day?
Jason Hill was one such teenager, but he clung on to that vision through aeronautical engineering studies and work in the aviation industry.
His dream was revealed to the world on 7 December when the wraps came off a new helicopter designed by him.
""I felt an overwhelming sense of pride and jubilation,"" Mr Hill says about the grand unveiling. But creating a new helicopter has been a daunting process.
""The sheer volume of difficult things that need to be executed and coordinated makes the task seemingly impossible,"" says Mr Hill.
The five-seater Hill helicopter will be powered by a turbine engine, a small and light jet motor that drives the rotor blades. To keep the weight down the fuselage is made from carbon fibre.
However, with the UK in a cost of living crisis, it seems like a challenging time to launch a luxury product. The Hill machine has a price tag of almost Â£600,000 - cheap for a helicopter, but for most people completely unaffordable.
Nevertheless, there are buyers. Hill has chalked up 1,222 orders worth Â£540m. Those buyers have parted with non-refundable deposits of up to Â£100,000.
And that's all happened before the helicopter's first flight, projected for the middle of this year.
Of course, it's not just Hill that's able to sell luxury transport options.
California's Robinson has popularised helicopter flying with a family of small, two to five seat aircraft that have notched up nearly 14,000 sales for the manufacturer.
Robinson's R66 Turbine costs just over $1m (Â£790,000) and it sees orders increasing, growing from 101 helicopters in 2022, to a projected 120 units for 2023, and 150 in 2024.
The British Helicopter Association's chief executive Tim Fauchon doesn't dispute that helicopter ownership is for the wealthy. ""If you're flying a helicopter you've got a bit of cash behind you.""
However it still makes sense to shell out for such a machine when time is of the essence. ""You buy a helicopter to save time, it's an efficient way of getting from A to B.""
And private helicopter owners can recoup their costs by leasing their machine out to flying schools when they're not using it.
Also, appearing on the horizon, are fresh competitors for the helicopter business.
Electric Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft (Evtol) have been promoted as the answer to a host of regional and urban transport needs with several hundred projects on the go worldwide.
Powered by batteries and often having multiple rotors, Evtol makers say the aircraft will be cheaper, quieter and easier to maintain than helicopters.
The promise is that one day, such aircraft could bring the convenience of helicopter travel to a much bigger market.
Adam Twidell is working out how to integrate Evtol machines into the operations of private jet club Flexjet, which has ordered an Evtol from Brazil's aerospace giant Embraer.
Its Eve Evtol machine will, Flexjet hopes, pick up passengers from private terminals and whizz them into city centres.
More technology of business
The challenge for any new flying machine such as Eve or the HX50 is to win regulatory approval says Mr Twidell. He has no illusions over the extent of testing a new aircraft faces.
""In aviation seeing is not believing. Certification means every single part of the machine has to be certified for safety.""
Can Hill emulate the success of Robinson or beat off the Evtol challenge? Mr Hill's vision involves dispensing with external suppliers and designing and building all components in-house, including the power plant.
The company says 95% of each machine will be constructed in-house, which will result in huge savings, according to Hill.
However industry veterans describe such an approach, as opposed to sourcing parts from established external production lines, as a big challenge.
Hill hopes that it can cut one of the costs of owning a helicopter - the compulsory rebuild that comes after a certain number of hours have been flown.
For a Robinson helicopter with a turbine engine this comes at 2,000 hours and costs $400,000. Hill hopes to stretch that figure to 5,000 hours and replace the engine and gear boxes for $150,000.
Spencer Phillips is head of training at Advance Helicopters, a flying school on England's South Coast.
Advance uses a mix of Robinson helicopters, which he praises as ""a great training aircraft"", but is impressed with the specifications of the Hill helicopter.
He mentions one feature in particular. The Hill aircraft features a fully automated start-up procedure for the tricky task of monitoring temperatures before fuel can be safely pumped into the turning motor.
He explains how this will take a challenging task out of the hands of the private pilot: ""It's far too easy to mess this up with a turbine and melt the engine!"".
He accounts for the rush to pay deposits at Hill by the closed nature of the rotary wing world. ""It's word of mouth in the helicopter community, most of us know each other. Once people started putting deposits down it snowballed."""
ACIOYRTARL_M0ORTUSMAHPNCAL,Dozens reported killed as battle rages in Gaza's Khan Younis,By David Gritten,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68055933,"Dozens of people are reported to have been killed in intense Israeli strikes on Khan Younis in the south Gaza Strip, as battles between soldiers and Hamas fighters rage on the ground.
Residents said tanks had surrounded a hospital and university where thousands of displaced people were sheltering.
Ambulances were also trapped and unable to reach the wounded.
Khan Younis has been a recent focus of Israeli forces, who are convinced top Hamas commanders are holed up there.
On Sunday, the Israeli military said it had found an underground compound in the city where it believed about 20 Israeli hostages had been held.
Meanwhile in Israel, a number of hostages' families on Monday interrupted a finance committee meeting at the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem, to call for the government to do more to secure their release.
One relative shouted: ""We won't let you breathe until our kids come back.""

As the US, Qatar and Egypt try to mediate, Hamas has demanded that Israel ends the war and withdraws its forces before the hostages are released.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected such a deal, saying it would amount to a capitulation to ""monsters"" and mean soldiers had ""fallen in vain"".
But on Monday evening the US news website Axios quoted two US officials as saying Israel had given Hamas a proposal that included a two-month pause in fighting in return for the phased release of all remaining hostages in Gaza.
Hamas gunmen took about 250 people hostage and killed 1,300 others when they carried out an unprecedented cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, Israeli authorities say.
At least 25,295 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli military launched a large-scale air and ground campaign in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. More are believed dead under rubble.
On Monday Israeli tanks were reported to have advanced into western areas of Khan Younis and closed in on the city's two main hospitals following a night of heavy bombardment.
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said Israeli forces were besieging the area around al-Amal Hospital, which it runs, as well as its headquarters and nearby ambulance centre, and that it was deeply concerned about the safety of staff, patients and displaced civilians inside them.
""The area now is extremely dangerous. They are hearing strong bombing in the area,"" spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told Al Jazeera TV. ""Everyone who tries to move out or who goes out in the street is being targeted.""
She added that PRCS ambulances were trapped and unable to respond to reach wounded people in the area, and that a telecommunications blackout meant staff were only able to contact each other via VHF radios.
Smoke was also seen rising and gunfire heard in the vicinity of Nasser Hospital, the largest medical facility still functioning in Gaza.
Palestinian media cited the hospital's surgical director as reporting that it had received 50 dead and more than 100 wounded since the night.
Gaza's health ministry said dozens had been killed or wounded west of Khan Younis on Monday, and that people had been forced to bury 40 bodies inside the grounds of Nasser Hospital because it was not safe outside.
A doctor in the emergency department told Reuters that the hospital was overwhelmed by casualties and ""on the brink of collapse"".
""With the siege on the neighbourhoods close to Nasser [hospital], it is very difficult to deliver medical aid to the hospital, and it is very difficult to continue treating the patients,"" Ahmed Abu Mustafa said, adding that there were ""no pain killers, no anaesthesia, or any medical resources"".
A health ministry spokesman also told Reuters that Israeli troops had stormed the al-Khair Hospital in the al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis.
On Monday White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Israel was obliged under international law to protect innocent people in Gaza hospitals as much as possible.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the reports from the three hospitals. However, it has previously accused Hamas of operating inside and around medical facilities - a claim the group has denied.
Shelling was also reported around the Al-Aqsa University, in al-Mawasi, where thousands of displaced people are staying.
""We can't leave... it's dangerous and I fear for the little ones,"" Younis Abdel Razek, who was sheltering there with his family, told AFP news agency. ""They said the al-Mawasi area was safe, but they lied.""
The Israeli military has told civilians to move for their own safety to what it calls a ""humanitarian zone"" in al-Mawasi. The thin strip of mainly agricultural land runs along the Mediterranean coast, south-west of Khan Younis.
The UN estimates that 1.7 million people have been displaced by the past 15 weeks of fighting, many of them multiple times.
UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned on Saturday that disease and hunger were ""deepening"" among them.
""People are dying not only from bombs and bullets, but from lack of food and clean water, hospitals without power and medicine, and gruelling journeys to ever-smaller slivers of land to escape the fighting,"" he said. ""This must stop."""
AIZSJ2VV6N_NEA0VP7K4C3GRLQ,Fake Biden robocall tells voters to skip New Hampshire primary election,By Max Matza,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68064247,"This video can not be played
Listen: AI-generated robocall impersonates Joe Biden's voice
A fake robocall claiming to be from US President Joe Biden has urged voters to skip Tuesday's primary election in New Hampshire.
An investigation has been opened into the calls, which are suspected to have been artificially generated.
It is unclear who created the audio. The Trump campaign has denied involvement.
In the message, a voice tells voters to ""save"" their ballot for the general election in November.
""Republicans have been trying to push nonpartisan and Democratic voters to participate in their primary. What a bunch of malarkey,"" says the message.
But there is no rule that says people who vote in a primary cannot cast a ballot in the general election, so there is no reason to ""save"" a vote.
The New Hampshire attorney general's office said in a statement: ""Although the voice in the robocall sounds like the voice of President Biden, this message appears to be artificially generated based on initial indications.""
It added that the ""messages appear to be an unlawful attempt to disrupt"" the election on Tuesday, and that ""voters should disregard the content of this message entirely"".
To recipients, the robocalls falsely appeared to be coming from the personal mobile phone number of a former state Democratic chairwoman, Kathy Sullivan, who helps run a pro-Biden political group in New Hampshire.

""This call links back to my personal cell phone number without my permission,"" she said in a statement, calling it ""outright election interference"".
Anti-robocall application Nomorobo estimates the calls were placed between 5,000 and 25,000 times, reports CNN.
On Monday, White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed that the audio was fake. Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez criticised the call as an attempt to ""suppress voting and deliberately undermine free and fair elections"".
In the New Hampshire primary, voters from both main parties are picking which candidate should be their standard-bearer in this year's general election.
Though Mr Biden's name will not appear on the New Hampshire primary ballot, a campaign led by state and local Democrats has taken shape for voters to write in his name.
The decision to remove his name came after Mr Biden approved a new voting calendar that stripped New Hampshire of its status as the first state to hold a primary.
Mr Biden is all but certain to win the state and his party's nomination to seek a second term in the White House.

AJKKJ5PED2_ZJGHDYJZJ9GXP7Z,Kenya court blocks police deployment to Haiti,By Ian Wafula,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68090488,"The Kenyan High Court has blocked the government from deploying police officers to fight gangs in Haiti.
The judge argued that the deployment would be illegal as the National Security Council lacks the legal authority to send police outside Kenya.
He added that the council can only deploy military, not police, for peacekeeping missions such as Haiti.
Last year, Kenya had volunteered to lead a multinational security force in Haiti to quell gang violence.
The judge further explained that Kenyan law only allows the government to deploy police officers to another country if a reciprocal agreement exists between Kenya and the host nation.
Kenya's government has said it will appeal against the ruling.
Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry last year asked the UN to urgently deploy a multinational force.
He said his government had been overwhelmed by gangs who controlled 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince.
The UN Security Council backed Kenya's offer to lead the force and Kenyan lawmakers went on to approve the deployment.
In Haiti, the possible deployment had received mixed reactions from community members who have suffered at the hands of gangs.
Laurent Uwumuremyi, the country director of Mercy Corps, told the BBC the mission had the potential to facilitate access to public infrastructure and address the humanitarian crisis.
He added though that some community members said Haiti did not need external interventions and that they saw it as a waste of money and time.
Ekuru Aukot, the Kenyan opposition leader who brought the case, said the court ruling was a win for the country, which could not afford to spare officers before tackling its own security challenges.
Mr Aukot added that President William Ruto was only using the deployment to prop up his international image and seek favour with Western countries like the US.
President Ruto said Kenya had an ""impressive record"" of participating in peace support missions around the world.
He added that the deployment would enable officers to improve and sharpen their skills and experience in providing security.
However, the suitability of Kenyan police for the deployment had raised concerns over possible human rights violations.
Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC they had documented Kenyan police violence, including murders, going back to 2013.
She added that there has been a long history of international armed intervention in Haiti really doing ""a lot of terrible things"".
The Kenyan government has denied any allegations of human rights violations by its officers.
One police officer who had already received two months of intensive training said he was ""demoralised"" by the ruling.
""I was prepared to go. I wanted to see how other police officers are doing their work and to add on to my experience.""
But he said he would use the training ""to serve here in Kenya"".
This is the second major court ruling to go against Kenya's government on the same day. The High Court also rejected a government attempt to overturn a block on a controversial housing levy.
It comes after Mr Ruto had recently criticised judges he said were corrupt for blocking government policy.

B6G7G1OSB7_HLU6JXTTEH3ILBY,Captain Cook statue vandalised in Melbourne on eve of Australia Day,By Hannah Ritchie,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-68090094,"A century-old Captain James Cook statue has been cut down and a Queen Victoria monument covered in red paint in an apparent protest in Australia.
The late-night vandalism occurred in Melbourne on the eve of Australia Day and is under police investigation.
The holiday on 26 January is the anniversary of the 1788 landing of Britain's First Fleet at Sydney Cove and the start of the colonial era.
The vandals wrote ""The colony will fall"" on the Cook statue's plinth.
Police said the ""criminal damage"" to both memorials happened in the early hours of Thursday.
""It is understood the [Cook] statue was sawn off at the ankles. Several people were seen loitering in the area around the time of the incident,"" Victoria Police said in a statement.
The 1914 monument commemorates Cook's 1768-1771 voyage during which he charted the country's east coast and paved the way for a later decision to send the First Fleet led by Captain Arthur Phillip.
The statue has a history of being vandalised on or around 26 January. In 2022 it was splashed in red paint, while in 2018 it was graffitied with the words ""no pride"" and had an Aboriginal flag placed next to it.
Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan said the vandalism of both monuments had ""no place in our community"".
""We'll be working with council to repair and reinstate the statue in St Kilda,"" she added, referring to the suburb where it is located.
Work is also under way to clean the Queen Victoria memorial in the city's centre.
Port Phillip Mayor Heather Cunsolo said that while she understood the ""diverse views surrounding Australia Day"" she could not condone ""the vandalism of a public asset where costs will be ultimately borne by ratepayers"".
She said her council had arranged for a security guard to protect the Cook statue on Thursday, but the incident occurred before they were scheduled to arrive.
Opinion polls show roughly 60% of Australians support celebrating Australia Day on 26 January.
But many Indigenous Australians and others say it is wrong to celebrate a date which represents the theft of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander lands and their dislocation from culture.
""Invasion Day"" protests have grown in recent years and many people boycott the holiday.

BCHMIR16D8_6QCS4A2KA4PB41H,In-N-Out Burger closes Oakland store over crime concerns,By Madeline Halpert,4 days ago,20230124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68084164,"In-N-Out Burger is closing its only store in Oakland, California due to concerns about crime, the company said.
It marks the first time in its 75-year history that the company has shut down a location, according to In-N-Out.
""Despite taking repeated steps to create safer conditions, our Customers and Associates are regularly victimized by car break-ins, property damage, theft, and armed robberies,"" it said in a statement.
The store will close on 24 March.
While data suggests several different types of crime - including murders - fell on a national level in 2023, burglaries, robberies and motor vehicle thefts rose in the city of Oakland on the east side of San Francisco Bay.
Violent crimes increased by 18% from 2019 to 2022, according to data from the police department. Robberies rose by 37% and burglaries by 24% in 2023, according to data reviewed by KPIX, a local affiliate of the BBC's US partner CBS News.
In just the area surrounding the In-N-Out near the Oakland International Airport, police have reported 1,335 incidents of crime since 2019, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
The popular burger joint had served Oakland customers for over 18 years. In a statement shared with US media, the chain restaurant's Chief Operating Officer Denny Warnick said that while the company had relocated restaurants over the years, it had never before completely shut down a store.
The company said it recognised the shuttering would negatively affect employees and their families. All staff were offered the chance to transfer to nearby restaurants or receive a severance package, it said.
""[T]his location remains a busy and profitable one for the company, but our top priority must be the safety and wellbeing of our Customers and Associates - we cannot ask them to visit or work in an unsafe environment,"" In-N-Out said in a statement.
Several businesses have closed in the California city due to crime, including a Starbucks and several local businesses.
Several national corporations have also shuttered stores in other parts of the US, citing rising crime. Target, for example, announced in September it would close nine stores in four states over retail theft, despite data suggesting levels of crime were not necessarily worse at those store locations than others in the same city.
Nationally, the US murder rate fell by more than 12% last year, while violent crime also dropped substantially, according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

BILEAXD9E3_IX9VHRGGZBW69WV,Amazon's record drought driven by climate change,By Mark Poynting,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68032361,"One of our planet's most vital defences against global warming is itself being ravaged by climate change.
It was the main driver of the Amazon rainforest's worst drought in at least half a century, according to a new study.
Often described as the ""lungs of the planet"", the Amazon plays a key role in removing warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
But rapid deforestation has left it more vulnerable to weather extremes.
While droughts in the Amazon are not uncommon, last year's event was ""exceptional"", the researchers say.
In October, the Rio Negro - one of the world's largest rivers - reached its lowest recorded level near Manaus in Brazil, surpassing marks going back over 100 years.
As well as being a buffer against climate change, the Amazon is a rich source of biodiversity, containing around 10% of the world's species - with many more yet to be discovered.
The drought has disrupted ecosystems and has directly impacted millions of people who rely on rivers for transport, food and income, with the most vulnerable hit hardest.
One trigger for these dry conditions is El NiÃ±o - a natural weather system where sea surface temperatures increase in the East Pacific Ocean. This affects global rainfall patterns, particularly in South America.
But human-caused climate change was the main driver of the extreme drought, according to the World Weather Attribution group, reducing the amount of water in the soil in two main ways.
Firstly, the Amazon is typically receiving less rainfall than it used to between June and November - the drier part of the year - as the climate warms.
Secondly, hotter temperatures mean there's more evaporation from the plants and soils, so they lose more water.
The researchers used weather data and computer simulations to compare drought conditions in two scenarios: one with human-caused warming, and one without.
In a world where humans hadn't heated up the planet by around 1.2C, such an intense 'agricultural drought' - where a lack of rainfall and high evaporation dry out the soils - may only have happened around once every 1,500 years, the study suggests.
Climate change has made a drought of this severity around 30 times more likely, according to the researchers, and one is now expected to happen every 50 years under current conditions.
""This really is something quite exceptional,"" says Dr Ben Clarke, a researcher with the World Weather Attribution group.
As the map below shows, drought hit almost all of the Amazon basin. This scale - and intensity - makes it different to previous droughts, Dr Clarke told BBC News.
And if warming continues, such extreme droughts could become even more common.
""If we continue burning oil, gas and coal, very soon, we'll reach 2C of warming and we'll see similar Amazon droughts about once every 13 years,"" says Dr Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London.
More frequent and intense droughts test the Amazon's resilience. That has already been stretched by deforestation - around one-fifth of the rainforest has been lost over the last 50 years.
Trees help the area retain and release moisture, fuelling their own clouds, and they also help to cool temperatures.
While the effect of deforestation was not directly tested in this latest study, previous research has shown it increases the vulnerability of the rainforest to drought.
The world's largest rainforest is seen as crucial in the battle to limit global warming.
""The Amazon could make or break our fight against climate change,"" says Regina Rodrigues, a professor of physical oceanography and climate at the Federal University of Santa Catarina in Brazil.
In a healthy state, it takes up more carbon dioxide (CO2) than it releases.
This limits CO2 increases in the atmosphere from human activities, keeping a lid on temperatures.
But there is evidence that this may be changing, as trees die back due to drought, wildfires and deliberate clearance to make room for agriculture.
There is concern that if climate change and deforestation continue at their current pace, the Amazon could soon reach a ""tipping point"".
If crossed, this could lead to the rapid and irreversible dieback of the whole rainforest - potentially leading to the region becoming a significant source of CO2 emissions.
It's not known exactly where such a threshold might sit.
""I don't think that [tipping point] is what we are seeing [yet], at least in all but the driest part of the Amazon forest,"" says Yadvinder Malhi, a professor of ecosystem science at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the latest study.
Despite the latest record drought, there has been some encouraging progress.
The rate of deforestation fell in 2023 compared with the year before, according to the Brazilian space agency, with President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva pledging to halt it completely by 2030.
This - alongside urgent action to slash the greenhouse gas emissions that are fuelling global warming - can still help to protect what's left of the Amazon, researchers say.
""The loss of the Amazon forest is far from inevitable in the short-term,"" as long as fire and deforestation can be controlled, Prof Malhi told BBC News.
""But we do need to get to grips with stabilising global climate, as the risk increases with every fraction of a degree the planet warms.""

BOEO7I261N_C3GVSEWWB5P47PB,France set to tighten immigration law after court scraps some measures,By Paul Kirby,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68103950,"The French government says it will push through a controversial immigration law ""in the coming hours"", despite many of the measures being struck out as invalid.
Most of the 35 measures rejected by France's nine-member Constitutional Council were added to the bill because of right-wing and far-right pressure.
But the new law still represents a hardening of the immigration rules.
Foreigners legally in France could now be deported with criminal convictions.
Even those who came to France before they were 13 or those who have lived in France for more than 20 years could be expelled if they are given substantial jail terms and deemed to be a ""grave threat to public order"".
Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said the Constitutional Council had validated all the government's measures and it was now time to put the law into practice.
""The Republic will never have had a law as tough as this,"" he told France's TF1 TV channel on Thursday night.
Details on enforcing the law would be handed out on Friday, he said, and as of February or March every French prefect would have to put together their files to decide which offenders should be expelled.
However, the law also includes measures that prevent authorities from placing under-18s in detention centres and gives prefects the power to hand one-year residence permits to people with no papers who work in jobs such as construction, which are known to be facing labour shortages.
Friday's ruling coincided with latest migration figures from France's interior ministry showing the number of foreign offenders expelled from France in 2023 had risen by 10.7% in 2023 to more than 17,000, although well down on the numbers before the Covid crisis.
Asylum applications increased by 8.6% last year to almost 142,500, but at a slower rate than the year before.
With European Parliament elections ahead in June, and without a majority in the National Assembly, President Emmanuel Macron is facing a strong challenge from the far right and he is reliant on parties outside the government to get legislation through.
It was only five weeks ago that the government managed to push through its immigration law, with the backing of right-wing Republicans and the far-right National Rally (RN).
Left-wing parties accused the president's centrist Renaissance party of enabling the far right and betraying their own convictions, while some Renaissance MPs refused to back the proposals.
In order to get the bill through, the government accepted a series of amendments on top of the measures already proposed, such as limiting family reunifications and reducing access to welfare.
It was largely those amendments that were thrown out by the nine ""sages"" who make up France's top constitutional authority on Thursday evening, to the anger of the Republicans and the RN.
Government figures hailed the Constitutional Council's ruling as a victory, as the original measures that ministers had initially failed to get past MPs were intact. ""We have all the resources we need,"" Mr Darmanin said.
The president of the RN, Jordan Bardella, complained of a ""coup by the judges, with the backing of the president of the Republic himself"", while Republicans leader Eric Ciotti said it appeared that constitutional reform was more vital than ever ""to safeguard France's destiny"".
Commentators pointed out that the sages had scrapped the added measures because they were seen as not sufficiently linked to the initial legislation, not because of their substance.
The French right is now pressing for a second immigration bill to be put forward, although the interior minister has made clear he has no intention of doing so.

BQIEQ5XP64_CFYTSGIMT7LPCDJ,Doomsday Clock stays at 90 seconds to midnight,By Jane Corbin,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68017445,"The Doomsday Clock - which shows how symbolically close the world is to nuclear Armageddon - is to remain at 90 seconds to midnight.
Scientists have listed reasons for keeping its hands the closest they have ever been to ""Doomsday"" - but stopped short of nudging it further forward.
The threat of a new nuclear arms race, the Ukraine war and climate change concerns were all factors, they said.
The clock is set annually by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.
Since 2007, members have considered the impact of new man-made risks such as AI and climate change, as well as the greatest threat - nuclear war.
In its 2024 announcement on Tuesday, the Bulletin said that China, Russia and the US were all spending huge sums to ""expand or modernise their nuclear arsenals"" - which added to the ""ever-present danger of nuclear war through mistake or miscalculation"".
The war in Ukraine had also created an ""ever-present risk of nuclear escalation"", it said.
A lack of action on climate change and risks linked to ""misusing"" emerging biological technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools were also cited.
The Doomsday Clock was created in 1947 by J Robert Oppenheimer and fellow US scientists who had developed the atomic bomb.
They had seen its devastating effects two years earlier, at the end of World War Two, on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They wanted to warn the public and put pressure on world leaders to make sure nuclear weapons were never used again.
The hands of the clock have moved 25 times. In 1947, they started at seven minutes to midnight. At the end of the Cold War, in 1991, they had fallen back to 17 minutes to midnight.
Bulletin president Rachel Bronson told the BBC that ""every major country, including the UK, is investing in their nuclear arsenal as if nuclear weapons are usable for a very long time. This is a very dangerous timeâ¦ leaders are not acting responsibly.""
Nuclear Armageddon: How Close Are We?
With the Doomsday Clock the closest it's ever been to midnight, Jane Corbin investigates the proliferation of nuclear weapons across the globe and the breakdown of systems of constraint.
Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)
Pavel Podvig, a Russian nuclear weapons expert who has been involved in setting the Doomsday Clock for many years, says he was shocked when President Putin put Russia's nuclear forces on alert after the invasion of Ukraine.
The world reacted with horror to the Russian leader's threat but it seems he had made a deliberate calculation.
""This is exactly what nuclear weapons are there for - to make certain you have a certain freedom of action,"" Podvig says. ""The Russian President believed that by making these statements he could deter the West from intervening in Ukraine which was a correct calculation - this is how deterrence works.""
Despite decades of arms control agreements there are still about 13,000 nuclear warheads globally, 90% of them Russian and American. Six other countries are declared nuclear powers: the UK, France, China, India, Pakistan and North Korea. Israel is widely believed to have these weapons, but has never confirmed it. Most modern nuclear weapons are many times more powerful than those that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
In 2021, the UK increased the cap on its warheads from 225 to 260, potentially 35 more warheads, and the country's nuclear force is on high alert. Since the war in Ukraine began, there has been rhetoric from senior Russian figures suggesting Moscow's nuclear weapons could be used against the UK.
The UK's nuclear deterrent is housed in the west of Scotland at the Faslane base, home to four Vanguard submarines that carry Trident missiles armed with nuclear warheads.
Feargal Dalton, a former Lt Cdr who served on board submarine HMS Victorious, is one of a handful of people who have actually fired a Trident missile: a test missile with a dummy warhead.
""There's always one [submarine] somewhere out there, at 15 minutes notice to fire,"" Dalton says. ""As we speak there is a nuclear deterrent out there. The Vladimir Putins of the world know it's out there, it's credible and we could use it if needs be.""
Ever since the atomic bomb was created there has been opposition to these weapons. In the 1980s, the women of the Greenham Common peace camp fought to get all US nuclear missiles removed from UK soil - the last warheads left in 2008.
However, at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) is now protesting against the possibility of US weapons returning.
Pentagon documents - first reported by the Federation of American Scientists - suggest US ""special"" weapons will be stationed at the base. US fighter planes that are capable of dropping such weapons arrived at Lakenheath in 2021 and there are now plans by the United States Air Force to build dormitories for troops to serve in a potential nuclear mission on this site.
""We know that we have got public opinion on our side,"" Sophie Bolt from CND explains - as her small group chant slogans over the perimeter fence of the base. ""Nearly 60% of the population do not want to have nuclear bombs sited in Britain.""
""We've got nothing to do with this base, it is totally under US control,"" Alan Wright, another protestor says. ""If we get Trump in [the White House] next time and he may press the button because he's got a bigger button than Putin - then we are a target.""
However, Donald Trump has previously said he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of being elected, although he hasn't explained how. Some analysts believe it is likely that  US support for Ukraine could be diminished.
In the past decade, fears of a nuclear war have also been ramped up by Kim Jong-Un, leader of North Korea, the latest nation to join the nuclear club. He has boasted of testing nuclear-capable missiles that could reach the United States.
Former Bulletin of Atomic Scientists member and Doomsday Clock adviser, Sig Hecker, has visited North Korea's nuclear facilities seven times as part of a scientific research programme and estimates it could have 50 to 60 nuclear warheads by now.

Watch: Witnesses describe Smith's last moments before death
The UN, EU and anti-death penalty activists have condemned the first execution of a prisoner using nitrogen gas.
Kenneth Eugene Smith was put to death Thursday night at a state prison in Atmore, Alabama.
A journalist who witnessed the execution told the BBC that Smith thrashed violently on the gurney.
Smith was convicted in 1989 of murdering a preacher's wife, Elizabeth Sennett, in a killing-for-hire.
The execution process began at 19:53 local time (01:53 GMT) and Smith was pronounced dead about half of an hour later at 20:25 (02:35 GMT).
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said he had ""serious concerns this novel and untested method of suffocation by nitrogen gas may amount to torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment"".
In a statement, EU officials called nitrogen gas ""a particularly cruel and unusual punishment"".
One of the five reporters who witnessed the execution told the BBC it was unlike any other he'd seen.
""I've been to four previous executions and I've never seen a condemned inmate thrash in the way that Kenneth Smith reacted to the nitrogen gas,"", Alabama journalist Lee Hedgepeth told the BBC's Newsday programme.
""Kenny just began to gasp for air repeatedly and the execution took about 25 minutes total.""
Inhaling pure nitrogen gas cuts off the oxygen supply to the brain. The procedure had never been used before in an execution, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.
Alabama officials had said in an earlier court filing they expected Smith to lose consciousness within seconds and die in a matter of minutes.
Smith's spiritual adviser, the Reverend Jeff Hood, said after the execution: ""I think that anybody that witnessed this knows that we didn't see someone go unconscious in two or three seconds.""
""What we saw was minutes of someone struggling for their life,"" Mr Hood said. ""We also saw cracks in correction officials in the room who were visibly surprised at how bad this thing went.""
State officials, meanwhile, said the execution went as planned.
John Hamm, commissioner of the Alabama Department of Corrections, said it ""appeared that Smith was holding his breath as long as he could.""
""He struggled against restraints a little bit, but there's some involuntary movement and some abnormal breathing,"" he told a post-execution briefing. ""That was all expected and was in the side effects that we've seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia"".
""Nothing was out of the ordinary,"" he added.
At a press conference on Friday, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said he expected the method to be used in the future and by other states. Oklahoma and Mississippi have also authorised nitrogen gas for executions.
""Despite the international effort by activists to undermine and disparage our state's justice system and to deny justice to the victims of heinous murders, our proven method offers a blueprint for other states and a warning to those who would contemplate shedding innocent blood,"" he said in a statement after the execution on Thursday.
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Friday that the Biden administration found the execution ""very troubling"" and that it would continue to enforce a moratorium on executions to be carried out by the federal government.
Smith's last words were, according to a media pool report: ""Tonight Alabama caused humanity to take a step backward. I'm leaving with love, peace and light. Thank you for supporting me. Love all of you.""
He also made an ""I love you"" sign with sign language, reporters said.

Watch: How nitrogen became a form of execution in the US
Smith was one of two men convicted of murdering Mrs Sennett.
Her husband Charles Sennett, a debt-ridden preacher, paid them $1,000 (Â£790) to carry out the murder so that he could collect insurance money. He killed himself as investigators closed in.
Mrs Sennett was beaten with a fireplace tool and stabbed in the chest and neck, and her death was staged to look like a home invasion and burglary.
At his trial Smith admitted to being present when she was killed, but said he did not take part in the attack.
Smith's fellow hitman, John Forrest Parker, was executed in 2010.
Mike Sennett, the victim's son, said the family wouldn't be celebrating but that Smith had paid his ""debt"".
""Nothing that happened here today is going to bring Mom back,"" he said. ""We're glad this day is over.""
In a statement, Smith's legal team said it was ""deeply saddened"" by his execution, noting the jury in his case had voted to spare his life but a judge overrode its decision.
American opponents of the death penalty also condemned the execution.
""It's not something that should be done, and yet it was done,"" said Abraham Bonowitz, executive director of Death Penalty Action.

Alabama tried to execute Smith by lethal injection two years ago, but prison staff had trouble inserting an intravenous line.
On Thursday night, the US Supreme Court denied him a last-minute reprieve. Three liberal justices dissented from the conservative majority's ruling.
The death penalty is on decline in the US.
Last year 24 people were put to death with lethal injections in five states: Texas, Florida, Missouri, Oklahoma and Alabama.
A slight majority - 53% - of Americans approve of the death penalty in murder cases, according to a long-running Gallup poll.

C4VH0HWF2X_8DUEFKBKXXN1A84,United Airlines to lose money over Boeing groundings,By Mariko Oi,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68064948,"This video can not be played
Watch: On board flight during mid-air blow out
A major US airline has said it expects to lose money in the three months between January and March due to the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 jets.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded 171 of them after an unused door broke away mid-flight.
United Airlines has 79 of the aircraft in its fleet, more than any other carrier, followed by Alaska Airlines.
Both airlines have been forced to cancel hundreds of flights this month as inspections are carried out.
United has said it expects the planes to remain grounded until 26 January and its forecast assumes it won't be able to fly them at all this month.
The issues at Boeing, which is now facing government investigations of its manufacturing process, have also scrambled United's efforts to expand its fleet.
It warned investors on Tuesday that deliveries of dozens of new Boeing planes, including 737 Max 9s and a not yet approved Max 10, will be delayed.
Chief executive Scott Kirby told analysts the firm has not cancelled its orders with Boeing but was considering alternatives.
In an interview with CNBC, he called the latest grounding the ""straw that broke the camel's back"".
Boeing has been struggling to restore confidence since fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving another version of its 737 Max plane that led to a global grounding for more than 18 months. Smaller manufacturing issues have cropped up repeatedly since production restarted.
Stan Deal, head of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, said the firm had ""let down"" its customers and was ""deeply sorry for the significant disruption to them, their employees and their passengers"".
""We are taking action on a comprehensive plan to bring these airplanes safely back to service and to improve our quality and delivery performance,"" he said.
The Alaska Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon to Ontario, California, had reached 16,000ft (4,876m) when it began its emergency descent, according to flight tracking data, after the unused emergency exit door blew out.
On Sunday, the FAA said another, older 737-900ER model should also be inspected as they use the same door design. United has 136 of these jets in its fleet.
The FAA did not order the older model to be grounded while the visual inspections are carried out by operators.
In the wake of the incident, Boeing said it would increase inspections and bring in an outside expert to review its processes, among other measures.

CHTNQXTBWP_41TCQC66XMVSQYM,Shrewsbury MP considering council funding rebellion,By Adam Green & Andy Giddings,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-shropshire-68081608,"A Conservative MP could ask colleagues to rebel against the government over the funding it gives councils.
The government had proposed a total package worth of Â£64bn, an increase of 6.5% compared with the year before.
On Wednesday it promised an extra Â£500m. Shrewsbury and Atcham MP Daniel Kawczynski said he would consider that offer.
He said he wanted to know if the extra money would be enough to help Shropshire Council.
The council has warned of further budget cuts this year, as it attempts to reduce its deficit and avoid the need to issue a Section 114 notice, effectively declaring itself bankrupt.
A number of councils across England, including Birmingham City Council, have already taken that step.
The government is currently consulting on the amount of funding available to councils in England from April, but is under cross-party pressure to offer more.
Earlier this week more than 40 Conservative MPs wrote to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak warning about the combined impact of council tax rises and cuts to services.
They urged him to increase the funding settlement ahead of a vote on the issue in February. Council leaders asked for an extra Â£750m.
The government has responded by offering single-tier and county councils an additional Â£500m to pay for children's and adult social care.
Lower-tier districts are expected to get extra sums totalling Â£30-Â£40m.
Mr Kawczynski had said he was planning to write to his fellow Conservative MPs and was aiming to get ""a deputation of 20 of us to go together, to warn them that this will be voted down unless they can find additional money for our councils.""
But after receiving the news of the extra Â£500m he said he would ""digest"" the information and wait to hear what Shropshire Council thought of it before deciding to continue.
A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities previously said: ""We recognise councils are facing challenges and that is why we have announced a Â£64bn funding package - a real terms increase at an average of 6.5% - to ensure they can continue making a difference, alongside our combined efforts to level up.
""We recently consulted on the final settlement for next year and are now considering the responses carefully. Councils are ultimately responsible for their own finances, but we remain ready to talk to any concerned about its financial position.""

CN5OLFZJTH_YNDSTIMC4HBWN7E,India calls Pakistan's claim of targeted killings 'false',By Meryl Sebastian,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68091822,"India has dismissed allegations by Pakistan that its agents killed two Pakistani citizens on its soil in 2023, calling them ""false"".
Pakistan's claims come months after Ottawa alleged that India was involved in the murder of a Sikh separatist in Canada - India has denied this.
On Thursday, Islamabad said it had ""credible evidence"" of links between the two killings and Indian agents.
India's foreign ministry called it ""malicious anti-India propaganda"".
The two deaths in Pakistan include the killing of Muhammad Riaz in Rawalakot city in September 2023 and Shahid Latif in Sialkot city in October 2023, the country's foreign ministry said in a press briefing on Thursday. One of the men was shot dead while praying at a mosque, while the other was killed outside one.
Pakistan's foreign ministry did not disclose who these people were or the reasons for Delhi allegedly dispatching agents to carry out the killings within its arch-rival's territory.
Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Qazi called the killings ""unacceptable"" and ""a violation of its sovereignty"".
""We have documentary, financial and forensic evidence of the involvement of the two Indian agents who masterminded these assassinations,"" he said.
India must be held ""accountable"" for its ""blatant violation of international law"", he added.
India did not directly address the specific allegations raised by Pakistan but called the country an ""epicentre of terrorism, organised crime and illegal transnational activities"".
""India and many other countries have publicly warned Pakistan cautioning that it would consume by its own culture of terror and violence,"" its foreign ministry said in a statement.
Mr Qazi also said that the killings in Pakistan were similar to attempts in Canada and the US - though those allegations were about the murders or attempted murders of Sikhs, not Muslims.
In November 2023, the US said it had foiled an alleged plot by an Indian man to assassinate an American citizen in New York who advocated for Khalistan, or a separate Sikh state.
Nikhil Gupta was allegedly directed by an Indian government official who was not named or charged in the indictment.
The White House said it had raised the alleged assassination plot with India at the most senior levels. India said it had formed a high-level inquiry committee to ""address the security concerns highlighted by the US government"".
The news came months after Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there was ""credible"" evidence connecting the Indian government to the murder of a Sikh leader in British Columbia in June. India denied any role in that killing.
The allegation led to a steep deterioration in ties between the two countries.
The Khalistan movement peaked in India in the 1980s with a violent insurgency centred in Sikh-majority Punjab state.
It was quelled by force and has little resonance in India now, but is still popular among some in the Sikh diaspora in countries such as Canada, Australia and the UK.

CN61CNJ3TN_CMGE992FWDETPHV,Defiant Trump takes legal risk on stand in New York defamation trial,By Brandon Livesay and Nada Tawfik,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68071744,"Donald Trump testified on Thursday in the defamation trial brought by writer E Jean Carroll, but his much-anticipated time on the stand was kept brief.
The former president - who has already been found to have defamed Ms Carroll for comments he made about her in 2019 - was under strict rules on what he could say.
But he told the jury that he stood ""100%"" by a deposition given in 2022 in which he strongly denied her sexual assault allegations and called her a ""whack job"".
Other comments he made were struck from the record by the judge for breaching the restrictions, which took significant time to agree before he took the stand.
Mr Trump has been testing the limits of the courts in his various legal cases that have become intertwined with his re-election campaign.
It's a strategy which keeps his political base invested and tuned in, and gives him considerable press coverage as he looks set to become the Republican presidential nominee.
A related civil trial last year found that he had sexually assaulted Ms Carroll, a magazine columnist, in a New York department store in the 1990s and pay her about $5m in damages. The jury also found him liable for defamation for calling her accusations a lie.
Despite that ruling, he continues to regularly deny the attack in public comments.
This civil trial focuses on separate defamatory comments Mr Trump made about Ms Carroll in 2019 while in the White House, with the jury considering how much Trump must pay in damages.
Closing arguments will take place on Friday and a ruling could swiftly follow.
Mr Trump's continuing denials of Ms Carroll's sexual assault allegations - despite what a court already found - are the reason why he was under severe limits on what he could say in his testimony in the New York court on Thursday.
The legal complications meant the judge and lawyers spent much more time arguing about what Mr Trump would be allowed to talk about compared to his four minutes of testimony.
Judge Kaplan said the first trial established the facts and the only issue remaining was how much Mr Trump must pay Ms Carroll, if anything. The Republican frontrunner was told he would not be allowed to deny that he sexually assaulted Ms Carroll.
The strict terms made it impossible for Mr Trump to launch into a monologue or to campaign from the witness stand.
It's perhaps a lesson learned from one of Mr Trump's other legal battles. In a New York civil fraud trial earlier this month, Mr Trump was initially told he could not give his closing argument. The judge in that case asked whether Mr Trump would keep it short and stick to the matters of the case.
Mr Trump responded with a six-minute monologue in which he argued he was a victim of political persecution.
The defamation trial on Thursday gave the 77-year-old much less leeway.
Asked if he stood by his deposition, Mr Trump said: ""100% yes.""
His lawyer Alina Habba then asked if he denied Ms Carroll's accusation. ""That's exactly right, yes I did,"" he responded.
He went on to say ""she said something that I considered a false accusation - totally false"".
But Judge Kaplan quickly cut Mr Trump off and told the jury to ignore that last statement.
Finally, Ms Habba asked if her client had ever instructed anyone to hurt Ms Carroll, to which Mr Trump said: ""No, I just wanted to defend myself, my family and frankly, the presidency."" The judge again ordered the latter part stricken from the record.
And with that, the testimony was over. As he left the courtroom Mr Trump was heard saying: ""It's not America. This is not America.""
Earlier in the day, Judge Kaplan warned him to stop interrupting proceedings by ""talking loudly"". That included a moment when he was heard muttering under his breath that he had ""never met this woman [Ms Carroll]"".
Testifying outside of the limitations outlined by the judge on Thursday could have theoretically caused Mr Trump to face hefty fines or even five years in prison for perjury.
Ronnell Andersen Jones, a professor of law at the University of Utah, told BBC News the case showed the ""wide gap"" between Mr Trump's strategies in court and on the campaign trail.
While the former president and his lawyers may want to convince the jury that his comments in the White House did not show ""ill will that warrants punitive damages"", that is easier said than done considering his actions.
""This will be a hard row to hoe, given that this same jury is daily receiving new evidence that the defendant, outside the courtroom, continues to spread the lie undeterred,"" Ms Jones said.
The defamation trial will resume on Friday at 09:30 ET (14:30 GMT) with closing arguments. It is not yet known if Mr Trump will attend.

CPVNO0GVGW_A7EG21OZ73ZUY2J,Badenoch blames Biden for missing post-Brexit trade targets,By Simon Jack,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68069994,"The Business Secretary has blamed a change in US president for the UK's failure to hit post-Brexit trade targets.
Kemi Badenoch told MPs Joe Biden's administration had no appetite for trade deals.
She claimed it was why the government missed a manifesto pledge to strike deals with countries that account for 80% of UK trade by the end of 2022.
The UK has free trade agreements covering 60% of overseas trade.
Appearing before MPs on Tuesday, Ms Badenoch said: ""The biggest thing that had an impact on us reaching that goal was the change in administration from President Trump to President Biden.
""The Biden administration decided it was not doing trade deals - with anyone not just us.""
She noted that the US had moved to specific smaller deals in areas like semiconductors and critical minerals. That produced a change in her own strategy, Ms Badenoch said, causing her ""to pivot away"" from free trade agreements and instead focusing on smaller Memorandums of Understanding which she conceded were not based on enforceable international law.
But the Business Trade Secretary said she remained confident that the UK would reach a target of hitting Â£1 trillion in exports by 2030.
Liam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Select Committee, noted that the Institute of Directors business group had estimated that meeting that goal would require export growth of 3.5% per year.
That compares to a current forecast of 0.1% growth by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent fiscal watchdog.
Faced with questions on the UK's membership of a wider Trans-Pacific Partnership, known as CPTPP, Ms Badenoch refused to be drawn on whether Britain would support China or Taiwan joining the trade bloc.
It currently includes Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. The UK already currently has trade deals with nine of the 11 members.
The OBR estimates that membership of the CPTPP trade bloc would boost UK economic growth by 0.04% over the next 15 years.
It has also estimated that the UK's departure from the EU single market and customs union would mean the UK economy being 4% smaller than it would have been if the UK had not left.
Ms Badenoch stopped short of saying the OBR was ""wrong"" but said while the government took account of the OBR's estimates, it thought its estimates were vulnerable to changing economic circumstances and outcomes.

The bodies of Jasmin Kuczynska, 12, and Natasha Kuczynska, eight, were found in Costessey, near Norwich, on Friday.
Detectives confirmed they were treating their deaths and that of Kanticha Sukpengpanao, 36, as murder.
Ms Sukpengpanao and Bartlomiej Kuczynski, 45, were earlier found to have died from stab wounds to the neck.
All four bodies were discovered by police officers at a house in Allan Bedford Crescent, Queen's Hills.
Police said Mr Kuczynski's death was not being treated as suspicious and they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the murders.
Norfolk Police has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) over the case.
On Tuesday, the IOPC confirmed Mr Kuczynski called 999 shortly before 06:00 GMT from inside the house.
He said he was confused and worried about his mental state.
It is understood he was advised to seek medical advice and contact the NHS on 111.
Police were not despatched until after they received a second 999 call at 07:00 GMT from a member of the public and forced their way into the house.
The IOPC said it would be examining whether the handling of the contact with the first call ""was appropriate and in line with force policy, training and procedures"".
The IOPC's regional director Charmaine Arbouin said they would also ""be making contact with the families of the deceased to explain our role"".
Det Ch Insp Chris Burgess said: ""We understand how incredibly shocking this incident is for all involved and for the wider community and that this latest update adds to the sense of heartbreak.
""Our thoughts are with the family of the those found at the property grieving such a traumatic loss.""
He said a cordon would remain at the address ""whilst we finalise our detailed examination of the scene"".
The police previously said Natasha was nine years old, which they later corrected.

D31X1Y64CA_3C8Q6B4FEBIHW4R,Turkey parliament backs Sweden's Nato membership,By George Wright,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68076829,"Turkish MPs have ratified Sweden's bid to join Nato in a long-delayed vote that represents a big step forward on the Nordic nation's path to membership.
Sweden applied to join in 2022 after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but Turkey withheld approval amid a row over what it called Sweden's support to Kurdish separatists.
Turkish President Erdogan is expected to sign the legislation within days.
It leaves Hungary the sole Nato member yet to ratify Sweden's accession.
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson posted on social media: ""Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of Nato"".
And Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg welcomed Turkey's vote, saying he was counting on Hungary to ""complete its national ratification as soon as possible"".
Hungary has accused Sweden of having a hostile attitude. In March Hungarian government spokesman ZoltÃ¡n KovÃ¡cs accused officials in Sweden of sitting on a ""crumbling throne of moral superiority"". Stockholm has previously accused the Hungarian government of backsliding on the EU's democratic principles.
However there have been signs of progress. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Tuesday invited his Swedish counterpart to Budapest for talks, stating in a letter that ""a more intensive dialogue could contribute to reinforcing trust"".
Sweden's Foreign Minister Tobias Billstrom said he saw ""no reason"" to negotiate with Hungary ""at this point"", but added that the two nations ""can have a dialogue and continue to discuss questions"".
Turkey had been blocking Sweden's application until July, when an agreement was reached. On Tuesday evening lawmakers voted 287-55 in favour of Swedish membership. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now expected to sign the legislation.
Turkey had argued Sweden was giving refuge to Kurdish militants, and needed to do more to crack down on rebel groups like the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which it considers a terrorist organisation. The EU and US have also designated the PKK as a terrorist group.
Like any of Nato's 31 member countries, Turkey has the power to block new nations from joining the group.
But Sweden introduced tougher anti-terrorism laws in June, making it illegal to give financial or logistical help to terrorist groups.
Sweden and its eastern neighbour Finland, both long considered as militarily neutral, announced their intention to join Nato in May 2022, several months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finland formally joined in April, doubling the length of the alliance's border with Russia.

Harri, five, spends his free time after school reading to residents in Pendine Park's Highfield care home in Wrexham.
His mum Laura said it was his love of reading that inspired her to bring the book fanatic to the care home where she works.
Harri has become a firm favourite among residents and his mum said their faces ""light up"" when he arrives.
Laura, a senior care practitioner at Highfield, added: ""Staff also have got to know him well and always shout out 'hello Harri' on his arrival.
""They all know him and enjoy hearing how well he is progressing with his reading.""
Harri added: ""It's great. I like to make them smile and it's nice when they help me if I get stuck on anything.""
Harri's favourite books are the Biff, Chip and Kipper series of adventures.
Resident Betty Newcombe - one of Harri's new friends - said his visits were a highlight in the home.
""Seeing him walk into the room always brightens up an afternoon. He is very clever and an excellent reader, considering his young age.""
Highfield manager Tracey Smith described Harri as a ""little ray of sunshine"".
""He's a very charming little boy and he has melted the hearts of the residents and staff alike,"" she said.
Laura has since reached out to teachers at Harri's school to arrange for pupils to visit the care home.
She said: ""It's always a good idea bringing older and younger generations together. They easily enjoy each other's company and can learn so much from each other.""

She has previously avoided lashing out at the former president, but Mr Trump's attacks have become more personal as his commanding lead in the polls has grown.
Mr Trump is leading with 50% of likely Republican voters in the state, with Nikki Haley trailing far behind.
On Sunday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantisdropped out of the race altogether.
With his campaign faltering, Mr DeSantis admitted he had no path to victory - setting up a two-horse race in New Hampshire. And he endorsed Mr Trump.
In last week's Iowa caucus, Mr Trump dominated Ms Haley and Ron DeSantis.
But even with that decisive win and a clear lead in the upcoming New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, Mr Trump has gone on the attack against Ms Haley.
His criticisms appear to have convinced her to turn up the heat on the former president.
Mr Trump went after his former UN ambassador at a campaign rally over the weekend, but he seemed to confuse her for another political foe - former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - when speaking about the Capitol riot.
On CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, Ms Haley seized on the slip up and struck back at the former president, saying that his ""mental stability will probably continue to decline"".
""No matter what it is, chaos follows,"" she added. ""In some cases he [Mr Trump] causes it. In some cases he doesn't... he's like a magnet to it. What happens is that puts the rest of America in chaos, and people are tired.""

The former UN ambassador also blasted her onetime boss as soft on undemocratic leaders, alleging he did not hold Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and China's Xi Jinping accountable.
""You can't have someone who's trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us,"" Ms Haley said on CBS. ""Instead, you have to let them know what we expect of them. That's the difference.""
Characterising Mr Trump as a mayhem and temper-fueled candidate appears to be a new counter deployed by Ms Haley. It comes after he has ramped up personal insults on her in recent days.
On Friday, for example, Mr Trump took to social media to refer to Ms Haley as ""Nimbra"", a misspelling of her birth name Nimarata, and to baselessly suggest she was ineligible to serve as president or vice president in the US.
The jab against the US-born Ms Haley - whose parents emigrated to the US from India in the 1960s - was reminiscent of the false birther attacks Mr Trump deployed against former President Barack Obama.
Ms Haley responded to the baseless claim by telling reporters in New Hampshire that Mr Trump is ""clearly insecure if he goes and does these temper tantrums"".
Her decision to fight back against Mr Trump - something she has been loath to do on the campaign trail - may have come too late in this primary, however.
While Ms Haley appeared to have some momentum a few weeks ago, polls released before Mr DeSantis quit showed Mr Trump dominating ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
Mr Trump led with 55% support among likely Republican voters, compared to 36% for Ms Haley and just 6% for Mr DeSantis.
A separate poll, from CNN, had Mr Trump with 50% support, compared to 39% for Ms Haley and 6% for Mr DeSantis.
The former president's lead has prompted Haley campaign officials and political allies to temper and downplay expectations for New Hampshire after previously expressing optimism.
New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, who has campaigned for Ms Haley, told NBC News that she ""doesn't have to win"" in his home state. He claimed that any momentum from this week's race offers an ""amazing opportunity to turn this around"".
Additionally, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney repeatedly declined to offer a prediction during an on-the-record briefing with Bloomberg News, telling reporters only that Ms Haley needs ""incremental progress"".
""I know everyone wants us to put a number on it,"" she said. ""We have never done that. We never will.""
Mr Trump's campaign has also received a boost from the endorsements of two former opponents for the Republican nomination, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.
Ms Haley also received an endorsement from a former rival, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who never earned much support and ended his bid for the Republican nomination last week.
""Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years,"" he said in a post on X. ""Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so.""
Still, Ms Ankney said that ""beating Donald Trump is not easy"" and appeared to push for a longer view of the campaign.
""He is a juggernaut,"" she said of Trump. ""But how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. We have to continue to show incremental growth and progress until we are the last man, or woman, standing against him.""

DST911ONVG_9SABMMAW97P16Z4,Kenya housing levy: Blow to William Ruto as court blocks tax,By Jewel Kiriungi,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68104248,"A Kenyan court has dealt a blow to the government, rejecting its appeal against a temporary block on a controversial housing tax.
In November, the High Court found that the 1.5% monthly levy unfairly targeted Kenyans working in the formal sector and ordered payments to halt.
On Friday, the Court of Appeal ruled that citizens should stop paying the tax until the case is decided.
The government had wanted to carry on collecting the tax in the meantime.
President Ruto has vowed to press ahead with the project regardless, claiming to have public support that was tantamount to an endorsement from God.
""Your say is God's say. So I have enough directive and I will push this housing programme forward,"" he told people at a public rally in Meru County, central Kenya, on Friday.
Kenya's government had begun deducting 1.5% of the gross salaries of locals and foreigners last July, to fund construction of affordable houses for low-income earners.
The levy sparked an outcry from the opposition and a large section of Kenyans, who feel burdened by the raft of taxes introduced under President William Ruto.
The government had argued that suspending the levy would render thousands of workers under the housing programme jobless and breach contracts that had already been signed.
Many Kenyans are relieved by the judgement, although the Court of Appeal is yet to make its final decision.
The ruling comes a week after the appeals court gave the go-ahead for a controversial healthcare insurance levy, which will require people to contribute 2.75% of their monthly salaries to a social healthcare programme.
The housing levy case is one of the petitions that have created a rift between the judiciary and executive, with President Ruto accusing allegedly corrupt judges of colluding with the opposition to sabotage national development projects.
Friday's ruling was one of two on the same day to go against the government. The High Court also ruled that Kenya could not send police officers to Haiti, to tackle gang violence there."

The landslide in Zhaotong city happened at 05:51 local time (21:51 GMT) on Monday, trapping 47 people.
President Xi Jinping has ordered an ""all-out"" rescue in the area which is experiencing sub-zero temperatures.
The cause of the landslide remains unclear, but the remote, mountainous region is prone to them.
More than 500 people were evacuated from their homes and nearly 1,000 rescue workers were dispatched to the site. Chinese vice-premier Zhang Guoqing reportedly led a group to the site to guide rescue operations.
One of the villagers told local media that most of the residents were either elderly or children. Another resident told local news outlet Jimu News that the landslide happened while many people were still asleep on Monday morning.
""It was very loud, and there was also a shake, it felt like a big earthquake,"" she said.
Video clips shared on social media showed rescuers walking on piles of rubble against a backdrop of snow-covered mountains. Personal belongings are seen scattered among the collapsed masonry.
In January 2013, at least 18 people were killed in a landslide in the same county.

E85VACO8EY_KWLNVE8N1HGUT3X,NY police probe alleged attack on pro-Palestine march,By Nada Tawfik in New York & Nadine Yousif,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68075715,"Police in New York City are investigating a possible hate crime after pro-Palestine demonstrators at Columbia University reported being sprayed with a foul-smelling substance.
The incident happened on Friday at a pro-Palestine march on campus.
The students reported symptoms like vomiting and headaches, and some sought medical treatment.
Columbia University said the suspected perpetrators have been banned from campus while police investigate.
In an email to faculty and students on Monday, Columbia's Provost Dennis Mitchell denounced the attack and called it ""deeply troubling"".
""We condemn in the strongest possible terms any threats or acts of violence directed toward anyone in our community,"" he wrote.
""The University is committed to taking urgent action with the appropriate authorities in any such cases.""
The protest, which was unsanctioned by the university, took place at the front steps of Columbia's Low Library.
According to Columbia University's campus newspaper The Spectator, it was there that about a dozen or so students began smelling a foul odour, akin to sewage.
Some reported physical symptoms like nausea and burning eyes, as well as damage to their personal belongings.
The New York Police Department (NYPD) confirmed that it is investigating at least six reports related to the march.
In a statement to BBC, the NYPD said a 24-year-old female reported smelling an ""unknown odour and began to feel nauseated and experienced a burning sensation in her eyes"". Since then, the police said they received five additional reports.
The NYPD added that no arrests have been made and that the investigation is ongoing.
The incident follows months of tension on Columbia University's campus and others across the country between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel students since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war on 7 October.
In October, a 19-year-old former student of Columbia University was charged in an assault on an Israeli student who was putting up posters of hostages held by Hamas.
Pro-Palestinian students on campus have also reported being harassed online, as well as being publicly singled-out by a truck that featured their faces and names and that labelled them as antisemites.
In November, Columbia University suspended two pro-Palestinian groups - Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voices for Peace - in an effort to reduce tensions on campus.
The groups have pushed back, calling the suspensions unjust, and have continued to hold rallies under different banners.

EE1YRRKBXE_MQKS0L6DCTHAFTV,Ukrainian intelligence does not rule out PoWs on downed Russian plane,"By Sarah Rainsford, in Kharkiv",3 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68101731,"This video can not be played
The BBC has verified this video showing the moment a Russian aircraft crashed in the Belgorod region
A representative of Ukrainian defence intelligence has told the BBC that he ""does not exclude"" the possibility there were Ukrainian prisoners on board the Russian military plane that came down in Belgorod.
However, Andriy Yusov stressed that Russia had provided no proof to back its claims there were.
""There is no clear information about prisoners of war. There are only statements by Russia, of a political and propagandist nature,"" he said. ""Who or what was on board needs to be clarified.""
Mr Yusov, who is the first Ukrainian official interviewed by the BBC since the incident on Wednesday, accused Moscow of ""hiding"" information, with limited images from the crash site - including of any dead.
Russia says 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war died when the IL-76 plane was shot down by a Ukrainian missile.
Its investigative committee released a short video this evening, showing blood on the snow, plane wreckage and a large blackened area of ground.
There are some human body parts - but the footage and what it reveals is very limited.
Asked whether it was possible Ukraine had shot down the military plane, Mr Yusov said: ""We do not confirm such information.""
He said both sides were using drones that day over Belgorod: ""There were Ukrainian reconnaissance drones and Russia was launching attack drones.""
""Russian air defence was working against them. Belgorod is also potentially within the range of Ukrainian air defence systems.""
When pushed, he said again there was ""no confirmed information"" that Ukraine had fired at the plane.
He also suggested that what he called a ""friendly fire"" incident by Russia - hitting its own plane - was ""one of the possible scenarios"" that needed looking into.
Mr Yusov said Ukraine had launched a criminal case on the plane incident that would look into all the possibilities.
He stressed the need for an international investigation, with full access to the crash site in Russia and any fragments of plane or any missile - ""in order to rule out all possibilities"".
The intelligence officer did claim that the specific Il-76 aircraft which crashed had been used previously to deliver ammunition and ""missiles for S-300 and S-400 systems"" to the Belgorod region.
We haven't been able to check that.
But such missiles are used in regular deadly strikes on Ukraine, particularly the Kharkiv region near the Russian border. This week, dozens of people have been injured here - and at least 10 killed - when residential buildings were hit.
Mr Yusov added that Ukraine ""can't exclude"" the plane was carrying both people and ammunition.
On the prisoner swap, he confirmed an exchange had been planned on Wednesday ""around lunchtime"". But it was meant to take place in the Sumy region, west of Belgorod.
Mr Yusov refuted Russia's claim that it had warned Ukraine its PoWs would be brought by military plane to the Belgorod region.
He said the two sides implemented a ceasefire in Sumy, as agreed. ""Unfortunately, the exchange did not happen.""
The Ukrainian official said the two sides usually communicate about the routes they will use for prisoner swaps, to ensure safety.
On 3 January, during the previous swap, he said Ukraine was informed that Russia would use a plane.
On Thursday, Ukraine's Air Forces chief stressed that the country had the right to defend itself against attack by Russia and would continue to do so.

EEGISQ91IR_XSSJ1LXWDPPA99B,UNRWA claims: UK halts aid to UN agency over allegation staff helped Hamas attack,By Sarah Fowler & Lipika Pelham,1 day ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68104203,"Several countries including the UK have paused funding for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.
It comes after the agency announced the sacking of several of its staff over allegations they were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks.
The UK government said it was ""appalled"" by Israel's allegations.
The US, Australia, Italy, Canada, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany have also suspended additional funding to the UN agency.
Created in 1949, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, is the biggest UN agency operating in Gaza.
It provides health care, education and other humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It employs around 13,000 people inside Gaza.
Since Israel began its offensive in response to the 7 October attacks, UNRWA has used its facilities across Gaza to shelter hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians.
It says it has ordered an investigation into information supplied by Israel.
Israel has long accused different branches of the United Nations including UNRWA of bias and even of antisemitism.
Speaking to the BBC, the organisation's former chief spokesperson, Christopher Gunness, said that the suspension of aid to UNRWA was disproportionate and can only lead to further suffering in Gaza.
Mr Gunness believes UNRWA has demonstrated its zero-tolerance policy by sacking the staff members before their internal investigation was complete.
""One million displaced people are currently taking refuge in and around UNRWA buildings. They are the ones who will suffer as a result of this decision,"" said Mr Gunness, adding: ""The curtailing of UNRWA services will also destabilise the region at a time when Western governments are trying to contain a regional conflagration.""
On Friday, an adviser to the Israeli prime minister told the BBC that the 7 October Hamas attacks had involved ""people who are on their [UNRWA] salaries"".
Mark Regev said there was information showing teachers working in UNRWA schools had ""openly celebrated"" the 7 October attacks.
He also referred to an Israeli hostage who, on her release, said she had been ""held in the house of someone who worked for UNRWA"".
""They have a union which is controlled by Hamas and I think it's high time that the UN investigated these links between UNRWA and Hamas,"" he added.
The allegations prompted reaction from major donors.
""The UK is appalled by allegations that UNRWA staff were involved in the 7 October attack against Israel, a heinous act of terrorism that the UK Government has repeatedly condemned,"" the UK Foreign Office said in a statement.
""The UK is temporarily pausing any future funding of UNWRA whilst we review these concerning allegations,"" it added.
Earlier, the US State Department announced that it was suspending additional funding to the UN agency, saying it was ""extremely troubled"" by the allegations of UN staff involvement in the attacks.
The EU said that it would assess further steps ""based on the result of the full and comprehensive investigation"".
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""horrified by this news"".
The head of UNRWA, Philippe Lazzarini, said a full investigation into the allegations was being carried out ""to establish the truth without delay.""
""To protect the agency's ability to deliver humanitarian assistance, I have taken the decision to immediately terminate the contracts of these staff members,"" Mr Lazzarini added.
He said any staff found to have been involved in ""acts of terror"" would be held accountable.
Israel's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz said he aimed to stop UNRWA operating in Gaza after the war.
But the Palestinian Authority's minister for civilian affairs, Hussein Al-Sheikh, said the decision by some countries to pause support for the vital UN agency ""entails great political and humanitarian relief risks"".
Mr al-Sheikh urged Western donors to immediately reverse their decision, adding: ""We need the maximum support for this international organisation.""
The Irish deputy premier, MicheÃ¡l Martin, said his country had no plans to suspend its funding for the agency, saying it provided ""life saving assistance to 2.3m people and at incredible personal cost - with over 100 staff killed in last four months"".
In a post on Telegram, Hamas's press office said the group urged the UN and the international organisations ""to not cave in to the threats and blackmail"" from Israel.
Hamas killed around 1,300 people, mostly civilians, in the unprecedented attack on southern Israeli communities on 7 October last year.
Another 250 people were taken hostage. The events triggered Israel's retaliatory attacks on Hamas in Gaza, which have killed more than 26,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
The US, Germany and the EU are among some of UNRWA's biggest donors.
The agency says it is struggling to get humanitarian aid to many of the estimated 1.7 million people - nearly three-quarters of the population - displaced by 12 weeks of fighting.
A number of UN facilities where Gazans had taken shelter have been hit in Israeli air strikes.
On Wednesday, 12 people were killed when a UN shelter was struck in Khan Younis in southern Gaza.

EKKTAAF8RC_A2TBRRU5KWFRO4J,Houthis attack British-linked tanker Marlin Luanda in Gulf of Aden,By James Gregory,1 day ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68110358,"A tanker with links to the UK was on fire for several hours in the Gulf of Aden after being hit by a missile fired by the Houthis.
The Iran-backed movement, based in Yemen, said it targeted the Marlin Luanda on Friday in response to ""American-British aggression"".
The US and UK have launched air strikes on Houthi targets in response to attacks on ships in the Red Sea region.
French, Indian and US naval ships provided assistance to the vessel.
UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps called the attack ""intolerable and illegal.""
""It is our duty to protect freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and we remain as committed to that cause as ever,"" he said on X.
The operator of the Marlin Luanda is registered as being Oceonix Services Ltd, a UK registered company.
The tanker flies under the flag of the Marshall Islands and is operated on behalf of Trafigura - a multinational trading company.
In an update on Saturday, Trafigura said all crew were safe and that the fire in a cargo tank had been put out. The ship was now sailing towards a safe harbour, the company said.
The US Central Command (Centcom) said there were no casualties on the tanker, which was made up of 22 Indian and 1 Bangladeshi crew members.
It is the latest attack on commercial shipping by the Houthis in and around the Red Sea. The group says it is targeting vessels in the region in support of Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel is fighting Hamas.
In a statement, a Houthi spokesperson claimed the Marlin Luanda was a British ship and was targeted in response to ""American-British aggression against our country"".
The UK government said attacks on commercial shipping are ""completely unacceptable"" and that Britain and its allies ""reserve the right to respond appropriately"".
The US Central Command said ""these unlawful actions have nothing to do with the conflict in Gaza"".
""Neither the vessel nor its crew have any affiliation to Israel. The Houthis have fired indiscriminately into the Red Sea, targeting vessels impacting over 40 countries around the world,"" Centcom said in a statement.
The UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said the incident happened 60 nautical miles south-east of Aden.
It warned other vessels to transit with caution and report any suspicious activity.
Later, Centcom said its forces had conducted a strike at 03:45 local time (00:45 GMT) on Saturday ""against a Houthi anti-ship missile aimed into the Red Sea and which was prepared to launch"". They ""destroyed the missile in self-defence"", Centcom said.
Since November, the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels travelling through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.

Watch: A video showing a chained lion cub seated in the back of a white, open-top Bentley has gone viral
Police in Thailand have arrested a woman whose pet lion was pictured going on a joyride in the streets of Pattaya.
A video that has now gone viral shows the chained lion cub seated in the back of a white, open-top Bentley.
The lion was being driven about by a Sri Lankan man who has since left the country, and is believed to be a friend of the woman, Sawangjit Kosoongnern.
While it is not illegal to own a lion in Thailand, it needs to be officially registered.
Authorities in Thailand said Ms Sawangjit claimed to have bought the animal from a Thai man in Nakhon Pathom province, who successfully facilitated its delivery to Pattaya.
However he failed to have his facility checked by officials before doing so, which made both the transfer and ownership of the animal illegal.
She is therefore facing charges of possessing a controlled wild animal without permission, which carries a penalty of a year's imprisonment and a fine of up to 100,000 baht ($2,800; Â£2,200).
Police were also reportedly looking to charge the Sri Lankan man, who had kept the lion in his rented pool villa, but were unable to as he is no longer in Thailand. He was due to be charged with bringing a controlled wild animal into public places, which carries jail time of up to six months and a fine of 50,000 baht.
The man who sold the lion to Ms Sawangjit will also face charges of moving an animal without permission.
Officials say there are currently 224 lions in Thailand that are legally owned.

F739U6Z92Z_936VEHMO4LM3TLZ,Kenneth Eugene Smith: US inmate faces first nitrogen execution after losing last-minute appeals,By Brandon Drenon & Tom Bateman,3 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68089279,"The Supreme Court has refused to grant a last-minute reprieve to an Alabama death row inmate facing the first ever US execution by nitrogen inhalation.
The justices have twice declined, along with a federal appeals court, to block what Kenneth Eugene Smith's lawyers call a ""cruel and unusual"" punishment.
Opponents say using nitrogen gas could cause unnecessary suffering, and a leak could harm people present in the room.
Smith, 58, was convicted in 1989 of murdering Elizabeth Sennett.
Alabama's death warrant expires early on Friday morning.
Smith, who has been on death row since 1996, told the BBC earlier this week that the wait felt like torture.
He will be the first person to be put to death by this method in the US and, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, anywhere in the world.
Breathing pure nitrogen without oxygen causes the cells to break down and leads to death. Alabama said in a court filing that they expect him to lose consciousness within seconds and die in a matter of minutes.
But its use has been denounced by some medical professionals, who warn it could cause a range of catastrophic mishaps, ranging from violent convulsions to survival in a vegetative state.
Alabama and two other US states have approved the use of nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative method of execution because the drugs used in lethal injections have become more difficult to find, contributing to a fall in the number of executions nationally.
Alabama already tried to execute Smith by lethal injection two years ago but were unable to raise a vein before the state's death warrant expired.
Smith was one of two men convicted of murdering Mrs Sennett in a $1,000 (Â£790) killing-for-hire in  March 1988.
The 45-year-old was beaten with a fireplace implement and stabbed in the chest and neck, and her death was staged to look like a home invasion and burglary.
Her husband Charles Sennett, a debt-ridden preacher, had orchestrated the scheme to collect insurance money. He killed himself as investigators closed in.
Smith's fellow hitman, John Forrest Parker, was executed in 2010.
At his trial Smith admitted to being present when the victim was killed, but said he did not take part in the attack.
The UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights has said gassing Smith could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and called for a halt.
Smith's lawyers lodged a challenge with the Supreme Court, arguing that putting convicts through multiple execution attempts violates the Eighth Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects against ""cruel and unusual"" punishment.
On Wednesday, the justices declined to hear the appeal and denied his request to halt the execution. No justice publicly dissented from the ruling.
Smith also made a separate legal challenge to the lower 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, where he contested the legality of Alabama's nitrogen gas protocol.
But that court also rejected the inmate's request for an injunction in a ruling on Wednesday evening.
A final appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected again on Thursday, with three liberal justices noting public dissents this time.
Smith's legal team argues the nitrogen gas method is ""recently released and untested"", leaving him at risk of choking on his own vomit.
State Attorney General Steve Marshall previously called it ""perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised"".
Smith's spiritual adviser, Reverend Jeff Hood, will be present in the room when the execution happens. He told the BBC he believes he will be in danger if the nitrogen leaks.
On Wednesday, prison officials escorted Rev Hood for a ""walk-through"" of the execution chamber, as required by Alabama's execution protocol.
He told the BBC afterwards that he saw oxygen-level meters unplugged on a ledge inside the room, which he described as ""unbelievably disturbing, it feels like you are at the centre of evil"".
""I asked 'what's the safety plan?' and they said they didn't want to get into it, they couldn't get into it,"" he said.

Watch: ""This is dangerous."" Smith's spiritual adviser, Jeff Hood, discusses the risk he faces.
""Once again we're back at this place of having to rely on these people who have botched three executions in the last [few] years, he said. ""It's absolutely a terrifying thing to think that your life hangs in the balance with these guys"".
Rev Hood said he had requested that Alabama's Governor Kay Ivey be present in the chamber during the execution to demonstrate her confidence in its safety, but had not received a response.
""We have somebody who is championing this type of execution in the governor and yet she is unwilling to get her hands dirty,"" he said.
The BBC has approached Ms Ivey's office for comment regarding this and the latest accusations over safety.
Alabama has one of the highest per capita execution rates in the US and has 165 people currently on death row.
Since 2018, the state has been responsible for three botched attempts at lethal injection in which the condemned inmates survived.
The failures led to an internal review that largely placed blame on the prisoners themselves.

FG32QKZ5MN_ITV1XPIM28KNV7C,Alaska Airlines warns of $150m Boeing blow-out cost,By Natalie Sherman,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68096634,"Alaska Airlines says it is facing a $150m (Â£118m) hit, after the dramatic mid-air blow-out of a panel on one of its planes this month.
The 5 Jan incident on a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane terrified passengers and prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to ground 171 jets with similar designs.
Alaska had to cancel more than 3,000 flights in the wake of the incident.
It said it expected its travel to return to normal by early next month.
But it warned that growth would be lower than expected in the months ahead, as deliveries of new Boeing aircraft are likely delayed.
The FAA on Wednesday said the grounded Boeing planes could return to service if they have been inspected.
But Boeing's output has been capped, while the FAA investigates its manufacturing.
The troubles at the company, one of the world's two major plane-makers, are now spilling over to the rest of the industry.
United Airlines, another major 737 Max 9 customer, earlier this week said it was braced for delays in deliveries and looking at alternatives to Boeing as it plotted out aircraft orders.
It warned investors that it would lose money in the first quarter due to the incident.
Executives at Southwest and American, which are also reporting earnings this week, have also echoed the concerns about delayed aircraft and frustration with Boeing.
""Boeing needs to get their act together,"" American Airlines chief executive Robert Isom said.
Boeing for its part, has apologised for the disruption and pledged to work transparently and cooperatively with regulators.
Alaska Airlines had also faced questions from passengers, after it was revealed that the airline had restricted the jet involved in the accident from certain routes due to a pressure issue.
Chief executive Ben Minicucci said the problem was ""totally unrelated"". Speaking to financial analysts, he said passengers should feel confident in the safety of flying on its planes.
Mr Minicucci said he was having ""tough"" conversations with Boeing and would hold its ""feet to the fire"", but did not go so far as to threaten to cancel orders.
""We have a longstanding deep relationship,"" he said, noting that the company had been happy with the planes in the past.
Boeing has been struggling with a spate of smaller manufacturing issues in recent years, while trying to repair its reputation after fatal accidents in 2018 and 2019 - involving a different version of the 737 Max - killed 346 people.
Robert Mann, president of RW Mann & Company, an airline analysis and consulting firm in New York, said airlines used to have staff on hand to oversee more of the manufacturing process, but that they had scrapped that practice in recent decades in a drive to cut costs.
""As upset as these airlines are - and you can understand why they would be - they don't exactly have clean hands,"" he said.
Now, with the industry dominated by just two big players - Boeing and European rival Airbus - they are in ""a bit of a box"", he added.
They don't ""really have any alternative as a practical matter,"" he said.

FGNCCMWAGY_65VLBJG1Z7IAK1I,Qatar 'appalled' by reported criticism from Israel's Netanyahu,By David Gritten,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68091659,"Qatar has said it is ""appalled"" by remarks attributed to Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he apparently called its role as a mediator in the Gaza war ""problematic"".
Israeli TV broadcast what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling the families of hostages held by Hamas that ""you don't hear me thanking Qatar"".
""They have leverage... because they finance [Hamas],"" he reportedly adds.
Qatar said the comments, if true, were ""irresponsible"" but ""not surprising"".
The tiny Gulf emirate has had high-level contacts with Israel since the 1990s, but they have never officially established diplomatic relations.
Qatar has long championed the Palestinian cause and hosts political leaders of Hamas, which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, the US and other countries.
It is has also provided hundreds of millions of dollars of aid for Gaza, which has been subject to a crippling blockade by Israel and Egypt since 2006, when Hamas won legislative elections. The blockade was tightened the following year when Hamas reinforced its power in Gaza by violently ousting Palestinian Authority (PA) forces.
Since 2018, Israeli governments have allowed Qatar to pay the wages of tens of thousands of civil servants in Gaza's Hamas-run government, financially support the poorest families, and fund fuel deliveries for the territory's sole power plant. Qatar insists the funding was only for civilian and humanitarian purposes.
The policy sparked controversy within Israel, with critics warning it was helping Hamas to stay in power and fund its military activities.
Mr Netanyahu - who has been re-elected to office for all but one of the past 15 years - said it was a way to dissuade attacks on Israel and prevent a humanitarian disaster in Gaza.
Following the cross-border attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,300 people were killed and 250 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages, he dismissed as a ""big lie"" accusations that he had also encouraged the payments in order to strengthen Hamas at the expense of the PA.
Israel responded to the attacks by launching a large-scale military campaign in Gaza with the aim of destroying Hamas. More than 25,000 people have been killed in the fighting, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
Qatar used its ties with Hamas to help broker a week-long pause in the fighting in late November, during which 105 Israeli and foreign hostages were freed in exchange for some 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
The emirate has for weeks been trying to broker a new ceasefire, with Gaza's humanitarian crisis worsening and with the Israeli government coming under mounting domestic pressure to secure the release of the remaining hostages.
On Tuesday, Israel's Channel 12 TV released what it said was a recording of Mr Netanyahu telling hostages' families: ""You don't hear me thanking Qatar. Have you noticed?""
""Why? Because for me it is essentially no different from the UN or Red Cross, and in a certain sense is even more problematic - I have no illusions about them.""
""But I'm ready to use any actor right now that helps me bring [the hostages] home,"" he added.
Israel has accused the UN and Red Cross of not doing enough to support the hostages or to help get them freed.
The prime minister purportedly said the reason Qatar could help was because of ""leverage"" over Hamas.
""Why do they have leverage? Because they finance them.""
On Wednesday night, Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari wrote on X, formerly Twitter: ""These remarks if validated, are irresponsible and destructive to the efforts to save innocent lives, but are not surprising.""
""For months, and following a successful mediation last year that led to the release of more than 100 hostages, Qatar has been engaged in regular dialogue with the negotiating parties including Israeli institutions, attempting to establish the framework for a new hostage agreement and the immediate entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.""
He added that Mr Netanyahu appeared to be undermining the mediation efforts ""for reasons that appear to serve his political career"".
In response, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X: ""Qatar is a country that supports and finances terrorism. It is Hamas's patron and is largely responsible for the massacre of Israeli citizens by Hamas.""
""One thing is certain: Qatar will not have one iota of involvement in Gaza on the day after the war,"" he added.
There was no immediate comment from Qatar's foreign ministry.
Meanwhile US President Biden is sending the director of the CIA to try to broker a new deal on hostages held in Gaza, the BBC's US partner CBS has confirmed.
William Burns will meet the Qatari PM and directors of Mossad, Israel's secret service, in France.

FLY0VECEUA_N617MDM4ANWD4E2,Evan Gershkovich: Russia again extends detention of US journalist,By Max Matza,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68111693,"Russia has once again extended the pre-trial detention of American journalist Evan Gershkovich, 32, who was arrested last year on espionage charges.
The court ordered that his detention be extended until 30 March which means the Wall Street Journal reporter will spend over one year behind bars as he awaits trial.
Mr Gershkovich, his newspaper, and the US deny the espionage charges.
US officials have called for his immediate release.
""The grounds for Evan's detention are baseless,"" the American embassy in Moscow tweeted on Friday. ""Journalism is not a crime.  We continue to call for Evan's immediate release.""
His arrest marked the first time Moscow had accused a US journalist of espionage since the Soviet era.
Mr Gershkovich was arrested in the city of Yekaterinburg, about 1,600km (1,000 miles) east of Moscow, while reporting on the war in Ukraine on 29 March.
It is the fourth time his detention has been extended and as a result he will continue to be held in Moscow's Lefortovo prison.  Mr Gershkovich faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.
A video of the hearing, posted on the Moscow court system's Telegram channel, confirms the two-month pre-trial extension and shows Mr Gershkovich listening to the proceedings while wearing jeans and hoodie.
The closed hearing on Friday was attended by US consulate officials, including United States Consul General Stuart Wilson, according to then Associated Press.
Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the US and Russia were discussing Mr Gershkovich's possible release, and were working to find a ""mutually acceptable"" outcome.
""It seems to me that on the whole we're speaking in a language which we both understand,"" he said.
Russian officials have previously suggested that they are open to a prisoner swap with the US, but only after a trial is concluded.

April: Evan Gershkovich appears in Russian court
The US government has designated the reporter as being ""wrongfully detained"", a status which requires it to work to free him.
Former US Marine Paul Whelan, who is currently serving a 16-year sentence in Russia for spying, is also considered wrongfully detained. Last year, he told the BBC that he felt ""abandoned"" by his own country.
In October 2023, a journalist with both American and Russian citizenship was detained while visiting her family.
Alsu Kurmasheva, who works for US-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, is accused of failing to register as a foreign agent and is facing a jail term of up to 15 years.

FRAJH26557_JOC3FO1CSG27E8H,"UK-Canada trade rift: What it means for cheese, beef and cars","By Harrison Jones & Tom Espiner in London, Jessica Murphy in Toronto",2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68107263,"The UK and Canada are blaming each other after a dispute over beef and cheese led to the collapse of trade talks.
Negotiations to thrash out a new agreement to replace the one the two countries had when the UK was still in the European Union had been running for nearly two years.
But on Thursday night, it emerged the UK had halted discussions, due to a lack of progress on the two food products.
It could mean tougher trading terms for the UK with a partner that accounted for 1.4% of its total trade in the 12 months to June 2023.
Goods trade between the two countries was worth Â£19.2bn in 2020, according to the UK government, with UK imports from Canada worth Â£7.3bn and UK exports to Canada worth Â£11.8bn.
The implications of the talks collapsing could be felt by consumers and farmers in both countries. Another major sector, cars, will also be affected.
Here's the likely impact on all three areas at a glance.
British farmers will see the collapse in talks as a big win. The body representing UK farmers, the National Farmers Union (NFU), has been putting pressure on the government to protect its members.
Beef farmers in the UK are already facing competition from those in New Zealand and Australia, whose exports benefit from free trade deals with the UK, meaning tariffs are removed.
Minette Batters, the president of the Nation Farmers' Union of England and Wales, said walking away from the Canadian trade deal would have been difficult, ""but it's the right decision"".
Canada's government had been pushing for the UK to relax a ban on hormone-treated beef, which its producers say effectively shuts them out of the British market.
The Canadian Cattle Association said the UK had ""shown no indication that it is prepared to fully accept Canada's food safety system, which is widely recognised as one of the finest in the world"".
It's not the first time that beef has been a sticking point in trade relations between the two nations. Canada's farming industry has previously voiced its frustration to the government, saying that its meat is ""severely disadvantaged"" under a post-Brexit interim agreement with the UK, and essentially blocked out of that market.
Last year, a coalition of Canadian farming groups protested the UK's accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement over concerns about that reciprocal access. They demanded that either the UK accept Canada's food safety system or pay compensation for their losses.
British cheese exports to Canada were worth Â£18.7m - or 2.4% of total cheese exports - in 2022, according to the Food and Drink Federation (FDF).
That translates to Canada importing a little more than two million kilograms of cheese from the UK (its fifth largest supplier), international trade data indicates.
British firm Coombe Castle International is the largest UK cheese exporter to Canada and about a third of the cheese it exports goes to the country.
Ben Hutchins, its sales and marketing director, told the BBC the firm was ""pretty gutted"" that talks had been suspended, adding that the company had been exporting to Canada since 1980.
He said the suspension of talks ""doesn't look rosy"" for cheese exports.
Mr Hutchins said that with a third of the business tied up in Canada after 40 years, it won't be easy to quickly find new markets.
Industry group Dairy UK said the suspension of talks was ""regrettable, but there was little indication that Canada was really willing to improve access to the Canadian cheese market"".
Since the beginning of the year, UK cheese exporters have seen a 245% tariff placed on British cheese going to Canada, impacting prices.
""This has put UK dairy exporters at a disadvantage and disrupted trade,"" a Dairy UK spokesperson said.
""However, exports to Canada are a relatively small part of UK production, and while some UK dairy companies will be faced with a significant commercial challenge, we understand that it will not be insurmountable,"" the group added.
Meanwhile, Canadian cheese exports, including its cheddar, are mainly to other countries. The UK is not in its top ten markets.
The Canadian Cheese Council of Canada, which represents small and medium-sized cheese importers and their suppliers, said its members had spent decades building relationships with the UK cheesemakers.
The December expiry of the time-limited agreement that allowed the UK to continue to sell cheese without high tariffs has already caused ""significant"" disruption in the industry and ""will cripple cheese importers as well as small cheese shops across Canada"", it said.
That, combined with the pause in trade talks, put the efforts spent building those bilateral relationships ""in jeopardy"", Joe Dal Ferro, council chairperson, told the BBC.
""We feel abandoned by both governments"", he said.
Afrim Pristine, who owns the Cheese Boutique in Toronto, told the BBC that cheese from the UK is popular - in December, he sold about 250 kg (550lb) of it every day.
He hasn't yet had to raise prices in his store - he has enough in stock from last year - but when he does, he says ""A - is it going to be available, and B - what's the cost going to be""?
""I don't want to disappoint my customers, clients who've been supporting my business for decades. And that's what's going to happen.""
The UK's biggest goods export to Canada is cars, according to the Department for Business and Trade.
In the 12 months to the end of the second quarter of 2023, exports were worth Â£745.8m.
A time-limited agreement had allowed the UK to continue to sell cars without high import taxes, but this is now in doubt.
Although the UK's exports to Canada are much smaller than those to the EU, Canada is still ""an important market"", according to Mike Hawes of trade group The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
""Given the close ties between our two countries, the suspension of trade talks is especially disappointing, and sends a signal that the UK's world-class automotive products are not welcome in Canada,"" he said.
If tariffs on UK cars are reintroduced ""this would benefit no one, not least Canadian consumers"", he said, adding: ""We urge all parties to get back around the negotiating table.""
There are no significant imports of Canadian-manufactured cars into the UK, the BBC understands.
There has been a muted reaction from the Canadian automobile industry to the news.

More than 4,000 paintings at the National Art Gallery in the capital Sukhumi were lost in the blaze.
It spread quickly inside the early 20th Century building which had a wooden structure and was home to an entire collection of Abkhazian art.
Investigators say an electrical short circuit may have started the fire.
A video on social media showed intense flames inside the gallery.
Among the destroyed artworks were 300 pieces by the renowned artist and stage designer Alexander Chachba-Shervashidze.
The director of the national gallery, Suram Sakanya, said the collection had survived Abkhazia's civil war with Georgia in the 1990s and was an irreparable loss for Abkhaz culture.
""We have been gathering this collection since 1963 and it went up in flames in seconds. Such a tragedy for us here in Abkhazia,"" the director said.
Local artists had long been demanding a more suitable location to store the unique art collection. A video taken before the fire showed paintings stacked together in two cramped rooms without adequate protection.
Abkhazia, which gets military and financial support from Moscow, lies in the north-western corner of Georgia and borders Russia.
The region fought a war of secession with Georgia from 1992-93 and declared independence in 1999, but has little international recognition.
Since the Georgian-Russian war of 2008, Moscow has recognised it as an independent state. Georgia says Abkhazia is occupied by Russia.
Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili said the fire was ""a tragedy for us all"".
""I deplore what is a direct consequence of the neglect of cultural identity both by the de facto leadership and the Russian occupants,"" she posted on X, formerly Twitter.
Russia has promised to send specialists to Sukhumi to help restore the surviving 150 paintings rescued from the fire.

FU7QFTUD2X_PX8SR6FNTLEJ1CZ,Kerem Shalom crossing: Israeli protesters hold up aid trucks to Gaza,By Lipika Pelham,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68103641,"Hundreds of Israeli protesters have blocked some humanitarian aid trucks from entering Gaza for a third day.
Demonstrators, including families of hostages still held in Gaza, waved Israeli flags at a key crossing and chanted against ""aiding the enemy"".
The protesters say they are demanding no aid for Gaza until all of the hostages are released.
This comes despite a US demand that aid to civilians in Gaza be allowed to enter ""without interruption"".
For a third consecutive day, the protesters descended on the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and Gaza to try to block humanitarian aid from entering the enclave.
A queue of trucks carrying aid supplies, some of them flying Egyptian flags, idled for hours at the crossing as the protesters urged the government to stop aid supplies until the remaining captives held by Hamas are freed.
The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said that on Wednesday - the first day of the protests - only nine trucks were able to cross at Kerem Shalom, while 114 were diverted to the Rafah crossing in Egypt.
The UN said that only 153 trucks had entered Gaza on Wednesday, which was well below what had been able to enter in recent weeks.
The Israeli government is facing growing international pressure to allow more humanitarian relief into Gaza, combined with intense domestic pressure to secure the release of the hostages.
The protesters say they view the delivery of aid to Gaza while their loved ones are still being held by Hamas as ""a moral failure"".
They say they fear the aid could end up in the group's hands.
Israeli media report that although some of the protesters are related to hostages, others are the parents of IDF soldiers currently deployed in Gaza, with another group representing right-wing activists who promote a return of Jewish settlements to Gaza.
The demonstration took place amid unconfirmed reports that Israeli and American officials will hold ""critical"" hostage talks with Qatari and Egyptian mediators in Europe in the coming days.
The reports suggest that the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency, William Burns, and the Mossad chief, David Barnea, will meet Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, to discuss the release of more than 100 Israeli hostages and a pause in fighting in Gaza.
The White House has described the talks as ""sober"" and ""serious"" efforts, involving players who were key to sealing a previous agreement in November.
But Hamas continues to insist on a full ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.
A senior Palestinian official has told the BBC that mediators have proposed the phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for a renewable ceasefire, the release of Palestinian prisoners and an increase in aid.
Meanwhile, heavy fighting has continued in Gaza. Israeli military officials say warplanes have carried out dozens of raids on several Hamas targets around Khan Younis during the night.
The Hamas-run health ministry says Israeli attacks in the past 24 hours have killed 183 people and injured nearly 400 others.
Israel launched its military campaign with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after its gunmen killed 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage, in the unprecedented attack on southern Israeli communities on 7 October last year.
Since then, health officials say more than 26,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza.

G0HHFR4VEG_DSRXGOHYKNEVU12,'Bankrupt' Nottingham City Council seeks Â£65m of emergency help,By Jamie Waller,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-68062038,"Nottingham City Council has asked the government for Â£65m of ""exceptional financial support"".
The authority effectively declared itself bankrupt in November when it issued a section 114 notice.
It faces a Â£23m budget shortfall for the current financial year, and a separate Â£53m gap for the year beginning April 2024.
The council has asked the government for the emergency help for both financial years.
It has asked the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) for Â£25m this financial year and up to Â£40m next year.
Details of the application for funding were revealed in a presentation at a council meeting on Monday.
The Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) said the council officials believe the funding will only be provided if the authority implements the full Â£14.9m its is proposing in cuts - including those to libraries, road sweeping and community protection.
The LDRS also said any support would likely be in the form of loans and special permission to raise money from council assets and spend it on day-to-day operational costs, rather than a grant.
Steve Battlemuch, the council's portfolio holder for skills, growth, economic development and property, said the authority was waiting for a government response.
He said: ""We do need an answer sooner rather than later. The budget is due in February.
""There are a number of factors to be confirmed which we can't finalise until we get an answer.
""The implication from government is that the council will only get money if we accept all of the proposed cuts.""
The government is currently reviewing all steps the council is taking to close its budget gap and previously said it is ""minded-to"" appoint commissioners to take charge.
The DLUHC has been contacted for comment.

He hosted Radio Ulster's Day By Day and Love in the Afternoon, and presented Sunday staple Love Forty.
With a broadcasting career spanning 77 years, Jazz Club with Walter Love aired its final show in 2023.
In a statement, his family confirmed he passed away on Friday morning in a nursing home after a short illness.
Mr Love was inducted into the Phonographic Performance Ireland Radio Awards Hall of Fame in 2014 for recognition of his skill and passion.
He started out as a freelance contributor to BBC radio in the 1950s, before landing a job as a studio manager in London.
He then spent a decade as a TV newsreader in Belfast before joining Radio Ulster in 1978.
His relatives said he was ""a dearly loved member of the Love family"".

In a killing that shocked the country, the dismembered remains of Rita Waeni, 20, were discovered in rubbish bags at a rental apartment in the capital, Nairobi, on 14 January.
Her head was missing, along with her phone and other personal items.
The two men, who Kenyan police say are Nigerian, have appeared in court but have not yet been charged.
Police asked a magistrate for permission to keep the men in custody until 31 January, as their investigations were continuing. The magistrate granted their request.
Ms Waeni's murder has led to calls for more to be done to address violence against women.
Four Kenyans are also in custody in relation to the killing, as well as one person who had been travelling on a Mozambican passport and was picked up as he tried to leave the country.
Police have named the two new suspects being held as William Ovie Opia,and Johnbull Asbor.
Mr Opia had an expired Nigerian passport and Mr Asbor had lost his passport two years ago, police said.
The police seized several items from the suspects' apartment, including a butcher's knife and small axe suspected to have been used in the killing and mutilation of the university student, according to Kenyan media quoting the police.
Mr Opia told investigators that he bought the axe online for self-defence, the privately owned Nation newspaper reported.
The two men were arrested in Ndenderu, a town about 20km (12 miles) from Nairobi and near a dam where the police recovered a head suspected to be Ms Waeni's, along with her phone and some of her missing items.
Ms Waeni's family have so far been unable to identify the recovered head.
The family said last week that those responsible demanded a ransom of 500,000 Kenyan shillings ($3,100; Â£2,400) to release Ms Waeni, even after she had died.
The gruesome way in which her body was dealt with has shocked people, including the chief government pathologist Johansen Oduor, who said he had ""never come across such an incident"" in his forensic career.
Human rights and feminist groups have planned countrywide demonstrations to protest against what they see as a surge in femicide and violence against women.
There has been a spate of reported violent killings of women since the beginning of the year. A survey carried out in 2022 found that at least 34% of women said they had experienced physical violence at some point in their lives.

GQYCDULGGZ_1OVHU21EE5F39T1,737 Max 9: Boeing jets cleared to fly after mid-air incident,By Mariko Oi,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68090175,"This video can not be played
Watch: On board flight during mid-air blow out
The US aviation regulator says it will allow Boeing's 737 Max 9 jets to resume flying after inspections are completed.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded 171 of the planes after an unused door broke away mid-flight.
United Airlines and Alaska Airlines plan to start returning the jets to service in the coming days.
But the FAA says it will not yet allow Boeing to expand production of its best-selling narrow body family of jets, which includes the 737 Max 9.
The unprecedented decision by the regulator marks more bad news for the plane making giant.
""This won't be back to business as usual for Boeing,"" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.
""We will not agree to any request from Boeing for an expansion in production or approve additional production lines for the 737 Max until we are satisfied that the quality control issues uncovered during this process are resolved,"" he added.
The announcement that the planes will be allowed to fly again once inspections have been completed is welcome news for Alaska Airlines and United Airlines, which had to cancel thousands of flights.
Alaska Airlines said it expects ""to bring our first few planes back into scheduled commercial service on Friday"", with more planes added every day as inspections are completed.
United Airlines said it had received final approval from the FAA to complete the process of returning its 79-strong fleet of 737 Max 9 planes to service.
The company's chief operations officer Toby Enqvist said the airline was preparing to start flying the aircraft again from 28 January.
On 5 January a door plug on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 blew off shortly after take-off, terrifying passengers, and forcing an emergency return to the Portland, Oregon airport.
Bosses of both Alaska Airlines and United Airlines have expressed frustration with Boeing over the grounding of the 737 Max 9, which has caused major disruptions to their services.
In an interview with NBC News, Alaska Airlines boss Ben Minicucci said there was ""no doubt"" that the plane came ""off the production line with a faulty door"".
He said airline inspections since the incident found ""many"" loose bolts. ""I'm more than frustrated and disappointed,"" he said. ""I am angry.""
United Airlines chief executive, Scott Kirby, also told CNBC that he is ""disappointed"".
""The Max 9 grounding is probably the straw that broke the camel's back for us,"" he said, adding that ""we're going to build a plan that doesn't have the [Boeing] Max 10 in it"".
United also said earlier this week that it expected to lose money because of the grounding.
On Wednesday, the head of Boeing, David Calhoun, faced questions from lawmakers in Washington to explain what led to the mid-air emergency.
The latest incident raises fresh questions about the safety of Boeing's aircraft.
The company faced intense scrutiny after two fatal crashes of 737 Max 8 passenger jets in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people.

GXZ0YNIES4_YZV417AMVDGUM8X,King Charles 'doing well' after prostate treatment,By Sean Coughlan,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68055575,"King Charles has had his treatment for an enlarged prostate, after being admitted to hospital on Friday morning.
Queen Camilla said the King is ""doing well"". He is expected to spend at least one night at the hospital.
The procedure was carried out at the London Clinic private hospital, where Catherine, the Princess of Wales had surgery last week.
The King visited his daughter-in-law in the hospital on Friday morning, ahead of his own treatment.
Queen Camilla left the hospital in Marylebone in central London on Friday evening, having arrived with the King this morning.
Before leaving the hospital, she said of her husband: ""He's doing well, thank you.""
King Charles had made his health problem public as a way of sending a message to other men to get their prostates checked.
Following the disclosure, the NHS website saw a surge in searches about enlarged prostates, an interest welcomed by doctors and charities.
A statement from Buckingham Palace said the King was ""delighted to learn that his diagnosis is having a positive impact on public health awareness"".
He also thanked those who had ""sent their good wishes"".
The plan for King Charles, aged 75, to have ""corrective procedure"" for his enlarged prostate was revealed by the palace last week. He travelled on Thursday from Sandringham to London to have the operation.
A benign prostate problem, which is non-cancerous, is common in older men, according to the NHS.
About one in three men over the age of 50 will have some symptoms of an enlarged prostate, which is a gland that sits just below the bladder.
The medical treatment is not significant enough to require any constitutional changes for the King's role as head of state. There will not be a need for ""counsellors of state"" who can stand in when a monarch is seriously ill.
A spokeswoman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he had sent best wishes to the King for a ""speedy recovery"".
The King is being treated in the same hospital where his daughter-in-law Catherine had ""abdominal surgery"" last week.
When she leaves the hospital it is expected that she will spend several months recuperating at home in Windsor. It means the princess will not be taking part in any official duties until after Easter.
There was a third royal health story this week, when it was revealed that Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, had been diagnosed with malignant melanoma, a form of skin cancer.
It had been discovered during treatment for her breast cancer, which had been diagnosed last summer.
""Naturally another cancer diagnosis has been a shock, but I'm in good spirits and grateful for the many messages of love and support,"" said the duchess, who was formerly married to Prince Andrew.
A spokesman for the duchess said she will have further investigations to ensure the melanoma has been caught in the early stages.

But when he appeared this week at the public inquiry into South Africa's deadliest building fire, he announced he had started it.
Sthembiso Lawrence Mdlalose, 30, said he had started the fire in the Usindiso building last August unintentionally.
He described himself as working for a violent drug dealer who demanded rent from residents.
He said the fire began after he used fuel to set light to the body of a man he had strangled while high on drugs, in a ground-floor room used to beat people targeted by the dealer.
Police arrested him at the inquiry. While in custody, he made a further confession.
He appeared in court on Thursday charged with 76 murders, 86 attempted murders, and a charge of arson. The authorities have not explained why he is facing 76 charges of murder, when the public inquiry has said 77 people died in the fire.
Prosecutors allege the murders were pre-meditated.
Johannesburg, known as the city of gold, is Africa's wealthiest city.
The fire has highlighted the profound housing crisis here.
Many people live in appalling conditions, without water or electricity, in deeply unsafe buildings.
The plight of the fire's survivors demonstrates the crisis still further.
More than 500 people were left homeless by the fire. The residents are some of the poorest people in South African society.
In the immediate aftermath, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the scene and declared ""our hearts go out to every person affected by this event"".
He said the disaster called on everyone, from the government down, to help restore the wellbeing of those affected and ""offer all material help residents may need"".
But, five months on, many survivors are suffering.
We visited 39 families who have been placed by the authorities in a newly built camp of metal shacks, which have no water or power, and which flood when it rains.
Sthembiso Ndebele lives in one of the shacks with her three children, including her disabled 10-year-old son, who she said is not coping with the conditions.
She asked President Ramaphosa to ""please give us housing not these shacks - these shacks are too dangerous for us"".
Hundreds of people living in the shacks have access to only two communal taps, a few chemical toilets which residents say are deeply unhygienic, and no showers or bathing facilities.
We saw men cooking on open fires, with elderly women shovelling sand around the bottom of their shacks to stop water getting in.
The Denver area of the city where the shacks have been placed is dangerous, and one girl has been raped, the residents said.
At first, multiple security guards were provided to keep watch, but these were withdrawn, leaving a single guard on a daytime shift by the time we visited.
Andy Chinnah, a human rights activist who is helping the residents, said: ""We want dignity and this is not dignity"".
When I challenged Johannesburg's Mayor, Kabelo Gwamanda, on the camp's conditions, he said there was not ""sufficient budget for us to be responding efficiently or in the manner in which we want to"", especially when ""unplanned"" emergencies occur.
He said that, in the past, the city had decent alternative accommodation, but those properties ""got hijacked"".
This was a reference to the city's so-called ""hijacked buildings"".
Matthew Wilhelm-Solomon, author of The Blinded City, says the term emerged in the early 2000s and referred to criminal gangs taking over some properties.
He says it was subsequently applied by the media and politicians to an array of buildings, even though many did not have gangs taking over and illegally renting them.
Wilhelm-Solomon says that what was essentially a crisis about affordable inner city rental properties began to be viewed ""through the lens of criminality"", which ended up criminalising people who were just looking for accommodation.
Many buildings in the city have been abandoned or neglected by owners and left without basic services or safety measures.
The law gives people evicted from such buildings the right to emergency temporary accommodation. But the profound lack of affordable housing means this is rarely offered.
The camp of metal shacks is the authorities' current offer of such temporary accommodation, but those living there wonder how long ""temporary"" will turn out to be.
An estimated 15,000 people are believed to be homeless in Johannesburg.
The mayor says there are now 188 ""bad buildings"" under investigation, with 134 of them in the inner city, and that the city authorities are pursuing multiple court cases to evict people, approaching them as places from which they need to be rescued.
Courtrooms are a battle ground in the struggle for decent housing.
After the Usindiso building fire, there were 248 people at the scene who agreed to be relocated to various shelters, according to court documents, with some foreign nationals refusing to be relocated to shelters due to fear of deportation.
Thirty-two foreign nationals were arrested and placed in a repatriation centre, but human rights groups went to the high court and obtained an order preventing the state from deporting them for now as they are witnesses in the ongoing public inquiry.
At one stage, the Department of Home Affairs claimed the main support groups for the fire's victims did not exist and that residents should have brought a court case in their individual names, but the court rejected the government's arguments.
In the meantime, the danger remains in Johannesburg's ""bad buildings"".
One property that has been a focus of attention is Vannin Court, long without water or power, and which is falling into deep disrepair.
The broken lift shaft is dangerously open, with children walking past in the darkness, and the fire escape lacks stairs as thieves have stolen them for scrap metal.
Some residents have been living in the property for decades and say they feel abandoned.
Vannin Court has been subjected to high-profile police raids, with politicians and media in tow, and five years ago the local authorities received publicity after claiming the property would be totally redeveloped - a pledge that was never followed through.
Mukelwa Mdunge, who lives in Vannin Court with her family, told us that facilities in the building once worked but had fallen into tragic dereliction, with the darkness and a lack of security creating constant danger for residents.
But she says the residents have no other option, and do not want to be evicted into even more uncertain conditions.
""This one is our home, where can we go?""
At the inquiry into the fire, where the confession came this week, damning evidence is now being heard about an entire culture of safety and security for the poorest in society.
Last week, fire safety expert Wynand Engelbrecht said the condition of the Usindiso building was not unlike that of hundreds other similar buildings in South Africa.
""It is clear both privately-owned and public sector-owned structures are far too often left to deteriorate to the point of no-return.
""Life safety is not a priority in this country, not even by a long shot.""
The current reckoning is barely beginning, let alone near an end.
The suffering behind Johannesburg's neglected walls will not be contained.

H9YQF6ZY8V_6ADLJTO8LDOMZXT,Iraq condemns 'irresponsible' US air strikes on Iran-backed groups,By Lipika Pelham,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68077560,"The Iraqi government has strongly condemned US strikes which targeted sites used by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq on Wednesday.
A spokesperson for Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said they ""blatantly"" violated his country's sovereignty.
The US said its ""proportionate"" attacks had targeted ""Iran-affiliated groups"".
The paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) said the ""treacherous"" US action killed one of their fighters.
The PMF, which is dominated by Iran-backed Shia Muslim militias, said a number of other fighters were injured in strikes on their bases in al-Qaim, a town on the Syrian border in western Anbar province, and in Jurf al-Nasr, in the central province of Babil.
US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes on three facilities belonging to the Kataib Hezbollah militia and other groups were ""in direct response to a series of escalatory attacks"" against US and other international forces in Iraq and Syria.
Major General Yehia Rasool, a spokesman for Prime Minister Sudani, said in a statement that the US action was ""contributing to a reckless escalation"".
""This unacceptable act undermines years of co-operation... at a time when the region is already grappling with the danger of expanding conflict, the repercussions of the aggression on Gaza,"" he added, referring to the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas.
He added that Iraq would treat the US operations ""as acts of aggression"" against its people on their land, and urged the international community to help restore peace.
Writing on X, formerly Twitter, Iraq national security adviser Qassem al-Aaraji said the US action would ""not help bring calm"".
He added that ""the US should pile on pressure for a halt to the Israeli offensive in Gaza rather than targeting and bombing the bases of an Iraqi national body"".
Last week, four US military personnel were injured in a ballistic missile and rocket attack on Iraq's Al Asad air base, in Anbar province.
The Pentagon said on Tuesday that they had returned to duty and that there was no significant damage to facilities.
The US military's Central Command (Centcom) said an Iran-backed militia targeted the air base, which hosts American troops.
The Islamic Resistance in Iraq claimed it was behind that attack.
The umbrella group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated militias operating in Iraq. It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks.
Mr Austin said: ""We do not seek to escalate conflict in the region. We are fully prepared to take further measures to protect our people and our facilities.""
""We call on these groups and their Iranian sponsors to immediately cease these attacks.""
In a separate statement, Centcom said the strikes were carried out at 00:15 local time on Wednesday (21:15 GMT Tuesday).
""These strikes targeted [Kataib Hezbollah] headquarters, storage, and training locations for rocket, missile, and one-way attack UAV capabilities,"" it added, without mentioning their locations.
Kataib Hezbollah, or Brigades of the Party of God, is a powerful Iraqi Shia militia that receives financial and military support from Iran.
It is believed to have strong links with Iran's Quds Force, the overseas operations arm of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps.
Since 2009, the US has designated the group as a terrorist organisation, accusing it of attacking US and Iraqi forces in Iraq on behalf of Iran, and of threatening Iraq's stability.
Saturday's attack on Al Asad air base followed a US drone strike in Baghdad earlier this month in which a high-ranking PMF commander was killed.
US troops in Iraq and Syria have been attacked dozens of times by Iran-aligned fighters since the war in Gaza started in October.
The US and UK have also carried out strikes on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement in response to its missile and drone attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
Meanwhile, Iran has carried out a number of missile strikes over the last week against targets in Syria, Iraq and Pakistan, which it claimed were linked to the Islamic State group, Israel and a Baloch separatist group respectively.
Last Saturday, Iran accused Israel of carrying out an air strike in the Syrian capital, Damascus, which killed five senior members of Iran's security forces.

HES2Z4NW7S_VO4MO2SV69FA98F,Khan Younis: Israel says forces have encircled Gaza's second city,By David Gritten,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68074566,"The Israeli military says its ground forces have encircled Khan Younis, the southern Gaza Strip's largest city.
Troops have also reportedly advanced deeper into remaining parts of the city, where they believe Hamas leaders are hiding in tunnels with hostages.
Residents said tanks had shut the last road out of the city to the Mediterranean coast, effectively stopping them from fleeing southwards.
There was also intense fighting around the city's two main hospitals.
It came as funerals took place for some of the 24 Israeli soldiers killed on Monday on the deadliest day for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) since the start of its ground offensive in Gaza 12 weeks ago.
At least 195 Palestinians were also killed in Gaza over the previous 24 hours, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
The ministry says more than 25,400 people have been killed - mostly children and women - during the war between Hamas and Israel.
It was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,300 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 250 others taken hostage.
Israeli ground forces expanded their operation into southern Gaza in early December, after largely taking control of Hamas strongholds in the north.
Within days they were said to have reached the ""heart"" of Khan Younis, where hundreds of thousands of people who had fled northern areas were sheltering.
But the troops have since faced fierce resistance from Hamas's Khan Younis Brigade. It is considered to be one of the two strongest in the group, which is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK and other countries.
The Israeli operation has expanded and intensified in recent days, with dozens of people reported killed in air and artillery strikes on Monday alone as tanks pushed into the west and centre of the city.
On Tuesday, the IDF put out a statement saying that over the past day its troops had ""carried out an extensive operation during which they encircled Khan Yunis and deepened the operation in the area"".
The troops had ""engaged in close-quarters combat, directed [air] strikes, and used intelligence to co-ordinate fire, resulting in the elimination of dozens of terrorists"", it added.
The IDF also ordered residents of western Khan Younis to move immediately to the al-Mawasi area, on the Mediterranean coast, for their own safety.
However, some witnesses said tanks had blocked the road leading there, preventing them from joining the estimated million people currently sheltering to the south in Rafah, on the border with Egypt.
""I am trying to leave for Rafah but the tanks are now very near to the coast and are firing toward the west,"" Shaban, an electrical engineer with four children, told Reuters news agency.
The World Health Organization meanwhile said it was deeply concerned by reports of attacks on hospitals in Khan Younis.
On Tuesday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said a civilian had been killed by an Israeli drone at the entrance of Al-Amal Hospital, which it runs, and that others had been injured when shells struck its nearby headquarters.
""The situation remains extremely dangerous. Early this morning, there was direct artillery shelling of the Palestine Red Crescent's headquarters on the fourth floor. Israeli drones did not stop firing at people at al-Amal Hospital,"" spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh told the BBC from Ramallah.
""[There is] panic and fear among thousands of displaced people who are taking shelter inside our facilities.""
There was no immediate comment from the IDF, but it has previously accused Hamas fighters of embedding themselves among the civilian population and operating in and around medical facilities.
Ms Farsakh also said ambulances were ""facing significant challenges to reach wounded people and transport them to hospitals"", adding that they were now being told to take critical cases to Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza.
And she warned that Al-Amal and the nearby Nasser Medical Complex - the largest of the 14 hospitals still partly working in Gaza - were ""overwhelmed and overcrowded"".
Dr Haytham Ahmad, who works in Nasser's emergency department, told the BBC that multiple amputations were being performed, and that in some cases, patients were not being given anaesthetic because of a shortage of supplies.
""These cases have severe crush injuries and there is just some skin and muscle still connected. We try to use limited anaesthetic in this situation,"" he said.
A World Health Organization spokesman said Nasser was ""now basically besieged"" and that there was ""no way in and out"" for its 400 patients, as well as the medical staff treating them and displaced civilians.
Gaza's health ministry alleged that Israeli forces had fired ""heavily on the upper floors of the specialised surgery building and the emergency building"" of the hospital.
One video filmed by a Palestinian journalist appeared to show gunfire hitting the hospital's western corner, while in another clip smoke is seen rising from an area to the south.
The IDF told AFP news agency that it was ""not aware of the event"".
Later, UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was ""appalling"" and that the entire population was ""enduring destruction at a scale and speed without parallel in recent history"".
He also once again appealed for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman said it was ""engaging in serious discussions with both sides"" on a potential deal, and a Palestinian official told the BBC that a Hamas delegation had arrived in Cairo on Tuesday morning to ""discuss new proposals"" with Egypt's intelligence minister.
Israel has not denied that it has proposed a two-month truce, involving the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners. But there are reports that has already been rejected by Hamas, which demands a permanent ceasefire.

HGBBGWEKU3_DHCGTDAAQU39ZAB,Bola Tinubu denies planning to move Nigeria's capital from Abuja to Lagos,By Mansur Abubakar,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68092177,"Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has no plans to move the country's capital from Abuja to Lagos, his office says.
The presidency blamed political opponents for such rumours, saying ""there is no iota of truth"" in them.
The speculation began before Mr Tinubu, who once served as governor of Lagos, took power last May.
It reached fever pitch this week after it was announced that the airports agency and a central bank department were moving to Lagos.
Abuja replaced Lagos as Nigeria's capital in 1991. It was a purpose-built, planned city - its location chosen because it is in the centre of the country, while Lagos is on the south-west coast.
Lagos, the capital during British colonial rule, remains the country's economic hub and biggest city.
The presidency said it had decided to issue a statement to scotch the rumours about relocating the capital as ""mischief-makers"" seemed bent on ""fuelling needless ethnic mistrust"".
""The people pushing the relocation narrative are playing dangerous politics, to pit the north against the south,"" said Bayo Onanuga, a presidential adviser who issued the statement.
Nigeria is split between the mainly Muslim north and largely Christian south - though Africa's most-populous nation has more than 250 ethnic groups speaking more 500 distinct languages.
There are three main groups: Hausa in the north, Yoruba in the west and Igbo in the east.
In recent years some figures from the south-west region surrounding Lagos have been calling for a separate Yoruba nation - though it is not regarded as a serious threat.
Because Mr Tinubu is from the Yoruba community, some fear that he would like to move the capital as part of a plan to favour the south-west over the rest of the country.
But this was denied by his adviser.
""President Tinubu-led administration is working tirelessly to be just and equitable to every section of the country,"" Mr Onanuga said.
The relocation of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (Faan) and the Central Bank of Nigeria's banking supervision department to Lagos was purely administrative, he added.

HS4OXD9R9Q_URYE7H1B0X8YBWZ,North Sea oil and gas claims fact-checked,By Mark Poynting,5 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67945281,"The government has been defending a plan that could see new licences granted every year for fossil fuel drilling in the North Sea.
In a debate in the House of Commons, it claimed it would be cleaner than importing oil and gas from overseas and would help the UK's energy security. Critics say it would damage the UK's reputation on climate action.
We've examined some of the claims.
Energy Secretary Claire Coutinho told MPs: ""Gas that we bring in from abroad through LNG has four times higher emissions.""
Liquified natural gas (LNG) is gas that is compressed into liquid form and shipped in, rather than pumped through pipelines.
She is right to say emissions from UK gas production are indeed roughly four times lower than imported LNG, according to figures cited by the North Sea Transition Authority, the UK's oil and gas regulator.
But most of the UK's gas imports are typically not LNG, rather they are pumped in via pipelines from Norway, according to government data.
And Norway's gas is on average much cleaner than the UK's.
These figures only relate to what's known as the ""production phase"" - just the greenhouse gases emitted from getting oil and gas out of the ground.
Total emissions from oil and gas come mainly from using these fossil fuels.
Claire Coutinho also told MPs: ""Our bill will improve our energy security.""
While the UK is heavily reliant on oil and gas imports, there's no guarantee that extra domestic production would stay in the UK, especially when it comes to oil.
This is because it is extracted by private companies, who sell it on the open international market, rather than necessarily to the UK.
For this reason - and because some oil can't be refined in the UK - around 80% of the oil produced in the North Sea is actually exported.
Most of UK North Sea gas is pumped directly into the UK network, but some is then exported to Europe, for example to be stored for winter, according to Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of analysis at the ECIU, an independent energy and climate think tank.
Amanda Solloway, a minister in the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, confirmed in December that there were no plans to force private companies to allocate oil and gas in the North Sea for domestic use.
Shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said: ""the legislation we are considering today won't cut bills"".
He is right. Oil and gas prices in the UK are determined by global energy prices.
""No amount of UK North Sea oil and gas will turn the dial on international prices, because our volumes are so small, and because everything is run through markets,"" Dr Cran-McGreehin says.
Defending the plan on BBC Breakfast on 6 November 2023, Claire Coutinho admitted: ""It wouldn't necessarily bring energy bills down"".
But she claimed it would raise a significant amount of money in tax revenue to help fund public services.
The government's independent climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), argue that the best way to reduce the reliance on imports and lower bills is to boost renewables and other low carbon technologies to reduce the demand for fossil fuels in the first place.
Over the past decade, the government has made progress in boosting UK's renewable electricity generation - from 7% of the total in 2010 to over 40% last year.
Claire Coutinho also said: ""Even the Climate Change Committee's own data shows that when we reach net zero in 2050, we'll still be using oil and gas.""
It is true that the UK will still use some oil (mainly for aviation) and gas (mainly for electricity and fuel supply) in 2050, as the chart below from the CCC confirms.
This is the date by which the UK has pledged to reach net zero - the point where the UK no longer adds to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, by removing as much as it emits.
But UK demand for oil and gas needs to fall 80% by 2050 for the UK to meet its targets, the CCC says.
In particular, it says there will be much less need for oil - which makes up most of the remaining North Sea reserves - as cars, trains and buses switch away from petrol and diesel.
For this reason, the CCC has distanced itself from the idea that it backs new UK oil and gas.
Prof Piers Forster, the interim chair of the CCC, tweeted in response to the proposed legislation that further oil and gas licensing was ""inconsistent with climate goals"".
This is because countries agreed to transition away from fossil fuels at the last year's COP28 climate summit. Some fossil fuels need to be kept in the ground to have a chance of limiting warming to globally agreed levels, says Rebecca Willis, a professor of energy and climate governance at Lancaster University.
The International Energy Agency has previously said there is no need for investment in new oil and gas projects to meet global energy demand.

IC7DCL4P56_ISQJ48S0XSJU8FB,Fugitive who faked death refuses court appearance,_,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-68072684,"A man extradited from Scotland to America after faking his death to avoid rape charges has refused to appear at his latest court hearing.
Nicholas Rossi spent more than two years fighting the case claiming to be an Irish orphan called Arthur Knight.
Judge Derek Pullan, of Utah's Fourth District Court, was told Rossi would not appear by video link from prison on Monday.
A new date of 6 February has been set for his appearance.
Judge Pullan told the court that if Rossi was not ill then he would ""authorise reasonable force to compel his attendance"".
The 36-year-old previously appeared by video link at the Third District Court in Utah last Tuesday.
He was arrested under an international arrest warrant in December 2021 after being admitted to hospital in Glasgow with Covid.
He claimed to have been the victim of mistaken identity and insisted his name was Arthur Knight.
But in November 2022 a sheriff in Edinburgh ruled that he was Nicholas Rossi after hearing that his tattoos and fingerprints matched.
He lost his final appeal against extradition on 14 December last year.
Prosecutors in Utah said he was charged with raping a 21-year-old woman in 2008.
Rossi was not identified as a suspect until about a decade later due to a backlog of DNA test kits at the state's crime lab.
During the previous hearing, he denied being Nicholas Rossi and said his name was Arthur Knight Brown."
IIL454SDRS_8P91I4QQNO83HGX,'Send back our husbands' - Russian women in rare protest,By Steve Rosenberg,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68056939,"In a function room on the edge of Moscow, something unusual is happening.
A group of women are publicly criticising the Russian authorities. Their husbands are among the 300,000 reservists mobilised by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine in autumn 2022.
And they want them home.
""When will our husbands be considered to have discharged their military duty?"" asks Maria. ""When they're brought back with no arms and legs? When they can't do anything at all because they're just vegetables? Or do we have to wait for them to be sent back in zinc coffins?""
The women met via social media and have formed a group called The Way Home. They have differing views on the war. Some claim to support it. Others are sceptical about the Kremlin's ""special military operation"". What seems to unite them is the belief that the mobilised men have done their fair share of the fighting and should be back home with their families.
It is an opinion the authorities do not share.
In Russia public criticism of anything related to the war comes with a risk. Most of the speakers choose their words very carefully. They know there's a string of laws in place now in Russia for punishing dissent. Their frustration, though, is palpable.
""To begin with we trusted our government,"" Antonina says. ""But should we trust them now? I don't trust anyone.""
Members of the group are here to share their stories with a local councillor, Boris Nadezhdin. He has been critical of the ""special military operation"" from the outset.
Curiously Mr Nadezhdin is one of the few government critics who has been allowed onto national television since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He's an occasional guest on TV talk shows.
Right now, the politician is trying to get on the ballot for the presidential election. He maintains that the war has damaged Vladimir Putin's domestic popularity.
""Putin was very popular in Russia because after the 1990s he brought stability and security,"" Mr Nadezhdin tells me. ""Stability and security were the main reason for supporting Putin. Now more and more people have already understood that stability and security are finished.""
Russian women campaigning for the return of their mobilised husbands, sons or brothers have come in for criticism from different quarters. Opponents of the war have little sympathy. They condemn the men for obeying the mobilisation order and for taking part in the war.
Supporters of the Kremlin portray the women as Western stooges.
In a recent interview with the Fontanka news site, Russian MP Andrei Kartapolov, who heads the Russian Duma's defence committee, claimed that the call for demobilisation was the work of ""[Russia's] enemies"". He appeared to suggest that the Ukrainian military or the CIA was behind it.
Mr Kartapolov also invoked World War Two.
""Can you imagine a delegation of wives coming to the Kremlin in autumn 1942 and telling Stalin: 'Let those men who were called up in 1941 go home. They've been fighting for a year already.' No-one would ever have thought of doing that.""
Maria Andreeva, whose husband and cousin have been drafted and despatched to Ukraine, finds Mr Kartapolov's comments insulting.
""He dares to liken the special military operation to the Second World War,"" Maria tells me. ""Back then Russia's aim was survival. We'd been attacked. There was full mobilisation and martial law. It's the total opposite of what is happening now.""
Maria says that she is not only campaigning to bring back her family members. She wants to prevent more Russians being called up and sent to the front line.
""We do not want a second wave of mobilisation,"" she says. ""We're against civilians being used in a military conflict. And we want all Russian citizens to understand this could affect them, too.
""Some people act like ostriches. They stick their heads in the sand and try not to think about what's happening. I can understand them. It's hard to accept that, in your country, the state doesn't need you to be happy - it just treats you as biological material. But if people want to survive, sooner or later they need to recognise this and say that they don't agree.""
How likely is a ""second wave"" of mobilisation in Russia? Last December President Putin appeared to rule it out - for now. Live on Russian TV the Kremlin leader claimed that in 2023 the Russian authorities had managed to recruit nearly half a million volunteers to fight in Ukraine.
""Why do we need mobilisation? As things stand there is no need,"" the Kremlin leader concluded.
Of course, ""as things stand"" doesn't mean ""never going to happen"". Situations can change.
For example, in March 2022 President Putin declared: ""Conscripted soldiers are not participating and will not participate in the fighting. There will not be an additional call-up of reservists, either. Only professional soldiers are taking part.""
""Partial mobilisation"" was announced six months later.
To raise awareness Maria and other wives of mobilised reservists have started a new tradition. Every Saturday they don white headscarves and travel into the centre of Moscow. Near the Kremlin walls they lay flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Red carnations are placed by the Eternal Flame. It is their form of peaceful protest.
On its Telegram channel The Way Forward explains that these flowers are for honouring ""the lives of loved ones. To honour the memory of those killed in all wars. To honour the memory of our guys.""
The group also believes that flower-laying is a way of saying ""never again"".
But how aware is Russian society? How much interest is there from the public in what the families of mobilised reservists are saying? Antonina says that since her partner was drafted, she hasn't felt much support from those around her. When he received his call-up papers in October 2022, he'd asked friends to keep an eye out for Antonina.
""They invited me to celebrate new year with them a year ago,"" she says. ""But all evening they kept telling me that my husband was a total mug for going there [to Ukraine].""
Antonina claims that, despite being diagnosed with stomach ulcers, her partner was deployed to an assault unit in Ukraine. She says that he telephoned her on 4 December.
""He was crying. He was frightened. It sounded like he was saying goodbye.""
She says he called again on 13 December. That was the last time she heard from him. Antonina says she's since been told that her partner was wounded in action.
""There are some people who want to fight. Who volunteer for it and sign contracts,"" Antonina says. ""Let them fight. But send us back our husbands who don't want to be there. They've done their duty to the motherland. Send them home.
""I used to have enormous respect for Vladimir Putin. Now I'm more neutral. I still find it hard to believe that he knows this kind of thing is happening. But if he really does see us as traitors and outcasts for wanting our husbands back, I don't understand why he'd have this attitude towards citizens who once voted for him.""

IZAXSOZN2J_85O080Z3SMMW8P6,HMS Northumberland returns to Tyne,_,26 January 2024,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87nl0x8xp6o,"HMS Northumberland is returning to the North East
The Royal Navy vessel HMS Northumberland is returning to Tyneside for a  goodwill visit.
The Type 23 frigate was built by Swan Hunter, in Wallsend, in 1992 and is the adopted ship of Northumberland.
It was designed for anti-submarine warfare but is also used for security patrols, escort duties and anti-piracy missions.
Members of the public will be able to visit the ship between 10:00 and 15:00 on Saturday 27 January at Northumbrian Quay, which is accessible from Royal Quays in North Shields.
HMS Northumberland has spent the last year in the North Atlantic, North Sea and Arctic Circle.
One of its missions was to shadow two Russian destroyers, external as they sailed near UK waters.

JBOHZYY71X_47TBLGTH339AU91,Venezuelan opposition denounces 'intimidation' attempts,By Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼ter,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-68081038,"Venezuelan opposition leader MarÃ­a Corina Machado has denounced what she says are attempts by the government to intimidate her and her supporters.
She said two campaign co-ordinators had been ""abducted"" and party offices had been vandalised.
The incidents come just months after the government agreed to a deal laying the groundwork for free and fair elections to be held in 2024.
Ms Machado said Tuesday's incidents violated that deal.
Under the agreement, which was reached in Barbados in October last year, the government of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro committed to allowing international observers to monitor the presidential poll, which is scheduled for a yet-to-be-determined date in the second half of 2024.
The 2018 election, which saw President Maduro win a second term in office, was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.
As part of the Barbados deal, his government also promised to guarantee that all candidates would be able to freely and safely move throughout the country.
In return, the United States, which backed the Barbados talks, eased some of the sanctions it had imposed on Venezuela's oil sector.
However, just three months after the agreement was struck, tension between the opposition and the government is again on the rise.
On Monday, Venezuela's Attorney-General Tarek William Saab, a close ally of President Maduro, announced that 32 people had been arrested for allegedly plotting to assassinate the president and Venezuela's defence minister, Vladimir Padrino.
Mr Saab also said that arrest warrants had been issued for another 14 suspects, among them human rights activist Tamara SujÃº and journalist Sebastiana BarrÃ¡ez, who both live outside of Venezuela and have been highly critical of the government.
Tension also seems to be on the rise again with the United States, with Mr Padrino claiming that the alleged plot to kill him and the president had the backing of the CIA and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
The US state department said on Tuesday it was ""deeply concerned"" by Monday's arrests.
""Actions that run counter to the spirit and the letter of the Barbados Agreement will have consequences,"" state department spokesman Matthew Miller warned.
Meanwhile, rival groups of supporters took to the streets of the capital Caracas on Tuesday.
President Maduro appeared to goad his followers when he told them, invoking independence hero Simon BolÃ­var: ""If the fascists ever hurt me (...), I leave it to you to do what you have to do to restore justice and peace in Venezuela. Activate the Bolivarian fury!""
Graffiti appeared later on the pavement in front of MarÃ­a Corina Machado's campaign headquarters reading ""Bolivarian fury"".
The whereabouts of two of her campaign co-ordinators are unknown after video showed men seizing them and taking them away in unmarked cars.
Ms Machado asked for help from the international community, telling them that ""we must put a stop to this madness because this is what the Bolivarian fury means: aggression, disappearances, persecution"".
The 56-year-old politician overwhelmingly won an opposition primary held in October despite being banned from running for office.
She has appealed against the ban, which she has always maintained was unfair and designed to keep the opposition down.
Mr Maduro has not yet announced whether he will stand for re-election or if his party will put forward a different candidate.

JFZ0JNMNFV_VPPIZIGOVIWSCRO,Ayodhya Ram Mandir: India PM Modi inaugurates Hindu temple on razed Babri mosque site,By Geeta Pandey and Yogita Limaye,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68003095,"This video can not be played
Indian PM Modi inaugurates Ram temple in Ayodhya
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated a grand temple to Hindu god Ram in the flashpoint city of Ayodhya.
He said it heralded ""a new era"" for India - the temple replaces a 16th-Century mosque torn down by Hindu mobs in 1992, sparking riots in which nearly 2,000 people died.
Top film stars and cricketers were among guests at the event in Ayodhya.
But some Hindu seers and most of the opposition boycotted it, saying Mr Modi was using it for political gain.
General elections are due in India in the next few months and Mr Modi's political rivals say the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be seeking votes in the temple's name in a country where 80% of the population is Hindu.
Critics have also accused the government of exploiting a religious celebration in a country which - according to its constitution - is secular. For Muslims, India's biggest minority, the event evoked fear and painful memories, members of the community in Ayodhya told the BBC in the run-up to Monday's ceremony.
Televised live, it showed Mr Modi performing religious rituals inside the temple's sanctum along with priests and Mohan Bhagwat, head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) - the ideological fountainhead of Hindu nationalist parties.
""Today's date will go down in history,"" Mr Modi said after the event. ""After years of struggle and countless sacrifices, Lord Ram has arrived [home]. I want to congratulate every citizen of the country on this historic occasion.""
The temple has been constructed at a cost of $217m (Â£170m), funded from private donations. Only the ground floor was opened - the rest is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The construction work is part of a revamp for the city, estimated to cost more than $3bn.
The building of the Ram temple in Ayodhya fulfils a decades-long Hindu nationalist pledge. Many Hindus believe the Babri mosque was built by Muslim invaders on the ruins of a temple where the Hindu god was born.
The movement to build the temple helped propel the BJP into political prominence in the 1990s.
There was a festive atmosphere as tens of thousands of chanting Hindu devotees waved flags and beat drums - military helicopters showered flower petals on the temple. Saffron flags with pictures of Lord Ram line streets in the city festooned with marigolds, as do banners with the faces of Mr Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.
Some of India's biggest celebrities, including Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan and cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, attended.
In many other northern cities Hindus lit lamps, and saffron flags carrying images of Ram are fluttering on rooftops, including in several parts of Delhi. Cinemas screened the event, and big screens relayed pictures from Ayodhya to town squares and residential neighbourhoods.
The ceremony, called Pran Pratishtha, which loosely translates from Sanskrit into ""establishment of life force"", lasted about an hour. Hindus believe that chanting mantras and performing rituals around a fire will infuse sacred life in an idol or a photograph of a deity.
Several domestic TV stations built huge sets by the side of the river Saryu, a tributary of the Ganges, just behind the temple, and provided wall-to-wall coverage of the event, some proclaiming the moment of consecration as the start of ""Ram Rajya"" (Lord Ram's rule) in India.
Hindus celebrated the inauguration in other countries too. Massive billboards of Lord Ram graced Times Square in New York, where a group of devotees braved the freezing weather to gather in the middle of the night.
Temples all across the United Kingdom - where Indians are one of the largest diaspora groups - marked the event. Colourful posters had been shared inviting devotees to honour the occasion and celebrations involved flowers, sweets and music. There were also some celebrations in Muslim-majority Dubai - where Indians are a significant population - but from Indian news reports these appeared more muted than elsewhere.
In 2019, the Supreme Court gave the disputed land to Hindus after a protracted legal battle followed the mosque's demolition. Muslims were given a plot outside the city for a mosque but have yet to build one.
One member of the community the BBC spoke to in Ayodhya ahead of Monday's inauguration agreed that Hindus have the right to build the temple after the Supreme Court gave them the site.
""We did not accept that decision happily, but what can we do,"" he said. Another man said he was happy Hindus are building the temple - ""but we are also sad because it was built after destroying a mosque"".
The new three-storey temple - made with pink sandstone and anchored by black granite - stretches across 7.2 acres in a 70-acre complex. A 51-inch (4.25-ft) statue of the deity, specially commissioned for the temple, was unveiled last week. The idol has been placed on a marble pedestal in the sanctum sanctorum.
Thousands of police were deployed for Monday's event, despite Mr Modi having appealed to pilgrims not to turn up and to watch the ceremony on television. In many states a full or half day holiday was called, with schools and colleges closed and stock markets shut.
But a sour note was struck with some top religious seers saying that as the temple was not yet complete, it was against Hinduism to perform the rituals there, and many opposition leaders deciding to stay away.
Some opposition-ruled states also announced their own plans for the day - West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she would pray at the iconic temple to goddess Kali in Kolkata and then lead an all-faith rally. The eastern state of Odisha (Orissa) unveiled huge plans to bring pilgrims to the Jagannath temple in Puri, one of the holiest sites for Hindus.
Authorities say they expect more than 150,000 visitors per day once the temple in Ayodhya is fully ready.
To accommodate this expected rush, new hotels are being built and existing ones spruced up as part of a major makeover and in recent weeks, a new airport and railway station have opened.
Officials say they are building a ""world-class city where people come as pilgrims and tourists"", but many local people have told the BBC that their homes, shops and ""structures of religious nature"" have been either completely or partially demolished to expand roads and set up other facilities.

JIL6ME7CXJ_W216P9BPY6YYCBS,Thatchers lose trademark fight with Aldi over rival cider drinks,By Bea Swallow & PA Media,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-somerset-68086529,"Thatchers brewery has lost a High Court trademark battle against Aldi over rival cider products.
The Somerset-based brewer sued the supermarket chain over claims Aldi had ""copycatted"" its Cloudy Lemon Cider ""in both taste and appearance"".
Following a blind taste test, Judge Melissa Clarke ruled on Wednesday there was a ""low degree of similarity"".
An Aldi spokesperson said: ""There's nothing cloudy about this judgement. It's clear cut.""
At a trial in London in November, Thatchers accused Aldi of gaining an ""unfair advantage"" in sales by copying the product which the family-run cider business had released in February 2020.
Thatchers claimed Aldi's Taurus drink, released in May 2022, had been ""riding on the coat-tails of the reputation"" of the Thatchers brand, and was ""misleading shoppers to believe that the ciders are the same, or in some way linked.""
Fourth generation cider maker Martin Thatcher said: ""As a Somerset family expertly crafting cider for 120 years, we were compelled to bring this case.
""Aldi clearly recognised the popularity of Thatchers Cloudy Lemon, a premium product that we developed by studying consumer trends and investing in innovation.""
Aldi denied claims it was ""passing off"" its product as one appearing to be from Thatchers.
It accepted use of the Thatchers product as a ""benchmark"", but denied infringement of property rights.
""Aldi exclusive brands are just that: exclusive to Aldi, while leading the market on quality and price,"" a spokesperson said.
Judge Clarke accepted that seeing the Aldi product ""would call to mind"" the Thatchers trademark, but ruled there was ""no likelihood of confusion"" for consumers.
""I found the taste of the two products to be very similar, but I accept they are different,"" she said.
The judge determined that Aldi did not develop its product ""with an intention to take advantage of the goodwill and reputation"" of the Thatchers brand, nor was it ""detrimental"" to the brewer's reputation.
She added the claim that Aldi's sales could only be the result of gaining unfair advantage from Thatchers' reputation ""amounts to little more than supposition"".
""It's clear to us that Aldi was intent on creating a product that rides on the premium position of Thatchers,"" added Mr Thatcher.
""So much so, that in their product development we were the only brand featured as inspiration.
""We are very disappointed that the Judge didn't agree with us, but it won't stop us from continuing to innovate and producing premium ciders.""

JL6NDQRFXF_D4IIQ1BPBYC63BZ,Supreme Court allows agents to cut razor wire at Texas-Mexico border,By Max Matza,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68064246,"The US Supreme Court has ruled that border patrol agents can remove razor wire that has been installed by Texas officials along the US-Mexico border.
The 5-4 ruling on Monday temporarily pauses a lower court's ruling that forced the federal agents to stop cutting wire near Eagle Pass, Texas.
The fencing had been authorised by Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott.
The Biden White House requested that agents be allowed to continue cutting the wire, arguing it harms migrants.
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court's three liberal justices to rule in favour of the White House request.
None of the judges offered an explanation for their votes.
Lawyers for the Biden administration say the wire restricts the ability of border agents to process migrants who have already arrived on US soil.
Mr Abbott's government has also installed buoys along the Rio Grande river, as part of a larger effort to deter illegal migration known as Operation Lone Star.
The Biden administration is challenging the buoys in a separate federal case.
The roughly 30-mile (46-km) razor fence has been criticised by Mexican officials as a violation of international law. Migrants have been known to bypass the wire, swimming and climbing under it, often getting injured in the process.
The Eagle Pass area, where the fencing and buoys are located, has seen about 270,000 migrant detentions this fiscal year.
Operation Lone Star also includes sending migrants in buses to Democratic-run cities.
Last year, Texas sued the federal government after Border Patrol agents cut through portions of the fencing, arguing that they were unable to reach the border they police.
It has been seen as a major escalation in the legal battles over immigration between Joe Biden, a Democrat, and Mr Abbott.
The federal government has failed to prevent unlawful entry into the United States, Texas argues. In their court filing for the razor wire case, they say that areas like Eagle Pass are at the ""epicenter of this crisis"".
Earlier this month, Texas officials seized a park along the border and declared that federal agents were banned from accessing it.
Last week, Texas ignored a demand from the Department of Homeland Security to resume federal access to the park, which is used by agents to patrol the border.
The Department of Homeland Security said two children and one woman drowned in the Rio Grande River this month after Border Patrol agents were ""were physically barred by Texas officials from entering the area"".
The Texas Military Department disputed the statement, and said it had found no evidence of migrants in distress.

JTYHJJTAJP_4IK84M8CYUOLYWH,Cameroon starts world-first malaria mass vaccine rollout,By Paul Njie & Natasha Booty,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68037008,"The world's first routine vaccine programme against malaria has started in Cameroon, in a move projected to save thousands of children's lives across Africa.
The symbolic first jab was given to a baby girl named Daniella at a health facility near YaoundÃ© on Monday.
Every year 600,000 people die of malaria in Africa, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Children under five make up at least 80% of those deaths.
Cameroon is offering the RTS,S vaccine free of charge to all infants up to the age of six months old.
Patients require a total of four doses. Health officials say these will be given at the same time as other routine childhood vaccines to make it easier for parents.
It comes after successful pilot campaigns in Kenya, Ghana and Malawi - where the vaccine caused a 13% drop in deaths of children of eligible age, says Unicef.
The jab is known to be effective in at least 36% of cases, according to US researchers, meaning it could save over one in three lives.
While the rollout is undoubtedly a relief and a life-saver, its relatively low efficacy rate means that it is not a ""silver bullet"", argues Willis Akhwale at End Malaria Council Kenya.
But for medics it is an important additional tool in the fight against malaria alongside mosquito nets and malaria tablets. Using all three together potentially gives children 90% protection from malaria, one UK-led study estimates.
""We have a capacity to considerably reduce the number of cases and deaths from malaria and accelerate the elimination of the disease,"" Cameroonian doctor Shalom Ndoula, who helped to lead the vaccine rollout in his country, told BBC Newsday.
Development of the RTS,S vaccine has taken 30 years of research by the British drug-maker GSK.
The World Health Organization, which approved the vaccine, hailed the launch in Cameroon as a historic moment in the global fight against the mosquito-borne disease.
There was another breakthrough earlier this month, when Cape Verde became the first sub-Saharan African country in 50 years to be officially declared malaria-free by the global health body.
Fears and doubts among some Cameroonians about the safety and efficacy of the doses have raised concerns about vaccine hesitancy.
""When people say we are being used as guinea pigs, that's not particularly true,"" Wilfred Fon Mbacham, who is a Cameroonian king and also a professor of public health biotechnology specialising in malaria, told BBC Newsday.
""We as scientists have to do much more to educate the public on what it is, and the benefits it has, so that we can calm their fears.""
Vaccination official Daniele Ekoto at Monday's launch told the BBC she was reassuring mothers after administering doses to their children, insisting that ""it's a vaccine that's safe, effective and free"".
But for others the benefits are obvious.
""I decided to vaccinate my child to avoid malaria. It's a bad thing and when it affects a child, they can easily die,"" one mother told the BBC at the same vaccination centre in Soa, near YaoundÃ©, where Monday's launch happened.
In 2021, Africa accounted for 95% of malaria cases globally and about 96% of related deaths.
""I have prayed and waited all my life for this vaccine"", Mr Mbacham told the BBC.
The WHO says Cameroon records about six million malaria cases every year, with 4,000 deaths in health facilities - most of them children below five.
Six-month-old children in 42 districts with the greatest rates of morbidity and mortality will receive four doses until the age of two.
Twenty other countries aim to roll out the programme this year, according to the global vaccine alliance, Gavi. Among them are Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone.
There is already a big demand for doses, but only about 18 million are available for allocation before 2025, according to Gavi.
It falls short of what is needed by the countries the vaccine alliance has recommended for approval.
The anticipated rollout of a second jab - R21 - developed by Oxford University, is expected to significantly increase the number of doses available for use.
This is to be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, which aims to make 100 million doses per year, so long as it successfully passes the regulatory approvals following its recommendation for use by the WHO last year.

K54UQABS7C_4JD85EQTCLVX811,J&J strikes US states deal over baby powder claims,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68072951,"Johnson & Johnson (J&J) has said it has reached a tentative deal with more than 40 US states over their investigation of the marketing of its talc-based baby powder and other products.
The healthcare giant said it expected to pay $700m (Â£552m), confirming a figure that had been reported earlier.
The deal would be part of a far bigger settlement the firm has been trying to reach to resolve claims around the safety of the products.
J&J says they were safe for consumers.
But it is facing more than 50,000 cases from people who claim using its talc-based baby powder caused cancer, including some who allege the product contained cancer-causing asbestos.
The company created a subsidiary responsible for the claims in an effort to resolve the lawsuits in bankruptcy court.
Last year, it proposed a nearly $9bn settlement, saying the claims were ""specious"" but it wanted to move on from the issue.
But judges have blocked those plans, ruling that the subsidiary was not in financial distress and could not use the bankruptcy system to resolve the lawsuits.
State officials did not comment on the tentative deal.
Erik Haas, worldwide vice president of litigation for Johnson & Johnson, said the company was continuing to work on a wider resolution.
""The company continues to pursue several paths to achieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc litigation. As was leaked last week, that progress includes an agreement in principle that the company reached with a consortium of 43 state attorneys general to resolve their talc claims,"" he said in a statement.
""We will continue to address the claims of those who do not want to participate in our contemplated consensual bankruptcy resolution through litigation or settlement.""
Johnson & Johnson has won a majority of the talc lawsuits against it and has maintained the products did not contain asbestos and did not cause cancer.
But it has been stuck with some significant losses, including one decision in which 22 women were awarded a judgement of more than $2bn.
Analysts estimate the company will end up spending more than $10bn to resolve the legal battles.
A lawyer representing some of the cases from former customers said earlier this month that the reported resolution of the state matters was ""good news"" for his clients because it cleared out ""distractions"".
""We need... attention focused on getting to a global talc powder settlement in 2024. This helps,"" Ronald Miller said in a statement.
Johnson & Johnson stopped US sales of its talc-based baby powder in 2020, citing ""misinformation"" that had sapped demand for the product, applied to prevent nappy rash and for other cosmetic uses, including dry shampoo. It later announced plans to end sales globally.
Before that decision, the company had sold the baby powder for almost 130 years. It continues to sell a version of the product that contains corn-starch.

K6CPFUHIN7_5VXFDGZLY4LTRW3,"Girl, 10, charged with threatening to shoot and kill classmates",By Bernd Debusmann Jr,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68094694,"A 10-year-old girl is facing criminal charges in South Carolina after allegedly saying she wanted to bring a gun to school and kill fellow students.
Police in Georgetown County, located north of Charleston, later searched the child's home and found weapons secured in a safe.
The child was charged in a juvenile summons with student threats.
A similar incident was reported on the same day, Wednesday, at another school in the same county.
In a statement posted to Facebook, the Georgetown County Sheriff's Office said that the girl will face disciplinary action from the local school district for the incident.
The student is enrolled at Kensington Elementary School, which is located in the county seat of Georgetown. It is unclear if she had access to the weapons found at her home.
In a separate incident reported earlier in the same county earlier on Wednesday, police said that an 11-year-old girl at another elementary school was charged after threatening fellow students.
According to the sheriff's office, the girl reportedly ""said she wanted to shoot up the school after an argument with a fellow student"".
Investigators conducted a search of the child's home but found no weapons. The school continued to operate normally.
The BBC has contacted the Georgetown County School District and the Georgetown County Sheriff's Office for comment.
The South Carolina incidents mark the latest in a series of cases involving children facing charges for allegedly threatening to harm fellow students or school staff.
In another incident in Tahoka, Texas, earlier this week, a 13-year-old girl was reportedly arrested and charged with threatening or exhibiting a firearm. Classes were temporarily halted while the investigation took place.
A 14-year-old was also arrested in Virginia on Wednesday for allegedly making threats against his school on social media.
The teen in James City County near Williamsburg was later charged with making threats of death or injury."
KACXBKV974_IW28LP7GAMA6OEU,New Hampshire primary: Donald Trump and Nikki Haley to go head-to-head,By Francesca Gillett,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68064703,"This video can not be played
Watch: Whatâs at stake for Trump and Haley in New Hampshire?
Donald Trump is facing his last remaining Republican opponent, Nikki Haley, in a primary election in New Hampshire on Tuesday.
The former US president is hoping to deliver a knockout blow to the ex-South Carolina governor's campaign to be the Republican nominee.
Ms Haley hopes New Hampshire's bloc of independent voters will help her pull off an upset victory.
The contest follows Mr Trump's landslide win last week in Iowa.
The eventual Republican nominee will challenge the Democrat nominee, likely President Joe Biden, in November's general election.
A contest between Mr Biden, 81, and Mr Trump, 77, would be a re-run of the 2020 presidential vote.
Democrats are also voting in their primary in New Hampshire on Tuesday, but because of a dispute between national and local party officials, Mr Biden is the first sitting president not to appear on the ballot.
The race for the Republican nomination narrowed to just two on Sunday, after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis came a distant second in Iowa's caucuses and then quit and endorsed Mr Trump.
Mr Trump already held a double-digit lead in many opinion polls taken in New Hampshire before Mr DeSantis' exit. Most surveys suggest a majority of the Florida governor's supporters view Mr Trump as the next best option.

Watch: Voters cast their ballots in New Hampshire primary
A new poll released by Suffolk University and the Boston Globe on Tuesday morning showed Mr Trump 19 points ahead of Ms Haley, 57% to 38%. A second poll from Monmouth University and the Washington Post showed him with an 18 point lead, 52% to 34%.
At a rally in Laconia, New Hampshire, on Monday night Mr Trump said that his campaign has ""to win by big margins"" to ""send a signal that we're not playing games. This country has gone to hell.""
""If you want a losing candidate who puts America last, vote for Nikki Haley,"" he added.
He told the crowd that ""globalists and radical left communists"" were convincing liberals to vote for her in the Republican primary.
""They want to run against her because she's so easy to beat,"" he added.
Most voters in New Hampshire will cast their ballots during the day on Tuesday but in tiny Dixville Notch, a handful of people voted at midnight in a decades-old tradition. All six registered voters in the resort town chose Nikki Haley over Donald Trump.
At a campaign event earlier in the day, Ms Haley, 52, said Mr Trump was preoccupied with the criminal and civil cases he faces. He denies all charges, claiming political persecution.
""When you hear Trump speak,"" she said, ""what's he talking about? Grievances, the past. He's talking about vendettas.
Ms Haley, who was UN ambassador under President Trump, added: ""When you go out on Tuesday, you're going to decide: do you want more of the same, or do you want something new?""
Speaking at a separate event in Salem on Monday night, Ms Haley urged voters to support her, arguing that polls show she has a better chance in a general election against President Biden.
""We have a country to save and we have the opportunity to save her,"" she said.
Anyone in New Hampshire can vote in the primary, and the state is seen as more moderate than deeply conservative Iowa. Mr Trump won the Republican nomination in the state in 2016 and 2020.
The Haley campaign is pinning its hopes for a potential shock win on the 40% of voters in New Hampshire who are registered independent.
The Democratic New Hampshire primary, which is also held on Tuesday, is at the centre of a dispute between state party officials and the national Democratic National Committee.
New Hampshire is usually the first primary in the US election calendar, but the national DNC changed the order to make South Carolina first, arguing that it better reflected the country's diversity.
Local party officials in New Hampshire decided to run the primary anyway, so the DNC said it would not award any delegates, effectively not recognising the results, and Mr Biden would not be on the ballot.
Instead, some of Mr Biden's Democratic allies in New Hampshire are urging voters to write his name on the ballot when they vote.
Polls in the state will begin closing at 1900 EST (0000 GMT), with the last closing an hour later. Preliminary results are expected around this time, although the final tally may take several more hours.

KBFPV7TEZA_OPUT1LHL2WTE3F0,China reveals British national sentenced to jail in 2022 for spying,By Yvette Tan,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-68078586,"A British national was sentenced to five years in jail for spying in 2022, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa) has now revealed.
The defendant - named as Ian J Stones - committed the ""crime of illegally obtaining intelligence for overseas actors"", a Mofa spokesman said.
The spokesman added that he had appealed against the sentencing but the case was upheld last September.
This was only revealed in a Mofa briefing on Friday.
According to an article by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Stones worked in China for four decades with big US firms like General Motors and Pfizer and is believed to be aged around 70.
He set up a Beijing-based investment management consulting firm some 15 years ago, said the WSJ, citing corporate records, online profiles and people who know him.
Mofa spokesman Wang Wenbin said the court had ""tried the case strictly in accordance with the law"", adding that Beijing had ""fully guaranteed the various legitimate rights"" and arranged for British officials to visit him and attend his trial.
Stones' daughter told the WSJ that embassy officials and one family member were permitted to witness one hearing but not the actual trial,  adding that none of them had been permitted to see any of the legal documents related to the case.
She also claimed her father was healthy at the beginning of his detention but had received ""inconsistent medical care and poor nutrition leading to severe and life-threatening injuries"".
Ms Stones said British Embassy staff have been able to visit Stones every four to six weeks to check on him, but that there have been long periods where they received no news and were not permitted any consular visits.
In a statement, Mr Wang added that Stones was accused of ""being bribed into providing intelligence by external forces"" .
""The judicial organs strictly promote the handling of cases in accordance with the law, safeguarding the rights and legitimate interests of both Chinese nationals and foreigners,"" he said.
This latest reveal comes as China increasingly publicises cases of alleged espionage by Western countries.
Beijing has also launched public campaigns to raise awareness of foreign spying and has been calling on people to report any suspicious activity.
Earlier this month, Chinese authorities said they had detained an individual alleged to be spying for Britain's foreign intelligence service, MI6. The BBC was not able to independently verify these claims.
The UK government has a policy of neither confirming nor denying claims relating to intelligence issues.

KBG3ZR8B54_YJ10JRALXRWZYCD,Norman Jewison: Renowned Canadian film director dies at 97,_,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68064514,"Famed Canadian film maker and producer Norman Jewison has died aged 97, his publicist has announced.
The three-time Oscar nominee for best director passed away peacefully at his home on Saturday, Jeff Sanderson said. He provided no further details.
Jewison directed classics such as Moonstruck, In The Heat Of The Night, and Fiddler on the Roof.
A versatile storyteller, he was renowned for tackling issues such as racism and civil rights in his films.
Jewison's films received 46 Academy Award nominations and won 12 Oscars.
In 1999, he received a lifetime achievement award from America's Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences.
Four years later, he was given a similar award in Canada for his contributions to the country's film industry, which included the setting up of the Canadian Film Centre.
""I have tended to show humanity as fallible, sensitive, befuddled, misled but redeemable, rather than mindless, relentlessly violent,"" he wrote in his autobiography in 2004.
""I want people to recognise themselves in the movies I make. I don't enjoy no-brainer action movies.""
During his illustrious career, the Toronto-born film director worked with some of Hollywood's biggest stars including Denzel Washington and Sidney Poitier."
KKCXURF1R4_4N9ZMIKUHBLE3BR,"Britain must train citizen army, military chief warns","By Jonathan Beale, defence correspondent & Doug Faulkner",4 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68086188,"Britain should train a ""citizen army"" ready to fight a war on land in the future, the head of the Army has said.
General Sir Patrick Sanders warned that an increase in reserve forces alone ""would not be enough"".
He highlighted the threat from Russia and pointed to steps being taken by other European nations to put their populations on a ""war footing"".
He also called for more to be done to equip and modernise the UK's armed forces.
In a speech at an armoured vehicle conference, Gen Sir Patrick was not making an argument for conscription - where men of fighting age are required to enlist in the military - but rather laying the foundations for a voluntary call up if war broke out.
He talked about the need for the UK's ""pre-war generation"" to prepare for the possibility of war and said that was a ""whole-of-nation undertaking"".
This is not the first time Gen Sir Patrick has warned of the increasing threat of war and expressed concerns about Britain's lack of readiness.
On Wednesday, the outgoing Chief of the General Staff (CGS) said Russia's war in Ukraine was about much more than seizing territory, saying it was about defeating our system and way of life.
He has already argued to reverse to recent cuts to the size of the Army. It is now a professional force of around 73,000, compared to around 100,000 in 2010.
In his speech he said Britain needed an army designed to expand rapidly.
""Within the next three years, it must be credible to talk of a British Army of 120,000, folding in our reserve and strategic reserve. But this is not enough,"" he said, as he also called for more to be done to modernise and equip the armed forces.
""We will not be immune and as the pre-war generation we must similarly prepare - and that is a whole-of-nation undertaking,"" he said. ""Ukraine brutally illustrates that regular armies start wars; citizen armies win them.
""But we've been here before, and workforce alone does not create capability.""
He highlighted steps being taken in countries like Sweden and Finland - where the threat of Russia looms closer - to put their nations more on a war footing.
Other senior Nato military commanders have also recently been calling on the alliance to ready itself for a potential conflict.
Such warnings make politicians nervous.
In response to Gen Sir Patrick speech the UK prime minister's spokesman said hypothetical scenarios of a future potential conflict were not helpful and ruled out any move towards a conscription model for the Army.
One senior Conservative MP told the BBC he did not think Rishi Sunak had fully appreciated the threat posed by Russia.
The MP said that might be because the prime minister when growing up had not experienced the existential threat posed by the old Soviet Union during the Cold War era.
Gen Sir Patrick said the nation could not afford to make the same mistakes of 1914, when it failed to perceive the escalations that led to World War One.
He said over the last 30 years the Army had halved in size, with a 28% reduction in the last 12 years, but added that despite challenges in recruitment applications to join the Army were at the highest level in six years.
Gen Sir Patrick has been a vocal critic of cuts to troop numbers and military spending and will be replaced as CGS in June by General Sir Roly Walker.
He has not been the only one to criticise cuts, with former CGS General Lord Dannatt saying the UK risked a repeat of the 1930s unless it invested more in its armed forces last week.

KWW2ZIHD84_H48EFHH076CM921,Israel reined in by ICJ rulings on Gaza - but will it obey?,By Paul Adams,2 days ago,20230126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68113223,"This was not a complete victory for South Africa, or the Palestinians.
The ICJ did not order Israel to halt its military campaign - an implied recognition of Israel's right to self defence in the wake of the Hamas attacks on 7 October last year.
But the UN's highest legal body has recognised that the situation in Gaza is catastrophic.
Crucially, it said that situation was ""at serious risk of deteriorating further"" before the court delivers its final verdict on the charge of genocide, a process that could take years.
As a result, it made several demands of Israel, broadly in line with most of the nine ""provisional measures"" demanded by South Africa.
By large majorities the court's 17 judges ruled that Israel should do everything in its power to avoid killing Palestinians, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, creating intolerable living conditions in Gaza, or deliberately preventing Palestinian births.
It also said Israel should do more to ""prevent and punish"" public incitement to genocide, citing examples by Israel's president and defence minister.
And there was a call for ""immediate and effective measures"" to address the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.
Not a call for a ceasefire, then, but a series of demands that, if implemented, would drastically change the nature of Israel's military campaign in Gaza.
Israel vehemently rejects the allegation of genocide, arguing that it is Hamas that's responsible for putting Palestinian civilians in harm's way.
It says Hamas operates inside and underneath Gaza's densely populated towns and refugee camps, making it virtually impossible for Israel to avoid killing civilians.
And it says that it has gone to great lengths to warn civilians to avoid danger.

Watch: ICJ orders Israel to prevent genocidal acts
The belief that Israel has ""the most moral army in the world"" is one almost universally held by the country's Jewish citizens.
But since early October, Israel's actions have resulted in the displacement of around 85% of Gaza's 2.3 million population.
Those who flee the fighting seeking refuge in squalid, overcrowded shelters, with dwindling healthcare and grossly inadequate humanitarian supplies.
It was clear, soon after the court's American president Joan Donoghue began speaking, that the urgency of Gaza's plight was uppermost in the court's mind and that Israel had not succeeded in its bid to have the entire case thrown out.
Judge Donoghue delivered a bleak summary of the suffering being experienced by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. She said the plight of children was ""especially heartbreaking"".
This is not the court's final ruling on genocide - that's likely to take several years.
But the measures called for today are designed to offer the Palestinians of Gaza some measure of protection, while the judges consider South Africa's fundamental charge against Israel.
Israel must now decide how to respond. The ICJ's rulings are binding, but there's no enforcement mechanism. Israel could choose to ignore the judges altogether.
With diplomatic efforts now apparently concentrating on the possibility of a two-month ceasefire, and efforts still being made to improve the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, Israel may argue that it's already taking steps to meet the court's demands.
But even if the situation eases - and there's no sign yet - the fact remains that Israel still stands accused of genocide, a case the ICJ believes is plausible and thus worthy of further detailed consideration.
Israel, a country born out of the ashes of the world's worst example of genocide, must now live under this legal shadow until the court delivers its verdict.

L1XJBRUQT5_BPXY2ZJ1HNPDMJG,"How many countries still have the death penalty, and how many people are executed?",_,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-45835584,"A convicted murderer in the US has become the first person in the country to be executed using nitrogen gas.
A Japanese man has also been sentenced to death by hanging for an arson attack which killed 36 people.
The number of executions is rising globally, despite many countries abolishing the use of capital punishment.
According to the latest figures from Amnesty International, in 2022:
The Amnesty International figures are compiled from official statistics, media reports and information passed on from individuals sentenced to death, and their families and representatives.
The organisation believes that China is the world's leading executioner, killing thousands of people every year. But because China does not release details about its use of the death penalty, it is impossible to provide reliable numbers.
Besides China, Amnesty International recorded 883 executions worldwide in 2022, the highest number of executions since 2017.
However, it is much lower than the figures for 1988, 1989 or 2015, when more than 1,500 people were executed in a single year.
Amnesty International also says at least 2,016 death sentences were imposed in 2022, across 52 countries.
Globally, it believes at least 28,282 people were under sentence of death at the end of 2022.
Many prisoners spend years or even decades on death row before their execution.
Twenty countries executed people in 2022, compared with 18 in 2021.
Apart from China, the countries which executed the most people were Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the US.
Amnesty says it recorded at least three public executions in Iran in 2022.
It says Iran also executed at least five people for offences carried out when they were under 18 years old.
The Amnesty International report highlights 11 countries in the world which persistently execute people every year.
These include China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the US, Vietnam and Yemen.
Amnesty International also believes that North Korea is ""likely to be using the death penalty at a sustained rate"", but cannot independently verify this.
Saudi Arabia's execution figure in 2022 was the highest for 30 years.
Five countries - Bahrain, Comoros, Laos, Niger and South Korea - sentenced people to death in 2022, having not used the death penalty for several years.
Although the number of executions in the US has risen since 2021, it remains well below the 1999 peak.
Amnesty International says there were 325 executions for drug offences worldwide in 2022 including:
In 2023, Singapore executed the first woman for almost 20 years. Saridewi Djaman was convicted of trafficking heroin in 2018.
The death penalty is not used at all in 112 countries, compared with 48 in 1991.
Six countries abolished the death penalty either fully, or partially, in 2022.
Four - Kazakhstan, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone and the Central African Republic - scrapped it completely.
Equatorial Guinea and Zambia said it would only be used for the most serious crimes.
In April 2023, Malaysia's parliament also voted to remove the mandatory death penalty for 11 serious crimes, including murder and terrorism.
Ghana's parliament voted to abolish the death penalty altogether in July 2023.
Saudi Arabia was the only country to list beheading as the method of execution in 2022.
Other methods included hanging, lethal injection and death by shooting.
The US state of Alabama is due to execute a convicted murderer called Kenneth Smith using nitrogen gas.
He will be the first person to be put to death by this method anywhere in the world, according to the US-based Death Penalty Information Center.
Mr Smith's lawyers called the untested method a ""cruel and unusual"" punishment.
Alabama and two other US states approved the use of nitrogen because the drugs which are more commonly used in lethal injections have become more difficult to find.
Drug shortages have contributed to the fall in the use of the death penalty across the US."
L483FDLMZ6_86H6OHRN91526US,European mission approved to detect cosmic ripples,By Jonathan Amos,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68096794,"What will be one of the most ambitious and most expensive space missions ever mounted by Europe has just been given the formal green light.
The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (Lisa) will try to detect ripples in the fabric of space-time generated when gargantuan black holes collide.
These gravitational waves will be sensed by three spacecraft firing lasers at each other over a distance of 2.5 million km (1.5 million miles).
The cost will run into the billions.
Scientists believe that studying gravitational waves will help answer important questions about the workings and history of the Universe.
Officials at the European Space Agency (Esa) forecast a budget of â¬1.75bn (Â£1.5bn; $1.9bn), with additional contributions coming from member states including Germany, France, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The US space agency (Nasa) will be a major partner, too.
While this sum is considerable, it does represent a life-time cost - and the complexity of the mission means it will not launch before 2035 at the earliest.
Esa's director of science, Prof Carole Mundell, likened the cost to each European citizen to that of a cup of coffee, and she hoped they would agree with her that this represented great value for money.
""We're trying to solve some of the big mysteries of physics,"" she told BBC News.
""How do we go beyond Einstein's theory of general relativity (his theory of gravity)? How do we probe the nature of space-time? How do we understand the most violent collisions in the Universe, between supermassive black holes? So, you bring together what is almost science fiction and the science engineering, and we make it a science reality.""
Gravitational waves are a prediction of Einstein's equations.
They are the ripples of energy that spread across the cosmos at the speed of light when masses accelerate.
The waves were first detected in Earth laboratories in 2015. They were produced by the coming together of black holes that were a few times the mass of our Sun.
Going into space with detectors will allow researchers to sense much longer wavelength phenomena.
""It's all about size. With Lisa we're talking about sensing the coming together of black holes that are millions of times the mass of our Sun,"" said Prof Harry Ward from Glasgow University, UK.
Scientists are particularly keen to study these supermassive objects because their creation and evolution seems to be tied inextricably to that of the galaxies that host them, and probing their properties would therefore reveal details about how the great structures we see on the sky took shape through cosmic history.
On Earth, gravitational waves are detected from the perturbations they induce in the path of laser light as it is fired down 4km-long, L-shaped tunnels.
Lisa will use the same principle but fire its beams over a much greater distance, and between three identical spacecraft arranged as an equilateral triangle.
Astonishing measurement precision is needed because although the waves come from colossal sources, their signal is tiny - just fractions of the width of an atom.
Scientists talk about picometres, which are a trillionths of a metre.
""If you scale it up, it's the equivalent to measuring the change in distance to Alpha Centauri to about the thickness of a piece of paper,"" said Dr Ewan Fitzsimons at the UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UK ATC). Alpha Centauri encompasses the closest star system to Earth and is more than four light-years away.
Lisa has already been in development for decades, and has gone through various ups and downs, not least with the participation of the Americans. They've been in and out, but are now fully back on board, and will bring important technologies, including the lasers.
Esa's Science Programme Committee (SPC) selected Lisa as a candidate mission in 2017. Since then the agency's technical staff, with support from European industry and academia, have been studying whether the mission is actually feasible. A positive assessment has now allowed Esa delegations to formally ""adopt"" the project.
The UK Space Agency has given its support although this has the reservation that a business case still needs to be made to His Majesty's Treasury. This will be submitted shortly and a decision is expected before the end of the year, after which Esa will look to place the major industrial contracts across Europe.
Britain is set to provide what are called the optical benches in the spacecraft. These are the mirror systems that corral the laser light beams so their behaviour can be precisely monitored. One of the main data distribution centres will also be hosted in the UK.
Thursday's SPC meeting also adopted the Venus mission concept called Envision."
LDP8R3GTS0_7RUQP2HDN8J2I7Y,"UAE has funded political assassinations in Yemen, BBC finds",By Nawal al-Maghafi,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67945137,"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has funded politically motivated assassinations in Yemen, a BBC investigation has found.
Training provided by American mercenaries - hired by the UAE in 2015 - has then been used by Emiratis to instruct locals, sparking a surge in targeted killings, a whistleblower says.
The findings come as conflict in Yemen has returned to the international spotlight following attacks on ships in the Red Sea.
The UAE government has denied the allegations in our investigation - that it had assassinated those without links to terrorism - saying they were ""false and without merit"".
The killing spree in Yemen - more than 100 assassinations in a three-year period - is just one element of an ongoing bitter internecine conflict pitting several international powers against each other in the Middle East's poorest country.
The deadly atmosphere has discouraged the permanent return of Yemen's internationally recognised government. This, it could be argued, has indirectly helped to embolden the Iran-backed Houthis. Washington has announced that it will now re-designate the group as ""global terrorists"".
I have been reporting on the conflict in my native Yemen since it began in 2014. The fighting led to the government losing control of the country's north to the Houthis - who over the years have become savvier and better equipped.
In 2015, the US and the UK supported a coalition of mostly Arab states led by Saudi Arabia - with the UAE as a key partner - to fight back. The coalition invaded Yemen with the aim of reinstating the exiled Yemeni government and fighting terrorism. The UAE was given charge of security in the south, and became the US's key ally on counter-terrorism in the region - al-Qaeda had long been a presence in the south and was now gaining territory.
American mercenaries: Killing in Yemen
BBC Arabic's Nawal al-Maghafi reveals how the UAE hired mercenaries to conduct targeted assassinations of its political enemies in Yemen, with American mercenaries starting the killings in 2015.
Watch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only) or on BBC Two at 23:15 on Tuesday 23 January (23:45 in Northern Ireland), or on YouTube (outside UK).
Listen to Nawal al-Maghafi's radio documentary on Assignment on the BBC World Service and on BBC Sounds from Thursday 25 January.
But instead of this establishing greater stability, during my frequent reporting trips at that time I witnessed a wave of mysterious targeted killings, in Yemeni government-controlled southern areas, of Yemeni citizens unconnected to terror groups.
Under international law, any killing of civilians without due process would be counted as extra-judicial.
The majority of those assassinated were members of Islah - the Yemeni branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. It is a popular international Sunni Islamist movement which has never been classified by the US as a terror organisation, but is banned in several Arab countries - including the UAE where its political activism and support for elections is seen by the country's royal family as a threat to their rule.
Leaked drone footage of the first assassination mission, first reported by BuzzFeed News in 2018, gave me a starting point from which to investigate these mysterious killings. It was dated December 2015 and was traced to members of a private US security company called Spear Operations Group.
I finally met one of the men behind the operation shown in the footage in a restaurant in London in 2020. Isaac Gilmore, a former US Navy Seal who later became chief operating officer of Spear, was one of several Americans who say they were hired to carry out assassinations in Yemen by the UAE.
He refused to talk about anyone who was on the ""kill list"" provided to Spear by the UAE - other than the target of their first mission: Ansaf Mayo, a Yemeni MP who is the leader of Islah in the southern port city of Aden, the government's temporary capital since 2015.
I confronted Mr Gilmore over the fact that Islah had never been classified as a terrorist organisation by the US authorities.
""Modern conflicts are unfortunately very opaque,"" he said. ""We see this in Yemen - one person's civil leader and cleric, is another person's terrorist leader.""
Mr Gilmore, and another Spear employee in Yemen at the time - Dale Comstock - told me that the mission they conducted ended in 2016. But the assassinations in southern Yemen continued. In fact they became more frequent, according to investigators from the human rights group Reprieve.
They investigated 160 killings carried out in Yemen between 2015 and 2018. They said the majority happened from 2016 and only 23 of the 160 people killed had links to terrorism. All the killings had been carried out using the same tactics that Spear had employed - the detonation of an improvised explosive device (IED) as a distraction, followed by a targeted shooting.
The most recent political assassination in Yemen, according to Yemeni human rights lawyer Huda al-Sarari, happened just last month - of an imam killed in Lahj by the same method.
Mr Gilmore, Mr Comstock, and two other mercenaries from Spear who asked not to be named, said that Spear had been involved in training Emirati officers in the UAE military base in Aden. A journalist who asked to remain anonymous also told us he had seen footage of such training.
The mercenaries would not go into detail about what it had entailed, but a senior Yemeni military officer from Aden, who worked directly with the UAE himself, gave me more details.
As the mercenaries' profile had made them conspicuous in Aden and vulnerable to exposure, their brief had been changed to training Emirati officers, ""who in turn trained local Yemenis to do the targeting"", the Yemeni military officer told me.
Through the course of the investigation, we also spoke to more than a dozen other Yemeni sources who said this had been the case. They included two men who said they had carried out assassinations which were not terror-related, after being trained to do so by Emirati soldiers - and one man who said he had been offered release from a UAE prison in exchange for the assassination of a senior Yemeni political figure, a mission he did not accept.
Getting Yemenis to conduct the assassinations meant it was harder for the killings to be traced back to the UAE.
By 2017, the UAE had helped build a paramilitary force, part of the Emirati-funded Southern Transitional Council (STC), a security organisation that runs a network of armed groups across southern Yemen.
The force operated in southern Yemen independently of the Yemeni government, and would only take orders from the UAE. The fighters were not just trained to fight on active front lines. One particular unit, the elite Counter Terrorism Unit, was trained to conduct assassinations, our whistleblower told us.
The BBC has found that despite the American mercenaries' stated aim to eliminate the jihadist groups al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) in southern Yemen, in fact the UAE has gone on to recruit former al-Qaeda members for this security force.
The whistleblower sent a document with 11 names of former al-Qaeda members now working in the STC, some of whose identities we were able to verify ourselves.
During our investigation we also came across the name Nasser al-Shiba. Once a high-ranking al-Qaeda operative, he was jailed for terrorism but later released. A Yemeni government minister we spoke to told us al-Shiba was a known suspect in the attack on the US warship USS Cole, which killed 17 American sailors in October 2000. Multiple sources told us that he is now the commander of one of the STC military units.
Lawyer Huda al-Sarari has been investigating human rights abuses committed by these UAE-backed forces on the ground. As a result of her work, she would frequently receive death threats. But it was her 18-year-old son Mohsen who paid the ultimate price.
He was shot in the chest in March 2019 while on a trip to a local petrol station, and died a month later. When Huda returned to work after his death, she says she received messages warning her to stop. ""Was one son not enough? Do you want us to kill the other?"" they said.
A subsequent investigation by Aden's public prosecutor found that Mohsen was killed by a member of the UAE-backed Counter Terrorism Unit, but the authorities have never pursued a prosecution.
Members of the prosecutor's office - who we cannot name for safety reasons - told us that the widespread assassinations have created a climate of fear that means even they are too afraid to pursue justice in cases involving forces backed by the UAE.
Reprieve has received a leaked UAE document that shows Spear was still being paid in 2020, though it is not clear in what capacity.
We asked Spear's founder, Abraham Golan, whether his mercenaries had trained Emiratis in assassination techniques, but he didn't respond.
We put the allegations in our investigation to the UAE government.
It said it was untrue that it had targeted individuals with no links to terrorism, and that it supported counter-terrorism operations in Yemen at the invitation of the government of Yemen and its international allies.
""The UAE has acted in compliance with applicable international law during these operations,"" it said.
We asked the US Department of Defense and the State Department to talk to us about Spear Operations Group, but they declined. And the US government's intelligence agency said in a statement: ""The idea that the CIA signed off on such an operation is false.""

LMJQEJLN6X_NNL9NMUNTYCVOCT,Bailiff referrals rise by 20% over council debts,By Mark Lobel and Phil Marzouk,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68054306,"Referrals to bailiffs in England and Wales to recover unpaid council debts have risen by nearly 20%, a BBC investigation has found.
Birmingham's 500% rise in referrals between 2022 and 2023 topped the list of 280 councils that replied to a File on 4 Freedom of Information request.
Figures suggest there is Â£500m of uncollected public debt each year, adding to councils' strained finances.
One bailiff said he was incentivised to use underhand tactics.
This is despite industry claims that it has cleaned up its act.
The BBC's Freedom of Information (FOI) request asked councils for the number of referrals made between April and October 2023, compared with the same period the previous year.
Recently ""bankrupt"" Birmingham made 43,283 referrals over the seven-month period in 2023.
That was nearly six times the equivalent figure for the same period in 2022 of 7,875 (adjusted for comparison).
The responses from all the councils who came back to us suggest more people are struggling to pay essential living expenses, such as council tax, during the cost of living crisis.
The debts also include parking fines, non-payment of business rates and housing arrears.
The amounts are made worse because once a bailiff is involved fees mount up. But with many councils across England and Wales in financial dire straits every penny is needed to maintain essential services.
For Paul Crichton, the debt spiral was devastating. He could not pay his council tax and considered taking his own life, following the pressure he felt from debt collectors sent by Stockport Council.
The former Army medic told the BBC he fled his house to avoid bailiffs. ""They were so antagonistic that I would get up out of the house and basically stay out during normal working hours. My strategy was to stay out of their way,"" he told File on 4.
Stockport Council said it only takes enforcement action as a ""very last resort"".
However, Joe Cox, senior policy officer for charity Debt Justice, believes the way public sector debt collection is structured is problematic.
""The collection process pushes people further into debt, which means that it's harder for them to get back on their feet and it's harder for them to repay the original debt and reset their lives.""
Enforcement companies are not paid by councils and only make money if a debt is successfully recovered by the bailiff or ""enforcement agent"".
Bailiffs Behaving Badly
Councils are increasingly using bailiffs to recover debts on behalf of local authorities. Mark Lobel speaks to those working in the industry about their tactics.
Listen on BBC Sounds
But the industry's new regulator said she had reservations about this approach.
""I do have concerns that bailiffs are only paid if they collect,"" Catherine Brown, chair of the Enforcement Conduct Board, told the BBC. ""If I could wave a magic wand, I'd take those cases out where people don't act with humanity.""
But whistleblowers within the enforcement industry, including working bailiffs, revealed some colleagues do break the rules, to ensure they collect and get paid, even if debtors are vulnerable.
Kevin, not his real name, is one of 1,600 enforcement agents who has worked for one of the largest collectors of council debt.
Five years ago the Ministry of Justice planned to make the use of body cameras for bailiffs compulsory. There is still no legislation but the industry has adopted them as standard.
However, Kevin told the BBC: ""They were encouraging me to let the debtor ask me to turn the camera off, so that something untoward could possibly happen or an enforcement agent could possibly break the rules and say something they shouldn't say.""
He explained that certain goods are protected but without camera footage agents would ""say that they could take it"".
He added agents would also ""aggravate the debtor"" potentially leading to a physical assault and an arrest, ""so they could carry on removing goods"".
Kevin's former employer told the BBC it terminates the employment of any rule breakers.
However, one council in north-west England has chosen to follow a different route, with remarkable results.
The FOI data showed there were 73 bailiff referrals in Chorley from April to October 2023, down 80% compared with the same period in 2022.
""Rather than simply going to enforcement, we look at 'how do we support them?'"" said the council's deputy leader Peter Wilson.
""If we think they're vulnerable we refer them into our social prescribing team which actually works with GPs and other agencies to assist people.""
Mr Wilson explained the approach did not harm the council's finances, despite it initially costing more to run.
""If you get to the root cause early on, we can actually save the taxpayer money in the long term,"" he added.
However, most councils continue to outsource enforcement to the private sector, where it has been handled for around 400 years, although laws were updated in 2014.
But the civil enforcement trade association CIVEA, which represents the industry, said the reforms had been hampered by a series of missed government targets.
""The Ministry of Justice hasn't managed to keep up with the the one-year, two-year and five-year review that it was proposing,"" CIVEA's chief executive Russell Hamblin-Boone said.
However, the Ministry of Justice said it was ""committed to ensuring that all enforcement agents treat people in debt fairly and operate in a responsible and proportionate way"".
Meanwhile, Mr Crichton was able to overcome his situation - his bailiffs had signed the Armed Forces Covenant and his debts were passed back to the council once he was identified as vulnerable.
""I got breathing space while things were put on hold. Then an order was put in place to make sure that this didn't reoccur,"" he said. ""There's definitely better days ahead.""

While many of the images appear to have been removed at the time of publication, one photo of Swift was viewed a reported 47 million times before being taken down.
The name ""Taylor Swift"" is no longer searchable on X, alongside terms such as ""Taylor Swift AI"" and ""Taylor AI"".
Deepfakes use artificial intelligence (AI) to make a video of someone by manipulating their face or body. A study in 2023 found that there has been a 550% rise in the creation of doctored images since 2019, fuelled by the emergence of AI.
There are currently no federal laws against the sharing or creation of deepfake images, though there have been moves at state level to tackle the issue.
In the UK, the sharing of deepfake pornography became illegal as part of its Online Safety Act in 2023.
Democratic Rep Morelle, who last year unveiled the proposed Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act - which would have made it illegal to share deepfake pornography without consent - called for urgent action on the issue.
He said the images and videos ""can cause irrevocable emotional, financial, and reputational harm - and unfortunately, women are disproportionately impacted"".
Pornography consists of the overwhelmingly majority of the deepfakes posted online, with women making up 99% of those targeted in such content, according to the State of Deepfakes report published last year.
""What's happened to Taylor Swift is nothing new,"" Democratic Rep Yvette D Clarke posted on X. She noted that women had been targeted by the technology ""for years"", adding that with ""advancements in AI, creating deepfakes is easier & cheaper"".
Republican Congressman Tom Kean Jr agreed, saying that it is ""clear that AI technology is advancing faster than the necessary guardrails"".
""Whether the victim is Taylor Swift or any young person across our country, we need to establish safeguards to combat this alarming trend,"" he added.
Swift has not spoken publicly about the images, but the Daily Mail reported that her team is ""considering legal action"" against the site which published the AI-generated images.
Worries about AI-generated content have increased as billions of people vote in elections this year across the globe.
This week, a fake robocall claiming to be from US President Joe Biden sparked an investigation. It is thought to have been made by AI.

LXHC2ZKJJT_Y7IF4Q0PANN7L6R,Henry Okello Oryem: Uganda minister says people dying of hunger are 'idiots',By Swaibu Ibrahim & Gloria Aradi,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68090485,"A Ugandan government minister is facing criticism after calling those who have died of hunger in his country ""idiots"".
Many have deemed Henry Okello Oryem's comments tone-deaf.
In 2022, more than 2,200 people died of starvation and related illnesses in north-east Uganda, a report by an official human rights body said.
But Mr Oryem argued that given Uganda's favourable climate and fertile land, people should be able to grow food for themselves.
""It's only an idiot, a real idiot, that can die of hunger in Uganda,"" the state minister for foreign affairs told the NTV Uganda television channel.
""If you work hard, there is land in Uganda. The climate is right in spite [of] climate change. If you make a double effort to make sure that you go out in the morning, you till your land, you plant the seeds, you maintain your plantation, surely, how do you fail then to get food?""
As well as killing many people, the food shortage in the north-east left nearly half-a-million people in ""acute hunger"", said the report by the Uganda Human Rights Commission, which was established by the constitution.
The minister's comments have sparked outrage.
Moses Aleper, a legislator for Chekwii county, which is part of the affected Karamoja region, told the BBC that Mr Oryem's views were ""not right"" and ""unfortunate coming from a minister who knows what goes on in this country"".
""I'm from one of the most productive parts of Karamoja where there is adequate rain and we produce food. But in situations where weather fails us, the weather vagaries set in, we definitely fail to get food. And normally people definitely get famine and eventually hunger strikes.""
Mr Aleper also said that hunger in the region is often caused by ""other issues beyond even human control"", such as the way that the climate is changing.
Prominent Ugandan author and journalist Charles Onyango-Obbo also hit out at Mr Oryem, saying that the minister failed to grasp ""that hunger in a country like Uganda is a distribution/market problem"".
Official data on the current food situation in Karamoja is unavailable, but it often experiences hunger during dry seasons due to the region's semi-arid climatic conditions.

M19HMF19YY_5IZOBV7I4E83X07,Wales gets extra Â£25m from English council funding boost,By David Deans,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-68086282,"Wales is to get an extra Â£25m for public services off the back of a boost for English councils aimed at tackling a cash crisis.
An additional Â£500m announced for social care has triggered more funding for the Welsh government.
Plaid Cymru wants the cash to be given to rural councils seeing the smallest increase in their budgets next year.
The Welsh government said it did not get notice of the funding announcement and was awaiting clarity on the detail.
If ministers choose to put the extra Â£25m into local government, the money would be a tiny addition to the overall Â£5.5bn budget.
Welsh public services get extra money when the UK government boosts funding to services in England, like health and councils, which are run from Cardiff in Wales.
Ministers are not required to spend the money in the same way as the UK government, and can put it into other services.
In the local government settlement, announced last year, Newport council saw the largest budget increase at 4.7%, while Conwy and Gwynedd got the worst at 2%.
The UK government said that it was likely that around Â£25m extra would be provided to the Welsh government, with final amounts to be confirmed later.
The Welsh government said it was not told about the funding announcement and was waiting for the details to become clearer.
""We have protected local government funding in our draft budget, despite the financial challenges we have faced,"" it added.
Plaid Cymru's finance spokesman Peredur Owen Griffiths said the party ""will be pressing for urgent clarity regarding the amount of consequentials for Wales from this new funding"".
""Additional funds could be used to raise the funding floor from 2% to at least 3%, which would significantly benefit many local authorities, particularly those in rural areas. This must be done swiftly before councils approve their budgets at the end of February.""
Anthony Hunt, finance spokesperson for the Welsh Local Government Association and a Labour council leader in Torfaen, said: ""It is vital now that the consequential funding allocation arising as a result of today's announcement is passported in full to Welsh councils to help our hard-hit social care services and to fund our schools.""
Welsh Conservative shadow minister for local government Sam Rowlands said: ""It's imperative that every penny of this funding makes its way to into council budgets and that none of it is pinched by Labour and Plaid Cymru to fund their vanity projects.""

M20N7R5ZZ1_GSA30COVSEN2PP9,Tesla warns of 'notably lower' sales growth in 2024,By Natalie Sherman,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68086212,"Tesla is forecasting a sharp sales slowdown this year, becoming the latest car company to warn of sagging demand.
Elon Musk's electric vehicle (EV) maker said growth would be ""notably lower"" than in 2023, when deliveries rose 38%.
The company's shares fell by almost 6% in extended trade in New York after the announcement.
Mr Musk also warned that Chinese rivals ""will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world"" unless trade barriers are put in place.
Tesla slashed prices repeatedly last year in a bid to keep demand up.
The moves helped the firm sell a record 1.8 million cars in 2023, up nearly 40% from 2022.
But revenue grew at about half that pace, slowing precipitously at the end of the year.
In its quarterly update to investors, Tesla said it was not expecting another big wave of expansion until it launches a new model.
The company has been discussing plans for a compact car that would be less expensive than its current Model Y, which starts around Â£45,000 in the UK.
""Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next-generation vehicle platform,"" it said.
Mr Musk's call for trade barriers in the increasingly competitive market came after China's BYD overtook Tesla as the world's top-selling electric carmaker in the last three months of 2023.
Wednesday's sales slowdown warning also came amid wider signs of weakness in the EV market, after several years of robust growth.
In the UK, sales of electric vehicles rose last year, but failed to make inroads against traditional cars as a portion of overall sales.
In China, the biggest market for such cars, manufacturers have slashed prices as the economy slows, while in Europe, sales of battery electric cars shrank sharply last month, falling nearly 17% compared with December 2022, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association.
In the US, major car companies, including Ford and General Motors, have said they are scaling back production of electric vehicles.
Around 1.1 million battery electric cars sold in the country last year, up nearly 50% over 2022 and more than double 2021, according to the government.
Tesla said in the last three months of 2023, revenue was $25.1bn (Â£19.7bn), up just 3% compared with the same period in 2022. Its profits were lower than many analysts had expected.

M4KTG1ML7P_LDBQ8QNGKG2FFMB,Amazon fined for 'excessive' surveillance of workers,By Sam Gruet,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68067022,"Amazon has been fined â¬32m (Â£27m) in France for ""excessive"" surveillance of its workers, including measures the data watchdog found to be illegal.
The CNIL said Amazon France Logistique, which manages warehouses, recorded data captured by workers' handheld scanners.
It found Amazon tracked activity so precisely that it led to workers having to potentially justify each break.
Amazon said it strongly disagreed with the CNIL's findings and called them ""factually incorrect"".
France's data protection agency investigated Amazon warehouses following complaints by employees as well as media coverage of conditions.
It outlined a number of areas where it found Amazon had breached General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
This included a system with three alerts in place to monitor employee activity, which the CNIL ruled to be illegal.
One alert triggered if an item was scanned too quickly or less than 1.25 seconds after scanning a previous item, increasing the risk of error.
Another signalled breaks of 10 minutes or more, while a third tracked breaks between one and 10 minutes.
The CNIL also questioned why Amazon needed to keep workers' data for 31 days.
Responding to the findings an Amazon spokesperson said: ""We strongly disagree with the CNIL's conclusions which are factually incorrect and we reserve the right to file an appeal.
""Warehouse management systems are industry standard and are necessary for ensuring the safety, quality, and efficiency of operations and to track the storage of inventory and processing of packages on time and in line with customer expectations.""
A similar system for Amazon warehouses in the UK has been highlighted before.
Amazon's Europe policy chief Brian Palmer told a parliamentary select committee in November 2022 that if an employee had three productivity flags on the system they could be fired. The online giant later said they were not ""fully correct"".
The subsequent report published by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee raised concerns about surveillance technology being used to set performance targets and monitor performance.
The report said there was evidence to suggest that Amazon's surveillance practices were ""leading to distrust, micromanagement and, in some cases, disciplinary action against its workers"".
The committee said it had written to Amazon outlining its concern the technology would put ""undue stress on its workforce"".
Amazon declined to comment on its UK warehouses.
The CNIL said Amazon already had access to lots of data to achieve quality and safety in its warehouses, and called the system ""excessively intrusive"". It also noted that tracking employees so closely could lead to them having to justify even a brief interruption of scanning.
Amazon also used data collected by the scanner to plan work in its warehouses, evaluate employees on a weekly basis and train them. The watchdog ruled Amazon did not need access to the smallest details of data collected by the scanners to do so.
The online shopping giant was fined for not properly informing workers and external visitors about surveillance, with the watchdog also found to have had insufficient security on its video surveillance.
Reacting to the ruling, the GMB union which represents Amazon's UK warehouse workers, said the company's staff were facing ""bruising levels of scrutiny and surveillance"".

MPN12R9JI7_VOCWE1QGF8ODRVX,US scientist recommends adding salt to make perfect cup of tea,By James Gregory,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68085304,"The British claim to know a thing or two when it comes to making a good cup of tea.
The beverage is a cultural institution in the UK, where an estimated 100 million cups are drunk every day.
But now a scientist based more than 3,000 miles (5,000km) away in the US claims to have found the secret to a perfect cuppa that many Brits would initially find absolutely absurd - adding salt.
Prof Michelle Francl's research has caused quite the stir in the UK, and has even drawn a diplomatic intervention from the US embassy.
""We want to ensure the good people of the UK that the unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain's national drink is not official United States policy. And never will be,"" the embassy said on X, formerly known as Twitter.
It is not the first time the drink has caused controversy on both sides of the Atlantic.
Back in 1773, demonstrators in Boston, colonial Massachusetts, threw 300 chests full of tea into the harbour in protest at British taxes - a key moment which sparked the American Revolution.
""I certainly did not mean to cause a diplomatic incident,"" Prof Francl, a professor of chemistry at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, tells the BBC.
""My emails have been going crazy today. I did not anticipate waking up this morning to see loads of people talking about salt in their tea.""
So why add salt?
It turns out that it is not a new idea - the ingredient is even mentioned in Eighth Century Chinese manuscripts, which Prof Francl analysed to perfect her recipe.
""What is new is our understanding of it as chemists,"" Prof Francl said.
This video can not be played
Watch: Prof Michelle Francl speaks about controversial salt in tea idea
She explains that salt acts as a blocker to the receptor which makes tea taste bitter, especially when it has been stewed.
By adding a pinch of table salt - an undetectable amount - you will counteract the bitterness of the drink.
""It is not like adding sugar. I think people are afraid they will be able to taste the salt.""
She urges tea-loving Brits to have an open mind before prejudging her research, which she has documented in her new book Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea, published by the Royal Society of Chemistry.
""It is OK to experiment,"" she says. ""I did experiments in my kitchen for this - channel your inner scientist.""
Prof Francl has loved tea ever since her mother made her first brew when she was 10 years old.
Everyone has their own opinion on what makes the perfect cuppa, but Prof Francl recommends using loose leaves instead of tea bags and giving the drink a constant stir so the tea gets a good exposure to the water and milk.
Adding a small squeeze of lemon juice can also remove the ""scum"" that sometimes appears on the surface of the drink, she adds.
Other suggestions she makes include using short, stout mugs to keep the tea hotter, and warming up the mug and milk, with the latter added in only after pouring the tea.
But chief among her advice is to never, ever heat up the water in a microwave: ""It's less healthy and it does not taste as good,"" Prof Francl says.
""You end up getting tea scum forming on the surface, and that scum contains some of the antioxidants and taste compounds.""
While the concept of microwaving tea might sound a bit alien in the UK, it is ""totally common"" in the US.
""Americans have some truly awful tea-making habits,"" Prof Francl says.
""I have had better cups of tea at service stations in Ireland than I have had at fancy restaurants in the US.
""I think it is just that people do not know [how to make a good cuppa]. If you do not drink tea, you do not know you are making a horrible cup of tea for someone and giving them a miserable experience.""
She says she loves coming to the UK, where she knows she will be able to locate a decent brew.
""I know when I land I can get a great cup of tea. It is good to have that common ground,"" she says.
So, what next for British-American tea relations?
The US embassy is not heeding Prof Francl's advice and says it will stick to what it calls the ""proper way"" of making tea - by microwaving it - while the UK Cabinet Office is adamant it can only be made using a kettle.

N73KWHF1MF_B53NXKAAGBLVQVI,GM-owned Cruise admits failures in driverless car accident,By Natalie Sherman,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68101907,"Federal prosecutors are investigating General Motors' driverless car unit over its handling of an accident involving one of its driverless cars.
Cruise acknowledged the probe, as it released findings from its review of the October 2023 incident, in which one of its cars dragged a pedestrian who had been thrown into its path.
California revoked Cruise's permit.
Cruise, which also pulled its cars from the road elsewhere, said its actions in the aftermath fell ""woefully short"".
""We are profoundly remorseful both for the injuries to the pedestrian, as well as for breaching the trust of our regulators, the media, and the public,"" the company said.
The report commissioned by GM and conducted by an outside law firm found the firm did not provide a full picture to regulators in the immediate aftermath of the accident and did not update the press as it learned more.
It ascribed these lapses to ""a failure of leadership within Cruise, inadequate and uncoordinated internal processes, mistakes in judgment, an ""us versus them"" mentality with government officials, and a fundamental misunderstanding of regulatory requirements and expectations"".
The report said it had not found evidence to date that Cruise leadership or personnel intended to deceive or mislead when they briefed regulators on the accident on 3 October 2023.
It said technical issues had prevented a full viewing of its video of the accident, in which the car dragged the pedestrian for about 20 feet. But staff did not verbally provide an account to make up for that lapse, the report noted.
Staff also responded to press inquiries without being aware of the pull over manoeuvre and did not update their accounts.
Cruise, which is majority owned by General Motors, was one of the first companies to get a commercial robotaxi service going, winning approval for regulators to start charging for rides in San Francisco in August despite objections from activists, police and fire officials and others.
At the time, Cruise hailed it as an ""historic milestone"". It had predicted that the business could generate $1bn in annual revenue by next year.
In the weeks after the accident, a slew of leaders at Cruise, including its chief executive, left the company.
It announced plans to cut about 24% of its staff - or roughly 900 jobs -  in December.
Cruise said on Thursday that it was cooperating with authorities, including the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Safety authorities were already known to be investigating.
""We believe that, over time, autonomous vehicles can significantly reduce the number and severity of car collisions which result in more than 40,000 deaths on U.S. roads each year. This is what motivates our work,"" the company said.
""We know our license to operate must be earned and is ultimately granted by regulators and the communities we serve. We are focused on advancing our technology and earning back public trust.""

The 23-year-old was challenged by staff but refused to pay for the items, stuffing them into a car, police say.
The Stanley cup, specifically the Adventure Quencher Travel Tumbler, has gone viral on TikTok.
The #Stanleycup hashtag has had more than seven billion views worldwide, and the craze has led to a number of attempts at law-breaking.
One popular recent video showed a man jumping across a Starbucks counter in an effort to steal a hot pink limited edition of the flask.
Police in the city of Roseville, a suburb of California state capital Sacramento, said officers responded to a theft after staff at a local store spotted a woman wheeling a shopping trolley full of the water bottles to the boot of a car.
""The suspect refused to stop for staff and stuffed her car with the stolen merchandise,"" the police statement said, adding that traffic police stopped the car as it tried to enter a nearby highway.
A search of the vehicle revealed 65 Stanley cups.
The police department had a message of warning for any would-be law-breakers.
""While Stanley Quenchers are all the rage, we strongly advise against turning to crime to fulfill your hydration habits,"" the statement said.
The reusable cups were first invented in 1913 by William Stanley Junior and marketed as ""unbreakable"". They became popular two years ago among eco-friendly, health conscious, often teenage Tiktokers.
Recent limited editions of the quenchers appear to have caused mayhem at some US stores.
TikTok videos showed overnight queuing and a mad dash to buy the cups - retailing at $54.50 (Â£42.99) - at one Target supermarket.

NSDMMN6OQ7_9JV4CT4AY1ZEDIK,Man held for murder over South Africa building fire,By Daniel De Simone,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68074917,"A man has been arrested on suspicion of 77 murders after telling a public inquiry he started last August's deadly fire in a Johannesburg building.
The 29-year-old confessed while giving evidence at the inquiry, police said.
Last year fire gutted the Usindiso building in Marshalltown, where many poor people were living, claiming 77 lives and leaving many injured.
The tragedy highlighted the issue of buildings abandoned or neglected by their owners in South Africa.
A South African Police Service spokesperson said the suspect, who cannot be identified, is expected to appear in court soon.
He is also expected to face charges of arson and 120 counts of attempted murder.
The individual confessed to ""being involved in starting the tragic fire"" while giving evidence during a session of the inquiry, police said.
The Usindiso building was home to hundreds of people, some of the poorest people in South African society.
Such abandoned buildings are often left without basic services such as water and electricity or fire safety measures - and are sometimes ""hijacked"" or taken over by criminals who make demands on residents.
The City of Johannesburg owned the Usindiso building and on Monday, Mayor Kabelo Gwamanda said 188 ""bad"" buildings were being investigated, with 134 of them in the inner city.
The public inquiry into the disaster is taking evidence on the fire and the wider issue of unsafe buildings and is due to report later this year.
Shortly after the fire President Cyril Ramaphosa said it had been a ""wake-up call"" for South Africa and the city of Johannesburg had to get to grips with issues around housing and services in Johannesburg's inner city.
South Africa faces a chronic housing shortage, with an estimated 15,000 people believed to be homeless in Johannesburg.

OKBNPBOO62_E9O3WWFYP6NJSM0,Mongolia: Three dead after liquified natural gas tanker crashes,By Flora Drury,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68079262,"Three firefighters have died after a truck carrying 60 tons of liquefied natural gas crashed and exploded in the Mongolian capital.
Hundreds of firefighters had been sent to battle the blaze following the collision with a car in Ulaanbaatar on Wednesday morning, officials said.
At least 11 people were injured, with the fire spreading to nearby buildings.
One local resident described how he initially thought a plane had crashed.
Erdenebold Sukhbaatar, a 40-year-old lawyer, told Reuters news agency the crash, which took place just after 01:00 local time (17:00 GMT on Tuesday), had felt like an earthquake, but was followed by a bright light.
""It was very strong. And then I've never seen such kind of, like, strong [explosion]. It was like 60, you know, tons, which means 60,000, litres [of gas] you know. It was like huge liquid gas.""
He watched the ensuing fire spread to ""almost three different buildings"", climbing at speed.
One resident told Reuters that by the time they realised their building was alight, their front door had already been engulfed in flames, forcing them to break out of the back door. When they looked back, the fire had reached the top floor of the building.
""It all happened very quickly,"" they said.
Another described how the force of the explosion had not only blown out their windows, but also destroyed their balcony.
According to Sainbuyan Amarsaikhan, Mongolia's deputy prime minister, no casualties had been reported from inside any of the buildings.
However, he revealed the firefighters - named as Barsuren Davaajav, Amgalanbayar Shirneng, and Tuvshintur Erdenedavaa - died in a second explosion, which threw part of the truck ""with a lot of force"", resulting in the ""tragic loss"" of life.
The Mongolian National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) - which said the fire was put out by 04:30 - added that four children were among the injured, including one who was being treated for poisoning.
Questions are now being asked about why a tank carrying such a dangerous load had been allowed to travel into the residential neighbourhood, containing many schools.
""You know, if it happened [in] the daylight time, especially during the rush hours in the morning or in the evening, [it would] be more harmful,"" Erdenebold Sukhbaatar pointed out.
""This shows city planning is really bad,"" Ankhbayar Galbadrakh told AFP news agency. ""All of these trucks - with gas or without gas - should travel outside of the city limit.""

Watch: Trump lashes out at 'imposter' Haley in victory speech
Donald Trump has won the New Hampshire primary, defeating his last remaining rival for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley.
His victory means the race for the nomination is all but over, even if Ms Haley is not yet ready to end her campaign - a fact that clearly irked the former president on what was otherwise an evening of celebration.
""She's doing... a speech like she won,"" he said of his rival, who pledged to stay in the race earlier in the evening. ""She didn't win. She lost.""
A rematch in November's general election with President Joe Biden, the likely Democratic candidate, now looks more certain.
Although Mr Trump's victory in New Hampshire did not match the 20-point margin that was predicted by recent polls, it should be more than enough to maintain the current direction of the race.
He won by a landslide in the first contest in Iowa. And the upcoming states on the Republican primary calendar tilt more heavily in his favour than New Hampshire, suggesting his march towards the nomination will soon become a stampede.
With each passing vote, a truth becomes increasingly clear. As polls for many months have shown, the Republican Party is still Donald Trump's party.
His base's loyalty is unwavering, through dramas both legal and political. His brand of conservative populism is in step with his party's voters, as is his focus on issues like immigration, crime and energy.
That may not deter Ms Haley in the short term, but the reality is that New Hampshire was her best shot to disrupt Mr Trump's steady march toward the Republican presidential nomination.
She spent tens of millions of dollars here and had the endorsement of the state's popular Republican governor, but New Hampshire's independent voters and large proportion of college graduates were not enough to deliver victory.
Ms Haley is now looking ahead to the primary in her home state of South Carolina next month. To get there, however, she will need the campaign contributions to keep flowing.
Even with a better-than-expected finish that is no guarantee, given that her long odds of winning the nomination just got even longer, with huge Trump polling leads in many of the remaining states.
If she does stay afloat, she may not get a particularly warm homecoming. Mr Trump has the endorsement of most of South Carolina's Republican establishment, and he has a commanding lead in the polls. It was a point the former president was quick to point out in his Tuesday night speech.
""We'll head out to South Carolina where I think we're gonna win easily,"" he said in front of a cheering crowd in the city of Nashua.

Watch: Haley congratulates Trump, but says race is not over
A drubbing in her old stomping ground would be an ignominious way to end what has been a relatively successful campaign for Ms Haley. It is a fate she may ultimately choose to avoid, but she has a month to try to turn that around.
Even if Ms Haley does ultimately throw in the towel in the days ahead, the New Hampshire results should cause some concern among Mr Trump's team.
A Fox News voter analysis found 32% of those who participated in the Republican primary would not vote for him in November's general election if he wins the nomination. Only 49% said they would consider themselves a Maga supporter - a reference to the former president's Make America Great Again campaign slogan.
A CBS exit survey also paints a picture of Mr Trump's support base, but it also shows its limitations. Among self-identified ""very conservative voters"", the former president won 88%. He carried 66% of primary voters with no college degree and evangelical Christian voters by a similar margin.
He won only 23% of moderates and 39% of college graduates - groups he will have to appeal to if he wants to beat President Biden.
And after Tuesday night's results, that 2020 presidential rematch seems much more likely, even if that is a prospect polls suggest many Americans do not welcome.

An old mob associate convinced him to carry out the smash-and-grab heist in 2005.
He was caught more than a decade later when an FBI art crime team recovered the slippers in a sting operation.
Martin's defence lawyer Dane DeKrey wrote in the sentencing memo last week that his client had not committed any crimes in nearly ten years after last being released from prison.
But an unidentified former mob associate made contact with him and tempted him to grab the slippers, which were on loan to the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. The late actress played the slippers-wearing Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz.
""At first, Terry declined the invitation to participate in the heist. But old habits die hard, and the thought of a 'final score' kept him up at night,"" Mr DeKrey wrote.
""After much contemplation, Terry had a criminal relapse.""
He added that Martin had never seen the movie and was completely unaware of the cultural significance of the sequin-encrusted heels.
Martin, from the nearby city of Duluth, took a sledgehammer to the museum's emergency exit and lifted the shoes- which were insured at $1m (Â£824,000) - from a plexiglass-encased display pedestal, believing they were bedecked with real gemstones.
He dumped them two days later after trying to sell them and discovering that the ruby accents were actually made of glass, according to his lawyer.
The memo asked the judge to keep him out of prison and sentence him to time served due to his poor health.
Martin is currently in hospice care with a life expectancy of six months, and uses oxygen and a wheelchair, according to his lawyers.
The shoes are among only four authentic pairs that remain from the 1939 film and are often considered among the highest valued props in movie history.
Lead character Dorothy puts them on early in the film, after she lands in the Land of Oz, and uses them to return home to Kansas at the end by clicking her heels three times while repeating ""there's no place like home"".

PKQ0EMTK2K_B0B0Z64DVK3AL9X,Australia: 'Golden visa' scheme for wealthy investors axed,By Hannah Ritchie,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-68052626,"Australia has axed its so-called ""golden visa"", which granted wealthy overseas investors the right to live in the country.
Designed to attract foreign business, it was cut in an immigration overhaul after the government found it was ""delivering poor economic outcomes"".
Critics have long argued that the scheme was being used by ""corrupt officials"" to ""park illicit funds"".
It will be replaced with more skilled-worker visas.
Thousands of significant investor visas (SIV) have been granted through the program since 2012, with 85% of successful applicants coming from China according to government data.
Marketed as a way to drive foreign investment and stoke innovation, candidates had to invest more than A$5m (Â£2.6m;$3.3m) in Australia to be eligible.
After multiple reviews, the government found that the scheme had failed to meet its core objectives. In a policy document from December, it announced that it would scrap it, focusing instead on creating more visas for ""skilled migrants"" capable ""of making outsized contributions to Australia"".
""It has been obvious for years that this visa is not delivering what our country and economy needs,"" Minister for Home Affairs Clare O'Neil said in a statement on Monday.
The move has been welcomed by Clancy Moore, the chief executive of Transparency International Australia, who told the BBC: ""For far too long corrupt officials and kleptocrats have used golden visas as a vehicle to park their illicit funds in Australia and arguably hide their proceeds of crime.""
The program had already come under intense scrutiny for its alleged ""loopholes"" and ""vulnerabilities"". Bill Browder, who is widely credited as being responsible for the creation of the Magnitsky Act - a US law designed to target individuals for abuses committed overseas, has also criticised the scheme.
In 2016, a government inquiry raised concerns that it had the ""potential for money laundering and other nefarious activities"", while in 2022 The Australian newspaper reported that members of Cambodia's Hun Sen regime were among the bad actors who had exploited the system.
The government inquiry also found that the visas were bringing people into Australia with ""less business acumen"" than would have otherwise arrived, while offering tax concessions that were costing the public.
Some asset managers have pushed back on those assessments, arguing that the follow-on investment from SIVs has ended up being significantly more than the A$5m buy in.
Australia now joins the UK, which scrapped a scheme offering fast-track residency to the mega rich in 2022, due to concerns about the inflow of illicit Russian money.
So-called golden visa schemes have also come under scrutiny in Malta, which has been granting speedy citizenship to wealthy non-European Union nationals. In 2022, an investigation discovered the visas being granted after people spent just days in the island nation, while the EU had raised concern over risks of money laundering, tax evasion and corruption.

PPOP66KUB6_TF7M2VFGZJJVZAG,Start-up firms frustrated by HMRC's 'slowness and lack of communication',By Dougal Shaw,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67754099,"The slowness of the UK's tax authority HMRC is holding back entrepreneurs, according to a business group.
Buy Women Built (BWB) says its members have been left frustrated when trying to access tax incentive schemes designed to support start-ups.
The group said trying to contact HMRC was ""very difficult"" and in some cases delays in receiving the tax credits meant firms could not pay bills.
HMRC said ""the overwhelming majority"" of all valid claims were paid on time.
""In recent months the female founders in our community have increasingly experienced issues accessing key government incentives aimed at boosting new businesses and innovation,"" says Sahar Hashemi, co-founder of BWB, a network of some 450 female entrepreneurs.
In particular, she points to R&D (research and development) tax credits and EIS (Enterprise Investment Scheme) tax relief.
R&D tax relief was introduced in 2000 in order to support small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) when they invest in innovation.
EIS was introduced in 1994 and makes start-ups who qualify more attractive to investors. It allows shares to be bought in a more tax-efficient way.
""We would ask that an urgent review take place on the rules around funding, to ensure that all HMRC staff are aware of the legitimacy of these claims,"" says Ms Hashemi, who co-founded High Street chain Coffee Republic and is the former co-chair of the government's Scale Up Taskforce.
She claims the issues with HMRC are hitting female-founded companies particularly hard because they currently receive only 2% of venture capital in the UK.
The number of firms on the brink of collapse jumped by more than a quarter at the end of 2023, according to the latest report from insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor. It found that 47,477 firms were in critical financial distress in the final quarter of 2023.
Its previous report, published in October, found that the number of companies going bust last year was on track to be the highest since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has promised to speed up the UK's economic growth amid flat GDP figures, and boosting entrepreneurship is one way to do this.
Last year a leading accountants' group said that understaffing at HMRC was causing unacceptable delays and hindering economic activity, with one accountant calling the service ""diabolical"".
Start-ups rely on tax incentives to stay afloat, so delays to paperwork and payments can be critical.
""There are frequently significant backlogs at HMRC to review applications, which delays the timing of the payment of the [R&D] credit,"" according to Anna Maxwell, CEO and founder of consumer healthcare company Maxwellia, which is part of the BWB group.
""For some businesses this time lag can impact cashflow, to the extent that they cannot pay their bills. HMRC are very difficult to contact and wait times on calls can be over an hour.""
R&D tax relief is a lifeline for many young companies, says Peter Cowley of Cambridge Angels, who has invested in tech start-ups for more than 15 years.
However, the process has been slow for many years, he argues.
One reason for this is that R&D tax relief has been abused by some companies and HMRC had to tighten up its procedures, he points out.
There are also HMRC delays around claiming the EIS tax relief, according to Joanna Jensen, founder of the Childs Farm skincare brand and strategic adviser to the BWB group.
""I've been waiting eight months for an EIS rebate and have now had to get my MP involved,"" says Ms Jensen.
""HMRC closed its lines over the summer,"" she adds. ""Then when we have been able to speak to anyone, they've said, 'they're looking at it next month.' If it is problematic or slow to make these rebate claims, it makes it a less attractive investment for angel investors.""
HMRC told the BBC that it could not comment on individual cases without knowing the specific details, but said in a statement: ""Public money is at stake and taxpayers rightly expect us to scrutinise claims. We do that thoroughly and fairly, and the overwhelming majority of valid claims are paid on time.""

PS8D57WNHW_CCQ46CPKV7AD841,"Igor Girkin shot down a passenger jet, then insulted Putin. Which one put him in jail?",By Steve Rosenberg,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68091877,"The last time I saw Igor Girkin was five years ago in the stairwell of a Moscow news agency.
""Would you consider giving me an interview?"" I asked. ""No,"" he replied sharply and scurried away.
I saw him again today. No stairwell. This time, Girkin was in a caged dock surrounded by police in the Moscow City Court.
Along with other media we were allowed in to film him for just one minute before the end of his trial.
A police dog kept barking. Girkin found that amusing. The verdict less so. Minutes later he was found guilty on extremism charges and sentenced to four years in a penal colony.
This wasn't his first conviction.
In The Hague in 2022, in absentia, Girkin was found guilty of the murder of 298 people: the passengers and crew of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17.
The Boeing jet had been shot down over eastern Ukraine in 2014 by Russian-controlled forces in the early stages of Russia's war there.
Girkin was one of three men sentenced to life imprisonment. A judgement he ignored.
A year after we'd met in the stairwell, I managed to get through to Girkin on the phone and ask him about the Hague.
""I do not recognise the authority of the Dutch court on this matter,"" he told me.
""I am a military man and I am not going to accept that a civilian court in a foreign country has the authority to convict a person who took part in someone else's civil war, only because their civilians were killed.
""Do you know who shot down [the plane]?""
""The rebels didn't shoot down the Boeing. I have nothing more to say.""
This video can not be played
Russian rebel commander Igor Girkin told the BBC in 2020 he did not recognise the court's authority
""If it wasn't the rebels, then was it Russian soldiers?"" I asked.
""That's it. Goodbye."" He hung up.
Now he is going to prison. But not for mass murder. And not for life.
So, who exactly is Girkin - also known under his pseudonym as Igor Strelkov - and why has a Moscow court sent him to jail?
He is a former FSB officer in Russia's domestic security service. In 2014 he played a key role in the fighting in Ukraine's Donbas region: a conflict engineered and orchestrated by Moscow.
He organised and commanded pro-Russia militias in eastern Ukraine.
The Dutch court would later rule that Russia had been in control of the separatist forces fighting in eastern Ukraine and that Girkin had helped to bring the Buk missile system into Ukraine that was used to shoot down flight MH17.
Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ultranationalist Girkin became a prominent pro-war blogger.
He became increasingly critical of the way the Russian authorities were waging the war: not hard enough, in his view.
He founded a hard line nationalist movement called The Club of Angry Patriots.
His problems began when he started to take that anger out on President Vladimir Putin.
Public criticisms of the Russian president turned to insults. In a post last year, Girkin described Putin as ""a non-entity"" and ""a cowardly waste of space"".
A few days later he was arrested. Now he's been tried and convicted.
Of course, a four-year prison sentence is mild in comparison to other recent punishments delivered by Russian courts.
Last year pro-democracy activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to a quarter of a century behind bars after being convicted of treason, a case he and his supporters insist was politically motivated.
How would the ""Angry Patriots"" react to Girkin's prison term? Would they pour on to the streets in protest?
Not exactly. A few dozen supporters gathered outside the Moscow City Court to chant ""Freedom to Strelkov!"" but there was little hint of optimism in their voices.
""They've put a Russian national patriot on trial,"" Denis tells me. ""I hope our people wake up and fight. Unfortunately, we don't see much pushback. Everyone seems to be hiding away.""
Also in the crowd was retired colonel and outspoken ultranationalist Vladimir Kvachkov.
Having informed me that ""Russia will always be the enemy of the Anglo-Saxon West"" and assured me that the break-up of the United Kingdom was inevitable, Mr Kvachkov claimed that Girkin was being punished for ""fighting against the system.""
In recent years the ""system"" concentrated on clearing the Russian political landscape of pro-democracy, pro-Western critics and challengers.
A prison sentence for Girkin suggests the Russian authorities have now decided to crack down on critics from the opposite end of the spectrum: the so-called ultra-patriots.
Last year's mutiny by Wagner mercenaries led by Yevgeny Prigozhin may be the reason.
The Putin system survived the challenge. But that drama will have alerted the Kremlin to the potential dangers from highly motivated nationalistic and patriotic elements in Russian society.

PUJH53OI73_JAEVA2EVAS3K268,Burns Night: Who was Robert Burns and why do we celebrate his work?,_,22 January 2024,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3g2jr027l8o,"Robert Burns died in 1796, at the age of 37
Burns Night is celebrated every year on 25 January in honour of Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns.
The Ayrshire poet and lyricist died in 1796, at the age of 37, but he is still regarded as the most prominent poet to have written in the Scots dialect.
His most well-known poems include To a Mouse, Address to a Haggis, Tam O'Shanter, A Red, Red Rose and The Selkirk Grace.
Alongside his literary contributions, Burns gained fame for his numerous love affairs and radical political leanings, expressing sympathy for the French and American revolutions.
A traditional Burns supper of haggis, neeps and tatties
Burns Night, or Burns Supper, is traditionally celebrated with a dinner consisting of haggis, neeps, and tatties, external - more commonly known as turnips and potatoes.
On the 21 July 1801, the fifth anniversary of his death, his friends gathered at what is now called Burns Cottage in Alloway, near Ayr, where he was born, to honour his memory.
During this gathering, they read aloud some of his works and poetry. One poem, 'Address to a Haggis,' was recited as they dined on haggis and a sheep's head.
Unbeknown to them, this event marked the beginning of a tradition that has endured for 200 years and continues to be celebrated today.
In the years following, Burns clubs started to emerge across Scotland to celebrate his life.
The Selkirk Grace is often said before tucking into haggis, neeps and tatties
In 1802, the celebration was shifted from the date of Burns' death to his birth date.
However, they initially got the date wrong, meeting four days after his actual birth.
It wasn't until the following year, in 1803, when members of what is known as the 'Mother Club', the Greenock Burns Club, discovered through Ayr parish records that his true birth date was 25 January.
This date has been celebrated with Burns Suppers for more than 200 years.
Burns' birthplace, Burns Cottage, in Alloway, is now a museum
Burns started life in Alloway, South Ayrshire, in 1759, the eldest of seven children born to William Burns and Agnes Broun, from a relatively poor farming family.
He began working in the fields at a young age and by 15, he had become the primary labourer. His farming upbringing is why he is often referred to as the ploughman's poet.
His father, a self-educated man, decided to home-school his children with the help of tutors.
It was during these formative years that Burns made his initial attempts at writing poetry for various friends and in pursuit of women.
As he matured, he had a growing interest in poetry, nature, women, and drinking - rather than farm work - much to his father's dismay.
Statues of Robert Burns can be found all across Scotland and the world
Burns was known to have had many affairs throughout his life.
In 1785, his affair with a servant girl named Elizabeth Paton, resulted in an illegitimate child.
Jean Armour, a woman who became a constant presence in his life, became pregnant the following year.
Burns sought permission to marry her but Jean's father refused.
Annoyed by this, Burns planned to travel to Jamaica with another woman named Mary Campbell, who tragically died shortly after.
She is more commonly known today as Highland Mary.
After Mary's death, Burns still attempted to gather funds to leave for Jamaica.
However, in 1786, he published his first collection titled 'Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect', widely known as the Kilmarnock edition.
These poems garnered rapid success, making him known across Scotland.
He postponed his intended trip to Jamaica.
Burns spent the last years of his life in Dumfries
An Edinburgh edition of Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish dialect brought more fame, money and an entrance into polite society.
He was received as an equal by the city's men of letters and was a guest at aristocratic gatherings.
In 1788, Burns moved to Dumfries, where he leased a farm, external, and married Jean Armour.
But the poet was leading a double life.
He engaged in correspondence and produced poems and songs with individuals who were considered socially superior, all the while working as a tenant farmer and an exciseman.
Plans to turn farm built by Burns into a visitor attraction
His outspoken support for the French revolution nearly cost him his job, as he openly expressed his pro-revolutionary views.
He died in 1796 after his health had rapidly declined.
On the day of his funeral, Jean Armour gave birth to his final son, Maxwell.
He left behind five surviving children out of the 12 born, along with his wife.
When she died 38 years later in 1834, she was buried next to him.
Auld Lang Syne is traditionally sung to bid farewell to the old year
His life is remembered and celebrated worldwide, as his work inspired generations of Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
His musical compositions have become integral to traditions worldwide.
Auld Lang Syne, which Burns based on an older Scottish folk song, is traditionally sung to bid farewell to the old year at the stroke of midnight on Hogmanay (New Year's Eve)/Hogmanay.
Listen on BBC Sounds: Auld Lang Syne on Soul Music
The melody of ""Auld Lang Syne"" is played worldwide at various events, each carrying different cultural significance.

PVWGMMFEIX_Y1ZWYT52PKQXG7F,Airport scanner delay will prolong 100ml liquid ban,By Katy Austin,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68031052,"The UK's biggest airports are set to miss the deadline for installing new advanced security scanners that will end the 100ml limit on liquids.
The government told major airports to have the high-tech equipment in place by 1 June 2024.
But Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester do not expect to have all their scanners ready by then.
Consumer group Which? warned it could cause confusion during the summer holidays.
The group said passengers may expect the hand luggage security rules to have been changed at all UK airports, only to find that is not the case, which could cause delays at security.
When the Department for Transport (DfT) announced the deadline, it said the scanners would both improve security and mean more convenience for people travelling, ending the need for ""tiny toiletries"".
The rules requiring liquid items to be taken through security in containers of 100ml or less and put in a clear plastic bag were introduced in 2006 after a plot to bomb a transatlantic flight was foiled.
Airports were originally told to bring in new scanners by 2022, before the deadline was moved to June this year.
They use CT X-ray technology to provide 3D images. That means two litres of liquid can be taken through, inside bags. Laptops can also be left in bags.
They are already used in some other countries including the US.
Trials in the UK began in 2018, and airports have been gradually putting them in place. Some, including Teesside and London City Airport, have already finished their rollouts.
However, London Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester are all expected to need extra time to finish installing the new equipment across all their lanes.
That means some lanes will still use the current scanners for this year's summer holidays, so people will still need to stick to the 100ml liquid limits.
Aviation commentator Sally Gethin outlined some of the reasons for the delay.
""[The scanners] are very heavy. Sometimes the floors in the actual terminal have to be reinforced. The cost is really high for these particular scanners - it's the latest technology,"" she said, also pointing to supply chain issues and airports having to free up staff for training.
Heathrow has already begun introducing the new equipment in three of its four terminals, but cannot guarantee the rollout will be complete by June.
A source pointed out that Heathrow has 146 security lanes, more than any other UK airport, and the installation process had to be carefully managed to avoid hindering the flow of passengers.
The airport is understood to be working with the government on how passengers can be provided with ""clear messaging"".
Gatwick said it will have made ""significant progress"" in both terminals by June but does not expect to finish installation until early next year ""after the busy summer peak period has concluded"".
Construction work is under way at Manchester and East Midlands airports to expand terminals to accommodate the new equipment.
A spokesperson for Manchester Airports Group said that while ""good progress"" was being made, completion of the programme is not expected until 2025.
The BBC understands the DfT may consider allowing airports extensions to complete installations across their whole premises where it deems it ""appropriate"".
However, if they miss the deadline without permission, penalties are not being ruled out.
Rory Boland, travel editor at Which?, said: ""We're now going to go into a situation where different [UK] airports have different rules, so at some places you will need to get the liquids out in advance, at others you won't.""
He said this could cause confusion and hold-ups at security. ""You only need a couple of passengers to not be prepared to end up having to wait an extra 10, 20, 30 minutes.
""It is disappointing that we're in a situation just months ahead of the peak travel period... and major airports aren't ready.""
Mr Boland said airports' communication with passengers would be very important.
Travel association Abta advised people planning holidays this summer to double check the rules at each end of their journey.
""It's important to remember that even if your departure airport in the UK has changed its rules around liquids when you travel later this year, you'll also need to check the rules that are in place for the airport you'll be returning from as they may be different,"" Abta said.
A DfT spokesperson said: ""The UK has some of the most robust aviation security measures in the world and this cutting-edge technology will enhance security and boost the passenger experience.
""We are in regular contact with airports as they move towards [the] June 2024 deadline for upgrading their screening equipment and processes. For security reasons we don't talk in detail about aviation security measures.""

PZ1XJHD8AY_ITS4B77S3TZNOF6,H&M pulls school uniform advert after being accused of sexualising children,_,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68054060,"H&M has dropped an advert for school uniforms after it was accused of sexualising young children.
The campaign showed a picture of two primary school-aged girls under the slogan: ""Make those heads turn in H&M's Back to School fashion.""
The advert in Australia has now been withdrawn and H&M has apologised.
Mumsnet founder and chief executive Justine Roberts said the advert ""should never have been created in the first place"".
The campaign was criticised by people on social media, with one labelling it ""vile"" and another ""disgusting"".
In a statement, H&M said it had removed the ad, which was only live in Australia.
""We are deeply sorry for the offence this has caused and will look into how we present campaigns going forward.""
Ms Roberts said: ""Mumsnet users have long been concerned about a sexualised culture creeping into the lives of children - which is why we launched our Let Girls Be Girls campaign in 2010.""
The campaign calls on retailers to commit not to sell products which play upon, emphasise or exploit children's sexuality.
Ms Roberts added: ""It's disappointing to see that, 14 years later, retailers are still creating inappropriate adverts that prematurely sexualise young girls.
""While we're pleased that H&M have accepted their mistake and removed the advert, it really should never have been created in the first place.""
Last year, online retailer Temu had an advert banned by the UK's advertising watchdog for sexualising a child.
The ad showed a girl aged between eight and 11 wearing a bikini in a pose that ""was quite adult for a girl of her age"", the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said.
The watchdog also banned four other adverts for showing sexual images and pictures that objectified women.

PZPNR25TUY_MO3E2QIE2WLZXEC,ICJ says Israel must prevent genocide in Gaza,By Raffi Berg and Anna Holligan,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68108260,"This video can not be played
Watch: ICJ orders Israel to prevent genocidal acts
The UN's top court has ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of telling it to halt the war.
The highly anticipated hearing was part of a controversial case brought by South Africa.
South Africa had asked the court to order Israel to stop military action straight away pending a decision on whether Israel has committed genocide.
Israel has vehemently rejected the accusation as ""wholly unfounded"".
Friday's hearing at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) at The Hague was the first time the judges have issued a ruling as part of the case which began two weeks ago. A verdict on the central allegation of genocide is expected to take much longer, possibly years.
Although the court did not call for a halt to Israel's military action, as South Africa had asked it to do, it is being interpreted as a victory for those who support South Africa's case.
The ICJ found it did have jurisdiction on the matter, and decided there was a plausible case under the 1948 Genocide Convention, and that the Palestinian population in Gaza was at real risk of irreparable damage.
""For the implementation of the international rule of law, the [ICJ's] decision is a momentous one,"" said South Africa in a statement. It called Friday's ruling a ""significant milestone in the search for justice for the Palestinian people"".
The Palestinian foreign minister said the ruling showed that ""no state is above the law"", adding it ""should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity"".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not address the ruling directly but said ""Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering. Equally unwavering is our sacred commitment to defend our country.""
He said South Africa's allegation that Israel was committing genocide was ""not only false, it's outrageous, and decent people everywhere should reject it"".
Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant dismissed the ruling, saying Israel ""does not need to be lectured on morality in order to distinguish between terrorists and the civilian population in Gaza"".
A spokesman for Hamas, the Palestinian group whose unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October triggered the war, called the outcome ""important"", saying it contributed to ""isolating Israel"", Reuters news agency reported.
The ICJ ordered Israel to take a series of measures against potentially genocidal acts against Palestinians in Gaza. These include measures not only on the battlefield but also against public incitement to genocide. It also ordered Israel to take ""immediate and effective measures"" to enable the provision of aid to people in Gaza.
The court said Israel must report on its compliance to the court within one month.
Although orders issued by the ICJ are legally binding, it does not have the power to enforce them. Israel is not expected to commit itself to the orders.
More than 26,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza by Israel's bombardment since 7 October, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. Israel launched its offensive after waves of Hamas gunmen burst through the border early that day, killing about 1,300 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.

PZYMN0BCK7_R8OC01CWWTKNXRV,Hermit crabs are 'wearing' our plastic rubbish,By Victoria Gill,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68071695,"Hermit crabs all over the world, which scavenge shells as armour for their bodies, are turning increasingly to plastic waste instead.
The conclusion is based on analysis of photos, taken by wildlife enthusiasts, and published online.
Scientists said they were ""heartbroken"" to see the extent to which the animals were living in our rubbish.
They said two-thirds of hermit crabs species were pictured in ""artificial shells"" - items that humans discarded.
The discovery is published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.
The study used social media and photo-sharing websites, as one of the researchers Marta Szulkin, an urban ecologist from the University of Warsaw, explained: ""We started to notice something completely out of the ordinary.
""Instead of being adorned with a beautiful snail shell, which is what we're used to seeing - they would have a red plastic bottle cap on their back or piece of light bulb.""
She and her colleagues, ZuzannaÂ Jagiello from the University of Warsaw and ÅukaszÂ Dylewski, from Poznan University of Life Sciences, found a total of 386 individuals using artificial shells - mainly plastic caps.
""According to our calculations, 10 out of the 16 species of land hermit crabs in the world use this type of shelter and it's been  observed in all tropical regions of the Earth,"" Prof Szulkin explained.
It isn't yet clear whether these materials are harmful - or perhaps even helpful - for the small, vulnerable crustaceans.
""When I first saw these pictures, I felt it was heart-breaking,"" Prof Szulkin told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science. ""At the same time, I think we really need to understand the fact that we are living in a different era and animals are making use of what is available to them.""
This internet-based ecological study, revealed that this use of artificial shells is a ""global phenomenon"".
""We saw it in two-thirds of all terrestrial hermit crab species,"" said Prof Szulkin. ""That's what we could identify just by using pictures taken by tourists.""
The researchers say the findings open up new questions about how these coastal crustaceans interact with and use plastic. As well as understanding whether it causes them any harm, the scientists want to work out how it might affect their evolution.
This whole group of crabs have adapted to scavenge and use discarded snail shells to protect their fragile bodies. And when those shells are in short supply, the crabs will fight over them.
What we don't know is how much the element of novelty might affect them - and whether the crabs will fight over artificial plastic shells,"" explained Prof Szulkin.
The researcher said that the natural snail shells were in decline, so she suspected it might be becoming easier for the animals to find an artificial alternative. And lighter, plastic 'shells' might even help smaller, weaker crabs to survive because they are easier to carry.
There is certainly a great deal of plastic in the marine environment for the animals to choose from. A recent study that attempted to quantify the scale of plastic pollution estimated that at least 171 trillion pieces of plastic are now floating in our oceans.
That could nearly triple by 2040 if no action is taken, experts have warned.
But there is hope that 2024 could see nations finally sign up to a long-awaited global treaty to end the scourge of plastic.
Mark Miodownik, who is professor of materials and society at University College London told the BBC that there was a lesson for humans in these images. ""Just like the hermit crabs,"" he said, ""we should be reusing plastics much more, instead of discarding it.""

Q3D99EZPQ7_ARY3OIQPUYCDAS0,"Abuja sisters' kidnapping: Nigeria police did not free them, we paid ransom, family says",By Mansur Abubakar,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68058229,"Nigerian police had no role in rescuing four sisters and their cousin from kidnappers, an uncle of the girls has told the BBC.
They were taken from their home in Abuja earlier this month, along with another sister who was later killed.
The uncle said a ransom was paid and the kidnappers dropped the girls in a forest for them to be collected.
On Sunday, police said they had ""successfully rescued the victims"", reuniting them with relatives.
Sheriff Al-Kadriyar, the girls' uncle, said the family went to collect them after a ransom was paid.
""There's nothing like rescue on this matter, we paid ransom - even though I can't disclose how much for security reasons,"" he told BBC Yoruba.
The Nigerian police spokesperson has not responded to a BBC request for comment.
The case has shocked the country, with people donating to a crowdfunding initiative to help raise the money.
In total five sisters were taken hostage in the Abuja suburb of Bwari on 2 January, along with their father Mansoor Al-Kadriyar, who was later released to raise the ransom.
Sheriff Kadriyar clarified that contrary to earlier reports that six Al-Kadriyar sisters had been abducted, one of the girls was in fact their cousin who had been staying with them over the school holidays.
Twenty-one-year-old Nabeeha, a final-year university student, was killed a few days after her father's release as a warning that the ransom of $68,000 (Â£53,000) must be paid.
Nigeria's defence minister had urged the family not to pay the ransom, but the Al-Kadriyars said they had no choice.
A controversial law that criminalises ransom payments was passed in 2022 aimed at tackling the country's spiralling and lucrative kidnapping industry.It carries a jail sentence of at least 15 years for anyone who pays a ransom, however no-one has been arrested, and a former minister is among those who said he had helped organise the payment to the kidnappers of the Al-Kadriyar sisters.
Sheriff Kadriyar, who said he was involved in negotiating with the kidnappers, explained that the money had been handed over to them on Wednesday.
His account backs up two others given by relatives to Nigeria's Daily Trust newspaper.
They all say that the girls were released on Saturday. One of them then called the family in the early evening, giving their location.
""The kidnappers chose the day and the location we were to pick up the girls about four or five days after ransom payment,"" the uncle said.
A group of male relatives then headed to the Kajuru Forest in neighbouring Kaduna state to find them. Along the way they chanced upon an army unit and requested help.
These army officers escorted them to find the girls - afterwards taking them all home by around 23:30 local time (22:30 GMT).
""We are happy and we thank God that the girls were found alive,"" the uncle said.
His brother and nieces were now being treated at a medical facility, he said.
Kidnapping has become rife in Nigeria, with hundreds of people abducted in recent years, largely by criminal gangs who see it as an easy way to make money. It has been particularly bad in the north-west of the country.
There has been an outcry that the insecurity has reached the capital, prompting Abuja's police force to launch a special squad to tackle the kidnapping gangs last week.
The family did not want to discredit the police but wanted to make it clear how they had managed to free the girls, Sheriff Kadriyar said.

State media said the fire started on Wednesday afternoon local time in the city in Jiangxi province.
Footage from state-backed Global Times showed smoke billowing from buildings and people jumping from windows. The video has not been verified by the BBC.
President Xi Jinping has called for an investigation into the blaze.
He also demanded the ""resolute containment"" of similar deadly incidents in the country.
Wednesday's fire comes days after 13 children died when a fire broke out in a school dormitory in the central Henan province. Seven members of staff were later arrested by police.
In November, 26 people died and dozens were sent to hospital after a fire at a coal company office in northern China's Shanxi province.
The month before, an explosion at a barbecue restaurant in north-western China left 31 dead and prompted official pledges of a nationwide campaign to promote workplace safety.
And last April, a hospital fire in Beijing killed 29 people and forced desperate survivors to jump out of windows to escape.

QJ4PNKJZ21_286MJPTD2QIH551,British man acquitted over London-Spain flight bomb hoax,By Sam Hancock,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68099669,"A Spanish court has cleared a British man of public disorder, after he joked to friends about blowing up a flight from London Gatwick to Menorca.
Aditya Verma admitted he told friends in July 2022: ""On my way to blow up the plane. I'm a member of the Taliban.""
But he said he had made the joke in a private Snapchat group and never intended to ""cause public distress"".
A judge in Madrid ruled that ""no explosive... was found that would lead one to believe it was a real threat"".
Mr Verma's trial, held at the National Court in the Spanish capital, took place on Monday - a year-and-a-half after the incident took place.
The message he sent to friends, before boarding the plane, went on to be picked up by UK security services. They then flagged it to Spanish authorities while the easyJet plane was still in the air.
Two Spanish F-18 fighter jets were sent to flank the aircraft. One followed the plane until it landed at Menorca, where the plane was searched.
Mr Verma, who was 18 at the time, was arrested and held in a Spanish police cell for two days. He was later released on bail.
A judge ruled earlier that Mr Verma, of Orpington, Kent, should be cleared of any wrongdoing.
If he had been found guilty, the university student faced a fine of up to â¬22,500 (Â£19,300) and a further â¬95,000 in expenses to cover the cost of the jets being scrambled.
A key question in the case was how the message got out, considering Snapchat is an encrypted app.
One theory, raised in the trial, was that it could have been intercepted via Gatwick's Wi-Fi network. But a spokesperson for the airport told BBC News that its network ""does not have that capability"".
In the judge's resolution, cited by the Europa Press news agency, it was said that the message, ""for unknown reasons, was captured by the security mechanisms of England when the plane was flying over French airspace"".
The message was made ""in a strictly private environment between the accused and his friends with whom he flew, through a private group to which only they have access, so the accused could not even remotely assume... that the joke he played on his friends could be intercepted or detected by the British services, nor by third parties other than his friends who received the message,"" the judgement added.
It was not immediately clear how UK authorities were alerted to the message, with the judge noting ""they were not the subject of evidence in this trial"".
A spokesperson for Snapchat said the social media platform would not ""comment on what's happened in this individual case"".
On its website, in a section titled ""How We Work with Law Enforcement Authorities"", Snapchat says one of its goals is to ""maintain a safe and fun environment where Snapchatters are free to express themselves and stay in touch with their real friends"".
It adds: ""We also work to proactively escalate to law enforcement any content appearing to involve imminent threats to life, such as school shooting threats, bomb threats and missing persons cases, and respond to law enforcement's emergency requests for disclosure of data when law enforcement is handling a case involving an imminent threat to life.
""In the case of emergency disclosure requests from law enforcement, our 24/7 team usually responds within 30 minutes.""

QY7EYC6ZU7_690JL0O766EMBPU,Why has Alabama executed a man using nitrogen gas?,By Mike Wendling,2 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68097008,"A death row inmate has been executed using a novel method. Why have authorities in Alabama used nitrogen gas, and why is it controversial?
Kenneth Eugene Smith was originally scheduled to be put to death with lethal drugs in November 2022.
Prison staff inserted one intravenous line, but two lines were required to administer the lethal injection.
After they struggled for an hour to insert the second IV, the execution was called off.
But Smith - who was convicted of the murder-for-hire of a preacher's wife in 1988 - was eventually executed using nitrogen gas instead.
It's a controversial method that had never been used before by a US state.
And it represents the latest step in the search for a new way to execute convicted criminals - even as the death penalty has become less popular over time.
Around half of US states still have death penalty laws. Execution methods vary, but some states still allow execution by hanging, firing squad or the electric chair.
According to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), a not-for-profit organisation that is critical of how executions are administered, no method has been found to violate the US Constitution's ban on ""cruel and unusual punishments"", although some state courts have outlawed some methods.
In recent decades, however, most states have converged on lethal injection - the administration of intravenous drugs that sedate and kill the convict - as the main execution method.
Texas was the first state to execute a convicted criminal with lethal injection, in 1982.
Last year, 24 people were executed in the US - most of those in Florida and Texas, and all by lethal injection.
The process, however, is not always straightforward. Several months prior to Smith's previous botched execution, Alabama authorities failed to put to death another death row inmate, Alan Miller, also because of difficulties inserting an IV needle. Several other lethal injection executions have also not gone according to plan.
And states have recently had difficulty in obtaining lethal injection drugs. In some cases, drug manufacturers won't sell them, or no longer produce them.
The UK and the European Union banned exports of the chemicals in 2011, and five years later American drugs giant Pfizer, the last open-market source of lethal injection drugs, announced it would no longer sell them to be used in executions.
The result is that states have been scrambling for other ways to execute prisoners.
Texas, for instance, has sourced its deadly chemicals from a secret list of private ""compounding pharmacies"", which mix their own drugs.
Prison officials strapped a mask to Smith's face and administered the pure nitrogen gas.
The gas itself is not poisonous - nitrogen makes up more than three-quarters of the earth's atmosphere.
But in pure concentrated form, breathing in the gas chokes off oxygen to the brain, a process called nitrogen hypoxia.
The use of nitrogen gas in executions has been approved by three states, including Alabama in 2018, and has withstood various legal challenges since.

Watch: How nitrogen became a form of execution in the US
The procedure had critics even before Smith's execution.
""It's an experimental procedure,"" says Dr Jeff Keller, President of the American College of Correctional Physicians. ""Many things can go wrong.""
Deborah Denno, a criminologist at Fordham Law School who specialises in research into death penalty methods, said the procedure ""is supposed to be painless"".
""But I have to emphasise - that's in theory,"" she says.
""These masks don't usually don't fit people,"" she says. ""They're not airtight, air can get in.""
Smith could have started vomiting or survived the attempted execution with brain damage, she says.
Proponents of the method reject criticism and point to examples of nitrogen hypoxia occurring in industrial accidents, with victims apparently becoming unaware of what is happening to them.
One study prepared for Oklahoma lawmakers considering whether to allow nitrogen gas executions cited research that concluded ""without oxygen present, inhalation of only 1Â­2 breaths of pure nitrogen will cause a sudden loss of consciousness"".
Alabama State Attorney General Steve Marshall has called nitrogen gas ""perhaps the most humane method of execution ever devised"".
Some witnesses to Smith's execution, though, said he did not lose consciousness within seconds and that he inhaled the gas for many minutes, thrashing all the while, before finally succumbing.
The flurry of attention over Smith's execution comes as enthusiasm for the death penalty has ebbed across much of the US.
The number of executions is down substantially from a peak of 98 in 1999, according to the DPIC.
Not only are fewer death sentences being carried out, in fewer states - just 10 have executed a prisoner in the last decade - but fewer death penalties are being handed out by courts.
""We've seen a big change in American support for the death penalty,"" says Robin Maher, the DPIC's executive director.
Polling organization Gallup, which has been tracking public attitudes towards the death penalty for nearly a century, says that 53% of Americans favour the death penalty for convicted murders.
That figure is down from a high of 80% which the survey registered 30 years ago.
Ms Maher says a variety of factors resulted in the death penalty becoming less common - not only botched executions, but nearly 200 exonerations of death row inmates, legal changes which prohibit mentally impaired people and juveniles from being put to death, and the increasing reluctance of juries to hand down death sentences.
""I expect that trend will continue,"" she says.

R1BEZMDJ35_5DJ0LOWXAEFK421,"China: At least 20 dead, dozens missing in Yunnan landslide",By Fan Wang & Kelly Ng,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-68065197,"The death toll from a landslide in China's Yunnan province has risen to 20, while 24 people remain missing.
The landslide in Zhaotong occurred at 05:51 local time (21:51 GMT) on Monday, trapping dozens of people.
Rescuers are racing against time and working through sub-zero temperatures to find those still missing, state news agency Xinhua said.
Preliminary investigations show the landslide resulted from a collapse in a steep cliff, it reported.
The collapsed mass measured approximately 100m (328ft) in width, 60m in height, with an average thickness of around 6m, Xinhua said, citing city authorities.
More than 500 people were evacuated from their homes and nearly 1,000 rescue workers dispatched to the site. President Xi Jinping has ordered an ""all-out"" rescue in the area, while Chinese vice-premier Zhang Guoqing reportedly led a group to the site to guide rescue operations.
""Search and rescue efforts persisted through the night,"" firefighter Li Shenglong told state news outlet Xinhua.
One of the villagers told local media that most of the residents were either elderly or children. Another resident told local news outlet Jimu News that the landslide happened while many people were still asleep on Monday morning.
""It was very loud, and there was also a shake, it felt like a big earthquake,"" she said.
Video clips shared on social media showed rescuers walking on piles of rubble against a backdrop of snow-covered mountains. Personal belongings are seen scattered among the collapsed masonry.
The remote, mountainous region in southwest China is prone to landslides. In January 2013, at least 18 people were killed in a landslide in the same county.
Separately, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Wushi county in China's Xinjiang at about 02:00 local time on Tuesday. State broadcaster CCTV said no casualties have been reported, but some homes have been damaged and some areas had their power supplies cut.

R4Q07M4H2X_S53DANNZUNWMQGN,Japan bomber may have been found after 50 years,By James Gregory,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68110356,"For decades, the smiling mugshot of Satoshi Kirishima has featured on wanted posters outside police stations across Japan.
After 49 years on the run, authorities think they may have got their man.
A patient at a hospital near Tokyo has claimed he is Kirishima, a member of a militant group behind several deadly bombings in the 1970s.
Police are waiting for DNA tests on the man, who was admitted under a different name suffering terminal cancer.
Kirishima had belonged to the East Asia Anti-Japan Armed Front - a radical, left-wing organisation believed to be behind several bombings against companies in Japan's capital between 1972 and 1975.
Eight people were killed in one attack committed by the group at the headquarters of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 1974.
Japan's National Police Agency says on its website that Kirishima violated ""criminal regulations to control explosives"", and is wanted for ""serial bombings of companies"".
Kirishima is alleged to have help plant and detonate a homemade bomb that destroyed part of a building in Tokyo's Ginza district in one particular attack on 18 April 1975, according to local media.
After 49 years, Kirishma, who would now be 70, may have finally been located.
He initially used a different name when checking into a hospital in Kamakura City in Kanagawa, south of Tokyo.
But he told hospital officials on Thursday he was actually Kirishima, saying he wanted to use his ""real name"" in his final moments as he only has a few months left to live, according to reports.
Police are now carrying out DNA tests to confirm his identity, describing his possible re-emergence as a bolt out of the blue."
R69E2PVLI9_38A80XZZZ572Y62,China appears to U-turn on 'obsessive' gaming crackdown,By Imran Rahman-Jones,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68068440,"China seems to have backtracked on strict rules to combat what the regulator deemed ""obsessive"" gaming.
The National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) had proposed regulations limiting the amount of money and time people spent playing video games.
However, on Tuesday the draft rules were no longer on the NPPA website.
China is the world's biggest online gaming market, but the industry has had frequent run-ins with the authorities.
The new rules would have limited in-game purchases. Incentives such as daily log-in rewards for gamers would also have come under fire, while the introduction of a pop-up warning players of ""irrational"" behaviour was proposed.
Share prices of Chinese gaming firms - including the world's biggest gaming company Tencent Holdings and its rival NetEase - jumped after the apparent U-turn.
They had plummeted after the rules were first proposed in December, wiping nearly $80bn (Â£63bn) off the value of the two companies.
However, analysts say the sector is still clouded by uncertainty about what the government might do next.
""I think this type of sentiment will probably last for quite some time, unless we get a very drastic turnaround in government rhetoric, or unless we get some super supportive policies,"" said Ivan Su, senior analyst at Morningstar.
""We don't know if it's going to happen in a week, in a couple months, or in a couple of years.""
China's largest crackdown on gamers came in 2021 when children were banned from playing for more than an hour on certain days.
That same year, the government stopped gaming licences from being granted for eight months.
As a result, says Mr Su, ""a lot of Chinese developers have started shifting their development pipeline toward overseas games"".
NetEase and Tencent acquired or invested in companies in the likes of France, Japan and the United States.
It remains to be seen whether the current uncertainty will prompt another wave of overseas expansion.

RCQUKVRSXK_TSEE4ZEVNL4XAHS,New Hampshire primary: Nikki Haley vows to fight on after second loss to Trump,By Holly Honderich,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68077998,"Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley has vowed to press on with her campaign in the wake of a second consecutive loss to Donald Trump.
Ms Haley campaigned across New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday's primary, courting both independent and moderate Republican voters.
But she was unable to catch Mr Trump, who had a comfortable 11-point lead with most ballots counted.
He now appears set to clinch the Republican nomination.
The former president last week won a landslide in Iowa's caucuses, with Ms Haley placing third, behind Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
Mr DeSantis quit the race days later, leaving Ms Haley as the last remaining rival to Mr Trump.
At an election night party in Concord on Tuesday night, Ms Haley conceded the New Hampshire contest, congratulating Mr Trump on his win.
But she vowed to take her bid to become the Republican party's presidential candidate back home to South Carolina, the state where she served as governor, in a month's time.
""This race is far from over,"" Ms Haley said to a boisterous room of supporters. ""There are dozens of states left to go. And the next one is my sweet state of South Carolina.""

Watch: Trump lashes out at 'imposter' Haley in victory speech
Even with her close ties to the state, opinion polls suggest Ms Haley is trailing Mr Trump by a wide margin.
Mr Trump did not seem to take well to Ms Haley's speech on Tuesday, calling her ""delusional"".
""Who the hell was that imposter that went up on that stage that went before and claimed victory?"" he said.
Team Haley hit back almost immediately, describing his speech as a ""furious and rumbling rant"".
For months, Ms Haley remained cautious in her criticism of Mr Trump, the prohibitive frontrunner and her former boss. But in New Hampshire last weekend, the former UN ambassador made her most pointed attacks to date, warning of his friendships with ""dictators"", questioning his mental acuity and slamming his ""lies"".
Exit polls from CBS News, the BBC's US partner, showed her 11th-hour sprint may have paid off - two-thirds of voters who made their decision in the last few days voted for her. And Ms Haley outperformed opinion polls that had shown her trailing Mr Trump by around 20 points.
Still, despite the state's sizable bloc of independent voters - those who were considered likely to favour Ms Haley - she could not fully close the considerable ground between herself and the former president.
""Nikki put in the time, put in the work and put in the money,"" said Katon Dawson, a Haley surrogate and the former chairman of the South Carolina Republican party. ""With that said, Donald Trump is an 800 pound gorilla that has his arms around the base.""
Across New Hampshire ahead of the primary, some members of that base told the BBC they thought Ms Haley was insufficiently conservative. Others said they liked her personally, but that they would not waver in their support for Mr Trump.
""I'm not sure about some of her policies,"" said Pat Hansen on Tuesday in Manchester. And it reflected poorly on Ms Haley, she believed, that top Republicans in South Carolina had turned their backs on her and endorsed Mr Trump.
Ms Haley is opting out of the third Republican contest - caucuses in Nevada - and experts said a loss in South Carolina's primary on 24 February would likely be fatal to her campaign.
""The momentum is moving toward Trump rapidly and he's likely going to close the nomination early,"" said veteran Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. ""There's little doubt now.""
And there's this daunting piece of political trivia for Ms Haley: no Republican candidate has ever won the first two states and not gone on to become the Republican nominee.

RHULN5HP46_XC9Y402JR8FK4TH,Photographer Rankin reflects on his career and charity work,By Leisha Chi-Santorelli,6 days ago,20230123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68035756,"Over the last 20 years, British photographer Rankin has profiled the world's most famous people ranging from David Bowie to the late Queen Elizabeth II. Supermodels and fashion shoots helped make his fortune. But it is charity projects that continue to keep him grounded.
Rankin, who was once labelled a 'bad boy' celebrity photographer, has mellowed since the Britpop heydays of the noughties and becoming a father. In an interview with the BBC, the Glasgow-born creative reflected on his journey from a working class background to the dizzying heights of fame.
""When my kid was born, and they started to grow up, I was very concerned that I needed to correct that balance of having this incredible job where you do get paid extraordinary amounts of money to do what you love. You need to balance the art of giving something back.""
Rankin, full name John Rankin Waddell, has used his profile to support numerous charities ranging from women's health issues and combating plastic waste, to recognising the contributions of NHS workers.
His latest campaign is for the Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTi) where his images are used in the book 'Tear Couture' which aims to bring attention to the continued risk of acid attacks as a form of gender-based violence.
ASTi, which counts the Princess Royal as its patron, estimates that more than 10,000 attacks take place globally each year, mostly on women and children. The charity found a large proportion occur in South Asian countries where garment and jewellery industries operate.
Anecdotal evidence shows attacks using corrosive liquids of hydrochloric, sulphuric and nitric acid occur at higher rates in locations where these substances are easily accessible, and where factories use acids in their manufacturing processes.
Some 710 acid attacks were recorded in England and Wales last year, an increase from 421 in 2021, according to ASTi which compiled the data by submitting a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to 43 police forces.
Rankin said taking on the ASTi charity project adds to his body of work in rethinking beauty standards.
The Belgian activist 59-year-old Patricia Lefranc, his model, has undergone countless surgeries after an ex-lover threw sulphuric acid on her. Few acid attack victims are willing to be photographed.
""I look at these pictures of Patricia and I think they're beautiful,"" Rankin told the BBC. ""I want to empower her through those pictures. She was very brave in showing me how extensive her acid attack was.""
""You have to have an empathy for anybody that's in front of the camera. It can be rather daunting,"" he added. ""I'm not taking something from them, I'm making something with them together. That's how I approach every single picture I take.""
""My idea of beauty was very influenced by growing up photographing beautiful people all the time,"" Rankin admits.
""So to challenge that, which I've been doing since the early '90s, I felt like it was my duty to not just buy into the beauty of the beauty industry or the movie industry. It's to buy into my own version of that.""
The 57-year-old said he wants to be able to ""take pictures that are unexpected and turn people's heads"".
""I'm trying to change the whole idea of what is beauty. That is the kind of thing that you're aiming for with these types of pictures"".
Rankin does not take a personal fee for charity work, instead using an expenses-based approach. Reflecting on his success, Rankin said photography remains his favourite medium.
""I own an ad agency. I've directed movies, I've made commercials, but I come back to photography and it's the thing that I love the most.""
He warns that younger people need to realise the industry has become even tougher in a digital age where everyone has a camera in the form of a smartphone.
""It's a very difficult career to manage,"" he said. ""You've got to reinvent yourself again and again and again.""
""You've got to remain current and it is a struggle. You have to kind of sacrifice quite a lot in your working life. I don't think that's changed.""
Rankin also holds the honour of having photographed all the top royals including an iconic image of Queen Elizabeth II marking her Golden Jubilee. At the time, he said in an interview that he worked hard to get her to smile.
Last year, he photographed King Charles III for the Big Issue magazine which helps the homeless and shared that the monarch was ""delightful to photograph and it was very easy to make him laugh"".
Below is a selection of images from charity campaigns Rankin considers close to his heart.
""I really love that picture because I feel there's a resilience to the image that maybe people haven't seen before. And I think what I'm always looking for is the person behind the Crown, not the Crown.
""I was looking for the person who has been in the wings and has that resilience and has got an opinion,"" Rankin told the BBC.
""To be really honest, I think we need some leaders like that in our lives.""
Cambodian genocide survivor Sokphal Din BEM had a way of looking at the lens ""as though he was reassuring the audience it was OK to talk about such tragedies,"" Rankin said in an interview for the Holocaust Day Memorial Trust.
For the charity, Rankin made five images: four of men and women who survived the Holocaust or genocide, and one of the teddy bear who accompanied Holocaust survivor, John Hajdu MBE, through the Budapest ghetto.
""I wanted my portraits to do something different. The West has been anesthetised to traditional pictures of disaster zones,"" Rankin said in a 2010 interview with Oxfam.
""My style of portraiture is always about bringing people out of themselves, getting them to share something. I chose to photograph the people against a stark white background instead of in their physical environment. The expressions in their eyes and on their faces - their humanity - was what I wanted people to notice and relate to.""
""You don't realise the scale of support that's out there - they fund research and new technologies, accommodation and support for patients, and extra services so more of us can access better care,"" Rankin said about his exhibition celebrating 75 years of NHS charities.
""I used to work in the NHS but honestly had no idea, and it really has been eye opening.""

S5KC2QHAR9_NV71P64X3TCWMEU,Man fined for pro-IRA slogan aimed at DUP's Edwin Poots,By Brendan Hughes,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68105099,"A man has been fined by a court in Scotland after shouting a pro-IRA slogan at a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assembly member.
Edwin Poots said he was boarding a flight from Glasgow to Belfast in 2022 when a man said ""Up the Ra"" to him.
Prosecutors in Scotland said a man has since pleaded guilty to threatening or abusive behaviour.
Mark Gallogly, 35, of Glen Road near Omagh, County Tyrone, was fined Â£850 earlier this month.
Mr Poots welcomed the outcome, describing the behaviour as ""totally unacceptable"".
The Stormont assembly member said people's lives were ""torn apart"" as a consequence of the Troubles in Northern Ireland and ""there is a pain that is carried by many people"".
Speaking to the BBC's Nolan Show, he said using slogans in support of paramilitary organisations was ""inflicting pain"" on those impacted by the decades-long violent conflict.
""We were boarding a flight from Glasgow to Belfast, and as I was going to my seat, the individual named said 'up the Ra' as I was passing,"" he told the programme.
""And this was witnessed by five or six passengers.""
He said he arranged for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) to be contacted before the flight took off, and a man was arrested when it arrived in Belfast.
Mr Poots urged police and prosecutors in Northern Ireland to do more to ""ensure this type of behaviour is stamped out"".
""A small number of convictions will actually eradicate this quite quickly because people won't want to get fined for it,"" he said.
In a response to the Nolan Show, Scotland's Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service confirmed Mr Gallogly was fined Â£850 at Paisley Sheriff Court on 17 January after pleading guilty to an offence under the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010."

Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades. have released a video of a 21-year-old Israeli-French woman, Mia Shem, who was abducted from a party in Israel.
She said was one of those taken hostage at the Supernova music festival in southern Israel on 7 October and brought back to Gaza.
Following the release of the video, Mia's family held a news conference in Tel Aviv where they called for her to be freed.

S7YAY3Y6LA_9Z5NEZMBCR00K9C,Yes or snow? Reese Witherspoon's viral brew divides opinion,By Ruth Comerford,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68059755,"Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon has whipped up a storm - after scooping snow to make a coffee-caramel drink.
The Legally Blonde star, 47, shared her icy recipe with followers on TikTok, prompting a cool response from many people apparently disturbed by the idea of eating fresh snow.
In a TikTok video now viewed 4.8m times, Witherspoon creates a ""Snow Salt Chococinno"" using snow gathered outside her house, together with cold brew coffee, and lashings of salted caramel and chocolate sauce.
""OK, so we got a tonne of snow over the past few days so we decided to make a recipe,"" she says. ""It is so good!""
But the idea went on to prompt a backlash so fierce the star used a further three videos to address a number of concerned comments from her followers.
""There are so many people on here saying that snow is dirty,"" she says. ""So we went and took snow from the backyard and microwaved it and it's clear - is this bad? Am I not supposed to eat snow?""
Scientists have suggested the first snowfall is not the safest to taste.
After a water droplet freezes and forms a snow flake, it can soak up pollutants from the air as it descends.
The whitest layer the furthest away from the ground is regarded as safer to consume.
Staci Simonich, professor of environmental and toxic ecology at Oregon State University, told the BBC that snow is safe to eat as long as it is from ""a non-urban area"" and that people wait ""until the first few centimetres fallen"".
""The first bit of snow scrubs pollutants from the atmosphere,"" she said, adding that is it best to ""eat a small amount"" from an ""area where no people or animals have walked"".
For Paul Williams, professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading, snowflakes ""risk being contaminated with far worse as they lie on the ground, as anyone who has ever seen yellow snow will agree"".
""Would you drink rain? If not, then don't eat snow,"" he added. ""The risks are probably small, but why take the chance - I hate to disagree with Reese Witherspoon, but humans invented water treatment processes for a reason.""
Yet for all those earnestly questioning the safety of eating snow, there appeared to be equal numbers ridiculing the whole debate.
One TikTok user wrote that ""my Canadian self is laughing at the comment... we've been eating snow since we could crawl"".
Another said: ""My entire family grew up making snow ice cream multiple times every winter. 13 of us never once got sick from it.""
And responding to Witherspoon's post, Dr Zachary Rubin - a paediatric allergist based in Illinois - said simply: ""This is not a big deal.""
""Doc says it's fine,"" Witherspoon replied.

S8LAD73LE4_WHKWXSZ42Q2F6GD,US demands Israel conduct full investigation into Palestinian-American teen's killing,By Nadine Yousif,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68038149,"The US is calling for a full probe into the murder of a Palestinian-American teenager who died on Friday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, 17, was shot in the head and killed, his family said.
Jabbar's family said they believe he was hit by an off-duty Israeli soldier and an Israeli settler who shot at the car he had been driving.
The Israeli police said a civilian and an off-duty policeman had fired at someone suspected of hurling rocks.
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said that one of its members was also in the area, and that it is investigating the claim that the soldier had fired shots at the Palestinian teenager.
The White House, increasingly at odds with the Israeli government and also facing criticism at home about its handling of the war in Gaza, is pressing for a wide and deep investigation.
Calling the death of Jabber ""a tragic killing"", National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby said that ""we have every expectation that those responsible will be held accountable"".
""We call on Israel to conduct a full, thorough and transparent investigation into his killing,"" Mr Kirby said at a White House press briefing on Monday.
Jabbar's death comes amid rising tensions in the West Bank between Palestinians and Israeli settlers, as the war between Israel and the militant group Hamas in Gaza enters its fourth month.
At least 319 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since the war broke out on 7 October, according to UN data. Many were killed in shootouts with the Israeli military, but some, witnesses say, were killed by Israeli forces and settlers while they were unarmed.
President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are divided over the future of post-war Gaza. Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly rejected US calls for a two-state solution to the conflict, where a Palestinian state would be created next to an Israeli one.
Born and raised in Louisiana, Jabbar had travelled to the village of Al-Mara'a Al-Sharqiya, about 10 miles northwest of Ramallah, with his family in May to learn about his Palestinian roots, his family said.
His father, Hafeth Abdel Jabbar, told NBC News that his son had hoped to study engineering in college and was considering pursuing a degree in the West Bank.
Jabbar's family said he was killed after going out for a picnic with friends. Witnesses told them that the teenager was first shot by a person who appeared to be a settler, followed by someone wearing an IDF uniform.
In his interview with NBC, Mr Abdel Jabbar said  he doubts the US government will take action to respond to the killing of his, who, he said, was ""very loved"".
He dismissed the accusation by Israeli authorities that his son was hurling rocks. But he added that even if rocks were thrown, his son should not have been killed.
""You're gonna shoot the car 10 times because a guy threw a rock?"" he asked.

SN6OQK7E3G_5S850BNT8NTXNN6,United Automobile Workers union endorses Biden for re-election,By Sam Cabral,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68088778,"The United Automobile Workers, a major US union representing more than 400,000 people, has endorsed the re-election bid of President Joe Biden.
It comes after the Democrat, 81, joined UAW workers on a picket line last year, in a first for a sitting president.
Mr Biden is expected to face off in the November general election against Donald Trump, who polls more strongly among blue-collar voters.
The UAW endorsement may boost his efforts to eat into that advantage.
Though the UAW backed Mr Biden ahead of the 2020 election, its new leadership declined last year to join other high-profile unions in endorsing his re-election. President Shawn Fain had said a 2024 endorsement should ""be earned, not freely given"".
But Mr Fain said Wednesday that members, mostly workers in car and truck factories, face a choice between voting for ""someone who stands up with us and supports our cause"" or for ""someone who will divide us and fight us every step of the way"".
""If our endorsements have to be earned, Joe Biden has earned it,"" he said at the close of the UAW's three-day national conference in Washington DC.
Mr Biden - who often refers to himself as the most pro-union US leader - donned a UAW ballcap and said ""it's great to be home"" as he accepted the endorsement.
""I'm honoured to have your back and you have my back. That's a deal,"" he told a sea of rank-and-file union members in red polo shirts.
In September, the president - with bullhorn in hand - joined union members on strike from a General Motors parts warehouse in Detroit, Michigan.

Watch: Biden addresses autoworkers on picket line
The unprecedented show of support came as the UAW took on the big three US automakers - GM, Ford and Stellantis - all at once in contract negotiations, by going on individual strikes with little notice and on a rolling basis.
Mr Trump, who held an event a day later at a non-union plant in Michigan, dismissed the incident as ""nothing more than a PR stunt"".
But by November, union leaders had brokered a historic new contract that included record wage hikes and cost-of-living adjustments.
""You built these companies, you sacrificed to save them in the worst of times and you deserve to benefit when these companies thrive,"" Mr Biden said on Wednesday.
""The days of working people being dealt out of the deal are over in this country.""
Mr Fain praised the president for his role in the negotiations, saying he had ""heard the call"" and ""joined us in solidarity"" in addition to vocally supporting the right to strike and creating new opportunities to organise.
By contrast, the previous president had ""trashed our union"" and taken actions to ""screw the American middle class"", he alleged.
The UAW endorsement may motivate its members to vote for Mr Biden, who has been plagued by low approval ratings and is struggling to build enthusiasm for his re-election bid.
This is particularly true for those workers concentrated in the auto-making battleground state of Michigan, where Mr Biden needs to cut into his opponent's lead with working-class voters.
Though he defeated Mr Trump in the state in 2020, Mr Biden is facing a revolt this year from its sizeable Arab-American electorate as well as many young voters over his position on the Israel-Gaza conflict.
Offering a preview of those electability concerns, protesters demanding a ceasefire in Gaza interrupted Mr Biden's remarks, in what is becoming a common occurrence at his public events.

SO4K0K446E_VTIDWUQINZJCCXP,Donald Trump must pay E Jean Carroll $83.3m for defamation,By Brandon Livesay and Madeline Halpert,1 day ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68109999,"This video can not be played
The BBC's Nada Tawfik explains why Trump must pay $83m to E Jean Carroll
A New York jury has decided Donald Trump should pay $83.3m (Â£65m) for defaming columnist E Jean Carroll in 2019 while he was US president.
The penalty in the civil trial is made up of $18.3m for compensatory damages and $65m in punitive damages.
Mr Trump was found in a previous civil case to have defamed Ms Carroll and sexually assaulted her in the 1990s.
He vowed to appeal the latest ruling, calling the case a witch hunt and the verdict ""absolutely ridiculous"".
In the latest trial, the jury was only required to decide how much compensation, if any, should be awarded to Ms Carroll.
The compensatory damages are meant to account for the harm that the jury found his comments had done to her reputation and emotional wellbeing.
The panel also had to come up with a punitive penalty intended to stop Mr Trump from continuing to speak out against her.
It took the jury of seven men and two women less than three hours to reach a verdict on Friday afternoon.
Mr Trump, who looks likely to be the Republican candidate in November's presidential election, also faces four criminal cases for a total of 91 felony counts.
He is the first president in US history to be charged with a crime, but has pleaded not guilty or denied all the charges.
""This is a great victory for every woman who stands up when she's been knocked down, and a huge defeat for every bully who has tried to keep a woman down,"" Ms Carroll said in a statement after the jury's decision on Friday.
Her attorney, Robbie Kaplan, said in a statement: ""Today's verdict proves that the law applies to everyone in our country, even the rich, even the famous, even former presidents.""
Mr Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, or even that he has ever met Ms Carroll, including on Friday morning.
But following the verdict he refrained from attacking her directly when he slammed the outcome of the case in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.
""I fully disagree with both verdicts,"" he wrote, ""and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party.
""Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment Rights. THIS IS NOT AMERICA!""
A civil trial last year found Mr Trump sexually assaulted Ms Carroll, a magazine columnist, in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in the 1990s.
That jury also found him liable for defamation for calling her accusations a lie - and he was ordered to pay her about $5m in damages.
The case that ended on Friday focused on different defamatory comments by Mr Trump in 2019.
Ms Carroll has yet to receive any money from Mr Trump.
The former president has paid a deposit to the court while the appeal process on the first defamation suit plays out, former federal prosecutor Mitch Epner said.
The same rules will apply to these much higher damages, Mr Epner added, where Mr Trump will have to put up an extra $83.3m - in either cash or an appeal bond - as a deposit.
Mr Trump, who abruptly left court earlier in the day with his Secret Service security detail, was not present to hear the verdict.
His departure came moments after Judge Kaplan threatened to jail Mr Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, for continuing to speak after he had told her to be quiet.
""You are on the verge of spending some time in the lockup. Now sit down,"" he told Ms Habba.
The judge had threatened to eject Mr Trump earlier after he muttered about the case being a ""con job"" and a ""witch hunt"" in court. Before the verdict was read, the judge warned: ""We will haveÂ noÂ outbursts.""
During closing arguments earlier on Friday, a lawyer for Ms Carroll told the court her reputation had been severely harmed by the former president's comments denying he sexually assaulted her.
""This case is also about punishing Donald Trump... This trial is about getting him to stop once and for all,"" she said.
Ms Carroll's attorneys previously told the court that Mr Trump's statements unleashed a torrent of death threats, rape threats, and online vitriol towards her.
Mr Trump's lawyer had argued that he should pay no further damages to Ms Carroll as her claims have ""more holes than Swiss cheese"".
Ms Habba said that her client was not to blame for the threats that Ms Carroll received.
Earlier in the trial Judge Lewis Kaplan (no relation of the plaintiff's lawyer) advised jurors not to use their real names with each other due to the sensitive nature of the case.
As it concluded, he advised them that they were free to discuss their experience. But he added that in his opinion they should not tell anyone they worked on this case.
Mr Trump has repeatedly claimed the various legal cases he faces are being orchestrated by allies of US President Joe Biden, a Democrat.
As the Republican party's White House frontrunner, Mr Trump looks set for a rematch against Mr Biden in the November 2024 general election.

SWJNPDQMDG_IWW0PK19SRMLXLX,World's first IVF rhino pregnancy 'could save species',By Rebecca Morelle and Alison Francis,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-68064432,"A fertility breakthrough has offered hope for saving the northern white rhino from extinction - there are only two of the animals left on the planet.
Scientists have achieved the world's first IVF rhino pregnancy, successfully transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother.
The procedure was carried out with southern white rhinos, a closely related sub-species of northern whites.
The next step is to repeat this with northern white embryos.
""To achieve the first successful embryo transfer in a rhino is a huge step,"" said Susanne Holtze, a scientist at Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany, which is part of the Biorescue project, an international consortium trying to save this species.
""But now I think with this achievement, we are very confident that we will be able to create northern white rhinos in the same manner and that we will be able to save the species.""
Northern white rhinos were once found across central Africa, but illegal poaching, fuelled by the demand for rhino horn, wiped out the wild population.
Now only two rhinos remain: two females, Najin and her daughter Fatu. Both of the former zoo animals are kept under tight security at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.
Unable to reproduce, the species is technically extinct. But now the Biorescue team has turned to radical fertility science to bring these animals back from the brink.
They started their work using southern white rhinos. This close cousin of the northern whites has a population of thousands - and is considered a conservation success story although it's still threatened by illegal hunting.
The project has taken years and has had to overcome many challenges: from working out how to collect eggs from the two-tonne animals, to creating the first-ever rhino embryos in a lab and trying to establish how - and when - to implant them.
It took 13 attempts to achieve the first viable IVF pregnancy using southern white rhinos.
""It's very challenging in such a big animal, in terms of placing an embryo inside the reproductive tract, which is almost 2m inside the animal,"" Susanne Holtze told BBC News.
The embryo, which was made using an egg from a female southern white from a zoo in Belgium and fertilized with sperm from a male in Austria, was transferred into a southern white surrogate female in Kenya, who became pregnant.
However, the success was followed by tragedy.
Seventy days into the pregnancy, the surrogate mother died after becoming infected with Clostridia - a bacteria found in the soil that can be deadly to animals.
The death dealt a blow to the team - a post-mortem revealed that the 6.5cm male foetus was developing well and had a 95% chance of being born alive.
But it showed that the technique had worked and that a viable pregnancy through rhino IVF was possible. Now the next step is to try this using northern white rhino embryos.
There are only 30 of these precious embryos in existence, stored in liquid nitrogen in Germany and Italy.
They were created using eggs harvested from Fatu, the younger female in Kenya, and sperm collected from two male northern white rhinos before they died.
However, the birth of a northern white calf will require another scientific first.
Neither of the last two surviving northern whites can carry a pregnancy because of a combination of age and health problems. So instead the embryo will be implanted into the womb of a surrogate southern white rhino.
IVF across a sub species has never been tried before, but the team is confident it will work.
Prof Thomas Hildebrandt, the director of Liebniz IZW and project head for the Biorescue Consortium, said: ""I think the situation for the northern white rhino is quite privileged for the embryo transfer because we have a closely related recipient - so their internal map is nearly the same.""
The Biorescue team hopes to implant the embryos in the coming months. They want the calf to be born while some northern white rhinos are still alive.
""We want to preserve the social communication, the social heritage of the northern white rhino by putting the first calf on the ground so they can learn the language from the last two rhinos, they can learn how to behave from them,"" explained Prof Hildebrandt.
The researchers are aware that adding some more animals through IVF will not save this species - there wouldn't be enough genetic diversity to create a viable population.
So they are simultaneously working on an even more experimental technique, attempting to create rhino sperm and eggs from stem cells, to go on to produce embryos.
Again, this will take time and there will be many scientific challenges to overcome.
Some wildlife experts also argue that pouring more money and resources into a species that's as good as lost could be better used in saving more viable species.
However, Jan Stejskal, the BioRescue project coordinator from Safari Park Dvur Kralove in the Czech Republic where Najin and Fatu were originally from, said: ""One thing that we have to understand is that behind the extinction of the northern white rhino is man. It's not because of some evolutionary pressure, it was greed, it was the consumption of a rhino horn.
""So, in a way, we are responsible and if we actually have a technique that can assist us to save them, then I think we have a responsibility to use it and to try to save them.""
Samuel Mutisya, head of research and species conservation at Ol Pejeta, added that the northern whites were a critical party of the ecosystem and the team was ""committed to do all that is humanly possible to nurture, protect and recover the species"".

SX73PH6PCM_72F6KR88MRL2I2V,French protests: Female farmer and daughter killed as car hits French protesters,By Chris Bockman in Toulouse & Paul Kirby in London,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68066310,"A French farmer in her thirties and her 12-year-old daughter have died after a car crashed into a roadblock during a nationwide protest by French farmers.
The accident, which left the farmer's husband badly injured, happened an hour south of Toulouse as the protest grew.
Farmers have cut off key roads for days in the south-west, one of France's most important agricultural regions.
Early indications suggested the accident was not deliberate, the local prosecutor said.
Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau said it was a ""tragedy for all of us"".
Tuesday's accident came as farmers across France expanded their roadblocks after a meeting with Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, to address complaints about new environmental regulations and rising energy costs.
Public prosecutors said the car ""struck bales of straw and mowed down three people"" while driving on a stretch of dual carriageway on the main N20 national route at Pamiers 70km (43 miles) south of Toulouse, while it was still dark at around 05:45 (04:45GMT) on Tuesday morning.
The farmer who died was named as Alexandra Sonac, 35, who bred cattle and grew corn on a farm in the nearby village of Saint-Felix-de-Tournegat.
Her 12-year-old daughter later died of her injuries in hospital. The farmer's husband, who is 40, is being treated in intensive care.
The three people in the car were all detained. They had reportedly been driving from Toulouse to Andorra, another two hours' drive to the south.
An investigation has been opened into aggravated manslaughter although local prosecutor Olivier Mouysset said the incident did not appear to be deliberate.
The young farmer who died was a member of the main FNSEA farmers' union, whose president Arnaud Rousseau said that ""in this particular moment that [French] agriculture is dealing with, this kind of tragedy is difficult to cope with"".
""I'd like to tell the people on the ground first of all that they have the full support of French farmers.""
Ms Sonac, who had two children, told a local radio station earlier this week that her family was protesting to defend their profession.
""I've got two girls to look after and we live for them. We don't go on holiday, we don't get a day off,"" she told Radio Transparence.
As the farmers' protests spread across France, the head of the Jeunes Agriculteurs (Young Farmers) union, Arnaud Gaillot, said he had never seen such widespread determination.
""If necessary we'll blockade Paris... some [of our members] have nothing else to lose, their survival is at stake,"" he told RTL radio.
Tractors and lorries blocked the A7 motorway in south-east France, with the slogan ""we're dying to feed you"" daubed in red on one of the vehicles.
The most recent protests started in the south-west last week. Although it is one of the most important agricultural regions in the country, the FNSEA says farmers in this part of France have the lowest incomes within the profession.
They are already being nicknamed ""gilets verts"", or green jackets - a reference to the broader gilets jaunes civil protests that swept across France over rising fuel prices.
More than 400 tractors last week blocked the centre of Toulouse, home to around 800,000 people. Over recent days, several key motorways in the south west have been cut off entirely by farmers who have installed sleeping quarters in the middle of the highways.
Motorways were cut off on Tuesday between Toulouse and the Basque Country and Toulouse and Bordeaux. On Wednesday morning taxi drivers in Toulouse joined the strike in a show of support for the farmers.
Aware of how politically sensitive the situation is, the French interior minister said on Monday he would not order police to break up the blockades.
Prime Minister Gabriel Attal responded to news of the accident on Tuesday by paying tribute to the family and friends of those involved in the accident. The nation was ""overwhelmed and united"" and all of France's farmers were in mourning, he said on social media.

SXZR8JB6NW_GZD2VJ49MH0UDIR,Woolworths could return to British High Streets,By Faarea Masud,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68068503,"Once loved for its pick 'n' mix sweets and bargain prices, Woolworths stores could return to the UK.
In 2009 when its British shops closed after the financial crisis, the brand in Germany, where it is known as Woolworth, was saved by HH Holding.
Current HH Holding chief Roman Heini says the UK is on his ""bucket list"" of destinations as he seeks to expand internationally.
It comes as Wilko, which filled the gap left by Woolworths, collapsed in 2023.
Mr Heini - who has worked in executive positions in both Aldi and Lidl and has been Woolworth chief executive since 2020 - told trade magazine Retail Week that despite the challenges of a cost-of-living crisis he had the opportunity to ""make Woolworth great again"".
Affectionately known as ""Woolies"", if the brand were to return to UK High Streets it is unclear how it would be spelt.
Woolworth Germany told the BBC: ""The brand name 'Woolworth' (without the 's') is owned by us throughout Europe. Should we ever plan to return to the UK, we would scrutinise the naming rights to minimise the risk of confusion. A transfer of rights could help if necessary.""
Woolworths originated in the US and operated for 100 years in the UK, having opened its first store in Liverpool in 1909. It had 807 British stores and its closure left more than 27,000 people unemployed.
It suffered from the economic downturn of 2008-09 and from cheaper competitors eating into its market share. Some analysts say it was also not able to keep up with online shopping.
Woolworth Germany said it was ""unable to confirm any plans for Woolworth to return to the UK market"" but that such a move was not ruled out in principle.
""Britain is on his [Roman Heini's] bucket list, although nothing is imminent,"" a spokesperson said, adding ""but it may be in the mix for the mid- or long-term future"".
Its offerings, however, have changed since it was last seen on the High Street. Previously, it was known for its variety of items including children's clothing brand Ladybird, CDs and confectionery.
Under Mr Heini's stewardship, Woolworth Germany has pivoted to clothing and homeware, which he says is at ""unbeatable prices"".
He told Retail Week that 6,000 of the 10,000 products that Woolworth sells are priced at â¬3 (Â£2.57) or below. ""To match that online, at least until today, is very difficult, if not impossible,"" he said.
But a re-entry would not be without its challenges. Disruption to supply chains because of attacks by Houthi rebels in one of the world's busiest trade routes in the Red Sea, plus post-pandemic ""turmoil"" were two of the issues Mr Heini cited as standing in the way of any immediate British revival of the brand.
However, as the collapse of Wilko left some people feeling nostalgic for Woolworths, the firm feels it would be welcome in the UK.
""I don't know of any brands where the recognition will be as high as it is in Britain, without having any stores,"" Mr Heini said.
Woolworth has more than 600 shops, with the majority in Germany but some in Austria and Poland.

SY5CTBUHC7_JIFEJWB2QOJMCL1,Coltan discovered in Kenya - Mining Minister Salim Mvurya,By Gloria Aradi,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68090482,"Kenya has discovered its first deposits of the valuable mineral coltan, the mining minister has said.
The rare mineral is used to manufacture electric car batteries, mobile phones and other electronic devices.
The Democratic Republic of Congo holds more than 70% of the world's coltan reserves, which have for decades fuelled violent conflict in the east of the country.
It is not clear how large the coltan deposits found in Kenya are.
Mining officials have previously hinted that Kenya could have traces of the highly valuable ore, but Kenya's Minister for Mining, Blue Economy and Maritime Affairs Salim Mvurya on Wednesday said that his announcement means ""it is now official"" that Kenya has coltan reserves.
Deposits of the mineral have been found in six counties across the country, but their value is yet to be determined.
""We will leave our teams behind to do ground truthing so that we can now begin to assess the economic value of that particular mineral,"" Mr Mvurya said.
Residents of Embu County in eastern Kenya, one of the six counties with reserves of the mineral, have been advised to hold onto their land.
""A precious mineral has been found here and if you want to benefit you should not sell your land,"" Nebart Muriuki, an MP from the county, was quoted as saying by the privately owned East African newspaper.
Mr Mvurya said the discovery was expected to create more jobs and expand Kenya's mining industry.
Mining accounts for less than 1% of Kenya's GDP but has the potential to contribute up to 10%, according to the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI).
Coltan is often refined into metallic tantalum, a heat-resistant powder that is used to produce capacitors, which are then used to manufacture electronic devices.
The price of coltan depends on how much tantalum it contains, but on average, a kilogram of the rare ore fetches $48 (Â£37), according to Forbes.
Analysts say the international demand for coltan is growing fast and has become one of the driving forces behind the conflict in eastern DR Congo, as rival militias fight for control of mines that produce coltan and other valuable minerals.
DR Congo, along with neighbouring Rwanda, are two of the world's top coltan suppliers."
T0QDH1G262_OW8C7PCI6RYL8AI,UK officials probe Iran generals' antisemitic talks to students,By Ed Thomas,6 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68016330,"This video can not be played
Watch: Clips of Iran generals' speeches to UK students
Videos of antisemitic speeches by Iranian generals, given to UK students, are being investigated by the Charity Commission.
The regulator is also looking at footage of ""death to Israel"" chants at an Islamic charity's UK premises.
Verified by the BBC, two of the videos show talks by members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. One described an apocalyptic war on Jews.
The group that promoted the online talks said it respects all communities.
The footage - which also includes a denial of the Holocaust - adds to growing concerns from some MPs that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is attempting to radicalise UK Muslims. Security services have also warned it is inciting violence and plotting to kidnap or kill people on British soil.
One of the most powerful paramilitary organisations in the Middle East, the IRGC controls the Iranian government's foreign covert operations and supports militant groups such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and the Houthis in Yemen.
The IRGC has previously been linked to kidnap and assassination plots in the UK. Counter-terror police confirmed in February last year that 15 such plots had come out of Iran since 2020, and the BBC has since been told there has been at least one more.
The videos seen by the BBC were recorded in 2020 and 2021 and show three events.
Two were live-streamed speeches by former and active IRGC commanders.
The other was an in-person event inside the Kanoon Towhid Islamic centre in west London, commemorating Iran's top military commander Gen Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a US air strike in 2020. Chants of ""death to Israel"" were heard at the event, but it is not known who was saying them.
The BBC has also seen evidence of another online talk to UK students by an IRGC commander who has since boasted of his role in training Hamas before the 7 October attacks.
The online talks were promoted in advance by the Islamic Students Associations of Britain (ISA) and its affiliates, which use the Kanoon Towhid centre as a meeting place. Unlike the UK's main Muslim student groups, the ISA was founded to promote the philosophy of the leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini.
Kanoon Towhid is owned by the Al-Tawheed (TUCF) Charitable Trust. The trust was already being investigated by the Charity Commission after reports of the event honouring Gen Soleimani, who was sanctioned by the UK for his links to terrorism. The commission is now examining the videos seen by the BBC, which include footage of this event.
The commission's chair, Orlando Fraser, has previously warned that charities must not ""become forums for hate speech"" or extremism. The Charity Commission has the power to investigate, sanction or close down charities which breach the regulations.
Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, described the speeches as a ""brazen act of radicalisation"". She said the IRGC should be added to the list of proscribed terrorist groups in the UK, meaning it would be illegal to be an IRGC member or to show support for them.
In one recording - an Instagram Live from Iran in September 2020 which has been viewed about 1,500 times - IRGC commander Hossein Yekta said universities had become ""the battlefront"" and urged the students listening to become ""soft-war officers"".
Kasra Aarabi - director of IRGC research at the US-based campaign group United Against Nuclear Iran, and who shared the videos with the BBC - said ""soft-war officers"" is a term used by Iran to describe recruits to its ideological battle with the West. He said it was coined by a branch of the IRGC, ""which today is proactively conducting terror plots on British soil"".
Ali Ansari, a professor of Iranian history at the University of St Andrews, said the talks reflected ""an attempt to encourage disruption, discontent, and basically undermine the stability of Western society, and what we need is a much more robust response to it"".
Prof Ansari said proscribing the IRGC as a terrorist organisation would be difficult, as it is an arm of the Iranian state. But he said the UK government could still shut down its activities.
The other video of an online talk seen by the BBC, this time from January 2021, again glorified the death of Gen Soleimani.
Seen by tens of thousands of people, the video shows former IRGC commander Gen Saeed Ghasemi comparing Soleimani's death to the Hollywood film Terminator 2, saying that after Soleimani was attacked, the broken pieces would come back together, stronger than before.
""You killed Qasem,"" he said, referring to the US, ""but he shattered into millions of hearts in the Islamic world. You can no longer stand in his way.""
In the footage, Gen Ghasemi also falsely claimed the Holocaust was ""a lie and a fake"" and described an apocalyptic war that the British students could join to ""bring an end to the life of the oppressors and occupiers, Zionists and Jews across the world"".
He added: ""God willing, myself and you good students in Europe will be written in the beautiful list of the soldiers of the resistance from tonight.""
In addition to the videos, the BBC has seen promotional posts dating from November 2020 for another talk to British students featuring elite former IRGC commander Ezzatollah Zarghami. Mr Zarghami, who is sanctioned in the UK for human rights abuses, posted a picture of himself on his Telegram social media account speaking live over Zoom on the evening of the talk.
Mr Zarghami was part of a group of radical students who stormed the US embassy in Tehran in 1979, holding Americans hostage for more than a year. He is currently the minister of Cultural Heritage and Tourism in Iran and has since boasted of training Hamas in Gaza prior to the 7 October attacks. In an interview on Iranian state TV, he also described how he had provided Hamas with missiles.
Online adverts for the speeches in the videos displayed the logo of the Islamic Students Associations of Britain. In one of the videos, the association's name is spelled out on the screen in Farsi.
And the Instagram Live event from September 2020 was hosted by Mohammadhussain Ataee, a British citizen educated in Yorkshire who was secretary of the Islamic Students Associations of Britain at the time. It is the only video he appears in and he is no longer the secretary of the organisation.
However, Mr Ataee is still the secretary of the Union of Islamic Students Associations of Europe - an umbrella body that includes the British organisation. In January last year, he was granted an audience in Tehran with Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Mr Ataee said the allegations against him are false, but would not answer the BBC's questions. He has previously said he does not have direct or indirect affiliation to the IRGC, or any army, government or security group in the world.
He added the Islamic Students Associations have never had any ""physical gathering in Kanoon Towhid or anywhere else with any of the falsely accused individuals"".
Mr Ataee also said the students association was a democratic organisation which makes its decisions through an executive committee, not through one person.
After watching the footage of IRGC commanders, the foreign affairs committee chair Ms Kearns urged the government to make such events illegal, adding the videos depicted ""a risk to the stability of our country"".
""It makes me really worried about the state of our society, everyone should be horrified by what they're seeing in those videos,"" she said. ""It's division, it's hatred. It's inciting violence, potentially it's incredibly serious.""
She said the IRGC had to be proscribed and ""they are aiding and abetting people who would commit terrorism on our soil"".
One of the people who says he is under threat is Vahid Beheshti, a British-Iranian journalist and human rights activist. He told the BBC police have warned him his life is at risk.
""Every day that I wake up, I think this is my last day,"" said Mr Beheshti, who has been holding a sit-in protest outside the Foreign Office for almost a year. He said in the past few weeks he had been approached and was told: ""I'm gonna cut your neck"".
Mr Beheshti said he believes the small group of people targeting him are IRGC agents, operating freely in the UK.
The government says it keeps the list of proscribed organisations under review, but it has a policy not to comment on whether a specific organisation is or is not being considered.
A spokesperson said: ""We have sanctioned more than 350 Iranian individuals and entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in its entirety.""
The Islamic Students Association of Britain told the BBC it is an independent group led by student volunteers with no affiliations to any government.
The association said it respects people from all backgrounds, faiths and communities and ""does not support or endorse anyone that does not share these values"". It added that ""all its activities are clearly lawful"".
The Al-Tawheed (TUCF) Charitable Trust, which runs the Kanoon Towhid centre, was repeatedly contacted for comment but did not respond.

T3QQ1FGMCW_RS8Q5O5GV7K1YUS,Elon Musk visits site of Auschwitz death camp,By Shiona McCallum & Chris Vallance,6 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68055368,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has visited the site of the Auschwitz death camp.
The visit comes after intense criticism of how X, formerly Twitter, tackles antisemitic posts and just weeks after Mr Musk apologised for endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory.
Prominent Jewish leaders called for Mr Musk to see for himself one of the most symbolic sites of the Holocaust.
Later he will address online antisemitism at a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association (EJA).
Nazi Germany murdered at least 1.1 million people in the Auschwitz death camp in occupied Poland during World War Two. Almost one million were Jews. The museum notes more than 200,000 were children and young people.
Mr Musk laid a wreath and participated in a memorial service, including lighting a candle, during a private visit to the site.
Photos showed him there with his son on his shoulders and standing next to Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.
As a result of the fall-out over Mr Musk's enthusiastic agreement with an antisemitic post, Apple, Disney and IBM paused ads on X.
In response, the entrepreneur has accused advertisers of attempting to ""blackmail"" him with money, and used expletive filled language to express his disdain for their actions.
The Tesla boss, who took over the platform in October 2022, faced accusations of antisemitism in November when he replied, ""You have said the actual truth"" to a post on X that made the false claim that Jewish communities push hatred against white people.
The White House immediately condemned his post, which drew anger online.
Mr Musk said the endorsement was a mistake, describing it as ""one of the most foolish"" things he had done on the platform.
Later in November Mr Musk joined Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a tour of the Kfar Aza kibbutz targeted by Hamas as part of the 7 October attacks in which 1,300 people were killed and about 240 taken back to Gaza as hostages.
Today, senior political figures from European countries and Mr Musk will meet in Krakow, Poland ""to discuss and find solutions to the astronomical rises in antisemitism affecting Europe,"" the EJA said.
""This troubling trend"" had been escalating since the war in Gaza, it said.
During a live discussion broadcast on X in September, EJA chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin invited Mr Musk to visit Auschwitz.
Rabbi Margolin said it would be ""a very strong statement"" and ""could contribute a lot to Holocaust awareness and the struggle to combat antisemitism"".
They were gassed, starved, worked to death and killed in medical experiments.
The Memorial and Museum Auschwitz-Birkenau has previously been critical of X.
In August, the museum criticised the platform after it had initially failed to remove a post denying the Holocaust, saying it did not break its rules.
The offensive post was a reply to one from the museum about a three-year-old Jewish girl murdered in the camp's gas chambers.
The post called her death a ""fairy tale"" and used antisemitic tropes.
According to a post on X by the museum, it had reported the offensive reply but received a response saying that after viewing the ""available information"" the platform had decided no rules had been broken.
That initial response to the museum's complaint, according to X, was down to a mistake during the first review - it was escalated and removed in a second review.
X's policies state that Holocaust denial is prohibited.
Shortly after publication of an article about the incident, a museum spokesperson told the BBC that moderation was vital in tackling antisemitism but there seemed to be ""a problem on X in the quality of moderating and responding to reports"".
But the Tesla boss has strongly defended his record in combating online hate.
In his discussion with Rabbi Margolin, Mr Musk said it was absurd that he was accused of antisemitism ""when all the evidence points the other direction and my entire life story is in fact pro-semitic.""
He previously threatened to file a suit against the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, over its claims that problematic and racist speech has soared on the site since his takeover.
X is also currently suing non-profit Media Matters after it accused the site of allowing antisemitic posts next to advertising. X's lawsuit alleges it used ""manipulated"" data in an attempt to ""destroy"" the platform.

T947VDLV3P_6XG3Q4QWDYB7DJK,Khan Younis: UN says 12 killed at Gaza shelter as fighting rages,By David Gritten & Lipika Pelham,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68078580,"At least 12 people were killed and 75 injured when a UN facility sheltering civilians was struck in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency says.
UNRWA said two shells hit its Khan Younis Training Centre during fighting in the city's western outskirts.
Its commissioner condemned the ""blatant disregard of basic rules of war"".
Israel's military said it had ruled out that the incident was the result of an air or artillery strike by its forces.
It added that it was reviewing Israeli operations nearby and examining the possibility that it was ""Hamas fire"".
Israeli troops have been battling Hamas fighters as they advance into western Khan Younis, a day after the military said it had completely encircled the city.
Clashes and bombardment around the city's two main hospitals have also left thousands of patients, staff and others unable to leave.
The conflict was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,300 people were killed and about 250 others taken hostage.
More than 25,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.
An estimated 1.7 million people - nearly three-quarters of the population - have also been displaced by the past 12 weeks of fighting and many of them are sheltering inside UN facilities or near them.
The Khan Younis Training Centre is one of the largest UNRWA shelters, with between 30,000 and 40,000 people said to be living inside its grounds.
UNRWA said the compound was clearly marked, that its co-ordinates had been shared with Israeli authorities, and that it and the civilians inside had to be protected under international law.
However, at least six displaced people were killed and many more injured when the training centre was struck on Monday during intense fighting in the surrounding area, according to the agency.
On Wednesday afternoon, UNRWA's Gaza director, Thomas White, said a building at the facility that was housing 800 people from northern Gaza was hit.
In an interview with the BBC from Rafah in the evening, he said the building was struck by ""two tank rounds"" and that at least nine people were killed.
On Thursday morning, Mr White issued a statement saying the building was ""hit by two shells and caught fire"". Twelve people had now been confirmed dead and 15 of the injured were in a critical condition, he added.
""A number of missions to assess the situation were denied. Yesterday evening, the UN finally managed to reach the affected areas to treat trauma patients, bring medical supplies and evacuate injured patients to Rafah.""
He added: ""The situation in Khan Younis underscores a consistent failure to uphold the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law: distinction, proportionality and precautions in carrying out attacks. This is unacceptable and abhorrent and must stop.""
In response to UNRWA's initial reports, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said: ""After an examination of our operational systems, the IDF has currently ruled out that this incident is a result of an aerial or artillery strike by the IDF.""
""A thorough review of the operations of the forces in the vicinity is under way,"" it added. ""The IDF is also examining the possibility that the strike was a result of Hamas fire.""
Vedant Patel of the US state department repeated Washington's calls for the protection of civilians in Gaza.
""We deplore today's attack on the UN's Khan Younis training centre,"" she said, and called it ""incredibly concerning"".
The IDF also said on Wednesday afternoon that its troops had ""launched a divisional manoeuvre on West Khan Younis"" that was targeting Hamas ""outposts, infrastructure, and command and control centres"".
""Dismantling Hamas' military framework in western Khan Yunis is the heart of the logic behind the operation.""
The IDF added that Hamas ""exploits the civilian population, exploits shelters and hospitals"" - something the group has denied.
Gaza's health ministry meanwhile accused the IDF of ""isolating hospitals in Khan Younis and carrying out massacres in the western area of the city"".
The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said the al-Amal Hospital, which it runs, and its local headquarters were under ""siege"" by Israeli forces, trapping patients, wounded people and an estimated 13,000 displaced people.
The organisation alleged that three displaced people were killed after being targeted at the entrance to the headquarters on Wednesday morning.
MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) warned on Tuesday night that its staff inside the nearby Nasser Medical Complex - the largest hospital still partly functioning in Gaza - had reported bombing and heavy gunfire nearby.
""They are currently unable to evacuate along with the thousands of people in the hospital, including 850 patients, due to roads to and from the building being either inaccessible or too dangerous.""
The IDF has issued evacuation orders for western parts of Khan Younis, including those where Nasser and al-Amal are located. The UN estimates there are about 88,000 residents and 425,000 displaced people in the area.
Mr White told the BBC that tens of thousands more people were now on the move, heading south to Rafah, on the border with Egypt, where as many as 1.4 million are already sheltering.
In another incident in Khan Younis on Tuesday, a cameraman for the UK's ITV News filmed a Palestinian civilian being shot dead on a main road about 1.7km (1 mile) south of the UNRWA shelter.
Five men are seen walking towards the combat zone holding a white flag, before there is a burst of gunfire and one of them falls to the ground. It was not clear who opened fire.
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was asked in the Parliament on Wednesday whether such pictures would prompt him to push for a ceasefire in Gaza.
He replied: ""No-one wants to see this conflict go on for a moment longer than is necessary and we do want to see an immediate and sustained humanitarian pause.""
Efforts involving several countries to try to reach a ceasefire are ongoing, with one plan said to include a month-long truce and phased release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.
But both Israel and Hamas appear to have rejected proposals, and hopes of any progress have been dampened.
Egypt's President, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, meanwhile accused Israel of deliberately holding up aid deliveries at the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing as ""a form of pressure on the Gaza Strip and its people over the conflict and the release of hostages"".
However, an Israeli defence ministry agency co-ordinating the deliveries with Egypt and the UN rejected the claim, insisting that ""there is no limit to the amount of aid that can enter Gaza"".

T9KYMGDXRN_ZU3S29RBGHISHM1,New Hampshire primary: How did Joe Biden win despite not being on the ballot?,By Phil McCausland,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68077090,"President Joe Biden has easily won New Hampshire's Democratic primary, even though he was not on the ballot.
Enough voters wrote his name on their ballot papers, saving him the embarrassment of losing to Dean Phillips, a Democratic congressman.
Mr Biden skipped the primary because New Hampshire refused to move its vote, as ordered to by the Democratic National Committee (DNC).
South Carolina is officially first to vote in the primary race, next month.
The DNC decided to pick South Carolina as the first state to vote, because it said the southern state's diverse population was more reflective of the country. Both New Hampshire and Iowa, where the first Republican contest was held, have a higher percentage of white people than the average US state.
New Hampshire argued it would not move its primary, because it was bound by its state constitution to be first.
The DNC then stripped the state of its 24 delegates and Mr Biden did not register as a candidate, nor did he campaign in the state. Voting in primaries decides the number of delegates that in turn select the party's nominee at the national convention in August.
As the stand-off between New Hampshire and the national party went on, Mr Biden's supporters in the state organised a campaign for voters to put his name on the ballot, known as a write-in.
With 94% of votes in on Wednesday, Mr Biden had won 53% of the vote, far ahead of Mr Phillips on 19%.
Marianne Williamson, 71, an author and motivational speaker, garnered 4% of the vote, according to partial returns.
With Mr Biden off the official ballot, Mr Phillips, a Minnesota congressman, sought to cut into his lead.
Despite losing to the president in a landslide, Mr Phillips vowed to continue his campaign.
""I'm just afraid that Democrats are sleepwalking into disaster,"" the 55-year-old told the BBC. ""We did it in 2016. It is unforgivable and shameful to do the same thing knowingly this year.""
A moderate, Mr Phillips came to office in 2019. As the heir to his stepfather's Phillips Distilling Company empire, which owns major schnapps and liquor brands, he is one of the wealthiest members of Congress. He spent more than $5m on ads in the state, according to ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Mr Biden spent $156,000."

TI1L1E2X5F_49P4HTST7WPQ3WW,Kaylin Gillis: Householder guilty of killing woman in driveway wrong turn,By Max Matza,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68077595,"A householder has been convicted of murder for shooting a 20-year-old woman as the car she was in took a wrong turn up his driveway in rural New York.
Kaylin Gillis was shot in the neck by Kevin Monahan, 66, on 15 April 2023.
Monahan's lawyers had argued the fatal shot was fired accidentally by a defective shotgun after he tripped on a nail on his porch and dropped it.
He was found guilty of second-degree murder, reckless endangerment and tampering with physical evidence.
Monahan could face life in prison when he is sentenced on 1 March.
The jury in Washington County, New York, took less than two hours to reach its decision on Tuesday.
Friends and family members of Ms Gillis cried and hugged in court as the verdict was delivered.

Watch: Witness speaks out about Kaylin Gillis driveway shooting
Ms Gillis was in one of a group of three vehicles that drove down Monahan's long, curving driveway on a Saturday night in the small town of Hebron, about 55 miles (88km) north-east of Albany.
The friends were in an area without mobile phone service and trying to find a party at a different address.
They had realised their mistake and were already turning back when Monahan emerged and fired twice from his 20-gauge shotgun.
He testified last week that he felt his life was threatened and that he fired a warning shot from his weapon.
But he said the second shot, which killed Ms Gillis as she rode in the passenger seat of an SUV driven by her boyfriend, was a misfire that came after he dropped the gun on his porch.
""I didn't mean to shoot the second shot,"" Monahan testified according to the Greenwich Time newspaper. ""The gun went off.""
During closing arguments on Tuesday, Assistant District Attorney Christian Morris told jurors that Monahan had ""acted out of anger"".
""He grabbed his shotgun and intended to make them leave as fast as possible and he didn't care if they were hurt or killed.""
Local police had previously said that he had ""not shown any remorse"" for the killing.
The victim's family said in a previous statement that she had been looking forward to starting college in Florida so she could become a marine biologist.
In a separate case that took place just days after Ms Gillis' death, a householder in the US state of Missouri was charged with shooting 16-year-old Ralph Yarl, who rang the wrong doorbell while picking up his younger brothers.

U53Q981UKY_GWK2SGXZI6OQH3Q,Tanzania: Kilimanjaro charity trekkers left stranded,By Sarah Easedale,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-68074513,"A group of charity trekkers say they were left stranded in Tanzania by trip organisers after they paid thousands of pounds.
Twenty-six hikers paid Eryri-based Aspire Adventures up to Â£3,500 each to scale Africa's highest mountain, Kilimanjaro.
But on Friday, as they arrived in Tanzania, they received an email to say no services would be provided.
Aspire Adventures has been contacted for comment.
Most of the group were raising money for Hope4, which helps Ukrainian refugees and orphans in Moldova.
Between them they had paid tens of thousands of pounds to Aspire Adventures, in Brynrefail, Gwynedd, to cover costs for accommodation, equipment and guides.
Jason Rawles, who owns Aspire Adventures, was supposed to be joining the group on the expedition on Friday morning.
But he sent an email instead as they started to arrive in Tanzania, telling them his company was no longer able to provide the services and assistance they had paid for.
The email, seen by BBC Wales, said the firm had been ""hit by a series of events outside of our control"".
Mr Rawles continued: ""I have tried everything, and I do mean everything.
""We have now just run out of options and cash flow is just one of many things that have happened all at the same time.""
Mr Rawles wrote he was ""desperately sorry"", adding: ""The reality is we cannot make payment for what is needed for your Kilimanjaro trip.""
Lea Turner, one of the trustees of the Hope4 Charity, was on her way to Africa to join the expedition when she saw the email.
She said she was ""in tears"" and felt ""responsible"" after leading the way on booking the trip.
But she added the group had all been ""determined"" to carry on regardless.
They managed to get $80,000 (Â£63,180) together to pay the bills, borrowing money from relatives and savings.
They have also set up an online fundraising page to help make the shortfall, with any surplus donations going to Hope4.
They are now three days into the mountain ascent.
An automated email response from Jason Rawles and Aspire Adventures says the company is taking a break until March.
It goes on to say that it is the company's ""intention"" to deliver any trips booked from April onwards, but adds: ""All social media channels are deactivated in the meantime.""
Aspire Adventures was founded by Jason Rawles in 2013, and organises expeditions to locations including Tanzania, Nepal and Mont Blanc in France.
North Wales Police said it had received correspondence from Hope4 and was reviewing that information.
""At this time, it would not be appropriate to comment any further,"" the force said.

UFQSMQAWZ8_ZCS792HENQOTZSM,Post Office investigator says cleared sub-postmaster was guilty,By Sam Gruet & Myranda Mowafi,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68009769,"A former Post Office investigator has said he still believes a branch manager, whose conviction was overturned after his death, stole money from his Post Office.
Raymond Grant told the Horizon IT inquiry on Wednesday, that he considered William Quarm to be guilty.
Mr Quarm pleaded guilty in 2010 to embezzling money, to try to avoid going to prison.
He died in 2012, aged 69, before his conviction was quashed.
His widow, Anne, told the BBC she was ""astonished"" that Mr Grant would say this, and that Mr Grant being compelled to attend the inquiry ""says it all about his attitude"".
Mrs Quarm previously told the BBC the threat of jail had been devastating. ""The fear in his eyes - I'll never forget it,"" she said.
Mr Quarm ran a Post Office branch in North Uist, Scotland. After his conviction he was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.
Speaking to the public inquiry, which is tasked with finding out how the UK's biggest miscarriage of justice took place, the ex-investigator eventually broke down in tears and apologised.
But earlier he told the inquiry he still believed Mr Quarm's conviction had been correct.
The former sub-postmaster, Mr Quarm had raised concerns about the ATM at his branch and possible errors in an interview with Robert Daily, another Post Office investigator in 2008.
Mr Quarm also said he was waiting for a bank loan to make good the Â£40,277.76 shortage found by auditors at his branch.
Mr Grant objected to the demands the inquiry was making on him, saying his ""time was limited"". He had submitted a ""minimum"" witness statement to the inquiry, that was only a little over two pages long.
He blamed this on working ""10 to 11-hour days"" at a Christian shelter. He said he was particularly busy in December with that paid work, and moving house.
""I was going home, walking my dog and at the same time, the home where I was living, I was asked to vacate it by December 31,"" he told the inquiry.
Mr Grant also complained he hadn't been paid for the time he had spent preparing to give evidence to the inquiry, adding he had been made to conduct research ""in my own personal time"" and had ""spent some time in my sick bed reading"" while preparing to give evidence.
Counsel to the inquiry, Jason Beer KC, asked the former investigator: ""When you made a witness statement, did you think that Mr Quarm continued to be guilty of the crime of embezzlement?""
Mr Grant replied: ""Yes I did.""
There were at times long pauses between questions as Mr Grant's answers came. When asked whether he still believed Mr Quarm was guilty he said: ""Yes I do.""
The counsel to the inquiry went on: ""Despite the verdict of the High Court of Judiciary in Scotland?
Mr Grant said: ""Yes.""
Asked whether that remained his view, the former investigator said: ""In my mind, I still think Mr Quarm had a role to play in the loss of the money.""
The Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh overturned Mr Quarm's conviction last year.
The long-running inquiry into the Post Office scandal is looking at prosecutions brought against sub-postmasters across the UK.
Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters and mistresses after a faulty computer system called Horizon made it look like money was missing.
The government has announced a new law to ""swiftly exonerate and compensate"" all those wrongly convicted.
At the end of his appearance at the inquiry Mr Grant interrupted the session to give a statement, and appeared very emotional.
He said the Post Office had ""deceived [him] and they have deceived an awful lot more people"", adding he was ""humbly sorry"".
""I just hope that people do learn from this and are more honest in the future,"" he told the inquiry.

V42JL2ZHV8_DD1AVZ4C31SLQMG,Israel-Gaza war: IDF says 24 soldiers killed in Gaza in one day,By Yolande Knell,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68065903,"The Israeli army says 24 of its soldiers were killed in Gaza on Monday - the deadliest day for its forces since their ground operation began.
That includes 21 reservists who died in an explosion likely caused by mines that Israeli forces had placed in two buildings to demolish them, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
The IDF later said rocket-propelled grenade fire triggered the explosion.
""A militant squad surprised the force with RPG fire,"" a spokesman said.
""The first rocket hit one of the buildings in which explosives had been laid out. The hit apparently led to the explosion that caused the collapse of the building and the building next to it,"" Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari added.
According to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, 195 Palestinians have been killed in the past day.
In an earlier briefing, Rear Admiral Hagari said the reservists were killed in central Gaza at around 16:00 (14:00 GMT) on Monday - close to the kibbutz of Kissufim on the Israeli side of the border.
They were involved in an operation to allow for residents of southern Israel to safely return to their homes after tens of thousands were evacuated after the Hamas attack on 7 October.
The first funerals for those killed in the explosion have been held at Mount Herzl in a rainy Jerusalem.
Many of the mourners wore military uniforms and the scene was full of blue and white Israeli flags.
Israel's military had already confirmed that three officers were killed in a separate attack in southern Gaza on Monday.
The country's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that despite its suffering, his country would push on with its offensive until it had ""absolute victory.""
Elsewhere in Gaza, there has been fierce fighting by three hospitals in Khan Younis in the south, which is crowded with displaced people.
The IDF announced it has completely encircled the city, which has been a main focus of its ground offensive targeting Hamas.
Israel believes that the group's leaders may be hiding there and that it may also be where some Israeli hostages are being held.
According to the IDF, dozens of local gunmen were killed in its operation and its forces found rockets in rocket-launchers ready to fire, as well as tunnel shafts and a large number of weapons.
The Palestinians said that women and children have been killed in the latest fighting in the city.
They added that Israeli blockades and the storming of hospitals since Monday had left the wounded and dead beyond the reach of rescuers.
The dead were being buried inside the grounds of Nasser hospital because it has been unsafe to leave in order to reach the cemetery.
It is said that Israeli forces stormed another hospital, Al-Khair - which is in the al-Mawasi area to the west - and arrested staff.
Israel launched the war with the declared aim of destroying Hamas after waves of its gunmen killed 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took about 250 others hostage in the unprecedented attack.
According to the IDF website, 217 soldiers have been killed since the beginning of Israel's ground invasion on 27 October out of a total of 552 killed since 7 October.
At least 25,490 people - mainly women and children - have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.

The company has said it would like deliveries from Monday to Friday only.
But Downing Street said the government ""would not countenance"" such a move, as a review by regulator Ofcom is looking into the future of the postal service.
""The PM's strong view is that Saturday deliveries provide flexibility and convenience,"" said Rishi Sunak's spokesperson on Monday.
""They are important for businesses and particularly publishers. The Prime Minister would not countenance seeing Saturday deliveries scrapped.""
In response, Royal Mail said it was ""simply not sustainable to maintain a delivery network built for 20 billion letters when we are now only delivering seven billion"".
""We have been consistent in saying the need for reform is urgent to ensure a modern and sustainable universal service,"" it added.
Ofcom, which regulates the postal industry, is set to publish a document outlining options on how Royal Mail can ""evolve to more closely meet consumer needs"".
The regulator has not commented on what the options will be.
Royal Mail posted a Â£319m loss for the first half of the current financial year and the business, which is owned by shareholders, has been calling for urgent reform since 2020.
It has said previously that it would like to go from delivering six days a week to five, from Monday to Friday only.
Ofcom has said that while it will publish options for how the postal service might need to change, it would ""ultimately be for the UK government and Parliament to determine whether any changes are needed to the minimum requirements of the universal service"".
The legal basis for the universal service is the Postal Services Act 2011."
VJBBS6CXPW_KNLBJ110EK40205,HS2: Mayors to meet minister about alternatives,By Katy Austin & Sam Gruet,3 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68087768,"New plans for a privately funded alternative to HS2's now-scrapped Birmingham to Manchester section will be presented to the transport secretary next week.
Birmingham's mayor Andy Street told the BBC that he and Manchester mayor Andy Burnham will meet with Mark Harper to discuss bringing in the private sector.
Mr Street said the plan could involve a dedicated line between the cities.
But he said it was ""highly unlikely"" to be exactly the same as HS2.
In October, the Prime Minister announced the parts of high speed rail line linking the West Midlands to Manchester, and to the East Midlands, would be cancelled.
Rishi Sunak also said HS2's key new station at Euston would only be built if private investment was secured.
Speaking to the BBC at the official launch of construction at HS2's Birmingham Curzon Street station, the West Midlands mayor said the proposed alternative route would run between where HS2 ends in Handsacre, north of Birmingham, and south Stockport, where the Northern Powerhouse Rail begins.
Northern Powerhouse Rail is a rail project which plans to speed up links between Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds.
HS2 trains are currently expected to continue north to Manchester after Handsacre on existing conventional tracks.
Mr Street said options being considered were ""maybe a dedicated line, maybe upgrades to the existing line"". The aim would be to relieve the ""very very congested"" West Coast Mainline, improving connectivity and reliability.
But he said it would be unlikely to be exactly the same as HS2 as the project was so over budget.
Mr Street confirmed the research he had done into alternative rail improvements was being done with the prime minister's approval. He gave no further details of the plans and said they were in their early stages.
The mayors announced in December they had started a group involving private sector firms to look at options to tackle the rail route between the Midlands and the North.
The group, chaired by infrastructure expert Sir David Higgins, would look at ""the cost, capacity, and economic uplift of changes to the rail route, helping to identify packages of potential interventions and potential private sector funding models and solutions,"" a press release at the time said.

The transport secretary said yesterday he would ""listen with an open mind"" to what the mayors came up with. He cautioned that he was ""somewhat sceptical"" the private sector could deliver without any cost to the taxpayer.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We have already cancelled HS2 Phase 2 and we're getting on with delivering our Network North plan - this hasn't changed.""
Mr Harper recently lifted ""safeguarding"" of land along the now-cancelled HS2 route between the West Midlands and Crewe.
It is not the same as selling back land or property, but means the land is no longer earmarked for HS2.
Land near Handsacre will still be protected, which is where a connection will be built linking HS2 to the main line, on which HS2 trains will now travel on to Manchester using conventional tracks.

A jacket potato seller said he had sold almost 1,500 potatoes in a single day after global success on TikTok.
Social media posts from Ben Newman - aka Spudman - are so a-peeling, he has become an international mash hit, but he admits to being in the dark as to why.
In the meantime, he keeps posting and visitors keep arriving to his trailer in Tamworth town centre, Staffordshire. If you bake it, they will come.
Among those to taste his taters, he said, were customers from across the globe.
Mr Newman joined TikTok to promote his business in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. He has since been praised for using his prominent pomme de terre profile to promote the town and other local businesses.
He said of post-pandemic trading: âWe got back into the town centre and we needed to let people know where we were.
âThis new thing, TikTok, had come around and we started posting a few videos on there.â
He said he simply posted updates on what he did, livestreaming his work, with thousands of people eventually tuning in from around the world to watch.
'Spudman' Ben Newman has become an internet sensation with his viral TikTok videos
He said: âWe did a video with a couple who flew over from Malaysia, landed in Gatwick, hired a car and came straight over for a jacket potato.â
Mr Newman has set up a partnership with a wholesaler, and will be handing out free potatoes at his pitch on Saturday.
He said the gesture was funded through his social media activity, and he was pleased to have the chance to âgive something backâ after all the support he had been shown.

VR2ABBYP13_7DUP81TRDOA20P3,Gustav Klimt portrait found after almost 100 years,By Bethany Bell,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68102376,"A painting by the Austrian artist Gustav Klimt, that was believed lost for 100 years, has been found in Vienna.
Portrait of Fraulein Lieser once belonged to a Jewish family in Austria and was last seen in public in 1925.
Its fate after that is unclear but the family of the current owners have had the painting since the 1960s.
The im Kinsky auction house estimates the painting's value at more than $54 million (Â£42 million).
It called the rediscovery ""a sensation"".
""A painting of such rarity, artistic significance and value has not been available on the art market in Central Europe for decades,"" im Kinsky said in a statement.
The portrait will now be put up for auction on 24 April on behalf of the owners, and the legal successors of the Lieser family.
This is based on the Washington Principles, an international agreement to return Nazi-looted art to the descendants of the people they were taken from.
Before the auction, the painting will be presented at various international locations including the UK, Switzerland, Germany and Hong Kong, the auction house said.
The portrait once belonged to the Lieser family, who were wealthy Jewish industrialists in Vienna.
Ernst Ploil, co-Managing Director of Kinsky Auction House, said they had so far found no evidence that the work had been looted or stolen before or during World War Two.
""The painting is described as lost in all catalogues raisonnÃ©s (comprehensive lists of Klimt's work). In our circles, 'lost' means probably destroyed, probably burnt during the war, but in any case no longer in existence; it was not to be expected that it would ever reappear.
""We took an active approach and not only researched the Lieser family as potential restitution claimants, but we also approached potential representatives based on our experience from previous restitution proceedings.""
Klimt's art has fetched huge sums at auction in the past.
His Lady with a Fan piece sold for Â£85.3 million in June, making it the most valuable work of art ever sold at auction in Europe.
Klimt's final portrait sells for record Â£85.3m"

W1CIJZ5W9J_V8STO02RH5RCLK2,Kim Jong Un: Is North Korea's leader actually considering war?,By Frances Mao,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68052515,"North Korea experts - by nature, a cautious group who seek to avoid sowing panic - have been left reeling by two of their own.
Last week, the two eminent analysts dropped a bomb - so to speak - in stating their belief that the pariah state's leader is preparing for war.
Kim Jong Un has scrapped the bedrock goal of reconciling and re-uniting with South Korea, they said. Instead, he's presenting the North and South as two independent states at war with each other.
""We believe, that like his grandfather in 1950, Kim Jong Un has made a strategic decision to go to war,"" wrote Robert L Carlin, a former CIA analyst and Siegfried S Hecker, a nuclear scientist who's visited the North several times, in an article on specialist site 38 North.
Such a pronouncement set off alarm bells in Washington and Seoul, and a massive debate in North Korea watching circles.
Most analysts, however, disagree with the war theory; the BBC spoke to seven experts across Asia, Europe and North America -  none of whom supported the idea.
""Risking his entire regime on a potentially cataclysmic conflict is not on-brand for the North Koreans. They have proven to be ruthlessly Machiavellian,"" says Christopher Green, a Korea watcher from Crisis Group based in the Netherlands.
He and others note the North often acts out to bring Western powers to the table for dialogue; and there are political pressures at home too.
But they do agree that Mr Kim's increased bluster can't be ignored and his regime has grown more dangerous.
While most argue war may still be unlikely, some fear a more limited attack could yet be on the cards.
Close watchers of North Korea's Kim Jong Un are used to his nuclear threats, but some say the latest messages from Pyongyang are of a different nature.
Six days on from his New Year's Eve declaration that ""it is fait accompli that a war can break out anytime on the Korean peninsula"", his military blasted artillery across the border.
North Korea has also claimed a test of a new solid-fuelled missile, and its underwater attack drones, which can supposedly carry a nuclear weapon, since the start of January.
They follow on from two years of near-monthly missile launches and weapons development in blatant contravention of UN sanctions.
However, it was his announcement of formally abandoning the goal of unification that last week furrowed brows.
Reuniting with the South had always been a key - if increasingly unrealistic - part of the North's ideology since the inception of the state.
""This is a big deal. It fundamentally alters one of the regime's core ideological precepts,"" says Peter Ward, a senior researcher at Kookmin University in Seoul.
Kim Jong Un would now be tearing down that legacy - literally. Along with shutting diplomacy channels and cross-border radio broadcasts, he has announced he will demolish the Reunification Arch, a nine-storey monument on the outskirts of Pyongyang.
The arch, showing two women in traditional Korean dress reaching towards each other, had been built in 2001 to mark his father's and grandfather's efforts towards the goal of reunification.
Satellite pictures released by Planet Labs on Tuesday appear to show the arch may already have been destroyed, although there's no official confirmation of this.
Kim Il Sung had been the one who went to war in 1950, but he was also the one who set the idea that at some point North Koreans would be united with their southern kin again.
But his grandson has now chosen to define South Koreans as different people altogether - perhaps to justify them as a military target.
Mr Carlin and Dr Hecker, the analysts who predicted war, have interpreted all of this as signs that Kim Jong Un has settled on actually pursuing a fight.
But most analysts disagree. Seong-Hyon Lee, from the George HW Bush Foundation for US-China relations, points out the country is due to reopen to foreign tourists next month, and it has also sold its own shells to Russia for war - something it could ill afford if it were preparing for the battlefields.
The ultimate deterrent, however, is that were the North to launch an attack, the US and South Korea armies are just so much more advanced.
""A general war could kill a lot of people in the South, but it would be the end of Kim Jong Un and his regime,"" says Kookmin University's Mr Ward.
Instead, he and others warn the conditions are building for a smaller action.
""I'm much more concerned, in general, about a limited attack on South Koreaâ¦ an attack of that sort would take aim at South Korean territory or military forces but be limited in scope,"" says analyst Ankit Panda, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
This could even be in the form of shelling or attempted occupation of contested islands west of the Korean peninsula.
In 2010, the North struck the island of Yeonpyeong killing four South Korean soldiers, infuriating the South.
A similar provocation again could be done to test the South Korea's limits, analysts suggest, and to push the buttons of President Yoon Suk Yeol, a defiantly hawkish leader who has vowed to respond to a North Korean attack with punishment ""multiple times more severe"".
""North Korea may expect to draw out a disproportionate retaliatory attack from Seoul,"" says Mr Panda, something that might spark a broader escalation in fighting.
Others say war fears should also be put in the context of Kim's operating patterns.
""Looking at the history of North Korea, it has often used provocation to attract the attention of other countries when it wants to negotiate,"" says Seong-Hyon Lee.
The regime continues to suffer from economic sanctions and 2024 is an election year for its enemies - with the US presidential vote and South Korean legislature poll.
""This presents a good opportunity for Kim Jong Un to provoke,"" explains Dr Lee.
The current US administration under President Joe Biden - tied up with Ukraine and Gaza - hasn't paid North Korea much heed and Pyongyang has also typically had most engagement with Republican administrations.
Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump famously had a bromance in 2019 before the denuclearisation talks soured - and the North Korean leader may be waiting for the former US president to return to the White House, where he might weaken the alliance with South Korea and be open to dialogue again.
North Korea's closer friendship with Russia and continued economic support from China in the past year may have also boosted its audacity, analysts suggest. It's received technical help from Russia to achieve a long-term goal of launching its spy satellites and the two states had several high-profile meetings including a leaders summit last year.
""Much of what we're seeing is a result of broader North Korean confidence in its own capabilities and its geopolitical position given Russian, and to a lesser degree, Chinese support,"" says Mr Panda.
And others say Kim Jong Un's behaviour is all aimed at stabilising his own regime.
""This appears to be an ideological adjustment for regime survival,"" argues Professor Leif-Eric Easley from Ewha University in Seoul. ""North Koreans are increasingly aware of their Communist country's failings compared to the South.""
He suggests a policy focused on defining the enemy is intended to justify Mr Kim's missile spending during a difficult time. There are reports of starvation across the country.
Presenting the South as the enemy also makes it easier to resolve ""cognitive dissonance at the heart"" of the North's view on South Korea, points out Mr Ward.
""Previously it was an indelibly evil state that was supposed to be the object of unification with a hopelessly corrupting culture that should not be consumed under any circumstances but with people who need to be liberated from their evil government,"" says Mr Ward.
""Now the country and its culture can just be branded evil and that justifies the continued crackdown on South Korean culture.""
The BBC last week published rare footage showing two North Korean teenagers sentenced to 12 years hard labour for watching K-dramas.
""He doesn't actually want a war - a huge gamble where he would have nothing to gain and everything to lose"", says Sokeel Park, from Liberty in North Korea, an NGO helping North Korean refugees.
His threats are instead aimed at cementing his new North and South policy, designed ultimately to shore up his power at home, he says.
While it's important for South Korea, the US and allies to prepare for the worst-case scenario, it is also worth a thorough examination of the internal situation in North Korea and the wider geopolitics, analysts say.
At the end of the day, the best way to find out what the North's leader is thinking is to engage with him, argues Dr Lee.
""The international community does not see the US talking to Kim Jong Un as surrendering to Kim Jong Un's threats. It is seen as a necessary means to achieve a goal,"" he says.
""If necessary, one should consider meeting with the leader of an enemy nation to reduce misjudgements and prevent war.""

W37EMSO48S_LQO6JXM1VA9H067,Canada's use of emergency powers 'unjustified' - judge,_,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68038172,"A federal judge has ruled that Canada's use of emergency powers to end the anti-government Freedom Convoy protests two years ago was ""unreasonable"" and unjustified.
In a decision on Tuesday, Judge Richard Mosley also said it violated Canada's rights charter.
The federal government said it will appeal the decision.
The Emergencies Act bestows the government with added powers in times of crisis.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked it on 14 February 2022, three weeks into protests that gridlocked the capital.
Dubbed the ""Freedom Convoy"", the protest against the government's Covid-19 vaccine mandate gained international attention as hundreds of demonstrators settled in for weeks around Ottawa's Parliament Hill, many in trucks.
Shorter protests and blockades also cropped up at various border points across the country.
The emergency powers allowed the government to impose bans on public assembly in some areas and to prohibit travel to protest zones, including by foreign nationals, among other measures.
In Tuesday's decision, Judge Mosely wrote: ""I have concluded that the decision to issue the proclamation does not bear the hallmarks of reasonableness - justification, transparency and intelligibility - and was not justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that were required to be taken into consideration.""
The court case was brought by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Constitution Foundation.
They had argued that the protests did not meet the ""high legal threshold"" needed to invoke the act, which was being used for the first time since it became law in 1988.
Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland defended the government's actions on Tuesday, arguing that the country at the time faced a threat to its national and economic security and it was a ""option of the last resort"".
""We acted to secure and protect Canada and to secure and protect the national interests,"" she told reporters in Montreal.
""It was not an easy time, these were not easy decisions.""
Last year, a federal inquiry into the use of the act found that Canada's government had met the ""high threshold"" for its use.
Justice Paul Rouleau, who led that probe, called the decision a ""drastic move"" but not a ""dictatorial one"".
""Lawful protest descended into lawlessness, culminating in a national emergency,"" Mr Rouleau wrote in his Public Order Emergency Commission report, issued in February 2023.

W66P6QQK3M_SLK7KNP21GWEBYO,UK halts trade negotiations with Canada over hormones in beef ban,By Paul Seddon & Kate Whannel,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68098177,"Negotiations between the UK and Canada on a post-Brexit trade deal have broken down after nearly two years, following a row over beef and cheese.
Canada has been pushing for the UK to relax a ban on hormone-treated beef, which its producers say in effect shuts them out of the British market.
The UK have concerns about 245% import taxes Canada put at the start of the year on British cheese.
The pause in talks mean British car firms could also face higher tariffs.
It will also mean the UK's trading terms with Canada will now be worse than when it was part of the EU's deal with the country.
Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales, said she was glad the UK government had not ""given way"" on hormone-treated beef.
But the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) described the news as unwelcome.
Downing Street said the government would ""only negotiate deals that deliver for the British people"", and reserved the right to ""pause negotiations where progress is not being made"".
But a spokesperson added: ""We're open to restarting talks with Canada in the future.""
No 10 dismissed a suggestion that Brexit had left the UK worse off in terms of international trade, saying it was a ""benefit of our independent trading status that we are able to insist on the detail of each and every deal to ensure that it works specifically in the UK's interests"".
Trade between the two countries currently takes place under the terms of a deal the UK rolled over from its time as an EU member.
A time-limited agreement allowed the UK to continue to sell cars and cheese without high import taxes. But talks about extending these as part of a new deal have now broken down.
The arrangements for cheese ended on 31st December 2023 leading to taxes of up to 245% on British imports, while the car deal is due to expire in April.
This is the first time the UK has formally suspended talks with a trade partner since formally leaving the EU trading regime in 2021.
Talks between the two countries on reaching a bespoke agreement had been taking place since March 2022.
A spokeswoman for Canada's trade minister Mary Ng said she was ""disappointed"" at the pause in talks, and had communicated this to UK Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch.
""Their decision to continue to maintain market access barriers for our agriculture industry and unwillingness to reach a mutual agreement has only stalled negotiations,"" the spokeswoman added.
""The UK is a long-standing trading partner and I am confident that we can negotiate an agreement that is win-win for Canada and for the UK.
""But let me be clear - we will not negotiate an agreement that is not good for Canadians - and not good for our Canadian businesses, farmers and workers"".
Total goods trade between the two countries was worth Â£19.2bn in 2020, according to the UK government, with UK imports from Canada worth Â£7.3bn and UK exports to Canada worth Â£11.8bn.
Ms Batters said the UK's decision would be a ""relief for farmers"".
She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was pleased the ""government has stuck to its line and not given way"".
""We have already damaged our economy and agricultural sector by fully liberalising on trade deals with Australia and New Zealand. We had to take a strong line on this.""
However, William Bain, trade policy head at the BCC, said: ""For our dairy exporters and parts of our manufacturing industry the loss of key trade preferences puts them in a worse position than before 2020.
""Government must help these sectors through difficult times and open up new markets for our goods and services.""
Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the SMMT, said the breakdown in talks sent ""a signal that the UK's world-class automotive products are not welcome in Canada"".
""If UK car exports can't use EU parts and components to avoid additional duties it creates a risk that tariffs, potentially charged on top of luxury goods taxes, could be reintroduced,"" he added.
The Canadian Cattle Association said it backed its government's ""hard-line approach"" on beef rules, adding that the UK had ""shown no indication that it is prepared to fully accept Canada's food safety system which is widely recognized as one of the finest in the world"".
Labour's shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: ""This is very concerning news and another significant failure from the Conservatives to honour their promises.
""Rather than strengthening our trading position post-Brexit these failures have left us in a weaker position, particularly for the automotive sector.""
SNP international trade spokesperson Richard Thomson said: ""Westminster's Brexit has damaged the UK's potential for global trade and has dragged Scotland's economy down with it.""
Former Environment Secretary George Eustice told the BBC the UK was ""absolutely right to suspend negotiations"", and that Canada should ""accept the need to comply with British food standards"".
Mr Eustice, who was fiercely critical of the UK-Australia trade deal, said the government had to ensure that ""any access granted for hormone free beef from Canada is matched with access for UK dairy into the Canadian market"".
Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle expressed frustration that the halting of the talks was announced to the media before MPs.
""I will say it is amazing how quickly the government come to give good news... I always believe this House should hear it first,"" he said.

WRYH7VB4SA_B91243LRT85OMK3,Leeds City Council leader says extra money 'too little too late',_,4 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-68088387,"The leader of Leeds City Council has described the government's extra funding for local authorities as ""too little, too late"".
Communities Secretary Michael Gove announced a Â£600m package on Wednesday, in the wake of recent warnings of future bankruptcies.
Leeds Council is facing a Â£65m deficit, and is looking at cutting 750 jobs.
Mr Gove said the extra money would allow councils ""to continue to provide vital services for their communities"".
Local authorities would share Â£500m to help fund children's and adult social care, Mr Gove added.
James Lewis, said: ""Any extra funding for council services that everybody in Leeds relies on is to be welcomed, but this does feel like too little, too late.""
Mr Lewis, who represents the Labour Party, said he expected the authority to receive between Â£6m and Â£7m as part of the extra funding announced by Mr Gove.
""We have been desperately trying to balance the budget for next year,"" he added.
""We have seen hundreds of millions of pounds a year taken away from all council services by the government since austerity was imposed on us in 2010.
""That's added up over the years.""
Meanwhile, in Bradford, the fellow Labour-controlled council is predicted to have an overspend of Â£73m for the current financial year and last month called for urgent government support.
Leader Susan Hinchcliffe told a recent council meeting 87% of this year's total budget was spent on essential children's and adult services
She said she welcomed the extra funding, which she said ""shows the government acknowledges there is a structural shortfall in council funding nationally"".
However, she added: ""The Bradford Children and Families Trust alone has an in-year budget pressure of nearly Â£50 million and next year is predicting this will be Â£42 million.
""We therefore need to wait to see how much of the Â£500m announced nationally today will be coming to Bradford before we can see how much this helps our financial position.""
In a written statement, Mr Gove said local authorities would have to ""produce productivity plans setting out how they will improve service performance and reduce wasteful expenditure to ensure every area is making best use of taxpayers' money"".

WWNU9Z1ZNV_TDMMXPSGSNXAGAD,Myanmar's army is losing - and facing fire from a militant monk,By Jonathan Head,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68038513,"Last Tuesday, a noisy crowd of several hundred people stood in the small main square of Pyin Oo Lwin, a popular Myanmar hill town, to hear a bespectacled monk make a startling suggestion.
Min Aung Hlaing, the country's military ruler, should step aside, he said, and let his deputy General Soe Win take over.
The man who led the 2021 coup against the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, provoking a catastrophic civil war, has faced plenty of international censure, and is loathed by much of Myanmar's population.
This though was criticism from an unusual quarter. The monk, Pauk Ko Taw, is part of an ultra-nationalist fringe of the Buddhist clergy, which has until now been staunchly behind the military junta.
But a series of crushing defeats suffered by the army at the hands of ethnic insurgents in recent weeks has prompted Min Aung Hlaing's one-time cheerleaders to reconsider.
""Look at Soe Win's face,"" Pauk Ko Taw said to the crowd. ""That's the face of a real soldier. Min Aung Hlaing is not coping. He should move to a civilian role.""
It is not clear what kind of backing Pauk Ko Taw has in the armed forces. But his comments echo those made by other junta supporters, who are increasingly frustrated by the seeming inability of Myanmar's military leaders to turn the tide against their opponents. Pauk Ko Taw declined to be interviewed by BBC Burmese.
That he chose to give his speech in Pyin Oo Lwin will have added weight to it. The one-time British colonial hill-station is now home to the prestigious Defence Services Academy, where the army's top brass are trained. They could hardly miss the thinly-veiled warning: that they are running out of friends.
The nexus between the military and monkhood is nothing new.
Burmese monks have a long tradition of political, often anti-authority activism, from the anti-colonial movements of the 1930s to uprisings against military rule in 1988 and 2007. Many opposed the 2021 coup, some abandoning their robes to take up arms against the junta.
But some have worked with the generals, sharing with them a belief that both Buddhism and Burmese culture need defending from outside influences.
Following violent clashes between local Buddhists and Muslim Rohingyas in Rakhine State in 2012, one militant monk, Wirathu, helped set up a movement known as Ma Ba Tha, or the Association for Protection of Race and Religion.
It encouraged a boycott of Muslim-owned businesses, claiming that Burmese Buddhism was in danger of being wiped out by Muslims. But they make up just 8% of the Myanmar population. The movement was officially disbanded in 2017, but has continued to enjoy military support.
Wirathu, who had earlier been jailed for inciting racial conflict, was jailed once again in 2020. But less than a year later he was freed by the military - and Min Aung Hlaing showered him with honours and cash.
Min Aung Hlaing's coup in February 2021 provoked a huge public backlash, with massive rallies demanding a return to democratic rule, which were brutally put down. The 67-year-old general has since sought to bolster his legitimacy by presenting himself as a champion of Buddhism.
State media puts out a continuous stream of reports showing the diminutive dictator lavishing gifts on temples, and as a pallbearer at the funerals of senior abbots.
He has also been seen laying the foundation stone of the world's largest seated Buddha statue in the capital Nay Pyi Taw, funded by his military administration.
Myanmar's top religious body, the governing Buddhist council or State Sangha, has said little publicly about the coup. Some of its members are believed to have quietly urged restraint on the generals. But one senior monk in the Sangha, Sitagu Sayadaw, has openly supported the military, and even travelled with Min Aung Hlaing on an arms-buying trip to Russia.
Other monks have gone even further. One of Wirathu's followers, Wathawa, has been helping set up armed militia groups in his home state of Sagaing, to challenge the volunteer People's Defence Forces, which have sprung up all over the state to fight the junta.
Photos posted on social media carry the jarring image of saffron-robed monks being shown how to fire rifles.
The militias - named Pyusawhti after a mythological Burmese king - have been accused of forcibly recruiting local men, and of multiple atrocities against civilians. But they have taken root only in the small number of communities where the military's own party is traditionally strong. They also appear to have been ineffective in countering the now extensive and organised opposition to military rule.
One man contacted by the BBC in the area where Wathawa has been mobilising since early 2022 said he had only been able to recruit a maximum of 10-15 men in each village, and then only by threatening to burn down their homes.
He said many of the recruits had run away, and were being helped by other villagers to hide from Wathawa and his gun-toting monks.
Now the shambolic performance of the army in its recent battles with ethnic armed groups is sowing doubts in the minds of its supporters.
One prominent blogger recently called Min Aung Hlaing ""incompetent"", saying that under him the country had experienced loss and shame of historic proportions, for which he should pay the price and step down.
He was referring to the huge swathes of territory in northern Shan State taken by insurgents from the Brotherhood Alliance, three ethnic armies which now control much of the border with China.
They launched their operation in October last year, culminating in the surrender of thousands of soldiers, and all their equipment. The bloody two-year stalemate, between the well-equipped armed forces and the hundreds of volunteer groups which had risen up and joined the ethnic insurgents to fight the junta, appeared to have been broken.
The army has continued to retreat in the first weeks of this year. On the other side of the country near the Bangladesh border, the Arakan Army, one of the three groups in the alliance, has taken over several military bases, giving it control of large areas of Chin and Rakhine States.
It has posted videos showing bedraggled troops in tatty uniforms being led away handcuffed with cable ties, and huge caches of captured weapons and ammunition.
Unable to secure the roads from ambush, the military is relying on its limited number of helicopters to re-supply surrounded bases, and on air strikes to defend them, causing extensive civilian casualties. Insurgents in Kachin State say they have shot down one helicopter and one combat jet this month.
Some of the capitulating soldiers have turned out to be mixed units with little combat experience. The fact that many were also living in these bases with their families suggests they were unprepared to fight.
Hundreds chose to flee over the border to India; thousands have surrendered without a fight. Six generals defeated in Shan State were pictured afterwards drinking toasts with their captors, and looking more relieved than humiliated. After being handed back to the army three of them were sentenced to death, and the other three given life sentences, presumably in the hope of deterring others from giving up.
Such reverses are unprecedented in the 75-year-long history of the Myanmar military's campaigns against insurgents. Morale in the ranks has crashed. Recruitment in these circumstances is proving difficult.
So should Myanmar's coup leader be worried about these disaffected voices?
Pauk Ko Taw's bold criticism from the stage last week appears to have struck a nerve. Afterwards he was detained by soldiers and questioned, but quickly released, suggesting he does have some powerful backing. While his rally was reported in state media, his comments about Min Aung Hlaing were not.
Gen Soe Win, the man Pauk Ko Taw was urging to take over command of the army, is reported to be unhappy about the poor performance of his troops.
But he has shown no signs yet that he is prepared to usurp his boss's role. For the moment that seems unlikely to change.
Min Aung Hlaing has also proved adept at promoting and then sidelining potential rivals. Last September the general once thought to be his most likely successor, Moe Myint Tun, was suddenly arrested and later sentenced to life in prison for corruption.
For all of the dreams of the junta's most ardent fans - of a knight in shining armour coming to restore morale in the ranks - there is no successor in view.
Even in the wake of shocking battlefield defeats, Min Aung Hlaing has continued to preside over official functions, more in the fashion of a monarch than a military commander.
Whether this is down to his confidence, or his isolation from reality, is not clear. But the military cannot afford more losses on the scale of the past three months.
The collapse of the junta's forces in either Lashio, the main town in northern Shan State which is now surrounded; in Rakhine State in the west; or in Karenni State on the border with Thailand, where insurgents are close to taking the state capital Loikaw, might lead to a much wider breakdown in military morale - and the eventual implosion of the regime.

WWTB31MQ1Z_IQHLXV6PBJE22X6,SK-II skincare sales hurt by anti-Japan sentiment in China,By Mariko Oi,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68077984,"Procter & Gamble has said sales of high-end SK-II skincare brand fell 34% between October and December.
In addition to China's slow recovery, the firm's executives blamed anti-Japanese sentiment.
Last year, Japan started releasing treated radioactive water from its Fukushima nuclear power plant which was hit by a huge tsunami in 2011.
China opposed the move and banned all seafood imports from Japan, despite the UN's assurance of its safety.
Scientists also largely agree that the environmental impact of the treated water will be negligible but as disinformation fuelled fear and suspicion in China, consumers boycotted Japanese brands, including P&G's SK-II.
Rocks were also thrown at Japanese schools and hundreds of hostile phone calls were also made to businesses in Fukushima.
But P&G executives said SK-II is already seeing sales turn around in recent months.
""Our consumer research indicates SK-II brand sentiment is improving, and we expect to see sequential improvement in the back half,"" the company's chief financial officer, Andre Schulten, was quoted as saying on the company's earnings conference call.
This is not the first time SK-II or Japanese brands face a boycott in China.
In 2012, a wave of anti-Japanese protests across China over a territorial dispute led to a halt in production at Japanese carmakers, Toyota, Honda and Nissan, whose showrooms were attacked.
Other Japanese companies affected included the electronics company Sony, fast fashion brand Uniqlo and the shopping chain stores Aeon.
The islands, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, are controlled by Japan but both China and Taiwan lay claim to them.
P&G's chief executive officer, Jon Moeller, said on the earnings call that previous tensions have also hurt SK-II's sales, but the brand always bounced back.
The company's overall earnings were mixed as the firm cut its annual profit forecast due to a one-off charge related to its Gillette business.
But demand for the company's daily-use products, mainly in the grooming and home-care segments, remained strong despite high prices.

Watch: Jennifer Crumbley emotional as involuntary manslaughter trial begins
A mother who is the first US parent ever to go on trial for failing to stop her son from carrying out a deadly school shooting has sobbed in court as she saw CCTV of the attack.
Jennifer Crumbley's lawyer said the prosecution was intended to ""send a message to gun owners"".
Mrs Crumbley, 45, denies a charge of involuntary manslaughter.
Her son is serving life in prison for killing four classmates at Oxford High School in Michigan in 2021.
Mrs Crumbley's husband, James, is facing a separate trial on the same charges, which are punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
During the attacker's trial last year, his attorneys argued he was neglected by his parents and suffered from mental illness. But he later said his parents did not know about his plans and that he was solely responsible.
The trial opened on Thursday, and Mrs Crumbley wept as jurors were shown a video captured by a school security camera on the day of the shooting.
Prosecutor Karen McDonald objected that the defendant and her attorney were ""sobbing"" in violation of the judge's request for those in court to control their emotions during the trial.
""We were not sobbing or making a scene,"" said Mrs Crumbley's attorney, Shannon Smith, raising her voice. ""All my eye makeup is still on.""
The defendant's legal team says she is being unfairly blamed because she could not have predicted her son's actions.
At opening arguments, Ms Smith began her defence by quoting Taylor Swift's song Bad Blood, saying: ""Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes.""
She accused prosecutors of charging her client ""in an effort to make the community feel better, in an effort to make people feel like someone is being held responsible, in an effort to send a message to gun owners"".
""And none of those problems will be solved with charging Jennifer Crumbley with involuntary manslaughter.""
But lawyers for the state argued the case is not about bad parenting or gun rights.
Prosecutor Marc Keast told the jury: ""Jennifer Crumbley didn't pull the trigger that day, but she is responsible for those deaths.""
""We're not here to talk about good parenting or bad parenting,"" he added. ""It's not illegal to be a bad parent.""

August 2023: Victims recount horror, grief of Michigan school shooting
Prosecutors say that Mr and Mrs Crumbley gave their son the murder weapon as a Christmas gift, and did not help him get the mental health support he needed.
Her lawyers have blamed her husband, saying he was responsible for ensuring the gun was safely stored at home.
Both parents attempted to flee after being charged with manslaughter and were found hiding in the basement of a Detroit warehouse. Their lawyers say they left home for their safety and planned to turn themselves in later.
There were three witnesses on Thursday: the school principal, a teacher who survived the attack and an employee of the gun shop where the killer and his father shopped for his handgun.
On the day of the shooting, school officials found the boy, who was then 15, with disturbing drawings.
His parents were called to school to review the drawings, but left after concluding the meeting in only 11 minutes, Mr Keast said.
None of the adults checked the boy's backpack, where he stored the gun, and he was sent back to class.

They were among staff working at the Chinese-owned Macrolink copper mine in Ndola city, near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The miners were trapped underground after water entered the mine, which is still under construction.
The Chinese embassy in Zambia said it was mobilising rescue specialists.
Macrolink had temporarily suspended operations at the mine, Zambia's state broadcaster reported.
The incident comes barely a month after landslides buried dozens of other miners at Seseli Mine in Chingola, about 400 km (250 miles) north-west of the capital, Lusaka.
The fate of around 30 miners who went missing in the mudslide remains unknown after emergency services were unable to locate them.
Augustine Kasongo, a senior government official in Copperbelt province, said one person had so far been rescued from the mine that flooded on Monday, local media reported.
Rescue teams are trying to pump out water from the mine. Reports say the seven are trapped about 235m (771ft) below the surface.
The two Chinese trapped are the mine supervisor and a controller, while the five Zambians are said to be staff who were working at the shaft bottom of the mine, according to local media.
In a statement, the Chinese embassy said it was providing ""dewatering equipment and other necessary assistance, to complement the efforts of the Zambian authorities"".
Zambia is among the world's top copper producers. A significant number of its mines are run by foreigners.
Last week, President Hakainde Hichilema said new stringent laws would be introduced to regulate the industry and to stop Zambians from selling mining licences to foreigners.

XSR378F4VB_J0I2XT754X6ZU2Z,Mohammad Ghobadlou: Iran executes protester with mental health condition,By David Gritten,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68068233,"Iran has executed a man who was sentenced to death in connection with mass protests against the clerical establishment, the judiciary says.
Mohammad Ghobadlou, 23, was convicted of murder and ""corruption on Earth"" for allegedly running over a policeman with his car and killing him during a protest near Tehran in September 2022.
Rights groups said he faced an unfair trial marred by torture allegations.
Appeals to take into account his mental health condition were also rejected.
He is the ninth person to have been executed in relation to their involvement in the protests. At least four others are believed to be under sentence of death and 15 others are at risk of being handed the death penalty.
The nationwide unrest was triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly wearing her hijab ""improperly"".
Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands detained in a violent crackdown by security forces, which have portrayed the protests as ""riots"".
The judiciary-run Mizan news agency said Mohammad Ghobadlou's death penalty was implemented on Tuesday morning, after being upheld by the Supreme Court.
Videos posted on social media showed members of his family - reportedly including his mother and aunt - crying out in anguish at the gates of Qazalhasar prison in Karaj, moments after he was hanged.
According to BBC Persian, one woman can be heard telling prison guards: ""You killed my Mohammed. He took to the streets for all of the young people.""
On Monday night, Ghobadlou's mother had made an emotional, videotaped appeal to the family of the policeman he was convicted of killing, asking them not to enforce the punishment of ""qisas"", or retribution in kind.
She had previously urged the judiciary to take into consideration that her son had been diagnosed bipolar disorder as a teenager and had stopped taking his medication two months before the protests, diminishing his responsibility.
Ghobadlou's lawyer, Amir Raesian, wrote on X on Monday evening that the execution would be illegal and amount to ""murder"". He argued that the Supreme Court had in July struck down the death sentence because of his client's mental health condition.
However, Mizan reported that Mr Raesian's claim was not true, saying the Supreme Court had twice rejected such appeals.
Amnesty International said last year that Ghobadlou had received two death sentences after ""grossly unfair sham trials marred by torture-tainted 'confessions' and failure to order rigorous mental health assessments despite his mental disability"".
According to information obtained by the human rights group, he was denied access to a lawyer by investigators following his arrest and that he was subjected to repeated beatings and not given his bipolar medication in order to force his ""confession"".
It said he was also denied an independently chosen lawyer at his trial before the Revolutionary Court, which consisted of two brief sessions in October and November 2022. At his two Criminal Court trial sessions that December, the lawyer he appointed was denied access to material evidence.
Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights, denounced Ghobadlou's execution as ""an extrajudicial killing"".
""The Islamic Republic's leader Ali Khamenei and his judiciary must be held accountable for this crime,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
After learning on Monday that the execution was imminent, imprisoned human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi had called on Iranians to express their solidarity with Ghobadlou's family.
""The execution of Ghobadlou is a deliberate act of murder & a crime & in the face of murder, silence is betrayal,"" she wrote in a post on a Threads account run by relatives.
""Don't leave Mohammad's family alone. Let's stand with them tonight. Anyone in any way possible, shout: 'Do not execute!'""

Y3OHWO8MDT_L4EKVEICSO3MMKB,Kenneth Eugene Smith: Alabama carries out first nitrogen gas execution,_,2 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68085513,"Alabama has executed convicted murderer Kenneth Eugene Smith with nitrogen gas, the first time the method of capital punishment has been used globally.
A witness told the BBC that Smith thrashed violently on the gurney and the execution took around 25 minutes.
The UN condemned it on Friday as cruel but Alabama said the process had been carried out humanely.
Smith was convicted in 1989 of murdering a preacher's wife, Elizabeth Sennett, in a killing-for-hire.
In his final words, the 58-year-old said his death would mean Alabama had taken humanity ""a step backwards"".
Mike Sennett, the son of the victim, said the family wouldn't be celebrating but that Smith had paid his ""debt"".
""Nothing that happened here today is going to bring Mom back,"" he said, adding: ""We're glad this day is over"".
According to the Death Penalty Information Center, Smith is the first person to be put to death using pure nitrogen gas anywhere in the world.
The execution began at 19:53 local time (01:53 GMT) and he was pronounced dead at 20:25 (02:35 GMT).
Alabama and two other US states have approved the use of nitrogen hypoxia as an alternative method of execution because the drugs used in lethal injections have become more difficult to find, contributing to a fall in the use of the death penalty nationally.
""Tonight Alabama causes humanity to take a step backwards,"" Smith said, according to witnesses. ""Thank you for supporting me. Love all of you.""
After the gas began to flow into his mask, the inmate is said to have smiled, nodded toward his family and signed ""I love you"".
One of the five members of the media transported to Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore to witness the execution told the BBC it was unlike any other he'd witnessed in Alabama.
""I've been to four previous executions and I've never seen a condemned inmate thrash in the way that Kenneth Smith reacted to the nitrogen gas,"" Lee Hedgepeth told the BBC's Newsday programme.
""Kenny just began to gasp for air repeatedly and the execution took about 25 minutes total.""
Breathing nitrogen without oxygen causes cells in the body to break down and leads to death.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, who did not respond to a request to attend the execution, confirmed Smith's death in a statement.
""After more than 30 years and attempt after attempt to game the system, Mr Smith has answered for his horrendous crimes,"" she said.
""I pray that Elizabeth Sennett's family can receive closure after all these years dealing with that great loss.""
Attorney General Steve Marshall said it had proved to be ""an effective and humane method of execution"", refuting the ""dire predictions"" of activists and the media.
""Justice has been served,"" his statement added.
Alabama corrections Commissioner John Hamm said Smith's shaking on the gurney appeared to be involuntary movements.

Watch: How nitrogen became a form of execution in the US
""That was all expected and was in the side effects that we've seen or researched on nitrogen hypoxia,"" Mr Hamm said. ""Nothing was out of the ordinary from what we were expecting.""
Alabama said in an earlier court filing that it expected Smith to lose consciousness within seconds and die in a matter of minutes.
Smith was one of two men convicted of murdering Mrs Sennett in a $1,000 (Â£790) killing-for-hire in March 1988.
The 45-year-old was beaten with a fireplace implement and stabbed in the chest and neck, and her death was staged to look like a home invasion and burglary.
Her husband Charles Sennett, a debt-ridden preacher, had orchestrated the scheme to collect insurance money. He killed himself as investigators closed in.
Smith's fellow hitman, John Forrest Parker, was executed in 2010.
At his trial Smith admitted to being present when the victim was killed, but said he did not take part in the attack.
The jury that convicted him had voted in favour of a life sentence but the judge overrruled them and imposed a capital punishment. The law has been changed since to prevent a judge intervening like that.
In a statement, Smith's legal team said it was ""deeply saddened"" by his execution, noting that the jury in his case had voted to spare his life but a judge overrode that decision.
""Nothing can undo the tragic consequences of the actions for which he was convicted, including the pain of the Sennett family and friends,"" the attorneys said.
""Kenny's life, however, should be considered in its full context.""
Earlier on Thursday, the Alabama Department of Corrections shared details from the inmate's final 48 hours.

Alabama tried to execute Smith by lethal injection two years ago, but they were unable to find a vein before the state's death warrant expired.
On Thursday night, the Supreme Court denied him a last-minute reprieve. Three liberal justices dissented from the conservative-led majority's ruling.Â
""Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its 'guinea pig' to test a method of execution never tested before,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote. ""The world is watching.""
The nitrogen execution had been denounced by some medical professionals, who warned it could cause a range of catastrophic mishaps, ranging from violent convulsions to survival in a vegetative state.
Last week, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights urged a halt to the execution, saying that gassing Smith could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment under international human rights law.

Y4WD7NXVLK_U9X6GLRVWR9LYC8,Japan: Man sentenced to death for Kyoto anime fire which killed 36,By Frances Mao and Shaimaa Khalil,3 days ago,20240125,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68090388,"A Japanese man has been sentenced to death for an arson attack at a Kyoto animation studio in 2019 which killed 36 people and injured dozens more.
The incident, one of Japan's deadliest in recent decades, killed mostly young artists and shocked the anime world.
Shinji Aoba, 45, pleaded guilty to the attack but his lawyers had sought a lighter sentence on grounds of ""mental incompetence"".
Judges rejected this however, ruling that Aoba knew what he was doing.
""I have determined that the defendant was not mentally insane or weak at the time of the crime,"" Chief Judge Masuda said on Thursday at Kyoto District Court.
""The death of 36 people is extremely serious and tragic. The fear and pain of the deceased victims was indescribable,"" Japanese broadcaster NHK reported him saying.
Many of the animation staff - young artists - were killed after being trapped on the upper floors of the studio as the fire spread.
The attack was one of the deadliest cases in recent decades and sparked national mourning in Japan. The country's public and media have followed the case closely.
Prosecutors had demanded the death penalty for Aoba, saying he was motivated to attack the studio after believing his work had been stolen. He said Kyoto Animation - known as KyoAni-  had plagiarised a novel he entered into their contest.
In July 2019, he burst into the studio during a work day, splashing petrol on the ground floor and setting it alight while repeatedly shouting ""Drop dead"".
He later said during his guilty plea in September 2023 that he did not think so many people would die.
""I felt I had no other option but to do what I did,"" he said at the time.
""I feel tremendously sorry and the feeling includes a sense of guilt.""
Aoba himself suffered burns to over 90% of his body in the fire, and was only arrested after he had recovered from operations.
""The delusion that KyoAni Studio had plagiarised his work influenced his motivation,"" prosecutors had told the court.
But they said he was not controlled by such delusions and had full capacity and understanding of his actions.
On Thursday, the judge read out a lengthy reasoning with victim testimonies before announcing the verdict. More than half of the animation studio's 70-strong workforce was killed in the event, and another 32 injured.
""Some of them saw their colleagues engulfed in flames, and some of them are suffering from psychological effects, and they are tormented by feelings of guilt and remorse,"" said Judge Masuda.
Families of the victims were seen in the court room, with many visibly emotional as the judge read out the details of Aoba's crime, NHK reported.
The outlet reported that Aoba kept his head bowed as the judge read out the death penalty sentence.
Japan retains capital punishment for its most serious crimes, like multiple murders. Those convicted typically remain on death row for years, or even decades. The death penalty is conducted by hanging.
The KyoAni studio in Kyoto is a beloved institution, known for producing films and graphic novels that are well-regarded by fans as well as critics - including K-On! and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.

Watch: On board flight during mid-air blow out
Checks are to be carried out on a second Boeing aircraft model following the blowout of an unused door on one of its planes earlier this month.
The US Federal Aviation Administration grounded more than 170 of the 737 Max 9 fleet after a cabin panel broke away thousands of feet above the ground.
On Sunday, the agency said airlines should also inspect older 737-900ER models, which use the same door design.
The FAA described the move as an ""added layer of safety"".
It said there had been no reported issues with the 737-900ER, but that it uses the same style of panel to ""plug"" an unused door as the plane involved in the terrifying 5 January incident.
An Alaska Airlines flight en route to California from Portland, Oregon was forced to make an emergency landing after the panel came away, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the aircraft.
The incident prompted the FAA to ground all 737 Max 9s featuring that style of panel and sent Boeing's share price tumbling.
The agency is investigating the firm's manufacturing practices and production lines, including those linked to subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems, which provided the panel.
Earlier this week, the FAA said it had carried out inspections on 40 of the grounded planes but did not say when they would be able to fly again.
In a statement on Sunday, the agency said: ""The safety of the flying public, not speed, will determine the timeline for returning these aircraft to service.""
Boeing has said it will increase the quality of inspections in its manufacturing process in wake of the incident.
The 737-900ER models have carried out 11 million hours of operations without similar incident to the newer 737 Max 9s.
The FAA did not order the older model to be grounded while the visual inspections are carried out by operators.

Watch: Explosions and flashes near Yemen's capital
The US and UK have conducted a fresh series of joint air strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.
The Pentagon said Monday's strikes hit eight targets, including an underground storage site and Houthi missile and surveillance capability.
The Iran-backed Houthis have been targeting ships they say are linked to Israel and the West that travel through the important Red Sea trade route.
The US and UK said they were trying to protect the ""free flow of commerce"".
A joint statement issued by the Pentagon confirmed ""an additional round of proportionate and necessary strikes"" against the Houthis.
The statement added: ""Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the world's most critical waterways in the face of continued threats.""
On Tuesday the Pentagon said its assessment was that the strikes destroyed or degraded more than 25 missile launch and deployment facilities.
This is the eighth strike by the US against Houthi targets in Yemen. It is the second joint operation with the UK, after joint strikes were carried out on 11 January.
Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron told reporters the UK had sent a ""clear message"" and that it will ""continue to degrade"" the Houthis' ability to carry out attacks.
Asked whether the strikes could escalate tensions in the Middle East, Lord Cameron said it was the Houthis who were escalating the situation and he was ""confident"" the previous strikes had been effective.
He went on to say the Houthis' narrative that the strikes were related to the war between Israel and Hamas ""shouldn't be accepted"", and the UK wants to see a ""swift end to the conflict"" in Gaza.
Lord Cameron said the UK had called for an ""immediate humanitarian pause"" and that ""we want it to turn into permanent, sustainable ceasefire"". It is a plan he will put forward when visiting the region this week, he said.

Watch: We're sending Houthis clearest possible message - Cameron
The joint statement said the strikes were carried out with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, and the Netherlands.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will give a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon, addressing the UK's decision to conduct further strikes. Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer was not told about the strikes before they happened, but was seen arriving at the Cabinet Office this morning for a confidential briefing.
US fighter jets from the carrier USS Eisenhower were involved in Monday's strikes.
Four RAF Typhoons, supported by a pair of Voyager tankers, joined the US forces, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.
""Our aircraft used Paveway IV precision guided bombs to strike multiple targets at two military sites in the vicinity of Sanaa airfield. These locations were being used to enable the continued intolerable attacks against international shipping in the Red Sea,"" the MoD said.
""In line with UK standard practice, a very rigorous analysis was applied in planning the strikes to minimise any risk of civilian casualties, and as with the previous strikes, our aircraft bombed at night to mitigate yet further any such risks,"" it added.
Government minister Huw Merriman told Sky News the airstrikes would ""not just be a one-off"", if the Houthis continue to attack ships in the Red Sea.
UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps described the strikes as ""self defence"" against the Houthis' ""intolerable attacks"" on merchant shipping.
""Aimed at degrading Houthi capabilities this action will deal another blow to their limited stockpiles and ability to threaten global trade,"" he wrote on X.
Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said the party was ""concerned about the Houthis' attacks in the Red Sea"" and they ""support the case for limited strikes"", but that it was ""absolutely vital that Parliament has an opportunity to have its say, via a debate and a vote"".
Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported strikes in Yemen's Sanaa, Taiz and Bayda provinces, including the al-Dailami air base near the capital Sanaa.
Ten days after the first carefully calibrated joint air and missile strike by the US and UK, the Houthis remain defiant.
They have continued to launch a variety of projectiles at shipping passing Yemen's coastline, in one case mistakenly targeting a ship carrying Russian oil.
Under the newly named Operation Poseidon Archer, US-led strikes have now hit fresh targets, after previously carrying out a number of pre-emptive strikes on Houthi launch sites.
These, say the Pentagon, destroyed missiles just as they were being prepared for launch. Western intelligence recently estimated that at least 30% of Houthi missile stocks had been destroyed or degraded.
Yet the Houthis, who are supplied, trained and advised by Iran, are clearly bent on continuing their attacks on shipping they suspect of being linked to Israel, the US or the UK.
These have earned them much popularity at home, where many Yemenis have been chafing under their brutal rule.
They are also popular with many across the wider Arab world since the Houthis say they are supporting Hamas as part of the Iran-backed 'Axis of Resistance' against Israel.
It comes after US President Joe Biden and Mr Sunak spoke earlier on Monday.
In an official readout of their phone call, the White House said Mr Biden and Mr Sunak ""discussed ongoing Iranian-backed Houthi attacks against merchant and naval vessels transiting the Red Sea"".
They reiterated ""their commitment to freedom of navigation, international commerce, and defending mariners from illegal and unjustifiable attacks"", the White House said.
It added: ""The president and prime minister discussed the importance of increasing humanitarian aid and civilian protections for people in Gaza, and securing the release of hostages held by Hamas.""
The Houthis began attacking merchant vessels in November, saying they were responding to Israel's military ground operation in Gaza.
Since then, the group has launched dozens of attacks on commercial tankers passing through the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
In response, the US and UK launched a wave of air strikes against dozens of Houthi targets on 11 January.
Those strikes - also supported by Australia, Bahrain, the Netherlands and Canada - began after Houthi forces ignored an ultimatum to cease attacks in the region.

YB500KJR8J_4FDTAZOABLKLQ9R,Thailand: Reformist leader Pita overcomes first court hurdle,By Frances Mao & Jonathan Head,4 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68078182,"Thailand's reformist political champion will be re-instated as an MP after winning a trial his supporters say was aimed at ending his political career.
The Harvard-educated Pita Limjaroenrat and his Move Forward party won the most votes in a huge election win last year.
But he failed to take charge after being blocked by the unelected Senate.
The charismatic young leader was seen as a threat to the establishment for promising to reform harsh royal insult laws and to tackle military influence.
While negotiating to form a coalition government after his election victory, two court cases were lodged against him. His supporters saw this as part of a wider campaign by conservative political forces to oust him from politics and discredit his party's ideas.
On Wednesday he was acquitted in the first case against him, but he faces a potentially more serious legal challenge next week.
The Constitutional Court will rule again, this time on whether his plan to reform Thailand's harsh lese majeste law amounted to an attempt to ""overthrow the democratic regime of government with the king as the head of state"".
A verdict finding that Move Forward acted unconstitutionally in this way could lead to it being dissolved, and its leadership being banned from politics.
In 2019 the court dissolved Move Forward's previous incarnation Future Forward, after it too had done better than expected in an election. That verdict sparked off months of street protests and unprecedented public criticism of the monarchy.
On Wednesday Pita's supporters cheered outside the Constitutional Court  when they heard he had won his case, chanting ""PM Pita"".
""It was Pita himself who told us that we have to live with hope,""  Luksikarn Tangchotithanavid, 40, told the BBC.
""Our generation can read and understand the law. We know what is written and how it should be executed. According to the law, he should not be disqualified in this case.""
Mr Pita was acquitted of violating election law by owning shares in a media company while contesting last year's election.
He had been suspended as an MP last July over the allegations and banned from sitting in parliament, forcing him to give up leadership of his party.
His defence has been that he inherited the shares from his father, but that the company had not been operating for many years, long before he ran  for office. A majority of judges agreed with him in their ruling on Wednesday.
""Holding the shares did not violate the law. The court has ruled his MP status has not ended,"" Judge Punya Udchachon said.
Before the verdict, Mr Pita also told reporters he would keep fighting for the reforms his party had promised.
As well as amending the lese majeste law these include breaking up business monopolies and limiting  the military's influence in politics and business. This platform proved very popular in the 2023 election, giving Move Forward 151 of the 500 seats in parliament, more than any other party.
""No matter the result I will still be working for the people,"" he said on Wednesday before the verdict. ""[This court case] is only a detour. Regardless of the verdict we will continue fighting.""
Thailand under King Maha Vajiralongkorn has seen a significant increase in the use of lese majeste laws to silence political critics. More than 260 people have been charged under the law since November 2020.
Last week, a 30-year-old man was sentenced to 50 years in jail for comments that were ruled to have defamed the Thai monarchy. This was the most severe sentence ever handed down under the country's notorious lese majeste laws.

YEREZ2AMF0_XWVRDSO4ZF1IRRY,City of Derry Airport: Council express future funding concerns,By Joe Doran,7 days ago,20240122,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-68035700,"Derry City and Strabane District Council has warned that money from Stormont to help secure City of Derry Airport's future is unlikely this year.
The airport is owned by the council and it costs ratepayers Â£3.45m to help pay operational costs.
In a document obtained by BBC News NI, the council said it is facing an estimated Â£729,000 shortfall in airport funding for the next financial year.
The paper was presented to councillors in a closed meeting.
In a statement, managing director of the airport Steve Fraser said there has been positive engagement between the airport, elected representatives and government departments.
""In all cases, the economic and strategic importance of the airport for the north west region is recognised. We fully expect when ministers return to Stormont that the airport business case will be addressed,"" he added.
It is understood the behind-closed-doors meeting at council was to discuss financial challenges ahead of striking the district rate for 2024/25.
In the paper, council officials were told that the estimated amount needed for the airport in the next financial year was Â£3.75m.
""While these figures are estimated at this point, it is clear that council funding will only be sufficient to sustain the airport up to a maximum of January 2025,"" the paper said.
""This will become a critical financial consideration by Spring 2024.""
In 2021, the council submitted a business case to Stormont for Â£3m a year over a six-year period to help reduce the burden on ratepayers. The document said that an initial Â£3m was secured in 2022/23.
In October last year, the council wrote to the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) requesting further funding to help meet the airport's annual running costs.
In reply, the DfI's permanent secretary Dr Denis McMahon said it was unlikely to provide further funding for the airport this year because of the ongoing financial challenges at Stormont.
In a statement to BBC News NI on Friday, a spokesperson for the DfI said: ""The department confirmed to the council in December that funding would not be provided in 2023/24.
""The department also advised that the issue of funding for City Of Derry Airport is a cross cutting one that requires executive consideration.
""The most recent funding provided by the department in relation to the airport was Â£3m covering the period 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 under a ministerial direction.
""A ministerial direction was required as the accounting officer had concerns regarding the affordability, value for money and regularity of the expenditure.""
Meanwhile, BBC News NI has also learned that another Stormont department has still not decided if funding for daily flights between City of Derry Airport and London Heathrow will be renewed after March.
The route, which is operated by Loganair, is widely regarded as one of the most important air links at the council-owned airport, as it connects the north west of Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK.
It is jointly funded by the Department for the Economy (DfE) in Northern Ireland and the Department of Transport in London under what is known as a public service obligation (PSO).
A PSO is intended to support regional economic development.
A spokesperson for DfE told BBC News NI: ""At this time, the department does not know its budget beyond March 2024.
""It is therefore not possible to allocate funding for 2024/25 at this stage.
""The department is currently planning for the 2024/25 budget year and will be bidding for the Â£1.018m required for the Public Service Obligation.
""The department will endeavour to update all stakeholders as soon as it can.""
A UK government spokesperson said funding for airports in Northern Ireland is a devolved matter which rests with the Department for Infrastructure.
""The government supports restoring a locally elected, accountable and effective devolved government as soon as possible to address issues facing Northern Ireland.""
A council spokesperson said they are engaging with City of Derry Airport on a regular basis and with the relevant departments at the Northern Ireland Executive, the UK Government and Irish Government.
They said they regularly discuss current funding challenges and ""the urgent need for financial support required to retain the connectivity benefits [the airport] provides across the north west region"".
""Included in those discussions are requests for funding for the continuation of the PSO route from London beyond the existing two-year contract; a funding package from government over a six-year period towards the overall operating cost of the airport and also a commitment from North-South Ministerial Council to prioritise a Dublin PSO service.""
The council said it recognises the strategic importance of the airport to the city and region and is doing everything possible to secure the necessary funding.

YLIL2AUDKY_E6CCRCCV4EIKUT2,Police search for motive in Illinois mass killing,By Jaroslav Lukiv,5 days ago,20240123,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68065165,"Police are still searching for a motive after a man suspected of killing eight people in Joliet, Illinois, took his own life after a cross-country manhunt.
Romeo Nance, 23, died after authorities tracked him down more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) away in Texas.
Nance is suspected of killing eight people at multiple locations in Joliet.
Seven of the victims were in two houses on the same street. Police say Nance also shot two other people, one fatally.
Joliet Police Chief Bill Evans said on Tuesday that Nance had an extensive criminal history and was related to most of the seven people found dead in the two houses, which are across the street from each other.
But he said that the other two shootings were random and that authorities are still searching for a motive in what he called a ""very complicated and active investigation"".
""We can't get inside his head,"" Mr Evans said at a news conference. ""We just don't have any clue as to why he did what he did.""
Mr Evans said that five women were found in the homes along with two men.
Some of those victims have been identified by officials. They are Christine Esters, 38, Tamaeka Nance, 47, William Esters, 35, Joshua Nance, 31, and Alexandria Nance, 20.
The names of two other victims, teenage girls aged 14 and 16, have not been released.
Authorities believe Nance killed those seven people before carrying out two other shootings elsewhere in Joliet, a city of about 150,000 people some 40 miles (64km) south-west of Chicago.
One of the attacks resulted in the death of a 28-year-old Toyosi Bakare, who was shot in the head as he left his apartment to buy cigarettes, authorities said.
Police said Mr Bakare was originally from Nigeria and had been living in the US for the past three years. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he later died.
The other victim was an unnamed 42-year-old man shot in the leg on Sunday, resulting in non-life threatening injuries.
Video of the incident shows the victim exchanging words with the driver of a red Toyota Camry, which pulls away and returns before gunshots are heard.
Police said they were able to trace the licence plate number on the Camry, which led them to Nance and the two houses with other victims.
That discovery sparked a manhunt for the suspect, who authorities warned ""should be regarded as armed and dangerous"".
But by that time, Nance had left the area and had fled south, police said.
He was located by US Marshals near Natalia, Texas, just outside San Antonio and about 18 hours from Joliet by road, at approximately 20:30 local time on Monday (02:30 GMT Tuesday).
Police said they do not believe he had any relatives or connections to Texas.
""I've been a policeman 29 years and this is probably the worst crime scene I've ever been associated with,"" Mr Evans said during an earlier news conference in Joliet."
YS11F1QUR6_B4FIKYRD9VJ5S2C,"Norfolk is treasure capital for detectorists, says museum",By Katy Prickett,5 days ago,20240124,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-norfolk-68070163,"More treasure was discovered in Norfolk in 2022 than any other county, according to new figures.
Metal detectorists reported 95 finds in the county compared with 83 in Hampshire and 81 in Kent.
The British Museum, which runs the Portable Antiquity Scheme (PAS), said 2022 was a ""record-breaking"" year for reported finds.
Museum interim director Mark Jones thanked ""the metal-detecting community"" who recorded finds voluntarily.
Lincolnshire had the greatest number of finds overall - other than just items classed as treasure - with more than 5,101. Norfolk had 4,265 and Suffolk yielded 2,727.
Although the report covers 2022, the findings were revealed on Tuesday.
There are a number of reasons for Norfolk remaining at the top of the treasure list, according to the county's finds liaison officer Helen Geake.
""Norfolk was always a very rich county, especially in days when riches depend on agriculture,"" she said.
""It's also very big, not very urban and very heavily ploughed, so things lost can be found and things buried can be eroded up to the top soil and found.
""And the third is we've worked with metal detectorists for a very long time and have a big team, so if something is found in Norfolk, people here know what to do.""
A gold Roman ring, with a red gemstone carved with a figure of the goddess Diana, was among Norfolk's 2022 treasure finds, discovered in Sedgeford near King's Lynn.
The image is similar to one found on a pendant from the Thetford treasure hoard, suggesting it might have come from the same workshop.
As the Romans did give and receive wedding rings, Dr Geake said it could have been given as a love token.
The British Museum also announced some ""significant"" new finds made since 2022, including a late Bronze Age dress fastener.
The 3,000-year-old object was found in Staffordshire by detectorist Jonathan Needham and would have been used to fasten clothing.
Museum scientist Laura Perucchetti and curator Neil Wilkin examined the find and it is likely to be acquired by a museum.
Another extraordinary find was an Iron Age hoard of 26 Iron age gold coins, hidden inside a flint container.
It was discovered at East Garton in west Berkshire.
Pippa Pearce, senior conservator, said: ""Every coin is a miniature document.
""To be understood, it has to be read and the role of conservation is to make this possible, revealing the hidden detail from beneath the concretions and corrosion built up during burial.""
A third find announced by the museum was a carved rosary bead, dating to between 1450 and 1550, and unearthed in the City of London.
It measures 27mm (1in) high by 21mm (0.8in) wide and shows the face of a young woman on one side and a skull on the other.
Mr Jones said the finds recorded by the PAS ""advance knowledge of past peoples, where and how they lived"".
""As such, it reflects every part of human history, from the Palaeolithic to more modern times, across the whole of England and Wales,"" he said.

YSPGPOX98I_O6C40INK3OYQGTI,25 Republican governors back Texas in escalating border standoff with US government,By Sam Cabral,3 days ago,20240126,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68101927,"Republican governors in half of the US have backed Texas in an intensifying standoff with the federal government over illegal immigration.
The Supreme Court ruled this week against Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who has strung razor wire along miles of the frontier with Mexico.
But the Republican has vowed to add more razor wire to crack down on what he calls an invasion.
A record 300,000-plus illegal migrants crossed the border in December alone.
On Thursday, 25 Republican governors released a joint statement of solidarity with Mr Abbott for ""stepping up to protect American citizens from historic levels of illegal immigrants, deadly drugs like fentanyl, and terrorists entering our country"".
The latest border flashpoint focuses on a small stretch of the Rio Grande River that has become one of the busiest spots for migrants crossing illegally from Mexico.
As part of his Operation Lone Star, Mr Abbott has sought to block or deter entry into his state, including by installing about 30 miles (48km) of razor wire barriers along the city of Eagle Pass.

Watch: A look at the US border as immigration debate heats up
On Monday the Supreme Court handed a victory to the administration of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in its standoff with Texas.
The justices ruled by 5-4 that US Border Patrol, a federal agency, could cut or clear out the concertina wire set up by the Texas National Guard.
The justice department had argued the fencing hampers the work of Border Patrol agents in that it poses a danger to both migrants and law enforcement. Some of the illegal migrants have cut themselves on the wire.
Appearing on Fox News on Thursday, Mr Abbott said: ""Because the Biden administration has really, truly abdicated its responsibility to secure the border and enforce the laws, Texas, very simply, is securing the border.""
He has posted photos of the Texas National Guard laying down new razor wire along the river.
The move does not appear to violate the Supreme Court order, which granted permission for the removal of existing wire, while saying nothing about adding new barriers.
Democrats are urging the president to take a tougher stance against Texas.
""Governor Greg Abbott is using the Texas National Guard to obstruct and create chaos at the border,"" congressman Joaquin Castro wrote on X, calling for federal control over the guardsmen.
Governor Abbott is also facing legal challenges from the Biden White House over his orders to install floating barriers in the Rio Grande and to jail thousands of migrants on trespassing charges.
And, as the governor continues to bus migrants to Democratic cities and states, pressure is mounting on Mr Biden to take drastic action to stem the flow of arrivals.
Last week, Mr Biden said he was ""ready to act"", but argued lawmakers on Capitol Hill must first agree on significant policy reforms.
The prospects of a grand bargain, however, in either chamber of Congress, let alone both, appear slim.
Republicans in the US House of Representatives are currently leading an effort to impeach and remove the president's top border official, Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.
An emerging bipartisan border deal in the US Senate meanwhile faces objections from right and left.
Former President Donald Trump, the Republican White House frontrunner, has reportedly pressured allies to kill the bill to avoid giving Mr Biden a win in an election year.
Immigration is a central issue ahead of the November 2024 general election, with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire delivering primary victories to Mr Trump in part due to their concerns over the border.

However, after a U-turn last week, he posted an old video - which has generated more than 155 million views.
The stunt has been closely watched as X's business struggles.
Elon Musk, the owner of X, has tried various strategies to boost engagement on the platform since buying it in October 2022.
These include sharing advertising revenue with high profile creators, something that other sites, including YouTube, already do.
But the plans have faced doubts, as traffic to the site has declined.
X's advertising revenue has also plunged as Mr Musk's feud with advertisers over issues such as hate speech and misinformation rumbles on.
MrBeast - real name Jimmy Donaldson - had previously said that even a ""billion views"" would not make it worth his while to post videos on X.
But he said he was ""super curious"" to see how much advertising revenue he could make from the video.
He said on Monday that the big sum seemed ""a bit of a faÃ§ade"".
""Advertisers saw the attention it was getting and bought ads on my video (I think) and thus my revenue per view is [probably] higher than what you'd experience,"" he wrote in the post, adding that he planned to choose 10 ""random people"" to give the money he made.
Analysts said an equivalent haul would be hard to repeat without MrBeast's massive profile.
""He said he made $250,000, so not bad for one video,"" said Karsten Weide, principal at W Media Research. ""It's good numbers but you have to have a massive amount of traffic.""
The amount so-called influencers can make varies from person to person. The terms of individual deals are kept confidential, although it is thought the biggest names online may be able to negotiate special rates.
In November 2022, Forbes estimated that MrBeast made $54m in a year from his YouTube channel.
Since then, he has gained millions of subscribers on his main channel, to make a total of 233 million.
The size of his audience has prompted courtship from companies looking to boost their platforms.
MrBeast, who has claimed his videos cost millions of dollars to make, is reportedly working on a deal for a show with a huge streaming platform.
He had previously posted the same video, where he tries out cars of differing valuations, on YouTube in September 2023.
It currently has over 215 million views on YouTube, where MrBeast makes most of his money.
A MrBeast video can earn more than $1m onYouTube over time, according to estimates from influencer analytics platform WeArisma.
But on X, where new content dominates, a similar post may not have the same staying power, said Jenny Tsai, founder and chief executive of the firm.
""It would be interesting to see how the monetisation potential stacks up over time,"" she told the BBC.
In the screenshot shared by MrBeast, he reported $263,655 in revenue from nearly 156.7 million ""impressions"" or about $1.68 per 1,000 impressions.
Dave Wiskus, chief executive of Nebula, the largest independent premium streaming platform, said it was not clear what counted as an impression on X.
But he said the performance of the video suggested that creators might not want to simply write off X as a platform for sharing their work, noting that even for MrBeast, making more than $250,000 was ""not nothing"".
""If you're a creator who can pull in any kind of numbers and if you're already making the video and you can post it over there too, then sure, why not?"" he said.
But he said he did not think less famous people would be able to bring in equivalent sums.
""This was a one-off from the biggest YouTuber on earth that got international media attention,"" Mr Wiskus added.
""I don't think another creator who pulls in 1% of those impressions is going to put in 1% of that money.""
MrBeast's experiment is fairly unique.
Most creators would not attract anywhere near those viewing numbers, or indeed the global media attention that went along with it. As he said himself, the final sum his video earned him is not reflective of the experience for most of X's users.
It will undoubtedly please X chief executive Linda Yaccarino, who joined the firm last year following a stellar career in advertising. She is said to have privately struggled with the reputation of X, so it will be encouraging for her to see that ads can still perform well on the platform.
The company's owner Elon Musk visited the site of the Auschwitz death camp on Monday, following intense scrutiny of the way in which the social network handles anti-Semitic content on its platform. This is one of the big issues which troubles many of X's users and potential advertisers. It is one which Mr Musk must continue to address both in terms of words and actions.
There are also rumours that MrBeast may be negotiating his own show with one of the large video streaming platforms. If this is indeed the case, his experiment on X is a loud signal as to just how much he is worth.

The small Jetstream aircraft was on its way to the company's Diavik mine and crashed shortly after take-off.
One survivor was airlifted to a hospital in Yellowknife, the Northwest Territories coroner's office said.
Rio Tinto said it is working closely with authorities as they investigate the crash.
""We are absolutely devastated by this news,"" Rio Tinto's CEO Jakob Stausholm said in a statement.
Four of the fatalities were passengers, and two others were crew members with Northwestern Air, the Northwest Territories coroner's office said in a statement on Wednesday.
The plane crashed near Fort Smith, a small town about 740 kilometres south of Yellowknife, north of the Alberta border.
Canada's public broadcaster CBC reported that the plane crashed about 500 metres from the end of the Fort Smith Regional Airport's runway. Joint Rescue Coordination Center Trenton said it lost contact with the plane shortly after take-off.
Rio Tinto's Diavik Diamond Mine is about 300 kilometres northeast of Yellowknife. According to the company's website, it has been in operation since 2003.
The incident has been ""very devastating"" for the close-knit community, said Fort Smith's deputy mayor Dianna Korol.
""Everybody has a little piece â or somebody that they know,"" Ms Korol told the CBC.
RJ Simpson, the premier of the Northwest Territories, offered his condolences to the victims' families and friends.
""The impact of this incident is felt across the territory,"" Mr Simpson said.
""The people we lost were not just passengers on a flight; they were neighbours, colleagues, friends and loved ones. Their stories and contributions to our communities will not be forgotten.""
Both the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada are investigating the crash."
