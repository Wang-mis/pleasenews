In response to the intensified shelling of Ukrainian civilian objects by Russia, including the attack in Poltava that killed dozens of people, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania summoned a representative of the Embassy of the Russian Federation to Lithuania to express a strong protest.
Lithuania's Foreign Ministry noted that rockets and bombs hitting educational institutions, hospitals, and residential areas demonstrate Russia's desperation and complete disregard for human life and international humanitarian law. The Foreign Ministry reminded that legal responsibility lays not only with the direct perpetrators of Russia's war crimes, but also with those responsible for the very planning and execution of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine.
Lithuania, together with the international community, once again calls on Russia to immediately stop its criminal brutal aggression and reiterates that it will do everything possible to further strengthen the support to Ukraine.
