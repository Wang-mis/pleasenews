At least three Israeli policemen have been killed in a retaliatory shooting operation near the southern West Bank city of al-Khalil.
The attack took place close to the checkpoint in Tarqumiyah city on Sunday morning.
Two officers were killed at the scene and the third succumbed to injuries later at the hospital.
An Israeli security source said several gunmen opened fire toward a car on Route 35, and that the occupation forces are in pursuit of the shooters.
According to Israeli media, the gunmen opened fire from a passing vehicle at the police car, before fleeing the scene on foot.
The shooting comes amid heightened tensions in the West Bank caused by an ongoing Israeli aggression in the occupied territory.
In the early hours of Wednesday, the Israeli army conducted its biggest operation - dubbed "Camps of Summer" - in the West Bank in over 20 years, deploying hundreds of troops and airstrikes on Jenin, Tulkarem, and Tubas, which are major centers of Palestinian resistance against the usurping entity.
So far, at least 22 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli raids and strikes in several West Bank towns, and many more sustained injuries.
