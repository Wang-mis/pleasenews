Q    Mr. President, what did you learn from your briefing today?
Q    Mr. President, (inaudible) about whether you propose a final offer to Israel and Hamas this week?
THE PRESIDENT:  It's still being negotiated.
Q    What parts are being negotiated?
Q    What would you like to see Netanyahu do?
THE PRESIDENT:  Well, we're in the middle of negotiations.
Q    Can you explain why Netanyahu is not doing enough?  Can you explain why you think Prime Minister Netanyahu is not doing enough to help the hostages?
Q    Netanyahu just gave a speech.  He was very defiant.  And he said that he will stay in Philadelphi.  Will this halt the agreement?
THE PRESIDENT:  We're still in negotiations â not with him â with my colleagues from Qatar and from Egypt.
