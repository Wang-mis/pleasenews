04YU8GDBPL_N9GUWOF5Q9POLBE,"Opinion Biden or Haley? For some Democrats, it’s about who can stop Trump.",Matt Bai,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/21/biden-haley-who-can-stop-trump/,"If you’re a Democrat, or someone who intends to vote that way in the fall, I have a hypothetical exercise for you.
Let’s say I could snap my fingers and make it so that former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley would win the Republican nomination and end the Trump nightmare once and for all. (In this exercise, I’m like some meddling god from “The Odyssey.” I can even stop Trump from inciting another riot.)
But here’s the catch: In addition to banishing Trump, Haley would also be magically proclaimed the winner over President Biden in the general election, thus handing the White House back to the Republicans. Would you take that deal?
My assumption — with no data to back it up, but plenty of anecdotal evidence — is that some sizable plurality of Democrats would say: “in a heartbeat.” Which gets to a very strange dynamic in the Democratic Party right now.
Whether or not Haley emerges from New Hampshire as a credible threat to Trump (the groupthink right now is that she won’t, and we all know how the groupthink is always right), her candidacy has exposed a divergence of priorities when it comes to the president and his supporters. Biden wants to stake his claim to another term, while many Democrats would sacrifice him tomorrow if it meant stopping Trump.
Biden, as I’ve written before, is making a pretty reckless bet with our democracy, and it’s too late now to fold. Instead of announcing a year ago that he would be stepping back and letting the party sort through a new generation of potential leaders, he and his team decided that an 81-year-old incumbent, visibly slowed and enduringly unpopular, was the party’s only viable option.
The main rationale behind this, as you’ve probably heard, is that Biden is the only Democrat who has managed to beat Trump (exactly two have tried, by the way), and thus he is probably the only Democrat out there who can beat Trump again.
Even if they actually buy this pretty shaky argument, however, Biden’s strategists surely know that the inverse is almost certainly true, too. That is: If Biden is the only Democrat who can beat Trump, then Trump is the only Republican Biden can actually beat.
Right now, 10 months out from the election, it’s hard to imagine Biden winning a campaign against a candidate who is decades younger, generally sane and not facing multiple indictments. White House aides might insist that they’re not rooting for Trump, and I’m sure it brought them no visceral joy to see his supporters celebrating after a resounding victory in Iowa. But they must also know that Biden won’t get another four years unless Trump is the foil.
For a lot of moderate voters, however, that’s one whopper of a risk to take. Someone less charitable might even call it selfish.
Trump doesn’t merely promise four years of bad government. As my colleague Robert Kagan has written, and as a startling number of Trump’s former aides have now warned, his return might well plunge the country into dictatorship. It’s not an outcome you want riding on a few contested votes in Pennsylvania.
So you can forgive some sizable segment of voters, including Democrats — I don’t know what the number is, but I’m betting it’s not less than a third — for being not so much pro-Biden as anyone-but-Trump. Better to spend four years fighting over abortion rights, an issue on which Republicans keep losing anyway, than to watch the Constitution itself be put through a shredder.
We’ll know after New Hampshire whether Haley is a genuine threat to Trump or more like this year’s John Kasich; at least she’s consolidated the anti-Trump vote, which is a first in the party. (Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his campaign on Sunday.)
But it’s not hard to see why some Democrats would root for her and why Biden would not. She’s a woman and non-White, which automatically disarms much of the left. She’s maddeningly malleable, which makes her a little bit like Barack Obama in 2008 — different things to different people. And she’s an excellent debater, even when she’s wrong.
The longer Haley hangs around, the more Biden and these voters will find themselves wishing for different outcomes — unless, that is, Biden’s objectives aren’t entirely what they seem.
Because there’s at least a chance that, under his veneer of determination and bravado, Biden is as tired as he looks some days and that he wouldn’t have chosen to pursue a second term if he had more confidence in his vice president as a candidate. There’s a chance that Biden really is more interested in saving the soul of the nation, as he likes to put it, than he is in delivering another State of the Union.
And if that’s the case, then maybe Biden is just as much in the anyone-but-Trump camp as a lot of his voters are. Maybe, truth be told, he’d take the deal, too."
2DXC7AM2UR_23PRZPQQZVTG9KL,OpenAI suspends bot developer for presidential hopeful Dean Phillips,Elizabeth Dwoskin,"January 20, 2024 at 5:33 p.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/20/openai-dean-phillips-ban-chatgpt/,"The artificial intelligence company OpenAI banned the developer of a bot mimicking long shot Democratic presidential hopeful Rep. Dean Phillips — the first action that the maker of ChatGPT has taken in response to what it sees as a misuse of its AI tools in a political campaign.
Dean. Bot was the brainchild of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Matt Krisiloff and Jed Somers, who had started a super PAC supporting Phillips (Minn.) ahead of the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday. The PAC had received $1 million from hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, the billionaire activist who led the charge to oust Harvard University president Claudine Gay.
The bot was powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT conversational software, which the company has made available to outside developers.
The super PAC, called We Deserve Better, had contracted with AI start-up Delphi to build the bot. OpenAI suspended Delphi’s account late Friday in response to a Washington Post story on the SuperPAC, noting that OpenAI’s rules ban the use of its technology in political campaigns. Delphi took down Dean. Bot after the account suspension.
“Anyone who builds with our tools must follow our usage policies,” OpenAI spokeswoman Lindsey Held said in a statement. “We recently removed a developer account that was knowingly violating our API usage policies which disallow political campaigning, or impersonating an individual without consent.”
Delphi co-founder Dara Ladjevardian told The Post on Monday that the company “incorrectly” believed that OpenAI’s terms of service would let “a political action committee that supports Dean Phillips create a clone of him using our platform.”
The start-up “did not understand that …  [the super PAC] may not and did not coordinate with or seek permission from candidates they are supporting,” Ladjevardian said, adding that he had refunded the super PAC and updated the company’s terms of service to ban engagement with political campaigns.
Dean. Bot, which could converse with voters in real-time through a website, was an early use of an emerging technology that researchers have said could cause significant harm to elections.
The bot included a disclaimer explaining that it was an AI tool and not the real Dean Phillips, and required that voters consent to its use. But researchers told The Post that such technologies could lull people into accepting a dangerous tool, even when disclaimers are in place.
Proponents, including We Deserve Better, argue that the bots, when used appropriately, can educate voters by giving them an entertaining way to learn more about a candidate.
Without disclaimers, experts have said, the technologies could enable mass robocalls to voters who think they’re talking to actual candidates or supporters. AI systems can also produce disinformation in ads or content, such as fake websites, at scale.
OpenAI won't let politicians use its tech for campaigning
After The Post asked We Deserve Better about OpenAI’s prohibitions on Thursday, Krisiloff said he had asked Delphi to remove ChatGPT from the bot and instead rely on open source technologies that also offer conversational capabilities that had gone into the bot’s design.
The bot remained available to the public without ChatGPT until late Friday, when Delphi took the bot down in response to the suspension, Krisiloff said.
Krisiloff did not have further comment. Delphi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Krisiloff is a former chief of staff to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Altman has met with Phillips but has no involvement in the super PAC, Krisiloff said."

5C2RCS4S7I_3DLB9OUK3E1CE9X,Allegations against Georgia prosecutors likely damaged case against Trump,Amy Gardner,"January 21, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/21/fani-willis-nathan-wade-accusations-damage/,"Among friends and supporters of Fulton County District Attorney Fani T. Willis, a common argument has taken root in response to allegations that a romantic relationship between her and the lead prosecutor on the election-interference case against Donald Trump should disqualify them both.
Even if the accusations are true, these allies say, there is no Georgia law requiring either Willis or Nathan Wade to be bumped from the case. They consider the controversy a distraction fomented by one of Trump’s co-defendants with a long record as a GOP opposition researcher. The case is too important, they say. It must go on.
In some ways, however, the damage may already be done.
After nearly two weeks of salacious headlines, Willis has still not denied or directly addressed the accusations. Trump and other critics have willingly filled that vacuum and amplified the most sensational claims. Regardless of what Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who is overseeing the case, decides to do — and regardless of whether the accusations are true — Trump has found a new line of attack on the validity of the Georgia case and Willis’s decision-making that he is unlikely to abandon.
The allegations threaten to undermine public confidence in Willis’s prosecution of Trump. On one side, they have inflamed grievances among those who believe that Trump has been unfairly targeted by partisan prosecutors and courts. On the other, those who want Trump held accountable for his effort to reverse his 2020 defeat are scrambling to protect the case.
“Any objective observer who recognizes the strong public interest in knowing one way or the other whether a jury believes Donald Trump led a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election is going to be concerned about the impact of these allegations,” said Norm Eisen, a longtime Willis ally and advocate of the case who served as special counsel in the House of Representatives’ first impeachment of Trump.

Eisen told reporters Saturday that while there is no legal basis to disqualify either prosecutor, Wade should voluntarily step away from the case. The controversy is not going away, Eisen said, and threatens to delay the case against the former president, which must be avoided. He pointedly did not recommend that Willis step aside — a reflection of the stakes of the case against Trump.
“There is an overwhelming amount of evidence justifying the decision to prosecute Mr. Trump and his co-conspirators, including Mr. [Mike] Roman,” Eisen said. “The evidence is strong. The case is powerful. It’s very likely to lead to conviction, and we mustn’t lose time on the calendar given the paramount public interest in bringing that strong case to a speedy conclusion.”
A spokesman for the district attorney’s office declined to comment on Eisen’s remarks. Wade has not addressed the accusations against him, and his attorney has declined to comment on them.
Roman, a Trump co-defendant, alleged in a court filing nearly two weeks ago that Willis and Wade have been in an “improper, clandestine personal relationship,” and that Willis may have broken the law by hiring Wade as a special prosecutor and then allowing him to pay for “vacations across the world” with her unrelated to their work on the case. He called for the prosecutors to be disqualified and for the charges against him to be dismissed.
On Friday, lawyers for Wade’s estranged wife filed a motion in their divorce case that included credit card statements that appeared to show Wade had purchased airline tickets for himself and Willis to Aruba and San Francisco. It is unknown whether Willis paid him back.
Eisen acknowledged that it is unknown whether Willis violated Fulton County hiring policies or gift policies in appointing Wade, but he said those matters are not relevant to the criminal case.
Eisen’s remarks represent one of the first instances of a Willis ally acknowledging the potential damage that the allegations have brought to her and the case. Although he was quick to note that many facts remain unknown, he said it seems clear that the two have had a personal relationship, and that was “not wise.”
Another unknown is what would happen to the case if McAfee disqualifies Willis’s office. It would fall to a state prosecutors advisory council to find a new prosecutor, but it’s not certain that any would volunteer.
Eisen is one of the few Willis allies who has spoken publicly on the issue. In Atlanta, where Willis’s willingness to take on a former president has made her something of a local celebrity, friends and allies, along with many Georgia Democrats, have been silent on the accusations, some privately saying they are waiting to see what Willis says first.
Several Willis allies have said privately they were disappointed with her remarks last weekend at a historically Black church in Atlanta in which she described herself as “flawed” and “imperfect” but did not directly address the allegations. She defended her decision to hire Wade, calling him a “superstar” with “impeccable credentials.”
“The reason you’re still interested in this, and the reason people are still looking at this, is because it’s a drip-drip-drip and she hasn’t responded yet,” said Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor who investigated whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election.
Some also criticized Willis’s claim during that speech that race is a motivating force in the controversy because she and Wade are Black.
The claims threaten to further energize Georgia Republicans, who have sought ways to disrupt the election-interference case since the August indictments, including through a newly formed state oversight commission that aims to punish “rogue” district attorneys for alleged misconduct.
More digging into Willis’s past is already underway. On Friday, Georgia GOP Chairman Josh McKoon circulated a 2020 video of Willis saying she would fire any employee who sleeps with a co-worker and promising not to date people “that work under me.”
So far, other key Georgia Republicans, including Gov. Brian Kemp and House Speaker Jon Burns, have fended off efforts by far-right lawmakers to use legislative powers to punish Willis and block the case.
“In Georgia, we will not be engaging in political theater that only inflames the emotions of the moment,” Kemp said in August about calls for a special session to impeach Willis and defund her office.
But the allegations against Willis and Wade threaten to unmoor that political protection from Kemp and other Republicans. Earlier this month, Kemp, who is expected to be a key witness against Trump, called the allegations against Willis “deeply troubling.”
“Evidence should be presented quickly in order for Judge McAfee to rule and the public to have confidence in this trial moving forward,” Kemp said.
Meanwhile, Burns said he would no longer oppose efforts to use the new state oversight board to target Willis, abandoning his earlier position. “The allegations against District Attorney Fani Willis are extremely troubling to say the least,” Burns said. “We need to let the process play out, but the public absolutely deserves transparency and the truth from the District Attorney about these serious allegations.”
Trump has seized on the allegations in campaign speeches and social media posts, referring to Willis and Wade as “the lovebirds.” On Friday, after the release of Wade’s credit card statements, the former president accused the prosecutors of targeting him “to ENRICH themselves and to live the Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous.” The scandal has dominated coverage on conservative-leaning media outlets and has prompted reporters to stake out Wade’s law office. An image of the special prosecutor, emerging from his office gripping a handgun, was published in the New York Post and later aired on Fox News.
Two Trump advisers said the former president’s team has watched the unfolding situation in Georgia with glee and say they expect Trump to continue the attack on Willis.
“It’s a gift to us,” one of the individuals said, requesting anonymity to speak about internal deliberations. The strategy, one of these people said, is to discredit the Georgia investigation and then use it to undercut and raise questions about the others. The Georgia case is one of four criminal prosecutions underway against Trump even as he marches toward the GOP nomination for president this year.
There is also a potential tangible reward to seeking to disqualify Willis and Wade: It could delay the trial, one person close to his legal team said. Inside Trump’s orbit, the Fulton County case has long been viewed as a less serious operation — but also perilous. If again elected president, Trump could select an attorney general with the power to drop the federal charges against him. He could also pardon himself if he is convicted in federal court. But he would have no pardon power if he or others are convicted in state court in Georgia.
One person close to Trump said aides are likely to lean on Kemp to apply pressure in the coming weeks. They are also privately heralding Roman, who has worked for Trump since 2016 on the campaign trail and at the White House, as a heroic figure.
Roman is one of the lowest-profile defendants in the election-interference case. Until recently, he had filed only a handful of court motions since the mid-August indictment alleging that Trump and 18 others illegally conspired to try to overturn Trump’s 2020 loss in Georgia.
That lack of activity had fueled speculation among close observers of the case that Roman might be among those targeted for a plea deal by Fulton County prosecutors, who have aggressively sought to flip some of those indicted in the case as they seek a conviction of Trump.
While Roman was among those offered a cooperation deal in early fall, he declined, according to a source close to the case who requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations.
Behind the scenes, Ashleigh Merchant, Roman’s attorney, had been chasing a tantalizing piece of courthouse gossip that she’d heard — including, she said, from staffers inside the district attorney’s office, whom she did not name — claiming that Willis and Wade were not just co-prosecutors but also romantic partners.
Merchant said in an interview that the rumor first came up in late August when she began investigating why Willis had hired Wade as a special prosecutor for the case. A longtime criminal defense attorney from Cobb County, Merchant had spent years as a Fulton County public defender, during which time she faced off against Willis in cases and knew her and many of the staff lawyers on her team well.
Merchant was also friends with Wade and had endorsed his failed campaign for a Cobb County Superior Court judgeship.
“I couldn’t believe it,” Merchant said of the rumor, adding that it seemed “sloppy” for Willis, who has a reputation of being a careful and meticulous prosecutor.
Merchant said she began filing open-records requests with the district attorney’s office seeking contracts and other documents tied not only to Wade but also the two other outside attorneys appointed to work on the case. And she said she began to talk to sources whom she declined to name — including those who allegedly claimed that it was “common knowledge” within the district attorney’s office that Willis and Wade were involved, an allegation that a spokesman for Willis has denied.
That these explosive allegations surfaced from Roman, a longtime Republican operative with a lengthy background in opposition research, has raised questions about whether Roman himself has been behind some of the digging that now threatens to upend the Georgia case. Merchant has not said how involved her client was in her investigation.
On Thursday, Willis alleged in a motion to quash a subpoena seeking to depose her in Wade’s contentious divorce case that Wade’s estranged wife, Joycelyn Mayfield Wade, was colluding with those who are seeking to disrupt the case.
Willis’s motion pointed out the close timing between the subpoena for Willis and Roman’s filing, as well as Merchant’s motion to unseal the divorce records — which all occurred within hours of one another on Jan. 8.
The motion, written by Cinque Axam, a lawyer representing Willis, accused Joycelyn Wade of “using the legal process to harass and embarrass” Willis and of “obstructing and interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution.”
In response, Andrea Dyer Hastings, one of Joycelyn Wade’s divorce lawyers, called Willis’s claims “an affront to the integrity of her office.” Her motion included Nathan Wade’s credit card statements.
“Contrary to Ms. Willis’s belief, [Joycelyn Wade] is not utilizing the deposition to harass her but rather to seek pertinent information from her husband’s paramour regarding her relationship with Plaintiff and the extent of the Plaintiff’s financial involvement in the same,” Hastings wrote. “These answers are relevant to the equitable division of the marital estate, dissipation of marital assets and the Plaintiff’s capacity to provide spousal support.”
Meanwhile, Merchant accused Willis of attempting “to create a conspiracy where none exists.”
“We filed Mr. Roman’s motion on the day it was due, January 8th,” Merchant said. “We believe her filing in Cobb County is just another attempt to avoid having to directly answer the important questions Mr. Roman has raised. She appears to be doing everything she can to avoid having to account for inconvenient and difficult facts.”
Merchant said she is planning to subpoena several witnesses to appear at a Feb. 15 evidentiary hearing McAfee has scheduled in response to Roman’s filing. Merchant said these witnesses will corroborate her client’s claims of misconduct by Willis and Wade.
But the first drama will come Monday, when Cobb County Judge Henry Thompson will hold a hearing in the divorce case to hear arguments on whether to unseal the divorce file and also whether Willis can be compelled to sit for a deposition in the case, which is likely to be videotaped and could eventually become public.

5P2ROD9LSW_9JJ0XZ7I0VWAE9F,N.H.’s primary pushed the GOP to fix acid rain. Climate change is another story.,Michael Kranish,"January 21, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/21/new-hampshire-primary-climate-change-acid-rain-republicans/,"CONCORD, N.H. — Thirty-six years ago, Republicans in the first-in-the-nation primary battled to prove they had the deepest commitment to the day’s most contentious issue: the acid rain poisoning New Hampshire’s lakes, rivers and forests.
George H.W. Bush promised to restore his party’s conservation ethic and curtail pollution. His top competitor, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, vowed to quickly pass an acid rain bill. The state’s voters and its Republican governor, Gov. John H. Sununu, had elevated the issue before the primary vote that helped propel Bush to the White House, where he followed through by signing legislation that has curtailed acidity in New Hampshire by 84 percent to date.
“This is one of the most significant environmental science and policy success stories of our time ... and New Hampshire is its birthplace,” Anthea Lavallee, executive director of the Hubbard Brook Research Foundation, which supports the facility where acid rain research has been conducted, said at an environmental forum here on Thursday.
Now, however, as New Hampshire faces the much broader threat of climate change, Republican candidates in the state for Tuesday’s primary are barely mentioning the issue — and when they do, it is often to play it down.
Nikki Haley advocated pulling out of an international climate deal as President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations; she has said “man-made climate change is real, but liberal ideas would cost trillions and destroy our economy.” Trump calls climate change a “hoax.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he supports efforts to address the impact of hurricanes and flooding, but he rejects “the politicization of the weather.”
Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, the son of the former governor, said in an interview that he sees no comparison between dealing with acid rain and climate change.
“Climate change is a completely different story,” the younger Sununu said. “There’s a lot of politics behind that kind of socialistic approach, that green New Deal type stuff that costs trillions of dollars.”
But to environmentalists in both parties here, the analogy is clear: The bipartisan framework that significantly reduced acid rain is exactly what’s needed to deal with climate change.
The story of how New Hampshire conservatives once forced action on acid rain stands in stark contrast to the party’s environmental policies today and helps illustrate a seismic shift in party politics in America, with fewer chances for small early-primary states to effect radical change on major issues.
“There’s been almost no discussion” of climate change by Republican candidates in the state’s primary, said former U.S. senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), who played a leading role in the 1990 Clean Air Act that dealt with acid rain. “People in New Hampshire do vote the environment aggressively. This is a state built around environmental protection.”
For years, New Hampshire residents were growing increasingly alarmed by the pollution causing mass die-offs of aquatic life in lakes and rivers and the deterioration of vast numbers of trees. The environmental devastation harmed everything from the forest industry to tourism, blotching a region known for its Currier and Ives landscapes.
As scientists scrambled to understand the exact causes of the phenomenon, they turned to the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, a patch of the White Mountain National Forest. Gene Likens, who in 1963 was a 28-year-old scientist, led a team of researchers that eventually confirmed the acidity was caused by the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from Midwestern power plants, carried by air currents and deposited into the state’s lakes, rivers and forests. Likens’s team determined that a primary solution was to greatly curtail pollution from the coal-fired power plants and other sources.
Lawmakers in the state demanded action. By the early 1980s, 197 of 199 New Hampshire towns had voted in favor of regulating acid rain emissions, a remarkable standing for a state that had New England’s weakest environmental laws. Gov. John H. Sununu signed a state bill in 1985 requiring emission cuts, boasting of his “stringent acid rain control law.”
Three years later, the problem of acid rain took center stage in the New Hampshire primary, and candidates in both parties responded by vowing to take federal action. Dole warned there was no time to waste dealing with acid rain and was quoted in the New York Times saying, “We don’t have the luxury of waiting until we get details on the extent of the potential problem.”
Bush, then the vice president, was eager to define himself on the issue after the lack of action by President Ronald Reagan. With the elder Sununu serving as co-chair of Bush’s New Hampshire campaign, Bush vowed to reduce emissions. After winning the primary and the nomination, he sought to portray himself as a stronger defender of the environment than the Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, whom he criticized over the pollution in Boston Harbor. After a fall speech in which he once again vowed action on acid rain, Bush spoke of his “conservation ethic” and said, “I am an environmentalist, always have been.”
After Bush was elected president, and Sununu became White House chief of staff, he persuaded most Republicans in Congress to vote for the legislation to clean the air and curtail acid rain. The legislation capped emissions but allowed companies to trade credits primarily among coal-fired power plants, sparking innovation that reduced the cost. Known as “cap and trade,” the practice was embraced by Bush and other Republicans as a market-based solution.
While opponents predicted the legislation would be an economic disaster, it reduced acidity at much lower cost than expected, according to environmental scientists. Opponents calculated the legislation would cost $1,500 to reduce a ton of sulfur emissions, but the actual price ended up being about $15 a ton, Likens said.
Bush later said that “public servants have an obligation to try to leave the earth better than we found it,” as he told the Boston Globe in 2010. He recalled a friend had suggested he view “the environment as creation,” leading Bush to conclude, “It gives you a new appreciation for this issue and why it matters to Republicans and Democrats alike.”
Despite the success dealing with acid rain, the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act mostly failed to address emissions that cause climate change, even though there were warnings about the issue at the time.
The result of both the success and the failure of that legislation is evident today at the Hubbard Brook research facility, a 7,800-acre site supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, where scientists conduct one of the country’s most extensive studies of air, water, soil and other parts of the ecosystem.
Hubbard Brook researchers have measured the 84 percent decline in acidity, according to Likens — a remarkable decrease from the peak around the early 1970s. But they have simultaneously documented that last summer, the site experienced the warmest temperature since measurements began in 1956, according to Lindsey Rustad, acting director of the Agriculture  Department’s  Northeast Climate Hub. The mean annual temperature increased by 3.6F (2C), which compares to an average global surface temperature increase of 2F (1.1C) over the same period, Rustad said.
For New Hampshire, Rustad said, the increased warming has meant longer growing seasons, warmer winters, less snow, shorter periods of lake ice and more heat waves.
“Climate change is unquestionably the biggest environmental crisis we’re facing right now,” Rustad said. “2023 was a warning.”
Climate change could be solved “just like we did with acid rain,” Rustad said.
But the political divide over that kind of action is evident on the campaign trail for this year’s primary in New Hampshire. Trump, the leading GOP contender in polls, pulled the United States out of the international climate change treaty — a move that Haley, one of his top rivals, had also backed as U.N. ambassador.
The Trump, Haley and DeSantis campaigns did not respond to requests for comment. Gov. Chris Sununu, who has endorsed Haley, said she did the right thing in backing the withdrawal from the climate accord because, he said, that agreement let big polluters such as China off the hook. Many New Hampshire residents, he said, are more concerned about the cost of heating their home than enacting new regulations.
The political climate — not just the ecological climate — has also changed significantly since his father was governor.
“George H.W. Bush did a great job of making sure that something got passed” on acid rain, the younger Sununu said. But he said climate change activists “have the extremist approach that the world is ending in 10 or 12 years, or whatever these folks have told us, and have massive policy changes or, or catastrophic events are going to happen, which, again, is an extremist approach.”
President Biden, who is not on the ballot in New Hampshire because he opposed it remaining the first primary, has strongly supported efforts to curtail climate change.
Sixty-one years after Likens led the discovery of acid rain, he appeared Thursday at the Youth Forum on Climate and Clean Energy, where he discussed how his experience can be translated into action on global warming. Despite what he called his discouragement over lack of political consensus on addressing climate change, Likens said he has to remain optimistic — especially given his own experience in the discovery of acid rain and then seeing the crisis fade into the background.
“It took 27 years from the discovery of acid rain in North America to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. It took another 34 years to today to reduce it to the near-background level that it is today,” he said. “It’s very rare that a scientist is there from discovery to reaction. It takes a long time. It’s not right, but it does.”"
6EMAZEK8XU_SO9D25MJKD800GL,How the polar vortex could bring winter back with a vengeance,Matthew Cappucci,"January 21, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/01/20/polar-vortex-extreme-weather-arctic-february/,"To say that January has been a tumultuous month weather-wise would be an understatement. The month has featured a string of severe winter storms, wild temperature swings and even a few bouts of tornadoes. And as we go into February, an even trickier complication enters the equation: the ever-capricious polar vortex.
Over the past week, Arctic cold has swallowed much of the nation’s heartland. Thirty states were included in alerts for dangerously low temperatures and wind chills, with readings dropping to minus-16 in Kansas City, 1 degree in Oklahoma City, minus-10 in Chicago and minus-27 in Bismarck, N.D. Snow cover reached its greatest mid-January extent over the contiguous United States in the last 20 years.
After one more frigid weekend, temperatures are about to spike 30 to 40 degrees, rising above freezing and inducing an abrupt thaw over the Ozarks, southern Plains and Mid-South. The northern Plains will see highs spike 15 to 20 degrees above normal by Tuesday.
But after that warm-up, then what? The jury is still out on what might happen. Much of it will boil down to what the polar vortex does, and how its shape and intensity evolve to affect the weather in North America. The ongoing El Niño may play a role as well.
There are two polar vortexes in the Northern Hemisphere: one in the lower atmosphere, or the troposphere (sometimes called the “circumpolar vortex”), and one higher up in the stratosphere. The stratospheric one is stronger and is present each winter as cold, dense air sinks and spirals near the North Pole. The stronger the vortex, the faster it spins and the more bottled-up the cold air is over the high latitudes.
But if something disrupts the polar vortex, it can be knocked off-kilter. Imagine a spinning top; if you jiggle the table, it might wobble out of control. If the polar vortex weakens, it can no longer contain the cold air — and pockets of frigid Arctic chill crash south over North America.
According to Climate.gov’s Polar Vortex blog, there was a subtle disruption to the polar vortex a couple of weeks ago. Temperatures inside the vortex warmed a little bit, and the whirlpool of air slowed down its spin. It didn’t reverse direction initially, which is the criterion for a major disruption, but it did slow markedly. Such minor disruptions are “not unexpected,” the Climate.gov blog post said.
Is that enough to affect our weather in the United States? Ordinarily no. Minor stratospheric disruptions happen 19 miles up, and by the time the signal propagates to the surface, it’s too weak to actually do anything.
But this last episode was wonky. Climate.gov stated that it occurred at the lower levels of the stratosphere, allowing it to warm up and destabilize. “It appears as though the minor [vortex] warming during the first week of January and the subsequent destruction of the polar vortex in the lower stratosphere were enough to at least help set the stage for the cold air outbreak over North America this past weekend,” Climate.gov wrote.
But what comes next?
Meteorologists believe that polar vortex disruption a couple of weeks ago in the lower levels of the stratosphere could help energize a stronger disturbance higher up. The jostled polar vortex would briefly collapse, filling in with warm air and even briefly reversing its spin. That theoretically could let the jet stream, or river of winds high up, shift south, spilling the cold over the Lower 48.
But don’t count on any big wintry weather anytime soon. Here’s why:
So basically, the polar vortex has the stage set for another wave of cold if other factors line up, but it’s not guaranteed, and mild weather could end up prevailing. And there are other atmospheric processes that will play a role in how the weather unfolds.
Pugh said he’d keep a close eye on El Niño.
We know for sure that next week will be mild over the Lower 48 states. After that, the forecast is a lot more cloudy.
Some forecast models project that the Arctic Oscillation, which approximates the strength of the polar vortex, will intensify into next week and weaken the week after, shifting toward its negative phase. A negative Arctic Oscillation — since it reflects a weak polar vortex — tilts the odds for more cold air to spill into the mid-latitudes.
Meanwhile, as we head into February, a weakening El Niño means there are elevated chances for above-average snowfall in the eastern United States. There’s a link between a weakening El Niño and an uptick in East Coast snows late in the wintertime.
“As far as El Niño, I do think that less than strong is better for snow and cold in East,” Judah Cohen, an atmospheric scientist and specialist in long-range weather forecasts at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, wrote in an email.
Cohen is also watching the polar vortex. “If it stays strong and circular, it is mild for February,” he wrote. But if it stretches out, “we get episodes of more severe winter weather.”
For now, February looks to start off warm. And while there are no immediate signs of sudden flare-ups of winter weather, it’s important to remember that, between El Niño and the effects of this polar vortex disruption, the bases are loaded. It wouldn’t take much for winter to come back with a vengeance.

7KXKW1OM6W_G9G9HSLKT0RDI00,"When Reagan tried to undo affirmative action, corporations fought back",Julian Mark,"January 21, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2024/01/21/ronald-reagan-affirmative-action-dei/,"President Ronald Reagan had been slowly chipping away at affirmative action since taking office in 1981, but it was six months into his second term that his administration saw its chance to deal it a decisive blow.
Reagan and his Cabinet viewed his resounding electoral victory against Walter Mondale in 1984 as a mandate to end the Lyndon B. Johnson-era policy requiring all government contractors to take “affirmative action” to end discrimination at their firms. By the mid-’80s, that meant some of the country’s largest companies — such as General Motors, IBM and Merck — had implemented robust affirmative action plans to hire women and people of color.
Reagan’s replacement order would have removed those requirements, a policy consistent with his push for deregulation and vision for a racially colorblind America. If all went according to plan, the new executive order would be viewed as the administration’s “landmark legacy,” writes legal historian Melvin I. Urofsky in his 2020 book “The Affirmative Action Puzzle.”
But after the plan leaked to the media, the effort unraveled.
Backlash came from civil rights groups, Democrats and Republicans — but also from corporate America. Many companies had adopted affirmative action plans and come to believe in them.
How the Reagan administration stoked fears of anti-white racism
“We will continue goals and timetables no matter what the government does,” said John L. Huck, chairman of Merck, the pharmaceutical giant. “They are a part of our culture and corporate procedures.”
Similarly, the National Association of Manufacturers told Reagan not to issue the order, arguing that “diversity in workforce participation produced new ideas in management, product development, and marketing,” according to Urofsky.
One 1985 survey of 128 Fortune 500 companies showed that 95 percent intended to keep their programs regardless of changes to the executive order. A year later, another survey showed that 9 in 10 planned to keep the programs; some would even expand them. According to one 1989 Harvard Law Review article, companies filed amicus briefs and sent telegrams to the White House opposing efforts to water down affirmative action.
All of this defied the White House’s expectations.
Reagan also received pushback from members of his Cabinet, as well as 126 Democrats and Republicans in Congress, who wrote a letter to Reagan calling affirmative action hiring goals and timetables an “essential tool in combating discrimination and … a necessary and proper response to the tragic legacy of historical discrimination which continues to plague our country today.”
Reagan never signed a replacement order, and Johnson’s affirmative action order has remained in effect ever since.
Nearly four decades later, corporate “diversity, equity and inclusion,” or DEI, efforts — an evolution of affirmative action — are again under intense pressure. This time, it’s not from the federal government, but rather from conservative activists emboldened by the Supreme Court’s June ruling striking down affirmative action in college admissions.
The ruling has fueled a tidal wave of reverse-discrimination complaints against Fortune 500 companies, including Meta, IBM and Amazon. In January, conservative activists hailed the resignation of Claudine Gay, Harvard’s first Black president, as a pivotal victory in their war against DEI, leaving some DEI professionals worried about the future.
But a recent survey and interviews with corporate lawyers suggest that companies are reacting in much the same way they did in the 1980s.
In a survey of more than 320 corporate executives by the employment law firm Littler Mendelson, 91 percent said the Supreme Court’s decision on admissions has not affected their prioritization of DEI. Moreover, 57 percent said they have expanded their DEI efforts over the past year, even as 59 percent said they have felt the rising backlash since the court’s decision.
“We’re seeing many employers maintain — or even double down on — their commitment to [DEI], even as backlash spikes,” said Jeanine Conley Daves, an attorney with Littler and member of the firm’s inclusion, equity and diversity consulting practice.
IBM, which has participated in affirmative action since the policy’s introduction in the early 1960s, is among those saying that its diversity efforts will continue, despite having been targeted directly.
In December, the technology company came under fire from conservatives when a recording was released of IBM chief executive Arvind Krishna stating that the company tied executive bonuses to diversity efforts. Soon after, America First Legal, a legal nonprofit run by former Donald Trump adviser Stephen Miller, filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint against IBM, alleging that some of the company’s DEI policies violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination.
When asked about the incident in a Jan. 11 CNBC interview, Krishna stated the company’s commitment to DEI policies. “It’s very simple,” he said. “Always when there is stress … you should go back to one’s principles. IBM’s principle has been that we want to be an inclusive workplace where all employees can bring their whole self to bear.”
He noted that IBM promoted a woman to an executive role in the 1940s, long before the civil rights movement of the 1960s. “We intend to keep living by those principles,” he said.
To be sure, some companies are drawing back. Several prestigious law firms altered their diversity fellowships after being sued late last year, and other companies have made changes to their programs after being hit with complaints, according to reporting by Reuters.
In the Littler survey, 9 percent of respondents said the Supreme Court’s June decision prompted changes to how they approached DEI as well as a reduction in how much they prioritized it. And while 69 percent of respondents said their approach has not changed “in any way,” Conley Daves of Littler said in an interview that those companies may still be reviewing their policies to avoid litigation.
In addition to threatening to replace the Johnson affirmative action order, Reagan’s Justice Department ordered dozens of municipalities to pare down their affirmative action plans. It also slashed staff at the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, which monitored companies’ compliance with the Johnson order. And thousands of discrimination complaints were backlogged at the EEOC, which was then chaired by Clarence Thomas, now a Supreme Court justice. In June, Thomas, a vocal affirmative action critic, sided with the majority to overturn race-conscious admissions.
The time Clarence Thomas said affirmative action was ‘critical’ for society
In a 1986 radio address, Reagan rejected arguments that his administration had attempted to end affirmative action. Yet in the same address, he denounced the use of hiring quotas and minority hiring goals, and used a famous Martin Luther King Jr. speech to illustrate his point.
“We are committed to a society in which all men and women have equal opportunities to succeed, and so we oppose the use of quotas,'' Reagan said, according to a New York Times article published at the time. ''We want a color-blind society. A society, that in the words of Dr. King, judges people not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”
Harvard sociologist Frank Dobbin writes in his 2009 book “Inventing Equal Opportunity” that it was during the Reagan era that corporate equal-opportunity initiatives evolved to more closely resemble what’s known today as DEI. As the concept of “diversity” began to work its way into the corporate lexicon, companies started to argue that promoting a diverse workforce not only reduced legal exposure but was also good for business.
In an email to The Washington Post, Dobbin sought to distinguish between the Reagan era and the present, which he called “a very different situation.” The political resistance to affirmative action by conservative activists, he said, is far greater than it was in the 1980s, when much of the opposition was coming just from the White House.
“The big question in my mind is how business leaders will respond,” Dobbin said, noting that companies adopted calls for racial justice following the 2020 murder of George Floyd by announcing workplace diversity goals and publishing data on their progress.
“As some states outlaw spending on public DEI programs, I think we should be looking at whether companies stop publishing their data,” he said. “My guess is at the very least, many companies will stop making public pronouncements about their DEI activities.”"
7O0NLM6DB7_UTZ41CDR1K1C6DY,Opinion Trump is not a colossus. And his party is a mess.,E.J. Dionne Jr.,"January 21, 2024 at 6:30 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/21/trump-gop-division-new-hampshire/,"The prevailing wisdom going into Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary sees Donald Trump as triumphant. But don’t mistake him for a colossus leading a mighty band. This view ignores the opportunism behind many of the endorsements he is winning and the sharp split between Republicans who want to govern and those who don’t.
Though there is certainly polarization between our parties, the primary cause of the deep distemper in American politics is the polarization within the Republican Party. Trump’s apparent dominance distracts from what the behavior of elected GOP politicians in Washington teaches us day after day: The party is a mess.
That doesn’t stop the Trump-Is-All-Powerful Industry from predicting he’ll go from strength to strength. Its argument is straightforward: Even if former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley wins New Hampshire, which she could, the obstacles in her way are formidable. In the next major battleground, Haley’s home state of South Carolina, Trump has a big lead. Haley’s problems only got worse on Friday when Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.) announced his support for Trump.
Trump’s victory in the Iowa caucuses created the feel of a party falling in behind him. Telling were endorsements from Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.), two politicians the vindictive front-runner repeatedly mocked, humiliated and slandered. On Sunday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom Trump routinely referred to as “Ron DeSanctimonious,” dropped out of the race and endorsed his tormentor. So much for self-respect.
But even if the punditry proves right, the GOP is in no way cohesive or coherent. Just look at the Republican majority in the House, which can’t govern without Democratic help. Meanwhile, Senate and House Republicans are at odds on the most important foreign policy question of the moment: whether the United States will continue to stand up against Vladimir Putin’s aggression in Ukraine.
In the House last week, Republicans were divided into almost perfect halves over whether to keep the federal government open until at least March: They voted 107-106 for a deal between House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). To get the supermajority he needed, Johnson required nearly unified Democratic support — 207 votes to 2.
In negotiations pairing help for Ukraine with enhanced border security, Democrats have given enormous ground on immigration, to the point at which Senate Republicans are reduced to begging their House comrades to accept a win.
Even Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.), one of Trump’s most enthusiastic apologists, lectured his colleagues on reality: “To those who think that if President Trump wins, which I hope he does, that we can get a better deal — you won’t.”
If the Senate reaches a bipartisan deal and Johnson rejects it, he will be the reason Ukraine isn’t funded and the United States loses credibility around the world.
Even Trump’s big victory in Iowa belied the idea that Trump’s army would walk through fire for him. Many were plainly unwilling to ignore the bitter cold and icy roads on caucus night. Only about 110,000 of the roughly 750,000 registered Republicans in the state participated, down more than 40 percent from the 187,000 who joined the last competitive caucuses in 2016.
The divisions among those hardy voters were deep, pointing to President Biden’s opportunities to drive wedges into the GOP electorate. The entrance poll found that Trump drew just 37 percent among college graduates, compared with 67 percent among non-graduates. Caucus-goers split down the middle as to whether they considered themselves part of the MAGA movement (46 percent) or not (50 percent.). Three-quarters of the non-MAGA voters opposed Trump.
And 31 percent said they would not consider Trump fit to be president if he were convicted of a crime — a significant number, considering the loyalty to the GOP of the small minority willing to brave the elements.
Sure, Democrats have their divisions, too. Party loyalists range from the center to the left, and some of their loud fights doomed parts of Biden’s program in the last Congress. But what’s remarkable is how much they did pass with narrow House and Senate margins — and, in the case of the infrastructure and technology investments, with bipartisan support.
The difference is that Democrats want to govern because they believe government has a chance to do good. This means even the party’s most left-wing members will compromise to take a step or two forward even when they want to take four.
Republicans, on the other hand, are riven between those willing to govern — even, occasionally, with Democrats — and those who will be satisfied only if Trump is president. They presume this would allow them to roll over the left, the liberals and the moderates alike.
Failing to see the GOP as a party torn asunder allows Trump to seem stronger than he is. He uses this perceived supremacy to cow Republicans who hold the quaint view that governing in a reasonable and (small-d) democratic way is the point of getting elected. Is it just wish-casting to think New Hampshire might seize the opportunity to send them the message that it’s their duty to fight back?"
ARDHH89I7J_PLALP62H4Y5IHUC,"Inside New Hampshire Gov. Sununu’s drive to stop Trump, boost Haley",Joanna Slater,"January 21, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/21/new-hampshire-governor-primary-nikki-haley-sununu/,"BRETTON WOODS, N.H. — At a mountainside hotel in the middle of a snowstorm, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) bounded to the front of a packed room and explained how he intended to impede Donald Trump’s march to the Republican nomination.
“The other guy” — Trump — makes speeches to large rooms, then “gets in his little fancy plane and flies back to Florida,” Sununu said. But the current contest in the state will be “won on the ground” in a last sprint of retail politicking. That’s something the candidate Sununu has endorsed, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, understands “more than anybody.”
If there is any chance to challenge Trump as the presumptive Republican nominee, it begins Tuesday in New Hampshire. For Sununu, the state’s popular governor, the contest represents a last-ditch effort to influence the future of the Republican Party, which he has repeatedly said should not include Trump, even if much of his party disagrees.
Sununu has emerged as Haley’s most vocal surrogate, campaigning with her across the state and lending his own appeal and local acumen to her cause.
If Haley has a strong showing in New Hampshire and in the next primary in her home state of South Carolina, Sununu said, it will be a “one-on-one race going into Super Tuesday.” Then, he said, “anything is possible.”
The scion of a political dynasty who has served as New Hampshire’s governor since 2017, Sununu is the rare conservative leader who has managed to win votes from Democrats. He has said he wants the Republican Party to be more “approachable” and “normal” — a goal that looks increasingly quixotic as long as Trump remains its standard-bearer.
In many ways, the contest in New Hampshire is a microcosm of the struggle of old-school Republicans like Sununu to wrest the party away from the darker, more polarizing vision of Trump.
The former president has been “a disaster for this party,” said Sununu, 49. If Trump becomes the nominee, he added, it will be nearly impossible to attract new voters, including young people and independents.
Trump has taken note, calling Sununu “a spoiled brat,” “the most overrated governor” and “unelectable.”
Sununu dismissed Trump’s jabs. “Every time Trump attacks,” Sununu said, “he’s afraid.”
Sununu has insisted that the campaign is about the party’s future, not his own, which at least temporarily may not center on politics. He is not running for reelection as governor in November. Last year he explored his own presidential bid but ultimately decided not to run, saying it was more important to defeat Trump.
But Sununu will remain a key voice in the debate over the party’s post-Trump future, said Jim Merrill, a Republican political consultant in New Hampshire. “The conversation about what comes next will continue,” Merrill said, although it will be put on pause if Trump becomes the nominee.
Sununu’s efforts on behalf of Haley, a former U.N. ambassador in the Trump administration, echo those of Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R). She backed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) over Trump in her state’s caucuses, only to watch him lose ignominiously.
Sununu has introduced Haley at rallies and been at her side during visits to venues ranging from a candy store to a drug rehabilitation center, recognizable in his blue, zip-up jacket bearing the words “Ski NH.” On Thursday, the two stopped by Robie’s Country Store, a century-old building on the Merrimack River that has been a destination for presidential candidates since the 1970s.
Amid a scrum of cameras squeezed next to shelves of jams and pasta, Sununu called Haley “my new best friend.”
Catherine Johnson, 64, shook hands with Haley and Sununu. His endorsement “made a huge difference” to the primary race, she said. Johnson is a Democrat, but she credited Sununu for his leadership during the coronavirus pandemic and voted to reelect him as governor even when all her other votes went to Democrats.
“He has this genuineness about him,” she said.
Robert Clark, a 76-year-old Republican from Manchester, said his top priority “is stopping Trump” from winning the presidency a second time because he believes Trump is “incompetent.”
But Clark wasn’t thrilled about his choices on the GOP side. Then last year, Sununu endorsed Haley — prompting Clark to give her a fresh look.
“She just seems to be a competent person,” Clark said at his doorstep on a recent morning as he spoke to a canvasser with Americans for Prosperity Action, the flagship political group of the Koch network that is supporting Haley’s bid.
“I wanted an alternative, and I guess when Governor Sununu put his support behind her, then I decided,” he said. (If the general election becomes a rematch between Trump and Biden, Clark said, he will support Biden).
Trump has tried to blunt Haley’s appeal with a fusillade of messaging on issue after issue, aimed at casting her as an opponent of his MAGA movement who can only prevail with the support of Democrats and independents (in New Hampshire, undeclared voters can vote in either party’s primary).
By Sununu’s count, he has done more than 100 interviews as part of a strategy to counter Trump’s megaphone. “Trump has his zealots, his cult — whatever you want to call it — on Newsmax and these stations that will fight for him tooth and nail,” Sununu said.
In interviews with The Washington Post, Sununu offered empathy for some of the other candidates, along with unvarnished opinions. He called Vivek Ramaswamy, who dropped out of the race after Iowa, a “misogynistic fool.” DeSantis got “better on the trail” but didn’t spend enough time in New Hampshire to earn Sununu’s endorsement. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who left the race before Iowa, had only one message and put all his focus on New Hampshire, Sununu said, describing Christie as “absolutely obsessed with being president.”
Sununu has been imbibing political strategy since childhood. His father, John H. Sununu, served as the sometimes combative governor of New Hampshire from 1983 to 1989. He then became chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush — the reward for helping Bush win the 1988 New Hampshire primary after what Sununu called a “see me, touch me, feel me” campaign, one much like Haley’s. The governor’s older brother, John E. Sununu, was a member of Congress from the state from 1997 to 2009, the last six years as senator.
After graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the younger Sununu briefly attended film school before dropping out and walking the length of the Appalachian Trail from north to south (his trail name, a tradition among hikers, was “Fade Out,” a reference to his short-lived film career).
He worked as an environmental engineer in California before returning home to New Hampshire. He later ran a ski resort and won a seat on the state’s Executive Council before being elected governor in 2016. Even as his state trended more Democratic in national elections, he held on as a highly popular Republican.
Sununu has delivered on conservative priorities such as expanding charter schools and cutting taxes. He has vetoed attempts to tighten the state’s gun laws. In 2021, he signed into law a ban on abortions after 24 weeks but rejected calls to outlaw the procedure earlier in pregnancy, as many Republican-led states have done since the fall of Roe v. Wade.
Thomas Rath, a former Republican attorney general of New Hampshire, described Sununu as “an aggressive fiscal conservative with a smile” whose buoyant personality is hard to resist.
Sununu doesn’t take opposition personally, Rath added: Even after a disagreement, he’ll call you up the next day and make a joke. “Then you can laugh about who the Red Sox ought to have in left field,” Rath said.
Republicans tried to recruit Sununu to run for a Senate seat in 2022 against incumbent Maggie Hassan (D), but he turned them down. Sununu has no second thoughts about not running. Nobody ever says “I really regret not joining the circus,” he told the Boston Globe last year.
Sununu described his own possible presidential run with detachment. “I gave it six months and I’m like, I don’t want to do this,” he said in an interview last week. But he also faced ideological impediments that would have made it difficult to succeed in Republican primaries, including having described himself as “pro-choice.”
Running for president “would have been a great story and a fun ride, but it wasn’t right,” Sununu said. “I don’t need to pile on the me, me, me campaign to help myself anymore. It’s really got to be about the bigger picture.”
The bigger picture is the uphill battle to steer the party away from Trump. Yet Sununu says he will still vote for Trump if he is the Republican nominee. “There’s no question we’re better off without Biden in the White House,” he said.
Sununu jokes that after the November election, he’s going to put a suggestion box in the foyer of his office to solicit ideas for his future. But he’s leaning toward something in the private sector, maybe as an adviser to large companies. And perhaps some kind of media role to “keep my fingers in the political pie a little bit.”
Of course, if Haley pulls off an upset in the Republican race — and in the general election — all that could change.
After an event at an American Legion post in Rochester, N.H., Haley stayed to take selfies and speak with anyone who wanted to until there was no line left. Sununu shook hands, greeted people he recognized and gave an impromptu media briefing.
As the crowd thinned, Kathy Easler, 77, approached Sununu and asked if he would consider being Haley’s vice president. He demurred. “Washington is not a fun place,” Sununu said. “Nikki can handle Washington, she’s got the grit.”
Easler turned to find her granddaughter. She was not convinced by Sununu’s reluctance. “Hey, we’ve all heard them say no before,” Easler said with a knowing smile, then headed back out into the January night.

Moyer,"January 21, 2024 at 8:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/21/dc-homeless-shelter-winter-weather-cold/,"LeNard Johnson, 47, has a job interview. He’s an IT guy who’s worked for the federal government, he says, sometimes with a security clearance. But it’s been hard to find work even after spending hours scrolling ZipRecruiter.   He needs this virtual interview, at 5 p.m., to go well.
He checks in at the homeless shelter, where he’ll change into a suit. The intake manager at the shelter — Central Union Mission, a 170-bed facility in a former school, knows Johnson and waves him through. Tonight, he has a spot in a dormitory with about a dozen other men.
Johnson has been at the shelter every night since he got off a waiting list around Thanksgiving. If he misses check-in, he risks losing his bed. The sun is setting, and the first snow in more than 700 days coats the ground.
On a freezing night in a city with nearly 5,000 homeless people, Johnson does not want to be where he found himself last fall during his first extended bout with homelessness — riding the Silver Line from end to end to get some sleep.
He has to stay housed.
He has to stay sober.
He has two kids.
Every liquor store is a temptation.
“I’m trying,” he says.
Robert Vaughn, 69, lines up for dinner at Central Union: Beef stew. Despite his labored breathing — Stage 3 emphysema — he’s jubilant. He says he’s been sober for 11 months, one of his longest stretches since he left home around 1967.
Central Union, founded in the 1880s to serve veterans of the Civil War, was a 14th Street landmark until about a decade ago, when it was replaced by boutique condos. Its current location — two blocks from Union Station and across the street from a luxury hotel — serves as a reminder of people in desperate straits who are stranded among policymakers, commuters and tourists at the foot of Capitol Hill.
After years living in other D.C. shelters — “hellholes,” Vaughn says — he’s in a long-term recovery program at Central Union. He lives in a four-man suite on the shelter’s third floor, having graduated from the second-floor dormitory. He’s made amends with his four adult children and agreed to a no-fault divorce from his wife. He says he no longer smokes crack. He is no longer, in his telling, a “hurricane” ruining women’s lives.
“I used to live a different way,” he says. “Now, I’m doing all the things I was told to do years ago.”
Johnson and Vaughn report to Central Union’s chapel, separated from the cafeteria by a collapsible wall. Johnson reports that his job interview went well. He was told he’s at the “top of the shortlist.”
“I try to remain optimistic about any opportunity,” he says. “If not, depression sets in.”
Ahead of a nightly ritual — the reading of the shelter’s rules — a chaplain welcomes guests.
“You’re making it in this cold,” he says. “Thank Him for heat. Thank Him for shelter. Can we praise the Lord tonight?”
A nondenominational Christian service begins. The service’s leader — the Rev. Norman Thomas of the First Baptist Church of Glenarden, Md. — gives a sermon about names. Johnson scrolls a job website as he listens.
The names God gave His creations have power, Thomas says. Those who carry these names must live up to them. In the film “Black Panther,” he says, Prince T’Challa defeated a formidable enemy by invoking the power of his mighty name.
“What is your name?” Thomas asks. “What does your name mean for you?”
Ahead of lights out, Johnson and Vaughn report to a lobby on Central Union’s second floor. The men have volunteered for housekeeping duties.
Johnson monitors the line for mandatory showers, making sure no one goes over the seven-minute limit. Vaughn polices the dormitory “tub rooms,” where residents stow personal items in plastic containers.
Vaughn takes the elevator down to a small lobby crowded with chairs and a TV.  A handful of sleeping mats  cover  the  floor. These are for “hypothermia” visitors — men who cannot be turned away during a hypothermia alert even though the dormitory is full. In the semidark, they  huddle in their coats with their bags surrounding them.
At  7 a.m., it’s time to figure out where to spend tomorrow.
The lights are on, but it’s still a cold world."
DIERSZGVGH_6M3V33RUMKL1R1Y,Virginia’s Vietnamese Americans get head start celebrating Lunar New Year,Joe Heim,"January 20, 2024 at 6:08 p.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/20/lunar-new-year-asian-american-vietnamese-virginia/,"Ben Tonthat did not grow up wanting to be a lion, but on Saturday, he got to be one anyway.
The cybersecurity and engineering major at George Mason University donned a fuzzy canary-yellow costume lion head with a pink cardboard tongue sticking out of its mouth and pranced and prowled around the Dulles Expo Center, accompanied by an enthusiastic contingent of drum thumpers and cymbal clashers. The cacophonous dance in the 100,000-square-foot venue helped announce the beginning of the La Vang Lunar New Year Festival, one of the largest annual gatherings in the Mid-Atlantic for Vietnamese immigrants and their families.
Lunar New Year doesn’t actually arrive until Feb. 10, but for Vietnamese Americans in Virginia, there was no time like the present to start celebrating Tet, their most important holiday.
“It’s a huge deal in our community and it’s pretty fun to be a part of it,” said Tonthat, who has performed with the lion troupe for the past two years. “It all connects me more with my culture and I like that.” As he and another lion made their way through the hall, young children deposited dollar bills in their mouths for good luck.
Celebrate Lunar New Year in D.C. with art, food and dancing lions
More than 20,000 people were expected to attend this weekend’s festival to listen to Vietnamese folk and new music, purchase traditional clothing and New Year’s gifts and eat everything from shrimp and crab soup, pho and banh mi to bubble tea, spring rolls and a Lunar New Year specialty: sticky rice with pork and mung beans wrapped in banana leaves.
Reaching young Vietnamese Americans such as Tonhat is one of the main goals of the event, said organizer Thinh Dinh, 60, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission engineer who spends many evenings and weekends teaching Vietnamese to teens and preteens at Our Lady of La Vang Mission in Chantilly. The congregation, which has put on the event since 2016 and is raising funds to build its own church, is a popular social and spiritual center for many Catholic Vietnamese Americans in northern Virginia.
“We want to present an event for the whole Vietnamese community,” Dinh said. “It’s a time to remember our ancestors and get together with family. Here it can be isolating for Vietnamese so it’s a chance for them to come out and meet other Vietnamese and anyone else who wants to experience our culture.”
At the opening ceremony, a dozen men and women stood side by side wearing traditional tunics called ao dai — the men in midnight blue, the women in bright fuchsia. They walked to the stage accompanied by solemn drumming and the slow beat of a gong. There, they paid respects and gave thanks to their ancestors, an integral moment of Lunar New Year festivities.
Celebrations of Lunar New Year in the United States take on extra meaning for Asian American communities and their families because it is a way of maintaining traditions and passing them to the next generation, said Xinqian Allison Qiu, a doctoral candidate in American Studies at the University of Maryland. Her research includes a focus on Lunar New Year celebrations.
“We want to celebrate with a large surrounding of people who cherish the same heritage, to celebrate the same culture,” said Qiu, who came to the United States 15 years ago and now lives in Washington with her family. “It’s a very important way of showing the heritage of resilience and then it’s also their way to tell America that this is my country as well.”
Hung Cao, who is running in the Republican primary to challenge Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), campaigned for votes but attended the event mostly to celebrate with other Vietnamese Americans. “We are all proud to be American, but we want to hold on to our heritage as well,” he said. The new year, he said, brings a fresh start. “Tet is something that brings us all together.”

Peter and Bella Ta drove up from Spotsylvania County with their three young children, Lillian, Natalie and Gabriel. The Tas are transplanted Californians who have lived in Virginia for four years. In California, they said, huge celebrations in the Vietnamese community were regular events, but they are less common on the East Coast.
“It really reminds us of California and it’s really nice for our kids to experience this cultural aspect the same way we did when we were younger,” Peter Ta said. “It’s good for them to have an experience of Vietnamese traditions.”
Phuong Dinh, 36, a physician from Warrenton, arrived at the Dulles Expo Center a little after noon Saturday with her husband, Michael Egan and their young children in tow. “I want to make sure my kids know a little bit about their culture and their background,” she said. Dinh added that she and her mother, Phuong Nguyen, are teaching the children Vietnamese. Laughing, Dinh pointed to her husband and said, “We’re trying to teach him too.”
For Nguyen, it’s essential to make sure that the next generation of Vietnamese Americans, including her grandchildren, know more about their history and where their immigrant grandparents came from.
“I think our culture is so beautiful and our language is beautiful,” Nguyen said. “If we can introduce it to the young children, hopefully they can carry it on.”

Then she started to cry.
“To have this kind of historic gift that really signifies her belief in Spelman and the power that it has to change lives … was just overwhelming,” Gayle said. “I was overwhelmed with joy, with excitement and just deeply grateful.”
It was the largest gift in the school’s history, and what Spelman called the largest to an historically Black college or university. And it came just days after a $100 million gift to the United Negro College Fund, the largest unrestricted private gift the nonprofit has ever received.
Over the past several years, after the pandemic and the racial reckoning after the 2020 killing by police of George Floyd, there have been numerous multimillion-dollar donations to HBCUs and organizations that support them. Some advocates were hopeful that might signal an inflection point after many years of financial struggles.
“I think there’s just kind of an awareness that important investments in education must include investments in historically Black colleges and universities,” said Michael L. Lomax, the president and chief executive officer of the United Negro College Fund.
Some prominent examples: In 2020, Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings and his wife, Patty Quillin, announced $120 million in gifts divided among Spelman, Morehouse College and UNCF.
Later that year, author MacKenzie Scott gave more than $800 million to HBCUs and colleges and universities serving Latino and Native American students. (Scott’s ex-husband Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)
Tyrone McKinley Freeman, an associate professor of philanthropic studies at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, said the recent gifts are a good indication that calls for more investment in HBCUs are being considered, and taken seriously.
“We’re in a period now where all of higher education is under a spotlight, and everybody’s asking these questions of whether or not a degree is worth it,” Freeman said. “While this is new for some institutions, HBCUs have always had those kinds of questions asked of them — they always operated under that kind of hostile or difficult funding environment.”
Kamala Harris, BLM protests put a new spotlight on HBCUs. Many now hope for a financial reckoning.
The support for HBCUs still lags the most eye-popping donations in the hundreds of millions that Ivy League and other well-known schools sometimes notch — or even higher, such as the $1.1 billion gift from John and Ann Doerr to Stanford University in 2022, and $1.8 billion from Mike Bloomberg to Johns Hopkins University in 2018.
When Lomax got an email from the head of a foundation asking for 15 minutes of his time, his first thought was, “Oh, no — what is this meeting?”
He was about to board a flight at the time of the virtual meeting. After searching for a quiet place, he propped his iPad on a ledge, and nervously dialed in.
He saw N. Clay Robbins, the Lilly Endowment’s chairman and chief executive officer — several of their other leaders on the Zoom as well. And they were smiling. Robbins told him that the board had voted to give a $100 million unrestricted gift to UNCF’s $1 billion capital campaign.
“I couldn’t scream and yell,” Lomax said. “ … I didn’t scream out, ‘Glory, Hallelujah!’
“I just felt it.”
The gift will be used to help its 37 member HBCUs, and the first investment in a planned $370 million pooled fund to raise each institution’s endowment by $10 million.
The immediate impact of the gift will be to raise each school’s endowment by $2.7 million — doubling the endowments of several. The median endowment of UNCF member schools currently is about $16 million, according to UNCF.
Meanwhile, the median endowment in 2022 at private nonprofit colleges and universities was about $215 million, according to the National Association of College University Business Officers.
“There are 102 historically Black colleges in the country, public and private,” Lomax said. “If you added their all of their endowments up, it’s just over $4 billion. Harvard has a $50 billion endowment.”
At Spelman, students cheered and balloons bounced down when the surprise gift was announced Thursday at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the Spelman name. (The school was renamed after a $250 gift from John D. Rockefeller in the late 1800s. His wife’s parents, whose last name was Spelman, had been prominent abolitionists.)
The bulk of the donation from Ronda Stryker, a business executive, philanthropist and longtime Spelman trustee; and her husband, William Johnston, who is the chairman of Greenleaf Trust, will be used for endowed scholarships. Seventy-five million dollars will go to scholarships for future students, and the remainder will be used for other goals including a focus in public policy and democracy and improving housing for students.
Gayle said Stryker preferred not to talk about the gift at this time, wanting to keep the focus of attention on Spelman.
Forty percent of their students have exceptional financial need, and 80 percent receive some kind of financial aid, Gayle said. “We hope this will help bridge the gap.”
Breah Banks, a senior and president of the student government at Spelman, said she knew firsthand the impact endowed scholarships can have on students. She said she had initially been awarded a scholarship covering tuition, but after the gift from Hastings and Quillin, she was given an even more generous scholarship with housing and other educational costs covered as well. Thinking of future students getting similar opportunities and relief from financial burdens, she said, “I am truly grateful.”
Banks, who went to a predominantly White high school in Minnesota, said she had many reasons for choosing Spelman. One moment that stood out was when she was visiting campus and listened to students in an honors English class talking about what Blackness meant to them — and not having that conversation just because it was Black history month. “I knew that I really wanted to be seen, felt and heard at the institution that I would attend for the next four years in college,” she said, “and Spelman College was that place.”"

Neither the officer nor the suspect was seriously injured, police said.
Dennis Burkett, 51, of Brandywine and Robert Burkett Jr. 50, of Temple Hills have been charged with attempted murder of a police officer, the police said Monday in a statement.
The incident began when two patrol officers stopped about 1:50 a.m. Sunday to investigate a possible burglary in progress at a closed gas station in the 7600 block of Crain Highway, according to Monday’s police account.
A burgundy van was backed into the front door of the business, and a van had been used in a burglary in that area about an hour earlier, the police said.
After the officers pulled into the gas station’s parking lot, two people ran out and got into the van, the police said. One officer tried to remove the driver from the driver’s seat and ordered the vehicle stopped, police said.
However, the van began to leave, with the officer unable to free himself from the area around the driver’s side door, according to the police account. The second officer fired a shot from his service weapon, and the driver was hit. Police identified him Monday as Dennis Burkett.
The van kept going, police, said, crossed Crain Highway and drove onto South Osborne Road, while continuing to drag the officer. The officer fell from the van on South Osborne Road.
A pursuit was authorized, and ended after 30 minutes when the van became disabled at Branch Avenue and Bonita Street in Temple Hills.
Police said the two Burketts were taken into custody.
Dennis Burkett was taken to a hospital and released later Sunday, the police said. The injured officer was treated for minor injuries and was also released, the police said.
A pry bar and other implements described by the police as burglary tools were found at the gas station, police said. In addition, police said, the store’s ATM “had been tampered with.”
The van involved had been stolen, according to the police statement.
Police said that “methodologies” used Sunday appeared similar to those in other cases in the county. They said they are continuing to investigate.
The two Burketts were charged with second-degree attempted murder, assault, breaking and entering, and auto theft, the police said.
They were being held without bond, according to the police."
HMKUU19V2O_OWYUA337IJ9WAK0,Trump recruits South Carolina leaders to undermine Haley ahead of N.H. primary,Sabrina Rodriguez,"January 21, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/21/trump-south-carolina-new-hampshire-primary/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — The New Hampshire primary may be two days away, but Donald Trump is surrounding himself with South Carolina Republicans.
A day after receiving the endorsement of Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), a former opponent, Trump on Saturday deployed an even larger show of support from South Carolina to try to undercut former U.N. ambassador and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley here in New Hampshire and assert his dominance in the primary, which heads to the Palmetto State next month.
Standing before hundreds of people at a rally here, Trump was joined onstage by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster; Pamela Evette, the state’s lieutenant governor; Alan Wilson, the state’s attorney general; South Carolina House Speaker Murrell Smith; and Curtis Loftis, the state treasurer. Reps. Russell Fry, William Timmons and Joe Wilson, all U.S. House members from South Carolina, also flanked the former president.
Trump introduced the officials, praising each of them and highlighting their rank in Haley’s home state. He emphasized that they had come to New Hampshire to support him because they “understand that I am the only candidate in this race who can save America from every single Biden disaster starting on Day One.”
“To the people of New Hampshire: All you need to know about Nikki Haley is that every globalist, liberal, Biden supporter and ‘Never Trumper’ is on her side — and virtually every single leader … in her home state of South Carolina is on our side. We have almost everybody,” he said after four of them, including McMaster, spoke on his behalf.
Trump joked that he had invited the South Carolina leaders to attempt to get in their good graces ahead of the state’s primary next month. “I’m kissing a--,” he said, laughing.
McMaster said that he and the South Carolina delegation were here to make the point that the majority of the people of South Carolina were with Trump — not the former governor.
“That’s why we are here. We are here for one reason: Those great philosophers, the Spice Girls, tell us what you want, what you really, really want. Well that’s what we’re here to do: to tell you what we in South Carolina want,” said McMaster, 76, quoting the British pop group’s song “Wannabe,” which was met with a standing ovation from the crowd.
“New Hampshire is for Trump. South Carolina is, too. We’ll see you at the finish line,” he said.
Haley on Saturday waved off Trump’s efforts to undermine her ahead of his rally with the delegation from her home state. When Haley was specifically asked about the decision by McMaster — who served as lieutenant governor during her time as governor — to come to campaign for Trump, she quipped in response: “I’m sorry, is that the person I ran against for governor and beat? Just checking.”
“Yet another nearly 80-year-old that’s trying to make an impact,” added New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R).
Haley argued that legislators in South Carolina were not backing her because, as governor, she forced their hand to back an ethics reform and called out their “wasteful spending.”
“There’s a reason there’s no love for me from the legislature in South Carolina,” she said during a campaign stop in Peterborough.
On congressional lawmakers backing Trump, she said she was not surprised because she is calling for more accountability from elected officials. There should be term limits and mental competency tests, and members should not get paid if they fail to pass a budget on time, she said. Haley on Saturday also questioned Trump’s mental fitness.
Haley’s odds of stopping or slowing his momentum lie here in the Granite State, where independent voters make up about 39 percent of the electorate. Haley’s lead among this bloc has narrowed in recent days, and she continues to trail Trump among Republican voters in polls.
At his rallies, Trump has repeatedly sought to diminish Haley’s résumé and said that he appointed Haley to become his U.N. ambassador to allow McMaster to become governor. McMaster was lieutenant governor at the time.
Trump’s move was similar to a strategy he deployed against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis this summer when he was viewed as his strongest challenger in the GOP primary. Trump brought members of the Florida delegation who had endorsed him to the Iowa State Fair.
In a not-so-subtle mention of Haley on Friday, Trump noted when he first introduced Scott: “I’m running against somebody from his state.” The senator came on the stage energetic, drawing an enthusiastic reception from the crowd as he told them, “We need a president like Donald Trump.”
Scott’s endorsement comes after the U.S. senator ended his own presidential bid in November. During his campaign, Scott — dubbed the “happy warrior” by many of his allies — refrained from criticizing the former president directly, with the exception of Trump’s reluctance to endorse a 15-week abortion ban. Scott sought to draw a contrast with Trump primarily through his tone, offering an optimistic vision of the country going forward.
Haley acknowledged that it was a letdown to see Scott, whom she appointed to the Senate in 2012, come out in support of Trump’s bid for a second term.
“Was I disappointed? Of course I was,” she said at the Peterborough campaign stop.
Supporters at the Trump event were pleased to see leaders from the Palmetto State coming to New Hampshire on behalf of the former president — even if they weren’t familiar with everyone who took the stage.
“I say: The more, the merrier,” said Chris Levesque, 52, who attended the rally with his sister.
Gerry Blaisdell, 55, who waited for hours in the cold to attend the rally with her friend, said Trump was sending the right message by showing the widespread support he has beyond New Hampshire.
“The other side is going to come after him for as long as they can, so he needs this united front with him,” she said.

JZO4XU3UJJ_0PXRYMV40H7RFWV,Elise Stefanik generates VP speculation as she campaigns with Trump,Marianne LeVine,"January 21, 2024 at 5:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/21/elise-stefanik-trump-vp-new-hampshire/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Standing in a packed room at the Trump campaign office here, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) delivered a quintessential Trumpian speech. She drew cheers from the crowd as she declared that “we need to build the wall.” She ripped “Bidenomics.” And she reiterated Donald Trump’s claims of a weaponized judicial system.
“They’re trying to remove President Trump from the ballot in multiple states; you see them, witch hunt after witch hunt,” she told supporters. “They’re doing it because they know that Donald J. Trump, President Trump, is going to win and beat Joe Biden.”
One person cheered “VP” as she finished her remarks. When she approached reporters, Stefanik echoed Trump again, asking attendees, “Trump supporters, are we ready to take questions from the fake media?” It was Stefanik’s second public appearance in the Granite State in less than 24 hours for Trump, as he and his allies are hoping for a decisive win Tuesday that will bring an early end to the Republican nomination process.
Stefanik, the No. 4 House Republican, symbolizes the shift of GOP officials in the Trump era. Once a Trump critic — a view for which she was celebrated among Republicans who had opposed his 2016 presidential bid — Stefanik has risen within the party over the years and fully embraced Trump. But her drop-in trip to New Hampshire, as well as visits from Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), has prompted speculation beyond the state’s primary: Whom would Trump pick as his vice president if he becomes the nominee?
Stefanik's climb to GOP leadership, embrace of Trump come at personal cost
During Trump’s 2016 campaign, Stefanik said that his behavior toward women was “offensive” and “just wrong,” and that she would “absolutely oppose” some of his foreign policy. She defied Trump on several policies, including her party’s tax cut bill, and disagreed with his pledge to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.
But her view and approach toward Trump changed. Her evolution from moderate to MAGA began after Democrats sought to impeach him over his effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his rival, Biden. Stefanik thought the impeachment was a sham and was furious about how Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, led the effort, a sentiment widely shared by Republicans, according to numerous GOP aides and lawmakers who have spoken to her. It led her to become a fierce Trump defender in Congress and on conservative television. Trump embraced her as a “Republican star.”
When asked about being a potential choice for vice president in a phone interview, Stefanik responded: “I’d be honored to serve in the Trump administration in any capacity,” saying she’s “focused on being a surrogate.” Stefanik added that she is friends with other surrogates whose names come up as potential vice-presidential picks, adding that “we are showing a full-court press.”
Nikki Haley says being Trump’s vice president is ‘off the table’
Even as Trump seemed to suggest at a Fox News town hall in Iowa that he knew whom he’d pick, his campaign has tamped down speculation about whom it is eying for the vice presidency should Trump win the nomination.
“President Trump is focused on winning New Hampshire and securing the Republican nomination for president,” senior adviser Jason Miller said. “There will be a time and place for VP discussions, but that isn’t now. Anyone claiming to have some ‘inside scoop’ is, in fact, fake news.”
In the same interview with The Washington Post, Stefanik said her support for Trump “goes back a long way,” adding that she was proud “to be the leading voice” during the former president’s first impeachment. She and her aides noted ads from her Democratic opponent Mike Derrick in 2016 hitting her as the “only Republican woman from the Northeast to still support Trump” while quoting other Republicans who said they could not support him. At the time, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and then-Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), the other two GOP women elected to Congress in the Northeast, said they did not back Trump.
After GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) was removed from her leadership position in 2021 because of her constant criticism of Trump and the Republicans who defended him, Stefanik, who had become one of Trump’s most ardent allies even after his attempt to overturn the 2020 election and following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters, was elected by House Republicans to the position tasked with GOP messaging.
While Cheney had a more conservative voting record than Stefanik’s, she was ousted from her leadership position because she did not support Trump’s baseless claim that the 2020 election was stolen.
Science is revealing why American politics are so intensely polarized
But Stefanik has since passed over opportunities to run for higher leadership positions. In part, she realized it would be a tough fight against other candidates for whip, but she also made the calculation, according to people close to her, that a senior leadership position was going to be politically risky in a slim majority.
Stefanik’s rise followed her turnabout in her view on Trump’s claims about stolen elections. In 2016, after Trump said he was concerned about “rigged” polls showing him trailing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, she said she disagreed with Trump, who beat Clinton. But when Trump falsely said the 2020 election was stolen, she supported some of his claims.
She falsely said that in Georgia, “more than 140,000 votes came from underage, deceased and otherwise unauthorized voters in Fulton County alone,” a claim refuted by Georgia election officials and given four Pinocchios by The Post’s Fact Checker. She signed on to a failed lawsuit filed by Texas’s attorney general that sought the rejection of the presidential vote in Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania, all of which were won by Biden. She voted against certifying Biden’s win in Pennsylvania.
Speaking recently on NBC News’s “Meet the Press,” she stood by her vote against certifying the Pennsylvania results, accusing the state of “unconstitutional overreach.” After the interviewer noted that Stefanik had said that the Jan. 6 rioters “must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” she was asked whether she agreed with Trump’s statement that Jan. 6 was a “beautiful day” and that some of those who went to jail are “hostages.”
She responded by accusing NBC of being biased and said she believed that “Joe Biden will be found to be the most corrupt president in our nation’s history.” Pressed to answer the question, she responded: “I have concerns about the treatment of January 6 hostages.” The Trump team loved the interview, according to two people familiar with their sentiments.
Jan. 6 ‘hostage’ comments fuel House GOP divisions in tough election year
As for the 2024 election, Stefanik has said she would not commit to certifying the results. “We will see if this is a legal and valid election,” she said.
In the interview with The Post, Stefanik said she speaks to Trump “frequently” and described her district in New York as “the story of the evolution of the Republican Party and the growing support for President Trump that we are seeing from hard-working families.”
Many of Stefanik’s colleagues on Capitol Hill see her as angling to become vice president. One vulnerable New York Republican, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter candidly, said: “She’s auditioning.”
Another vulnerable House member suggested Stefanik has a balance to strike between being in leadership and pursuing higher ambitions.
“I think when you’re in leadership, it can look like it’s annoying for rank and file,” that member said. “But if you’re in leadership and you’re thinking of higher office, you’re going to have to throw out there what gets people’s attention.”
For the past several cycles, Stefanik has focused on electing more Republican women. She is also now working to ensure Republicans from her home state win reelection. And she has been encouraging House Republicans to endorse Trump, telling them it will help motivate the GOP base.
The Early 202: The Republicans who aren’t endorsing Trump
Stefanik recently received praise from conservatives for her role in a congressional hearing with the presidents of Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for their handling of antisemitism on campus. Stefanik later took credit for the resignations of Harvard President Claudine Gay and Penn President Liz Magill.
Resignation at Harvard latest but not last salvo in GOP war on colleges
At a campaign event in Concord, N.H., last week where Stefanik also spoke, Trump praised the New York Republican for her committee performance, even as he mispronounced her last name in the speech: “That was such a beautiful delivery, did she destroy those three people.”
Voters attending Stefanik’s campaign event Saturday said she was among the candidates they would like to see join Trump on the ticket, along with tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and other members of Congress.
Marie Tontodonato, 68, of Hampton, N.H., described Stefanik as a “front-runner.”
“She supports Trump, and she’s been pushing for him in Congress and her home state; she’s just like one of us,” Tontodonato said. As for vice president, she would like to see “either her or Kristi Noem,” she said, referring to the Republican governor of South Dakota. “I’d like to see a woman. And Ben Carson. Those are my three picks.”

Washington appears to have gotten the Israeli war cabinet to allow in humanitarian aid and, more recently, to reduce the intensity of its operations in Gaza. But on the essential issue — defining a strategic endgame for the war — the two are openly at odds. President Biden urges an eventual Palestinian state, and yet on Thursday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphatically ruled it out.
Mr. Biden is articulating a position that is both right on the long-term merits and favorable to his domestic political interests. Mr. Netanyahu is wrong about the issue — but has judged his political self-interest as accurately as Mr. Biden. In the wake of Oct. 7, Israelis have lost faith in peace processes, the country’s president, Isaac Herzog reminded the World Economic Forum at Davos last week. Sixty-five percent oppose a Palestinian state, according to a December Gallup poll.
The U.S.-Israel impasse makes little practical difference, since a Palestinian state was not imminent anyway, though it does illustrate the already evident need for new leadership in Israel. But developing disagreements within a different formerly united body — Israel’s war cabinet itself — could be consequential in the short run. Also on Thursday, cabinet member Gadi Eisenkot told an Israeli television interviewer that, so far, Israel has failed in its principal war aim — “We didn’t topple Hamas” — and that its other key goal, freeing Hamas’s hostages, is also unattainable without a negotiated deal that might include a humanitarian pause in fighting of as long as four weeks, quadruple the length of the pause that enabled 105 hostage releases in November. Those who contend otherwise, he said, are “trying to sell fantasies to the public.”
Mr. Eisenkot belongs to an erstwhile opposition party, National Unity, that agreed to join the war cabinet after Oct. 7. His words carry authority both because of his past role as the Israel Defense Force’s chief of staff — and because his own son and nephew have been killed fighting in Gaza. He tapped a rising sentiment in Israel that time is running out to free the hostages and that a war that ends without doing so will be a defeat.
This shows, to be sure, the malign tactical acumen of Hamas, which correctly anticipated that abducting men, women and children on Oct. 7 would complicate Israel’s response with a huge moral and military dilemma. After accounting for hostages freed separately from the November pause, and one rescued by Israel, it appears that, out of the 240 originally taken, there are 132 captives still left, a number which includes the remains of 27 believed to have died in captivity. Of those killed, half a dozen were executed by Hamas, according to Israel, and three others died when Israel’s own troops mistakenly shot them. (Six of the hostages are dual U.S.-Israeli citizens.) Hostages range in age from their late 80s to one year — which is how old baby Kfir Bibas is as of Jan. 18. Many are ill and at least one, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was badly injured when Hamas militants seized him from a music festival on Oct. 7. They are probably being held at sites scattered across Gaza and deep within Hamas’s tunnel network. Mr. Eisenkot acknowledged that, despite the IDF’s best efforts, this makes the idea of large-scale rescues “an illusion.”
These people cannot be forgotten, just as suffering Palestinian civilians cannot be. To speak with the hostages’ family members, as we have done recently, is to understand the limits of human anguish. Nothing justified the kidnapping of their loved ones — or Hamas’s refusal to release them unconditionally. And yet to hold those conversations is also to understand that these families’ desperation has instilled in them a kind of pragmatic clarity. If the Israeli military cannot destroy Hamas soon, and the only way to get the hostages out is a deal with Hamas, brokered by its patron Qatar, then do it, the family members we met with said.  But Mr. Netanyahu still doesn’t see it that way, having urged tougher conditions for a possible release in recent cabinet meetings, according to Israeli media.
As the clock ticks for the hostages, and Israeli protests against Mr. Netanyahu’s approach to the issue grow, the country needs a fresh political consensus to enable tough strategic choices. Which brings us to Mr. Eisenkot’s boldest suggestion: new elections, even in wartime. They might bring out the country’s divisions even more starkly, he acknowledged, but are nevertheless needed “to renew trust because right now there is no trust.”

LIRLWWM6N4_I8HB7TH0OI3VSEQ,Growing Oct. 7 ‘truther’ groups say Hamas massacre was a false flag,Elizabeth Dwoskin,"January 21, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/01/21/hamas-attack-october-7-conspiracy-israel/,"When she first heard about Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Mirela Monte was “appalled.” The South Carolina real estate agent and self-described holistic healer detests violence and is horrified by war and human suffering.
But as Monte read more in Uncensored Truths, a Telegram group with 2,958 subscribers active on foreign policy and the supposed perils of vaccination, her shock turned to anger. According to the forum, the news reports were wrong: Secretly, Israel was behind the massacre.
Monte now argues the Oct. 7 attack was a “false flag” staged by the Israelis — likely with help from the Americans — to justify genocide in Gaza. “Pure evil,” she said. “Israel is like a mad dog off a leash.”
The Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack is among the most well-documented in history. A crush of evidence from smartphone cameras and GoPros captured Hamas’s breach of the border — a strike Israel says left about 1,200 dead, the deadliest onslaught in the country’s history.
But Oct. 7 denial is spreading. A small but growing group denies the basic facts of the attacks, pushing a spectrum of falsehoods and misleading narratives that minimize the violence or dispute its origins. Some argue the ambush was staged by the Israeli military to justify an invasion of Gaza. Others say that some 240 hostages Hamas took into Gaza were actually kidnapped by Israel. Some contend the United States is behind the plot.
These untrue and misleading narratives have been seeded on social media, where hashtags and terms linking Israel to “false flag” — a staged event that casts blame on another party — tripled on services including TikTok, Reddit and 4chan in the weeks after the attacks, according to the Network Contagion Research Institute, a nonprofit tracking disinformation.
It’s bleeding into the real world: Demonstrators have shouted the claim at anti-Israel protests and have used it to justify removing posters of hostages in cities like London and Chicago. At a November city council meeting in Oakland, Calif., multiple residents disputed the veracity of the attack.
“Israel murdered their own people on October 7,” said Christina Gutierrez, an analyst in the city’s housing department, where some in the crowd shouted “antisemitism isn’t real.” Gutierrez did not respond to requests for comment.
The phenomenon is worrisome to Jewish leaders and researchers who see ties to Holocaust denial, the attempt to undermine the genocide that killed 6 million Jews during World War II, a belief that has surged online. They also see parallels to many pernicious, internet-driven conspiracy theories with antisemitic tentacles, including the QAnon conspiracy theory, which alleges “globalists” — a reference, some say, to Jews — used the pandemic to control the world, and disinformation about the 9/11 terrorist attack, which some fringe groups falsely argue was perpetrated by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.
Antisemitism was rising online. Then Elon Musk super-charged it.
“There’s a built-in audience that wants to deny that Jews are the victims of atrocity and furthers the notion that Jews are secretly behind everything,” said Joel Finkelstein, chief science officer at NCRI.
In Ukraine and other conflict zones, smartphones coupled with the velocity of social networks allow the public to witness events in real time, providing a sense of “ground truth” about far-flung incidents.
But social media is an equally potent tool for distortion — and the internet has a singular power to erase and twist history.
The head of International Relations for Hamas, Basem Naim, has falsely asserted that the group “didn’t kill any civilians” when it attacked Israel on Oct. 7, calling the claim “Israeli propaganda.”  Such false claims are finding an audience in a variety of online spaces.
“So basically the Hamas attack was a false flag for Israel to occupy Gaza and kill Palestinians,” reads a recent post on the Reddit forum r/LateStageCapitalism. “Expected behaviour from nazi wannabes.”
LateStageCapitalism is a community of left-wing activists that bills itself as “A One-Stop-Shop for Evidence of our Social, Moral and Ideological Rot.” But the claim can be found elsewhere on the internet, including publications critical of Israel like Electronic Intifada and Grayzone, and in messaging groups like Monte’s Uncensored Truths, which previously had been focused on pandemic-related gripes about vaccines and conspiratorial ideas about “globalists” ushering in a so-called New World Order. Right-wing Holocaust deniers also have latched onto the claims.
All cherry-pick evidence — some factual, some highly distorted — to push misleading narratives.
Israeli citizens have accused the country’s military of accidentally killing Israeli civilians while battling Hamas on Oct. 7; the army has said it will investigate.  But articles on Electronic Intifada and Grayzone exaggerated these claims to suggest that most Israeli deaths were caused by friendly fire, not Hamas.
One Grayzone story quotes an Israeli helicopter pilot describing difficulty distinguishing between civilians and Hamas on Oct 7. But the account distorts his testimony, in which he describes in Hebrew the dilemma of facing so many terrorists, said Achiya Schatz, director of FakeReporter, an Israeli watchdog organization dedicated to fighting disinformation and hate speech online.
An Electronic Intifada article from November also argues that “most” Israeli casualties on Oct. 7 were perpetrated by the Israeli army, basing the story, in part, on a YouTube clip of a man who describes himself as a former Israeli general. The clip refers to these outsider observations as “a confession.”
Electronic Intifada executive director Ali Abunimah said in an email: “It would appear that the reach and success of The Electronic Intifada in debunking and exposing the kind of pro-Israel propaganda routinely published by the Washington Post is now causing enough worry that you have been assigned to do a hit piece, in which labels such as ‘far-left’ and ‘anti-Israel’ will be deployed in order to try to misdirect your readers from our careful, factual reporting.”
Two weeks after the Hamas attack, filmmaker Aharon Keshales and his wife were taking a Saturday walk in the Primrose Hill section of London when they saw a woman ripping down hostage posters on a local bridge.
The couple, who are Israeli, spoke to the woman, who said she was removing the posters because the people had not been kidnapped by Hamas, according to video of the encounter reviewed by The Post. Keshales said he and his wife told the woman that even Hamas has admitted taking hostages. The woman grabbed the posters and walked away, according to the video.
Keshales said the incident — which has now been repeated in several cities, according to other videos posted on social media — left him disturbed.
“Everyone takes a side in every conflict, and that’s okay. But to put it on Israel — that’s a lie,” he said. “Maybe it’s easier to lie than to say, ‘You got what you deserve.’ Maybe it’s psychologically easier than saying, ‘I hate you.’”
Influencers who question the Holocaust are also among those sowing doubt about Oct. 7.
“Despite how it can appear sometimes I don’t actually have an axe to grind with the Jews,” said Owen Benjamin, a comedian who embraces far-right and antisemitic content, in a November post on X. “It’s just the insane Holocaust narrative and fake war atrocities by shoved down our throats as Americans by israel needs constant pushback,” he wrote in apparent reference to the atrocities of Oct. 7.
The current conflict also is helping Holocaust deniers find potential new allies: neo-Nazis have shown up at pro-Palestinian rallies in several states, seizing an opportunity, analysts said, to push antisemitic tropes. And they’ve deployed conspiratorial rhetoric that appeals to different audiences: Dan Hanley, who runs an organization that claims there were no Muslim terrorists involved in the 9/11 attacks, posted on X in November that the “Zionist Rothschild cabal et al was behind both the 9-11 and Oct. 7 false flags.”
Benjamin and Hanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Researchers warn that Oct. 7 conspiracy theories may follow a similar trajectory to Holocaust denial, which was waning before social media platforms propelled its resurgence a decade ago.
The election of former president Donald Trump — who fanned the flames of white nationalism with his defense of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville — along with lightly moderated tech services like Telegram, Discord and Gab, have given new life to Holocaust denial, said Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League. Mainstream platforms like Facebook and YouTube, which permitted such content under their policies until recently, have also played a role.
The platforms have enabled extremists to pitch their ideas to more people, replacing swastikas with more broadly palatable internet memes such as Pepe the frog.
This newer brand of antisemitism has led a generation of young people to dispute the Holocaust. One in five American adults under 30 say they agree the “Holocaust is a myth,” according to a YouGov/Economist poll conducted in the first week of December. More than a fifth say they believe that the Holocaust was exaggerated.
The long tail of Holocaust denial is a lesson in what may happen to Oct. 7, said Emerson Brooking, resident fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan think tank — despite copious real-time documentation of the attacks. Extremists will draw people who are genuinely concerned about the atrocities in Gaza, where over 24,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s invasion, down a rabbit hole of conspiracies and misleading information, he said.
“It’s generally indisputable that Hamas did something — the pro-Hamas camp can’t erase that entirely. But they can keep chipping away at it, and over time, you’re seeing a rewriting of history,” said Brooking, co-author of the book “Likewar: The Weaponization of Social Media.”
Erasures of historical memory by online tacticians are not confined to the Holocaust, researchers noted. In both Brazil and Argentina, right-wing groups have used disinformation campaigns to question settled facts about human rights abuses under the military dictatorships of the 1970s and ’80s. Popular YouTube influencers who support Argentina’s far-right President Javier Milei are increasingly arguing that the military’s torture and disappearance of tens of thousands of political adversaries during that period didn’t happen, according to Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group that recently asked Google to remove the content.
Finkelstein said that conspiracy theories about Oct. 7 are beginning to bleed into the tumult roiling U.S. universities over the war. On X, activists claim Jewish students and “zionists” are “staging false flag hate crimes” against themselves on college campuses. Grayzone called it a “contrived campus antisemitism crisis.”
While it’s reasonable to question the intentions and wartime tactics of Israel’s government, Finkelstein said, efforts to say Israel was responsible for Oct. 7 are part of a broader strategy by antisemitic extremists to undermine Jewish suffering.
“First you have to prove that your enemies aren’t really victims or oppressed,” he said. “If your enemies are victims or are oppressed, your worldview doesn’t make sense.”"
M1ATE28KG0_ATSD5Z4BHP0U5MP,Coptic Christians describe bus attack in Egypt: ‘Even the little children were targets’,Heba Farouk Mahfouz,"June 1, 2017 at 10:50 a.m. EDT",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/06/01/coptic-christians-describe-bus-attack-in-egypt-even-the-little-children-were-targets/,"The passengers on the bus heard a noise and thought a tire had exploded.
One young man got up to see what had happened, and why there was so much smoke. But before he could open the door, a bullet smashed the glass and hit him in the head. Several gunmen dressed in military-style uniforms then sprayed the bus with gunfire.
“In a second, they [the gunmen] got inside and shot at every living and moving object they could see,” said the driver, Boshra Kamel, 56, who was shot several times but survived by playing dead. “Even the little children were targets to them.”
The passengers — a group of Coptic Christians — were on their way to a monastery in the Minya region, 150 miles south of Cairo, when the gunmen attacked last Friday, killing at least 30 people and wounding 26. It was the latest incident in rising violence targeting the country’s minority Christians, who make up 10 percent of the population.
Days after the massacre, I spoke to several survivors who had been transferred to the Nasser Medical Institute in Cairo for treatment. Among them were 13 members of one extended family.
With bullets still in her body, Samia Adly, 56, walked slowly down a hallway filled with relatives, religious leaders and officials who wanted to show their support for the victims.
Adly and her husband, Mohsen Morkos, 66, an Egyptian American, had come to Egypt about two months ago. They were on their way to the monastery for blessings after his successful lung surgery in the United States, she explained. Traveling on the bus with them were two sons, Hany and Sameh, both in their early 30s, two grandchildren and other family members.
“My son Sameh was the first to be martyred,” she said. “They then shot Boshra, the driver, and then killed my husband.”
Her 4-year-old granddaughter, Marvy, and a nephew were also shot and killed.
After the militants boarded the bus, they asked survivors of the first round of gunfire to “either recite the Islamic shahada creed, live as practicing Muslims, or be killed,” said Nadia Shokry, 54, who was shot three times.
Defying their attackers, the passengers began to pray. “The more we prayed for Christ, the angrier they became and started shooting again and more violently,” Boshra said.
“We told them that we are Christians and we will die Christians,” Adly said as she clutched a cross that a monk had given her at the hospital.
The attackers targeted the male passengers and then began confiscating gold jewelry, money and mobile phones from the female survivors, before shooting at them, too, and running away.
“I begged my attacker to stop after he shot me the first three times. He told me to shut up or he would shoot me in the heart,” Shokry said. She watched as the militants killed her husband, Samuel, 53, her son Mina, 30, and her 18-month-old granddaughter, Maroska, the youngest victim of the attack.
Maroska's mother tried to shield her from the flying bullets, but the baby was shot in the heart, Shokry said.
“We forgive them,” Shokry said about the attackers. “I pray God touches their hearts and changes them so that they see the right path.”
The bus attack comes a month after a twin bombing that targeted two churches in Alexandria and Tanta left 49 people dead and scores injured. Last December, a bomb exploded in the main cathedral in Cairo, killing 29 people.
But Minya has experienced the largest number of sectarian attacks, with more than 75 targeting Christian residents in the past six years.
Hours after the bus ambush, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi warned in a televised speech that government forces would strike training camps for terrorists who attack Egypt, regardless of where they are. Later that night, Egyptian fighter jets targeted several militant bases in eastern Libya, the Egyptian foreign ministry said.
But Christian leaders and the families of survivors said that the state needs to do more.
“They [security forces] are always present and on guard after the attack takes place, and keep their security measures tightened for a short while after,” Minya’s Coptic Bishop Makarios told The Washington Post. “What we need is real effort exerted to ensure this is not repeated, not just solidarity and compassion.”

ON0J8PVZQC_Y66JMP296MC2CD4,Opinion Why the Israeli hostages could be the key to peace,Jennifer Rubin,"January 21, 2024 at 7:45 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/21/interviews-hostage-families-ceasefire/,"Simona Steinbrecher plays for me the recorded message from her 30-year-old daughter, Doron, on Oct. 7, the last time she heard from her. Doron whispers in Hebrew — “They caught me, they caught me, they caught me.” Her voice is frantic, the terror she is experiencing unmistakable. Doron was pulled by Hamas terrorists from under the bed where she was hiding in her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Since then, her parents have heard nothing. No video. Nothing from hostages already released.
Simona takes out a “kidnapped” hostage poster with her daughter’s picture. Doron is a veterinary nurse, a warm and caring person, her mother says. Still almost in disbelief, Simona tells me, “They came into her home, where you are supposed to feel safe.” The horrendous sexual violence on Oct. 7 and subsequent reports from freed hostages add to her burden. “I worry about her,” Simona says, “because she is a young girl.”
Like so many other relatives of hostages, Simona experienced her own terror on Oct. 7. After 13 hours in her safe room in her home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, her husband ran out to look for Doron, believing he saw her body. He ran back to Simona. “It’s not her,” he told her. Simona grimaces as she recalls the “horrible” smell of burning bodies that day. Another of Simona’s daughters, her son-in-law and their 6- and 3-year old children survived in their safe room, the terrorists unable to open the door.
Doron requires daily medicine. While a deal was struck to deliver medicine to hostages who need it, Simona has heard that instead it goes “to Hamas and ...,” her voice trails off. Her agony in not knowing, stranded in perpetual helplessness, is palpable.
The Steinbrechers’ ordeal is shared with loved ones of more than 130 other hostages, some known to have been killed, others whose condition, like Doron’s, is entirely unknown. The families have forged an emotional bond, with several members traveling to U.S. cities, meeting with lawmakers and talking in public forums. Simona says she has been heartened and moved by the reactions both on Capitol Hill, where a group met Wednesday with members of Congress, and among American Jewish groups. But their excruciating emotional torture has no end in sight.
Gili Roman, a slender, tall and gentle young man, shares one aspect of the experience with many hostage families. His sister Yarden was released, but Yarden’s sister-in-law, Carmel Gat, remains held in Gaza. Carmel was taken from her parents’ home in Kibbutz Beeri on Oct. 7. Her mother was murdered just outside it. Her brother, Alon, and his wife, Yarden, and their 3-year-old daughter were taken hostage, too. At one point while they were being transported to Gaza, they saw a chance to escape; Yarden handed their child to Alon, knowing he could run faster while carrying the girl. The terrorists recaptured Yarden, but Alon and their daughter got away. After nearly eight weeks of being held hostage, Yarden was released. Carmel is still being held.
Gili says Yarden is home, doing better. Even though she is not in the United States with him, he says, “I know I can text her and she’ll respond now. I know I can call her.” Just knowing she is not there makes all the difference. Among those who have had a relative freed, “almost all the families still have someone there,” he says. Their families are torn, incomplete.
Carmel is an occupational therapist, an empathetic soul and a social activist. Two boys later released recalled that she “helped with their mental state.” Gili says, “She taught them yoga. She helped them keep a journal.” At one point they were taken away to go to the toilet; unbeknownst to Carmel, they were released instead. She probably remains unaware of their fate.
I ask Gili what he would like to see happen. “The humanitarian release — the women, the elderly, the sick — must be completed,” he says. “There is no reason to keep them. There is no reason to keep any of them, but they were supposed to be released.” Beyond that, he says that if there is a Hamas offer to release all the hostages in exchange for ending the war, the Israeli government “absolutely needs to take it.”
He repeats, “The key is the release of the hostages.” Many of the families living on the kibbutzim in southern Israel were engaged in the peace movement. Many still hope for a greater reconciliation, an end to hostilities. And to the extent that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is presenting “difficulties” to such a deal, Gili says, that would be “very severe” for Israel.
From D.C., he goes to Los Angeles, and then he hopes to speak at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard. I ask if there will be ground rules. He says, “It is crazy at the top universities you cannot have an educational conversation.” Perhaps he will start one.
After all, if the pro-Palestinian groups would stop screaming and start listening, they would recognize that their greatest allies might be the families of the hostages. These relatives advocate for prompt release of their loved ones as a prelude to a greater regional peace. While members of the right-wing government may have other ideas, the hostages’ families tend not to blame Palestinians more generally. They just want the hostage ordeal to end — and the ordeal of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Jews and Arabs who simply want the nightmare of endless war to end. A hostage release and a cease-fire could then clear the way, eventually, for a more comprehensive peace with the Palestinians.
If U.S. lawmakers and friends of Israel want to be effective, success may lie in making certain the Biden administration does everything in its power to prevent Netanyahu from unnecessarily prolonging the war (which has greatly reduced in intensity in recent weeks). In this, the hostages’ relatives I met, countless Israelis, many U.S. politicians and much of the American Jewish community are united: Take a deal as soon as possible — for the sake of the hostages and for the sake of a larger peace."
SGDW23U25R_GYJS5IYRUFD4OSY,War in Gaza is making childbirth a nightmare,Louisa Loveluck,"January 21, 2024 at 1:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/21/gaza-childbirth/,"JERUSALEM — Walaa didn’t expect the birth of her fourth child to spark abject fear. But by the time her contractions started, the whole family was frantic.
There were no ambulances to be seen in the streets of Gaza’s Rafah City, she said, now so crammed with displaced families that there was barely any food left available for the 27-year-old.
When her uncle Wissam, a doctor, reached the tent where she had lived for weeks in the cold, he said, he could see they had run out of time. “I’m having the baby now,” she kept telling him. It was dark, and she was scared.
His cellphone flashlight was all they had to see by.
The humanitarian catastrophe caused by Israel’s three-month military campaign against Hamas in Gaza counts some 52,000 pregnant women among its greatest victims. As airstrikes push 1.9 million people into an ever-smaller corner of the besieged enclave, disease is spreading, famine is looming and levels of anemia are so high that the risk of postpartum hemorrhage has soared and breastfeeding is often impossible. Forty percent of pregnancies are high-risk, CARE international estimates.
Prenatal care is almost nonexistent — what remains of Gaza’s hospital network is on its knees, at 250 percent capacity and consumed with treating mass casualties from Israeli bombing. Far more women are giving birth outside of medical facilities — in displacement camps, even in the street — than inside them.
Damage to facilities and communications blackouts — the strip lost cellphone service for a week this month — have left Gaza’s health ministry unable to compile reliable data for infant or maternal mortality during the conflict. But doctors and aid groups say miscarriage and stillbirths have spiked.
“What we know about pregnancy-related complications is that it’s hard to prevent them in any setting, but the way that we save a woman and newborn’s life is we treat the complication quickly,” said Rondi Anderson, a midwifery specialist for the Project HOPE aid group.
“So women with access to emergency care are the ones that live,” she said. “Women that don’t, die.”
The only place that Wissam could find to deliver his terrified niece’s baby was a spot of cold earth between the tents. Aid workers hung bedsheets to give the woman a modicum of privacy. No one had been able to contact Walaa’s husband, and her mother was so scared that at times she had to look away. They cut the boy’s umbilical cord with an unsterilized scalpel and they filled tin cans with hot water to keep him warm. He weighed 7 pounds and Walaa named him Ramzy.
The family spoke on the condition that only their first names be used because they feared for their safety in the event that Israeli troops entered the town.
They fled their home in northern Gaza so abruptly that no one thought to grab clothes for the baby. This week, Ramzy was swaddled in a onesie outgrown by another child in the camp. He wailed as Walaa, still in pain from tearing during the birth, gingerly pulled herself upright.
The 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt after Hamas won control of Gaza had already made pregnancy and childbirth more difficult for expecting mothers. Before the current conflict, hospitals often lacked adequate equipment and training for neonatal staff, according to Medical Aid for Palestinians, and more than half of pregnant women were anemic.
Hamas fighters streamed out of the enclave on Oct. 7 to kill around 1,200 people in Israel and take another 240 hostage. Israel responded with a bombing campaign and ground war to eradicate Hamas, killing almost 25,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, to date.
The South African legal team that accused Israel before the International Court of Justice this month of committing genocide during the conflict argued that the obstruction of lifesaving treatment since Oct. 7 amounts to preventing births.
A lawyer for Israel called allegations that it is obstructing the delivery of food, water, fuel and other supplies critical for Gaza “tendentious and partial,” and said it was working “around-the-clock” to help scale up the volume of aid making it into the enclave.
Hanaa al-Shawa, 23, gave birth to her first child, Ayla, during the coronavirus pandemic, and the little girl, she said, brought her family a “glimmer of hope.” Shawa and her husband Mustafa, 25, were ecstatic when they learned in July that another child was on the way. The war began in October, and the future they dreamed of fell apart. “I had felt overwhelming joy,” Shawa recalled. “I did not realize that this joy would turn into great suffering.”
Nearly 20,000 babies were born in Gaza during the first 105 days of the war, UNICEF reported Friday. Delays in the delivery of lifesaving supplies, the U.N. children’s agency said, have left some hospitals performing Caesarean sections without anesthetic. Spokeswoman Tess Ingram said she met a nurse at Gaza’s Emirati maternity hospital who had helped with postmortem caesarians on six dead women.
“Seeing newborn babies suffer while some mothers bleed to death should keep us all awake at night,” Ingram told reporters Friday. “In the time it has taken to present this to you, another baby was likely born, but into what?”
“Becoming a mother should be a time of celebration,” she said. “But in Gaza it’s another child delivered into hell.”
For the five pregnant women interviewed by Washington Post reporters, fear that mother or baby might not survive suffused their waking thoughts — and made appearances in nightmares, too.
Shawa and Mustafa left their home in Gaza City’s Yarmouk Street in the second week of October. The Israel Defense Forces had ordered 1.1 million people in northern Gaza to move south for what it described as their own safety.
“I was afraid that I would miscarry because of the power of the rockets,” she said.
Many pregnant women made the 20-mile journey from north to south on foot, their legs swollen and joints heavy as they carried their luggage, three women who made the journey told The Post.
When Ayla was born, her family had a room full of toys ready for her. The room in which Shawa’s second child, a girl, will spend her first weeks, in a friend’s home in the Tel al-Sultan area, is tainted with asbestos, she said.
“We carried Ayla here in just the clothes she was wearing, and we don’t even have anything warm for her,” Shawa said. “If I’m unable to provide for her, what will I do for my next child?”
Rising food scarcity and malnutrition can cause potentially life-threatening complications during childbirth and lead to low birth weight, wasting, failure to thrive and developmental delays.
Shawa said she had only eaten tinned food, with no access to fruit or vegetables, since she left her home three months ago. Doctors have said her iron levels are low and her blood pressure is high. Mustafa searches daily but has found no suitable medication to control it.
Saja Al-Shaer, 19, started to feel like she was too young to become a mother. Her weight had dropped below 110 pounds, she was anemic, and her husband had not managed to get her medication, either. “He spent three days knocking on the doors of pharmacies,” she said. “I do not know if I will see this child or not.”
In late December, doctors at the al-Aqsa Hospital, 11 miles to the north, received a pregnant woman whose high blood pressure caused eclampsia and bleeding to her brain, according to Deborah Harrington, a British obstetrician who volunteered at the hospital with a Medical Aid for Palestinians team.
The baby was delivered by a C-section, Harrington said. The mother was still on life support when the physician left two weeks later.
“These women are presenting it in much more extreme condition,” Harrington said. “They’re just not getting hypertensive treatment. They’re not being screened for diabetes. If they’re diabetic, they’re not getting treatment for their diabetes.
“They know that actually accessing care, as it often is for women in conflict, is really difficult and fraught with danger. At night, there is often no light, so moving around is really difficult. You can’t call an ambulance because there’s no signal. The women I saw were really frightened.”
From the corner of the damp room where Walaa was tending to Ramzy on Friday, she worried about where they would find clean water or baby formula. Her family had looked everywhere for diapers, but come up empty. In Tel al-Sultan, Shawa was fixating on rumors that Israel’s army would direct them to evacuate again. The walking, the carrying, the sense that nothing around her was hygienic — it all frightened her.
But she had made one decision that no shortage or military orders could change. She would name her daughter after her sister-in-law, killed in an Israeli airstrike weeks earlier while trying to find shelter for her own children.
The girl, she said, would be called Heba. In Arabic, it means blessing from God.

U1912TN59P_4RPHPC42KR6F1B3,"Ron DeSantis ends presidential campaign, endorses Trump",Hannah Knowles,"January 21, 2024 at 3:04 p.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/21/ron-desantis-drops-out/,"MANCHESTER, N.H. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Sunday ended his once-promising presidential campaign, which steadily deflated as he struggled to connect with voters and persuade Republicans to swap Donald Trump for a younger, more disciplined champion of his ideas.
As he departed the contest, DeSantis endorsed Trump, who had relentlessly attacked the Florida governor with demeaning nicknames and charges that he was disloyal. His exit came just two days before voting in New Hampshire’s primary, where Trump appears to be closing in on another victory that would underscore his unrivaled grip on the GOP.
DeSantis, 45, had seemed to many Republicans like the most viable challenger to Trump after the 2022 midterms, when the governor won reelection by a landslide. But he started to lose ground in polling even before his official campaign launch in May — via a glitchy live chat that neatly embodied the way his grand plans were going awry.
“It’s clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance,” DeSantis said in a video message he posted Sunday afternoon on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. “They watched his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare to this day to attack him.”
He acknowledged “disagreements” with Trump — he spent the past year effectively calling Trump self-absorbed and ineffective — but suggested Trump’s remaining GOP rival, Nikki Haley, was worse. “We can’t go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents,” DeSantis said.
Even before DeSantis dropped out, Haley had emerged as the most viable challenger to Trump, polling closer to him in New Hampshire, where independents and moderate Republicans have given her a particular boost. But it’s not clear that she can pull off an upset, and she faces a tough road ahead. On Sunday she said DeSantis “ran a great race” and has “been a good governor.”
“Having said that, it’s now one fella and one lady left,” said Haley, a former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina governor.
Trump’s campaign said in a statement it was “honored” by DeSantis’s endorsement and said “it is now time for all Republicans to rally behind President Trump” against Biden.
DeSantis echoed Trump’s combative style and “America First” rallying cry while arguing he would be more electable, truer to conservative values and more effective at executing an agenda. He appealed heavily to the party base as someone willing to dig in on polarizing issues and go to battle with critics, the media and companies such as Disney. Struggling to make headway against Trump, he increasingly criticized the former president as “high risk” and “low reward” for the Republican Party.
But the second-term governor’s strategy fell flat as voters refused to leave Trump and even gravitated back to him, galvanized by outrage at the former president’s four criminal indictments. DeSantis alienated more moderate primary voters and donors who increasingly looked to Haley as a Trump alternative. Awkward interactions on the trail dogged DeSantis’s campaign, spawning viral videos and feeding his longtime reputation for aloofness.
A person deeply involved in DeSantis’s campaign, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak freely, said the campaign had a host of problems: no coherent message, warring advisers and a weak small-dollar donor program. DeSantis disliked courting donors and activists, this person said, and spent too much time on culture war issues. When he made adjustments, this person said, it was too late.
“At the end of the day, I don’t think any of it mattered with all the Trump indictments,” this person said. “It wasn’t a well-run campaign, but I don’t think the best-run campaign would have beaten Trump.”
DeSantis barely bested Haley for a distant second in Iowa, the state where he bet the vast majority of his time and resources. After Iowa, DeSantis confronted a difficult map with no obvious states to help him turn the tide.
And a sprawling operation that quickly amassed more than $100 million was plagued by infighting and distrust among different factions. DeSantis loyalists in Tallahassee clashed with the national consultants brought in to run a supportive super PAC — their tensions culminating in the late creation of a new group and the resignations and firings of top officials.
Ron DeSantis wanted to change the way campaigns were funded. Then the fights started.
Discussions about dropping out began last week as DeSantis’s team insisted he was staying in and turning his sights to South Carolina. The governor had told donors and allies he had enough money to get through South Carolina, whose GOP primary is Feb. 24, but senior staffers did not see a path to victory, according to a person familiar with the conversations. DeSantis was on track to post a single-digit percentage showing in New Hampshire, polls showed, which could have made his exit more embarrassing.
Most of DeSantis’s senior staff wanted him to drop out of the race, according to a longtime ally of DeSantis who talks to him regularly, who said the governor heard arguments that losses could further damage his brand. DeSantis is determined to still have a future in Republican politics, this person said, and didn’t want to be further damaged for 2028.
The Florida governor said he was resigned to the fact that Republican voters wanted to back Trump — and conservative news outlets and influencers were now against him. DeSantis told one adviser last week that he understood he would probably lose but was not ready to pull the cord.
“He wasn’t going to even break single digits in New Hampshire and had no path in South Carolina,” said a person close to the governor. “He was trying to tell everyone he was just going to hang out and wait for Trump’s legal challenges to play out, but that wasn’t feasible and he knew it.”
DeSantis returned to Tallahassee this weekend instead of campaigning in South Carolina through Sunday, as had been planned, according to several people familiar with his travel. His campaign had recently added a Sunday evening event in New Hampshire and tried to bat away speculation the end was near after the governor canceled morning TV appearances.
A GOP star for his strident opposition to coronavirus restrictions in Florida, DeSantis enacted an aggressive home-state agenda in the run-up to his campaign. He passed laws limiting discussion of LGBTQ+ issues in school, defunding college “diversity, equity and inclusion” programs and banning abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy, among many others. He called Florida “the place where woke goes to die,” touting the GOP’s dominance in the state and his nearly 20-point margin of victory in 2022, which led the New York Post to nickname the governor “DeFuture.”
Despite the national buzz, some Republicans who worked with DeSantis in Florida harbored doubts that his success in the state would translate on a national stage. As governor, they said, DeSantis was effective but ruthless and insular, was unenthusiastic about the social aspects of politics and kept a small circle of trust that centered on his wife. Replacing his campaign manager in August, DeSantis chose a loyal aide from the governor’s office without campaign experience — a shake-up that one fundraiser panned as “rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.”
Money was one of DeSantis’s big advantages when he entered the race. His campaign raised a formidable $8 million within 24 hours of launching. And more than $80 million left over from his gubernatorial reelection was transferred to his primary super PAC, Never Back Down, which took on many functions traditionally handled by campaigns and pushed the limits of legal restrictions on such an outside group’s ability to coordinate with their favored candidate. Never Back Down built a massive door-knocking program, took on some of his private plane costs and hosted many of DeSantis’s events, inviting him as a “special guest.”
But the campaign quickly ran into financial trouble after launching with a massive staff and setting expectations for fundraising too high. Layoffs commenced. The super PAC absorbed even more costs. Major donors were also backing away, some of them aghast at DeSantis’s signing of a six-week abortion ban or his statement to then-Fox host Tucker Carlson that the U.S. had no compelling reason to become “further entangled in a territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine.”
Billionaire Ken Griffin, a top funder of DeSantis’s gubernatorial reelection, was initially expected to make a major contribution to the DeSantis effort. But he grew critical of the governor. The largest known contributor to Never Back Down, businessman Robert Bigelow, pulled back and said in August that DeSantis had gone too far to the right. Griffin was most angry about DeSantis’s position on abortion, and multiple entreaties from DeSantis advisers could not win his support for the governor, according to people familiar with the situation. Wall Street leaders close to him then gave to Haley.
Trump’s indictments — starting in late March — marked the start of a polling decline for DeSantis with voters who approve of the former president. In polling and focus groups, DeSantis backers and other Republicans found that many seemingly logical lines of attack on Trump were ineffective.
Still, DeSantis eventually ramped up his criticism of Trump, a former ally whose endorsement once helped DeSantis beat the establishment candidate in Florida’s 2018 gubernatorial race. He used the second GOP debate in September to assail Trump’s absence, calling him “missing in action.” On the trail, he lamented that “Trump views everything through the lens of him.”
DeSantis banked on a strong performance in Iowa, the first state in the GOP nominating calendar. He had championed causes important to the evangelical voters who dominate the Republican caucuses there, and tapped into the Christian social conservative networks that powered past winners in the Hawkeye State. His legislative priorities in Florida echoed the priorities of Iowa Republicans, who also passed a six-week abortion ban that got caught up in the courts.
Trump, meanwhile, had attacked prominent conservatives in the state, including Gov. Kim Reynolds (R). Reynolds, who grew deeply frustrated with Trump, initially said she was staying neutral but then took the unusual step of endorsing DeSantis in November.
“We need a leader who is looking forward and not backwards,” Reynolds said at the November opening of a DeSantis campaign office near Des Moines. “We need a leader who will follow through on his promises and has a record of following through on his promises.” The phrase “no excuses” became a sort of unofficial campaign slogan as DeSantis leaned into the idea that he could get things done where others, particularly Trump, had fallen short.
DeSantis fulfilled his early pledge to campaign in all of Iowa’s 99 counties, racked up legislative endorsements and moved much of his campaign staff there in the fall. Yet Trump maintained a large lead in Iowa and everywhere else.
“DeSantis would make the best president,” said DeSantis donor and surrogate Dan Eberhart. “Unfortunately, he didn’t run the best campaign.”
As DeSantis struggled, the divisions in his team grew and spilled out into public view. Close allies of the governor launched a new super PAC late in the fall, and campaign leadership gave the new organization its blessing to effectively take over advertising. Sidelined and instructed to focus on field organizing, Never Back Down saw repeated shake-ups in leadership.
Its CEO resigned. His replacement was fired less than two weeks later, along with two other senior officials, and the chairman of the group’s board — former Nevada attorney general Adam Laxalt, a longtime friend of DeSantis’s — left, too. Scott Wagner, a Florida-based lawyer and college friend of the governor, took the helm and accused the fired officials of misconduct, prompting the group’s chief strategist, Jeff Roe, to join the exodus with a month to go before the Iowa caucuses. Roe alluded to Wagner’s comments and said they were false.
Trump’s team had taken particular delight in criticizing DeSantis — many of Trump’s former advisers had worked for the governor before falling out with him, and his team had a universal dislike for Roe.
For example, DeSantis had fired Susie Wiles, once his top aide, after he became governor in 2019 — and sought to persuade others to fire her as well, including Trump, the lobbying firm where she worked and the RNC.
In 2021, she took the helm of Trump’s operation when the former president was at the nadir of his political influence in the GOP. She has spent the past three years working to make him the GOP nominee. Late Saturday, as DeSantis canceled his events for Sunday, Wiles posted a two-word tweet, her first in months.
“Bye bye,” she wrote.

U4BO9L1ENR_HWTZ3V43VM6WTPM,"Shelling in eastern Ukraine kills 27, Russian-backed authorities say",Mary Ilyushina,"January 21, 2024 at 3:12 p.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/21/donetsk-ukraine-pushilin-russia/,"At least 27 people were killed Sunday when shells slammed into a Russian-controlled region of eastern Ukraine, local officials and Russia’s Foreign Ministry said.
Authorities in the city of Donetsk blamed the strikes on Ukraine’s military, saying the shells landed in a busy shopping area in the Tekstilshchik quarter. Twenty-five people were injured in the attack, according to Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-installed head of the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic, or DPR.
In a post on Telegram, Pushilin said 155mm and 152mm artillery rounds were fired at Donetsk from two regions west of the city, near the front line. There was no immediate comment from Kyiv, and The Washington Post could not immediately verify the claims.
Images from the strike’s aftermath showed bodies on the ground and in the snow, some covered with blankets or lying alongside crates of fruit. Parts of an adjacent building were heavily damaged, and the area nearby was blackened by the explosion. Officers from Russia’s Investigative Committee were also shown inspecting the scene and carrying away victims.
In a statement, Russia’s Defense Ministry called the incident a “brutal terrorist attack” and said it was carried out with “weapons supplied by the West.”
Russia’s campaign of heavy airstrikes and shelling has also killed thousands of civilians across Ukraine. Russia invaded the country in 2022 and illegally annexed some regions, including Donetsk, where pro-Moscow separatists have operated under Russian cover for years.
Since the invasion, Ukraine has clawed back some territory from Russian forces, but now the front lines are largely frozen as the conflict settles into a grinding stalemate.
In recent weeks, the two sides have relied on long-range missile attacks, including a massive Russian barrage on Ukrainian cities on Dec. 29. The next day, a combined rocket and missile attack on the Russian city of Belgorod killed at least two dozen people, in an attack authorities also blamed on Ukraine.
On Jan. 2, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had used almost 300 missiles and more than 200 drones in attacks on Ukraine since the bombardment on Dec. 29 — a tactic that could exhaust Kyiv’s air defenses.
On Sunday, Pushilin said the DPR would observe a day of mourning for the victims.
Ilyushina reported from Riga, Latvia.
The latest: The Ukrainian military has launched a long-anticipated counteroffensive against occupying Russian forces, opening a crucial phase in the war aimed at restoring Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and preserving Western support in its fight against Moscow.
The fight: Ukrainian troops have  intensified their attacks on the front line in the southeast region, according to multiple individuals in the country’s armed forces, in a significant push toward Russian-occupied territory.
The front line: The Washington Post has mapped out the 600-mile front line between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

VYWVZL4PDQ_O3OLWVJE20GQ7XV,Iranian-linked militants strike Iraqi base housing U.S. troops,Justine McDaniel,"January 21, 2024 at 7:50 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/01/21/iraq-air-base-attack-ain-al-asad-iran/,"Iranian-backed militants attacked an air base housing U.S. and Iraqi troops in western Iraq on Saturday, U.S. Central Command said — the latest incident targeting U.S. forces as tensions flare over Israel’s war in Gaza.
The militants fired rockets and ballistic missiles at Ain al-Asad Air Base in Iraq’s Anbar province around 6:30 p.m. local time, Centcom said in a statement. “Most” of the missiles were intercepted by the base’s air defense systems, the statement said, adding that some landed and at least one Iraqi service member was wounded.
U.S. personnel were being evaluated for traumatic brain injuries, according to Centcom, which did not respond to a request for comment on whether any U.S. troops were wounded.
The attack was claimed by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a coalition that includes militias backed by Iran. In a statement, the group said the strike was part of the broader resistance against the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq, as well as a response to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.
About 2,500 U.S. troops are deployed in Iraq to help combat remnants of the Islamic State, and roughly 900 are operating in Syria, where they advise and assist the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.
The incident on Saturday comes amid an increase in attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria in recent months, as the war has devastated much of Gaza, killing more than 25,000 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
Israel launched its onslaught after Hamas militants staged a brutal massacre on Israeli towns near the Gaza border, leaving about 1,200 people dead. The United States has offered unwavering support to Israel, providing weapons and ammunition for the fight and giving Tel Aviv diplomatic cover at the United Nations.
The war has fueled concerns of a wider regional conflict, with strikes and skirmishes taking place in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen — all of which are home to Iranian proxies that either operate freely or hold significant power.
Iranian strikes in Iraq stoke fears of further Middle East escalation
Earlier on Saturday, an explosion in Damascus, the Syrian capital, killed five Iranian military advisers, according to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, whose statement was carried by official media in Iran. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi later vowed to respond to Israel’s “cowardly terror act” in Syria, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
When asked about the strike in Syria, the Israeli military said it does not comment on foreign reports. Iranian state media reported that Tehran called the strike a “desperate attempt to spread instability” in the region and said it has the right to respond.
Video of the aftermath Saturday showed smoke rising above the city. Syrian state media said the blast struck a residential building in the western Damascus neighborhood of Mezzeh, which is home to diplomatic missions and aid agencies.
The attacks in Iraq could also destabilize the government of Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, whose appointment in October 2022 coincided with a pause in attacks on Iraqi bases hosting U.S. troops. Iranian-backed militias had stepped up their strikes under the Trump administration, as tensions between Iran and the United States soared.
After U.S. forces conducted what the Pentagon called a “self-defense” strike in Baghdad on Jan. 4 targeting a leader of an Iranian-backed militia, Sudani’s office said it would take steps to evict U.S. troops, Reuters reported. However, a few days after the strike, the Pentagon’s press secretary, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, told reporters he was “not aware of any plans” to withdraw American troops or “of any notifications by the Iraqi government to the Department of Defense.”
“We’re there at the invitation of the government of Iraq,” Ryder told reporters at a briefing several days later.

X8GSB0BAN9_2TWU6G3VXAAXJNP,"As Houthis vow to fight on, U.S. prepares for sustained campaign",Missy Ryan,"January 20, 2024 at 6:26 p.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/20/us-military-yemen-houthis/,"The Biden administration is crafting plans for a sustained military campaign targeting the Houthis in Yemen after 10 days of strikes failed to halt the group’s attacks on maritime commerce, stoking concern among some officials that an open-ended operation could derail the war-ravaged country’s fragile peace and pull Washington into another unpredictable Middle Eastern conflict.
The White House convened senior officials on Wednesday to discuss options for the way ahead in the administration’s evolving response to the Iranian-backed movement, which has vowed to continue attacking ships off the Arabian peninsula despite near-daily operations to destroy Houthi radars, missiles and drones. On Saturday, U.S. Central Command announced its latest strike, on an anti-ship missile that was prepared for launch.
The deepening cycle of violence is a setback to President Biden’s goal of stemming spillover hostilities triggered by Israel’s war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Underscoring the threat, Iran on Saturday blamed Israel for a strike on the Syrian capital, Damascus, that killed five Iranian military advisers. The Israeli military declined to comment. In Iraq, an attack on Ain al-Asad air base, which hosts Iraqi and U.S. troops, left one Iraqi soldier seriously injured, according to a Defense Department official. An Iran-linked faction there said it was responsible.
The Houthis, one powerful faction in Yemen’s long-running civil war, have framed their campaign, which has included more than 30 missile and drone attacks on commercial and naval vessels since November, as a means of pressuring Israel, bolstering their standing amid widespread regional opposition to the Jewish state. The quickly expanding U.S. response likewise risks pulling Biden into another volatile campaign in a region that has repeatedly mired down the American military, potentially undermining his attempt to refocus U.S. foreign policy on Russia and China.
Administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, described their strategy in Yemen as an effort to erode the Houthis’ high-level military capability enough to curtail their ability to target shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden or, at a minimum, to provide a sufficient deterrent so that risk-averse shipping companies will resume sending vessels through the region’s waterways.
“We are clear-eyed about who the Houthis are, and their worldview,” a senior U.S. official said of the group, which the Biden administration designated this week as a terrorist organization. “So we’re not sure that they’re going to stop immediately, but we are certainly trying to degrade and destroy their capabilities.”
Biden this week acknowledged that the strikes had so far failed to discourage Houthi leaders, who have promised to exact revenge against the United States and Britain, whose military has contributed to the strikes in Yemen.
“Are they stopping the Houthis? No,” the president told reporters. “Will they continue? Yes.”
Officials say they don’t expect that the operation will stretch on for years like previous U.S. wars in Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria. At the same time they acknowledge they can identify no end date or provide an estimate for when the Yemenis’ military capability will be adequately diminished. As part of the effort, U.S. naval forces also are working to intercept weapons shipments from Iran.
The Houthis, who made an unlikely rise from an obscure rebel movement in Yemen’s northern mountains in the 1990s to ruling large swaths of the country by 2015, previously withstood years of bombing by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia.
“We’re not trying to defeat the Houthis. There’s no appetite for invading Yemen,” a diplomat close to the issues said. “The appetite is to degrade their ability to launch these kind of attacks going forward, and that involves hitting the infrastructure that enables these kind of attacks, and targeting their higher-level capabilities.”
The first U.S. official said the initial U.S. and British strikes had succeeded “in significantly degrading” the military assets targeted thus far, but also acknowledged they retain a consequential arsenal. “That’s not to say that the Houthis don’t still have capability, but there’s a lot that they had that they don’t have now,” he said.
Western officials believe the most advanced equipment is provided by Iran, which they say has conducted a years-long smuggling operation that has allowed them to strike far beyond Yemen’s borders. The United States is hoping that the strikes, in conjunction with its interdiction campaign that last week yielded a shipment of missile warheads, will slowly starve the Houthis of their most potent weapons.
They point out that more sophisticated attacks, like a large-scale one that occurred Jan. 9, have not been repeated since the U.S.-led strikes began. “Recall before the strike we had U.S. ships attacked with 20-plus UAVs and multiple missiles in a single attack,” a second American official said, using a military acronym for drone aircraft.
The Houthis now appear to be receiving targeting assistance from Iran, the first official said. He described the group’s approach to attacking ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden as “inconsistent”: sometimes they seem to have clearly identified the nationality and affiliations of the vessels they target; in other instances they do not.
Officials said that ideology, rather than economics, was a chief driver of Biden’s decision to mount the current campaign. While the attacks have so far taken a greater toll on Europe than the United States, which relies on Pacific trade routes more than those in the Middle East, the Houthi campaign is already beginning to reshape the global shipping map. Some firms have chosen to reroute ships around the Cape of Good Hope off southern Africa, while major oil companies including BP and Shell suspended shipments through the area.
The officials said Biden believed the United States had to act as what they described as the world’s “indispensable nation,” with a powerful military and an ability to organize diverse nations behind a single cause. Nations including Canada, Bahrain, Germany and Japan jointly issued a statement on Jan. 3 decrying the Houthi actions.
They compared Biden’s decision to confront the Houthis to his stance in support of Ukraine, where he has authorized billions of dollars in weapons donations to help Kyiv push back against Russia’s breach of its sovereignty, a major violation of global norms.
In this case, officials said, the administration is willing to safely transit key waterways and, more generally, defend the principle of freedom of navigation. They hope the signal sent by preemptive American strikes will convince shipping firms to return to business as usual.
“It’s impossible to forecast exactly what’s going to happen, and certainly not [to predict] future operations,” the first U.S. official said. “But the principle that it simply can’t be tolerated for a terrorist organization … with these advanced capabilities to essentially shut down or control shipping through a key international choke point is one that we feel very strongly about.”
Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert with the Navanti Group, said the Houthis have strong incentive to press on.
“When the Houthis attacked the Abu Dhabi airport, they garnered a lot of attention. When they attacked Aramco they garnered even more attention,” he said, referring to attacks in the United Arab Emirates and on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. “But the attention they’re getting today from the Red Sea attacks is unheard of, so they are loving this.”
The administration has tried to avoid being seen as fueling regional violence by working to build international support, including by finding partners to sign on for declarations condemning the Houthi violence and by securing passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution denouncing their actions a day before the initial U.S. strikes. This week, the administration imposed a terrorism designation on the group.
State Department spokesman Matt Miller said the nations who have joined the United States in seeking to counter the Houthi violence were all playing “different roles.”
“There are more than 40 countries that issued a statement making clear that they condemned the Houthis’ attacks. There is a coalition of more than 20 countries that we assembled … to defend against the Houthis’ attacks,” Miller said.
Some U.S. officials have voiced fears about the U.S. military’s intervention, worried it could unravel the hard-fought diplomatic gains aimed at ending the war in Yemen or exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation in the Arab world’s poorest country.
Some officials at the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development remain concerned the U.S. assault could result in the Houthis expanding their strikes against Saudi assets — in particular oil refineries — and derail efforts to forge a peace settlement to end the nine-year war in Yemen that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters.
There are still several steps that haven’t been taken to solidify a peace settlement between the Houthis and the Saudis, including a payment mechanism to former Houthi fighters that are now acting in local administrator roles. Measures like that become more difficult to establish amid active hostilities between U.S. and Houthi forces.
U.S. officials also are concerned that attacking the Houthis has thrust the United States into a conflict with little exit strategy and limited support from key allies. Notably, America’s most powerful Gulf partners have withheld their backing for the American operation. The prime minister of Qatar, a key U.S. ally in the Gulf, has warned that Western strikes would not halt the violence and could fuel regional instability.
“We need to address the central issue, which is Gaza, in order to get everything else defused … If we are just focusing on the symptoms and not treating the real issues, (solutions) will be temporary,” he said, according to Reuters. Palestinian authorities say that Israel’s campaign in Gaza, which the country launched following Hamas’ deadly Oct. 7 attacks into Israel, has killed more than 24,000 people.
While U.S. lawmakers have been broadly supportive of the strikes in Yemen, they said the administration has yet to outline a clear strategy or endgame, and suggested the strikes have not eliminated concerns about an escalating Middle East conflict. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters following a meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in recent days that the administration’s plan for addressing the threat appeared to be “evolving.”
Legislators also voiced fears the operation could become costly and prolonged. Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, noted that some of the missiles employed to date could cost $2 million apiece. “So you’ve got this issue that will be emerging of how long can we continue to fire expensive missiles,” he said.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) noted that the United States had attempted to weaken other groups in the past, such as the Taliban or al-Qaeda, even as they rearmed. “The Houthis were rebuilding even as the Saudis bombed them [for years]. So it’s sobering,” Blumenthal said.
“There’s no question,” he added, “that we should be very clear-eyed about the difficulties here.”

XAF34NADPH_SD8RETBCDHM3WE8,"In Judge Kaplan’s court, Trump plays with fire",Shayna Jacobs,"January 21, 2024 at 6:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/01/21/trump-carroll-judge-kaplan-witness/,"In the high-stakes world of presidential trials, there are no judges like Lewis A. Kaplan.
At 79, after decades on the bench, the senior judge is one of the most well-regarded legal minds in New York. And he has a unique history that makes Donald Trump’s courtroom behavior over the past week potentially dangerous for the former president of the United States.
Trump is on trial in a civil case as writer E. Jean Carroll seeks damages from Trump, who has been found liable for defaming her when he made disparaging remarks denying he sexually assaulted her decades ago in a department store.
Trump has claimed that he intends to testify in the case on Monday — which would probably produce a dramatic courtroom showdown. But it’s unclear whether Trump will really show up. For one thing, he has made similar claims in the past, then not appeared. For another, Tuesday is the New Hampshire primary, and Trump is again running for president.
If he does testify, legal experts said, his time on the witness stand could be something akin to a suicide mission.
Over the past week, Kaplan’s handling of the damages trial in Lower Manhattan shows how different a federal courtroom is from most other parts of public life — even state court, where Trump and his lawyers had more leeway to squabble with a judge overseeing a different civil trial in another New York courthouse over the past several months. Kaplan has not tolerated similar behavior, and Trump has railed on social media that the federal judge is “a totally biased and hostile person.”
The former president claimed that he only lost a previous lawsuit brought by Carroll over the sexual assault and a different set of defamatory comments because he didn’t appear in court personally. Kaplan oversaw that lawsuit, too.
See how Trump is is making his court appearances seem like campaign stops
In recent weeks, Trump has been attending more court hearings than he needs to, seemingly deciding that the best way to fight his legal critics — and win the GOP nomination — is to try to shout them down. He has spoken out of turn in the courtroom and denounced the proceedings.
Legal experts warn that if he does so on the witness stand in Kaplan’s courtroom, he could end up humiliated and threatened with contempt of court.
Robert Katzberg, a veteran New York white-collar criminal defense lawyer, said Kaplan is “the worst possible draw for Trump,” not because of any personal or political bias, but because of the type of judge he is.
“He’s really smart and takes no guff from either side. He expects lawyers to be professional and toe the line, and if they do not, holds them accountable,” said Katzberg, who is now consulting counsel for Holland & Knight.
“Even if you had the most pro-Trump judge in America overseeing the trial, Donald Trump should not testify. Multiply that by a million with Lewis Kaplan on the bench,” he said. “Given both his lack of any relevant facts as to the only issue remaining — the damages suffered by Ms. Carroll — and Donald Trump’s inability to control himself emotionally, he is begging not only to be debased before the jury, but contempt citations will be looming large.”
Kaplan’s history with contempt is unique among the federal judiciary. In 2019, Kaplan sought to persuade federal prosecutors to charge a lawyer, Steven Donziger, with criminal contempt of court after he refused to give access to his communications.
When prosecutors declined, the judge took the rare step of appointing a private law firm to prosecute Donziger. The attorney was ultimately convicted and served 45 days in jail after already having spent more than two years under house arrest.
In court last week, Kaplan dropped the hammer on Trump when the former president flouted the rules of courtroom behavior.
After being told that Trump, sitting at the defense table, was denigrating Carroll loudly enough for the nine-member jury to hear, Kaplan ordered him to cut it out.
“Mr. Trump, I hope I don’t have to consider excluding you from the trial,” the judge said, adding that Trump has a right to be in court, but “that right can be forfeited … if he is disruptive.”
Trump threw his hands up in an animated show of disapproval.
“I would love it! I would love it!” he said.
Kaplan said Trump appeared unable to control himself.
“You can’t, either!” the former president retorted.
Outside court, Trump has fired off a relentless barrage of social media posts about Carroll.
Inside the courtroom, Kaplan has chided Trump’s lead lawyer, Alina Habba, who has little trial experience, for not knowing proper procedures and rules.
One exchange, about a defunct New York restaurant, sounded more like a scene from a Marx Brothers movie than a “Law & Order” episode.
Habba asked Carroll whether she was a regular at a Manhattan restaurant called Elaine’s.
“Yes,” Carroll replied.
“It’s incredibly hard to get into, correct?” asked Habba.
“Not [hard]. You can get into Elaine’s,” she replied, at which point Kaplan jumped in to say: “Ms. Habba, it hasn’t existed for years, if I’m not mistaken. … That may be on account of its being closed.”
Kaplan is asserting more control over the proceedings in this trial than was seen in recent months in a nearby state courthouse, where trial judge Arthur Engoron was more permissive toward Trump and his defense team in a civil case involving allegations of business fraud.
In Engoron’s court, multiple lawyers for Trump raised objections simultaneously — something generally unheard of in federal court, which tends to be more staid and subdued.
Kaplan immediately shut down similar efforts last week.
“Let’s just get this clear for both sides right now,” he said Wednesday. “The first lawyer who says anything when a witness is on the stand says everything there is to be said for that side. This is not a tag-team lawyering.”
In addition to her legal role, Habba serves as a publicist for Trump. She is also a regular on the social scene at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida home and private club, and joined Trump’s entourage at a UFC event in Las Vegas in December.
At the Carroll trial, Habba has repeatedly incurred the wrath of Kaplan for, among other things, not knowing or quickly forgetting how to question a witness or refer to exhibits.
She complained to the judge about this treatment, and about the limitations imposed on her questioning of Carroll, to no avail.
When the judge halted her questions about tweets, Habba bristled and said, “I can’t ask about them? With all due respect …” The judge quickly cut her off.
“All due respect,” the judge replied, “means that when I issue a ruling, you say next question.”"
YW4V7IXS4K_EWO3L301NAQCCXN,Opinion Why the Supreme Court ought to punt on Trump’s eligibility,Jason Willick,"January 21, 2024 at 7:00 a.m. EST",20240121,washingtonpost.com,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/21/supreme-court-trump-insurrection-case/,"Donald Trump’s Iowa caucuses romp raises the stakes in Trump v. Anderson, the Supreme Court’s review of a Colorado ruling disqualifying him from the state’s ballot. Soon after the justices hear the case next month, Trump could be the presumptive GOP nominee. The meaning of the 14th Amendment’s disqualification-for-insurrection clause will cease being an academic hypothetical and start being a question of whether states can, in effect, block an unfolding presidential nomination process.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court briefs have poured in. Most retread familiar legal ground, but an amicus brief filed Thursday by election law scholars Edward B. Foley and Richard L. Hasen, along with election lawyer Benjamin L. Ginsberg, makes a distinctive appeal: Whatever you do, the trio urges the justices, don’t punt on the question of Trump’s eligibility. Either rule that he is qualified for the presidency or rule that he is disqualified from it, full stop — don’t reverse the Colorado decision on “procedural or jurisdictional grounds.”
Otherwise, if Trump wins the election in November, Democrats in Congress could try to block the certification of his electoral votes next January, as some Republicans did for President Biden’s in 2021. That would risk “catastrophic political instability,” the brief plausibly warns. But it overestimates the Supreme Court’s ability to head off such instability. And it understates the risk from more judicial entanglement in the election than necessary. Deciding that insurrection is a question for Congress might actually be the most statesmanlike solution available to the justices.
Some background: Section 3 of the 14th Amendment disqualifies certain officeholders who “engaged in insurrection” from holding certain offices in the future. Colorado says this applies to Trump because of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. The Foley brief urges the Supreme Court to pronounce whether Colorado is right or wrong on the merits. But there’s a separate, procedural question: Is the disqualification provision enforceable without further guidance from Congress? The 14th Amendment says Congress can enforce it “by appropriate legislation.” Congress has passed legislation disqualifying people criminally convicted of insurrection, but Trump hasn’t been charged with that crime.
The justices could thus order Trump restored to Colorado’s ballot because no congressionally authorized procedure was followed to disqualify him. A ruling along those lines would be agnostic on whether Jan. 6 was an insurrection. But it would stop state-level disqualifications of Trump and allow the 2024 election process to go ahead undisturbed.
It’s true that this wouldn’t end the matter if Trump wins in November. But Democrats in Congress could object to certifying a Trump victory no matter what the Supreme Court says. Let’s say the justices rule this spring in a 6-3 partisan split that Trump did not engage in insurrection in 2021. Would that change the minds of congressional Democrats, all of whom voted to impeach and convict Trump for insurrection in 2021?
Unlikely. Today, 81 percent of Democrats believe that Trump is disqualified from office, according to one poll. Some Democratic representatives would surely press that case after the election, and they could plausibly claim that congressional interpretation of the 14th Amendment supersedes the Supreme Court’s.
In any case, such turbulence in Congress, while distracting, would most likely resolve itself. It’s unlikely that Democrats would have enough votes to block Trump’s certification and create genuine ambiguity about “who is entitled to act as President and commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces starting at noon on January 20,” as the Foley brief puts it. Congress can throw out electoral votes, the brief notes, only “if a procedurally proper objection is sustained by both the House and the Senate.” If Republicans control even one house of Congress, Democratic objections to Trump’s election would be guaranteed to fail.
The chance that Trump will win the presidency while Democrats win a majority in both houses is small. Republican Senate candidates tend to run ahead of Trump in swing states, and the last time voters elected a president of one party and a Senate and House controlled by the opposing party was in the election of Bill Clinton in 1996.
Even if Democrats did somehow sweep Congress despite a Trump victory in the electoral college, their margin would be narrow, and it’s unlikely that all Democrats in Congress would sanction reversing the voters’ presidential decision. Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), for example, disagreed with the Maine secretary of state’s recent decision to remove Trump from the ballot. In other words, it might be rocky, but congressional procedures are probably adequate to handle the 2025 presidential transition without a direct Supreme Court pronouncement on Trump’s culpability, or lack of culpability, for insurrection.
And such a pronouncement would come at a high cost to the court. If the justices cleared Trump of insurrection, they would be essentially second-guessing Congress’s impeachment of the former president, who would use the opinion as an election-season talking point. The Supreme Court is already under liberal assault; a decision seen as vindicating Trump would turbocharge the attacks and increase the risk of a constitutional crisis under a Democratic president down the line. If the justices affirmed the Colorado decision, they would devastate the court’s standing within the GOP, which would see its voters stripped of the right to vote for their favored candidate in an unprecedented way.
The country is at a point where states are disqualifying a major-party candidate under the Constitution’s insurrection clause. That itself shows that instability is a real risk. But there is no procedural end run around this problem, which is fundamentally one of polarization and a loss of political legitimacy. The best course for the Supreme Court in those circumstances is probably to protect its own institutional interests and hope that the elected branches can heal themselves."
