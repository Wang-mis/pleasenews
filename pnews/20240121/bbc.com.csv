At a glance
Ireland's police force has raised its maximum age limit for recruits to 50
An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, which needs 1,000 new officers to tackle staff shortages, recently lost an age discrimination case brought by two men who were too old to apply
Forces such as the Police Service of Northern Ireland and Metropolitan Police already allow candidates in their 50s to apply
However, a leading member of an officer organisation says he does not believe the move will solve recruitment issues
The Irish police force, An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, announced this week it is raising its upper age limit for recruits from 35 to 50.
People on the cusp of half a century can now compete for a place at the Garda College, alongside candidates as young as 18.
It follows a legal case taken by two men who successfully claimed they were victims of age discrimination as they could not apply to join after the age of 35.
But the rule change also comes amid an ongoing police shortage -  the force recently failed to meet a workforce target of 15,000 officers by 2021.
Its current membership is just more than 1,000 short of that target.
The move has faced opposition in the past, notably from the head of An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na, Commissioner Drew Harris, who argued the age limit was necessary to ensure officers are physically able for the job.
However, the low cut-off point was out of step with other nearby forces - the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) accepts applications from candidates up to 57, while the Metropolitan Police's age limit is also ""typically"" 57.
Police Scotland has no upper age limit., external
Having recently celebrated his 50th birthday, County Donegal Garda (police officer) Brendan O'Connor would now be too old to apply for the job he has held since he was 24.
Brendan O'Connor works in the seaside town of Dunfanaghy, County Donegal
As well as being a front-line officer in Dunfanaghy, he is also president of the Garda Representatives Association (GRA), a union-like organisation which promotes the interests of rank-and-file officers.
Mr O'Connor told BBC News NI he does not object to widening the recruitment age bracket, but argued it will not fix staff shortages.
""We don't believe there's a pool of people in that age group who would be in a position financially, or with family commitments, to take that option,"" he said.
""Of course, anyone who meets the criteria and can do the job will be welcome, but we don't believe it's going to be any significant part of the solution to the problems we face.""
He explained officer numbers are being depleted by early retirements and ""an unprecedented level of resignations"".
The GRA president believes money will be the biggest deciding factor in how many middle-aged candidates apply.
""We imagine that most people in that age bracket may have financial commitments, may have dependents, may have mortgages, and will possibly be be seeing a significant drop in their income if they were to start training.""
The starting salary for a newly qualified garda is just over â¬35,000 (Â£30,000) in a  country with extremely high housing costs.
Recruits must also spend their first 36 weeks in the Garda College on a training allowance of â¬305 (Â£262) a week, well below minimum wage levels.
Justice Minister Helen McEntee said this ""significantly increased"", external payment followed the government's allocation of â¬2.3bn (Â£2bn) to the force for 2024 - its highest ever annual budget.
Minister Helen McEntee raised the training allowance from â¬184 to â¬305 a week
She added the age limit change would open policing ""to a new cohort of people who will bring a range of different life and career experiences to the table"".
But Mr O'Connor said the â¬305 allowance was ""wholly inadequate,"" and a ""paltry sum for anyone to try to exist on with the cost-of-living crisis"".
In terms of the age limit, the GRA president accepts it is ""part of the inevitable evolution of the workplace"".
He also believes it may be linked to the successful age discrimination challenge.
That long-running battle was fought by Ronald Boyle, who was 48 when he sought to join the gardaÃ­ in 2005, and Brian Fitzpatrick who was 37 when he wanted to apply in 2007.
The pair won their case in 2020, external when the Workplace Relations Commission ruled they had been discriminated against on age grounds.
That ruling was appealed by the Department of Justice and the Garda Commissioner but that was rejected last year, external.
Mr Harris had defended the age limit of 35 as ""essential"", telling the Labour Court gardaÃ­ needed operational resilience to protect the people of Ireland.
He listed several duties requiring a high level of physical agility, pointing out the force is responsible for national security, counter terrorism and major crime investigation.
Garda Commissioner Drew Harris had previously argued against older recruits
The commissioner said officers required the stamina to be as alert at the end of a shift as they are at the start.
But Mr Boyle told the Labour Court he was still physically fit - one of his jobs was as a swimming instructor.
The court ruled in the men's favour, saying the age limit of 35 was ""not appropriate or necessary"".
But fitness is still essential for all front-line officers who may have to chase down suspects or quell a riot like the one that erupted in Dublin last November.
Under the new Garda regime, middle-aged recruits must pass a physical fitness test alongside their teenage competitors.
However, the tests are adjusted based on age and gender.
Last year's riot saw the biggest ever deployment of public order-trained gardaÃ­
As Mr O'Connor points out there are ""lots and lots of gardaÃ­ in their 50s being very effective"" in their roles.
""Fifty-year-olds can do the job - I'd like to think I can do the job,"" he said.
""I mean, it's getting more and more challenging the older you get - shift work and stuff like that.
""But individuals look after themselves, have good health and certainly there's nothing prohibiting a 50-year-old from doing the job.""
He also acknowledged older recruits could bring ""a wealth of experience"" to the GardaÃ­, as they already do in other forces.
""Only time will tell whether this will make any difference, but we don't believe it's the solution to our current recruitment and retention crisis,"" he added."
0B7X9OGXXF_ZR9LJWZGWK6YDL9,Tata Steel: Port Talbot apprentices worry about future,By Bethan Lewis,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-68041372,"Kieran Harris' great-grandfather was the first of four generations to work at Port Talbot's steelworks.
Now Kieran, 18, is doing an apprenticeship with Tata Steel, which has announced 2,800 jobs cuts, with most expected to be in Port Talbot.
He said he's worried for the community but still optimistic there will be job opportunities at the site.
The chairman of the Swansea Bay City region urged young people to ""stick with us"" despite ""devastating"" cuts.
Kieran has already spent a short time working at the coke ovens at Tata, which he ""really enjoyed"", before he started his mechanical engineering apprenticeship.
He's following in the footsteps of several family members including his father and uncle. ""It's been in my family the whole time I've known,"" he said.
He said the news about job losses was ""very nerve wracking"" and a huge blow to the area.
However, due to his non-production apprenticeship, he hopes his role will not be affected by the announced cuts.
""I'm quite optimistic that with the community, we can pull through the hard times and hopefully see out the brighter side when we can produce green steel and everybody can have a job,"" he said.
Jay Morris, 18, from Neath, like Kieran, is in the first year of a four year apprenticeship with Tata.
He understands the concern of workers fearing for their jobs but he thinks their skills will be in demand elsewhere.
""I think that even if jobs do go, there will be other roles for those employees to fill,"" he said.
Long term, he would like to work as an engineer at the Tata plant, where two new arc furnaces are set to be installed.
The planned electric arc furnace will produce steel in a greener way and will mean many roles are retained on site - little comfort for those who fear their jobs will go when the current blast furnaces are shut down.
Kathryn Dunstan, of NPTC Colleges, said there was a ""flurry of excitement"" when Tata released its apprentice applications.
""Our students see it as an opportunity. They aspire to work at Tata Steel, they see it as secure employment with good opportunities and good prospects,"" she said.
She said the news about the site was ""certainly worrying"" but said there was a range of ""exciting initiatives"" in Neath Port Talbot including a Global Centre for Rail Excellence and plan for offshore wind generation.
Ms Dunstan said it was up to government at all levels, as well as colleges and training providers, ""to make sure that there are employment opportunities for young people"".
And developing the area's economy is a core purpose of the Swansea Bay City Region - its plans now badly hit by the ""devastating"" news about steel jobs, according to its chairman Rob Stewart.
""It's really undermining the efforts that we have to create quality jobs in south Wales,"" said Mr Stewart, who is also leader of Swansea council.
""There are now going to be limitations to what you can do in the steel industry because of the decisions made,"" he said, addressing young people hopeful of finding work.
""I hope that we can reverse them, but there are going to be other opportunities coming along through the economy we're creating in south Wales.
""As those opportunities come along stick with us, look at the careers you could potentially have in the area and we'll support you to pursue those careers in this region.""

4U0ITBFI5E_51XK5DHACSW8BKT,"'Drugged, robbed, killed': The city catching US tourists in dating trap",_,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-68022288,"A series of mysterious deaths involving American men in Colombia has been linked to dating apps. Relatives of those killed are now searching for answers, writes Austin Landis in Medellin.
Tou Ger Xiong loved coming back to Colombia.
""He talked about the high spirited peopleâ¦ just enjoying life,"" his brother, Eh Xiong, told BBC News. ""He even picked up Spanish.
""It never, ever even crossed his mind that he would end up in a tragic incident this way.""
Tou Ger, 50, was a Hmong-American community activist and comedian from Minnesota. Prior to his most recent trip to Medellin, he had been speaking to a woman online.
A few weeks into his two-month visit, in mid-December, he called his brother and asked him for $2,000 but didn't say what it was for or that anything was wrong. Eh said he would transfer the money. He never heard from his brother again.
The next day, police found Tou Ger's body in a remote, wooded area of the city. A friend in Medellin explained to Eh that his brother had been kidnapped and held at gunpoint for the $2,000 ransom.
""I did not want to believe it. I didn't know if it was really happening,"" Eh said. ""My heart just sank.""
Eh scrambled to contact the US embassy, who confirmed it was his brother's body. Colombian police this week arrested a woman and two men linked to his death, charging them with kidnapping and murder.
It's not clear whether he first met the woman through a dating app or through friends. But his death is one of eight in Medellin that prompted a warning from the US embassy about the risks of using dating apps. All eight victims were Americans who died in suspicious circumstances in November and December.
The US state department said it was aware of a gang in the city that previously used dating apps to isolate victims before abducting and killing them. But it's unclear if a gang was behind the US deaths.
In the first 10 months of 2023, Medellin's tourism observatory had already recorded 32 violent killings of foreigners in the city - including at least 12 Americans and three from the United Kingdom - a 40% increase from the previous year.
Jeff Hewett was found ""lying dead in a pool of blood"" in his Medellin hotel room, his friends wrote online, describing him as ""an easy-going, wry, kind spirit"" and apparent victim of a ""robbery gone bad"".
Johny Jerome was killed on his 45th birthday. Phillip Mullins was drugged and died of an overdose, according to local media reports.
The embassy says several of these cases began with a dating app used to lure victims, part of a concerning increase in people who end up ""drugged, robbed, and even killed by their Colombian dates"".  Neither Tinder nor Bumble, both popular in the city, would comment.
Carlos Calle, the former director of the city's tourism observatory, said it's common for criminals to drug tourists with scopolamine, an odourless substance known as ""Devil's Breath"". The US embassy also warned about the drug, which sedates victims for up to 24 hours.
""There's a negative profile of the tourist in the city that looks for a certain type of opportunities,"" said Calle in an interview. It's usually related to sex work, he said.
A spokesperson for the tourism observatory confirmed that the ""majority"" of victims last year were men, but added that many cases are still under investigation.
Prostitution is legal in Colombia and widespread in tourism hotspots like the cities of Medellin and Cartagena. But there's nothing to suggest the men killed were using prostitutes.
Alok Shah, 36, thinks scopolamine is what caused his vision to ""go sideways"" when he brought a woman back to his hotel room in late 2022. It was like his short-term memory was disappearing, he said.
The Texas resident had matched with a Colombian woman in her mid-20s on Tinder. They first went out for coffee, but Shah later decided to buy beers and bring her to his hotel.
He says he hadn't felt unsafe during his previous frequent visits to Medellin, or like prostitution was as prevalent when he first came in 2017. But he knew women were a draw to the city. ""If you're a single guy, the women are very lovely here,"" a friend had told him.
Before his watch, jacket and $200 in cash disappeared that night, he remembers his date rubbing a powder on his neck. But he stayed conscious enough to realise something was wrong, threatening to call the police and chasing her away.
""I generally don't interact with the locals there now,"" he said. ""There's just too much danger, there's too much risk.""
The new US embassy notice recommends its citizens avoid taking dates to private places like hotels, plus inform friends, family or building staff about who they're with. And don't resist a robbery because that could be fatal.
Medellin's city police would not comment on the recent increase in violent deaths and referred BBC News to the mayor's office.
""We want more and more foreigners to come to the city,"" said Mayor Federico Gutierrez, but added that tourists coming purely for sex and drugs were not welcome. He said he's directed the police to crack down on what he says is a related underlying issue - the sex trafficking of minors.
Police have been directed to begin ""special interventions"" in the neighbourhoods where tourism is most prominent, a spokesperson for the mayor told BBC News, including the popular nightlife area called El Poblado.
More than 1.4 million foreigners visited the city as tourists in 2022, a new record over previous years, and over a quarter were American, according to statistics released by the mayor's office. The numbers for 2023 are expected to be even higher, partly because Medellin has become a top destination for remote workers.
Last week, Eh Xiong came to Medellin himself for the first time, to carry out a Hmong tradition by calling his brother's spirits back home.
""We're not mad at the people of Colombia,"" he said. ""I truly believe that he would have forgiven the people who did that to him.""
He added: ""[Tou Ger had] this quick wit, fearlessness, that believes in the goodness of all people.""

5G87L4RXIQ_8I5LXXU7C9COOOL,Philippines president Marcos takes helicopter to Coldplay concert,By Vicky Wong,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68047606,"The president of the Philippines is facing criticism on social media for using a presidential helicopter to attend a Coldplay concert in a province north of the capital, Manila.
Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his wife were spotted arriving at the Philippine Arena via helicopter on Friday.
Critics have called this a misuse of government resources.
Mr Marcos Jr's office defended the move, citing ""unforeseen traffic complications"".
The head of Mr Marcos' Presidential Security Group (PSG), Brig Gen Jesus Nelson Morales, said in a statement published on Saturday that the ""unprecedented influx of 40,000 individuals eagerly attending a concert"" resulted in traffic complications, and that this posed a security threat to the president.
Brig Gen Morales went on to ask for the public's understanding, adding that the ""continued understanding and support for these measures are crucial in maintaining the safety and well-being of our nation's leadership"".
The Philippine Arena, located deep in the suburbs, is usually around 40 minutes by car from the presidential palace - absent the capital's notorious traffic jams. By public transport, the same route can take one to two hours.
Mr Marcos Jr and his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos were among the thousands of fans who attended Coldplay's concert at the Philippine Arena, the world's largest indoor arena.
Videos and photos of the first couple drew ire from social media users, who criticised the use of taxpayer money by Mr Marcos, who is the son and namesake of the late strongman president whose rule ended nearly four decades ago in a historic ""people power"" revolution.
""Using official resources, like the presidential chopper, for personal and non-official activities is generally considered an abuse of power or misuse of government resources,"" Facebook user James Patrick Aristorenas said in a post on Saturday.
""We paid for the use of the chopper, fuel and security, who knows even for the tickets for everyone,"" Facebook user Arvine Concepcion said.
In a survey published on Friday, Metro Manila topped the 2023 TomTom Traffic Index list of metro areas with the slowest travel time, taking an average time of 25 minutes and 30 seconds to travel 10km in the region. This has been blamed on creaking infrastructure and an inadequate public transport system.
Filipino office workers in the Metro Manila area often spend hours stuck in traffic. Many wake up before dawn in order to get to work on time.
According to news site Rappler, Coldplay's front man Chris Martin also remarked on the Philippine traffic, thanking fans for braving it to see the band live.
""We've seen some traffic. But I think you have the number one [traffic] in the world. Thank you for making the effort...to be here,"" he said.

7F7GL6R56V_9QTLQHFDY0OQ6MO,Northern Lights: Will 2024 be the best year to see it?,By Natalie Grice,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-67983038,"People looking up at the skies in Wales have been lucky enough to spot some fantastic displays of the Northern Lights in recent years.
This has been made easier by more areas being designated Dark Sky Reserves or zones.
Tourism to witness the spectacle is increasingly popular, in part through the sharing of some striking images on social media.
Could 2024 be one of the best years to spot the celestial phenomenon?
Changes in the sun are set to make the appearance of the lights more likely.
A solar cycle is an approximately 11-year period over which activity on the sun waxes and wanes.
This year will mark almost the mid-point of Solar Cycle 25, and it is heading into its most active phase.
The cycle began in 2019 according to NASA, and with magnetic changes comes a rise in the amount of activity on the sun's surface.
It means more sunspots - with X-rays and magnetic fields sent towards Earth, causing geo-magnetic storms which produce auroras, another name for the Northern Lights.
To catch a glimpse, you could try one of Wales' five dark sky areas accredited by DarkSky International.
The Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons) and Eryri (Snowdonia) national parks are both dark sky reserves and the Elan Valley estate in Powys is a dark sky park.
There is also Ynys Elli/Bardsey Island in Gwynedd and Presteigne and Norton in Powys which are a dark sky sanctuary and a dark sky community.
However, in order to have the best chance of spotting lights in Wales, the advice is to get as far north, near to a coast and away from manmade light sources as possible.
Keen photographer Gareth Mon Jones is perfectly placed to capture the best the night skies have to offer.
From Llangefni, Anglesey, he started taking photographs about 10 years ago partly as a way to ""stop going to the pub"" and partly in the aftermath of his father's death.
""I was going out for sunsets in the winter and then I stayed after sunset and saw all the stars come out, and I thought 'wow, this is amazing',"" he said.
""It took me back to my early days fishing with my father on the rocks. He used to say 'stand over there on the rocks, don't move'. And the only thing I could have for company was the stars. It took me back to that nice place.""
Gareth's first encounter with the aurora came as a complete surprise.
""I was beside myself, really, because I thought this can't be possible, this can't be happening on Anglesey.
""I've only seen the Northern Lights on Facebook pictures of Iceland or Norway or Scandinavian places.
""The only thing that made me think it was unreal was the light colour that was coming off the aurora was white lights coming off the horizon.
""In Iceland it seems to be green and red. You're further north, so all this colour tends to happen on a higher latitude and here in Wales we just get like light pillars.... I took a picture and then saw reds and greens and thought 'wow, this is the Northern Lights. From Anglesey'.""
Because viewers are unlikely to see the lights in full colour with just the naked eye, Gareth has sometimes been accused of digitally altering his images, and he stresses it is important for people to understand they will usually need a camera to see the full effect when out in Wales.
But high-tech equipment is not necessary to capture the phenomenon, he stresses.
""You can take the aurora now with colour on a mobile phone,"" he said.
""If you put your little iPhone into manual mode and put it into super-sensitivity, what they call the ISO for sensitivity of light, and then the aperture as wide as possible - as wide as possible means a lower number.""
He personally recommends Penmon Point lighthouse as a promising spot for a variety of natural phenomena - including, in the summer months, bioluminescent plankton in the sea -  as the beach is in the south-east of the isle but has a north-facing beach.
Other good spots on Anglesey include Amlwch, Cemaes Bay, Benllech and Moelfre.
But all is not lost if you aren't fortunate enough to live within easy travelling distance of Anglesey.
Last month, Mathew Browne from Carmarthenshire won a Northern Lights Photographer of the Year award for his image of the lights over Paxton's Tower in the county, proving with the right timing, the display can be appreciated all over the country.
""I've seen photographs from the Brecon Beacons. This year somebody picked them up from the Gower and even as far south as Cornwall,"" says Gareth.
He said one display was seen from high places ""anywhere in south Wales"" and Pembroke.
""Basically it's just getting somewhere dark and somewhere quite high if you're inland,"" he added.
Modern technology has also made a big difference.
""There's load of aurora apps these days as well and that's made my life super, I wouldn't say easy, but super useful to know when they're going to happen, or the prediction of a [magnetic] storm that's coming in,"" Gareth explains.
Things like this have ""without doubt"" encouraged a growth in aurora spotters, although it can be a double-edged sword, according to Gareth.
This happens when people arrive without being respectful of the natural environment and leave rubbish behind.

9YU8HH7PXH_EZP0XARC7Y3KDBL,New Hampshire primary: Attacks fly as Donald Trump grows lead,By Bernd Debusmann Jr,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68049922,"Nikki Haley has gone on the offensive against Donald Trump, just days before the Republican New Hampshire primary.
She has previously avoided lashing out at the former president, but Mr Trump's attacks have become more personal as his commanding lead in the polls has grown.
Mr Trump is leading with 50% of likely Republican voters in the state, with Nikki Haley trailing far behind.
On Sunday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantisdropped out of the race altogether.
With his campaign faltering, Mr DeSantis admitted he had no path to victory - setting up a two-horse race in New Hampshire. And he endorsed Mr Trump.
In last week's Iowa caucus, Mr Trump dominated Ms Haley and Ron DeSantis.
But even with that decisive win and a clear lead in the upcoming New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, Mr Trump has gone on the attack against Ms Haley.
His criticisms appear to have convinced her to turn up the heat on the former president.
Mr Trump went after his former UN ambassador at a campaign rally over the weekend, but he seemed to confuse her for another political foe - former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - when speaking about the Capitol riot.
On CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday, Ms Haley seized on the slip up and struck back at the former president, saying that his ""mental stability will probably continue to decline"".
""No matter what it is, chaos follows,"" she added. ""In some cases he [Mr Trump] causes it. In some cases he doesn't... he's like a magnet to it. What happens is that puts the rest of America in chaos, and people are tired.""
This video can not be played
Watch: Trump's big win in Iowa, and the battle for second
The former UN ambassador also blasted her onetime boss as soft on undemocratic leaders, alleging he did not hold Russian President Vladimir Putin, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, and China's Xi Jinping accountable.
""You can't have someone who's trying to buddy up with dictators that want to kill us,"" Ms Haley said on CBS. ""Instead, you have to let them know what we expect of them. That's the difference.""
Characterising Mr Trump as a mayhem and temper-fueled candidate appears to be a new counter deployed by Ms Haley. It comes after he has ramped up personal insults on her in recent days.
On Friday, for example, Mr Trump took to social media to refer to Ms Haley as ""Nimbra"", a misspelling of her birth name Nimarata, and to baselessly suggest she was ineligible to serve as president or vice president in the US.
The jab against the US-born Ms Haley - whose parents emigrated to the US from India in the 1960s - was reminiscent of the false birther attacks Mr Trump deployed against former President Barack Obama.
Ms Haley responded to the baseless claim by telling reporters in New Hampshire that Mr Trump is ""clearly insecure if he goes and does these temper tantrums"".
Her decision to fight back against Mr Trump - something she has been loath to do on the campaign trail - may have come too late in this primary, however.
While Ms Haley appeared to have some momentum a few weeks ago, polls released before Mr DeSantis quit showed Mr Trump dominating ahead of the New Hampshire primary.
Mr Trump led with 55% support among likely Republican voters, compared to 36% for Ms Haley and just 6% for Mr DeSantis.
A separate poll, from CNN, had Mr Trump with 50% support, compared to 39% for Ms Haley and 6% for Mr DeSantis.
The former president's lead has prompted Haley campaign officials and political allies to temper and downplay expectations for New Hampshire after previously expressing optimism.
New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu, who has campaigned for Ms Haley, told NBC News that she ""doesn't have to win"" in his home state. He claimed that any momentum from this week's race offers an ""amazing opportunity to turn this around"".
Additionally, Haley campaign manager Betsy Ankney repeatedly declined to offer a prediction during an on-the-record briefing with Bloomberg News, telling reporters only that Ms Haley needs ""incremental progress"".
""I know everyone wants us to put a number on it,"" she said. ""We have never done that. We never will.""
Mr Trump's campaign has also received a boost from the endorsements of two former opponents for the Republican nomination, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.
Ms Haley also received an endorsement from a former rival, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who never earned much support and ended his bid for the Republican nomination last week.
""Anyone who believes Donald Trump will unite this country has been asleep over the last 8 years,"" he said in a post on X. ""Trump intentionally tries to divide America and will continue to do so.""
Still, Ms Ankney said that ""beating Donald Trump is not easy"" and appeared to push for a longer view of the campaign.
""He is a juggernaut,"" she said of Trump. ""But how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. We have to continue to show incremental growth and progress until we are the last man, or woman, standing against him.""

Dozens took to social media to express their frustration, branding the experience and lack of communication a ""shambles"".
A spokesperson for the supermarket apologised for the inconvenience.
Tesco said orders were back up and running by mid-afternoon.
But disgruntled Tesco shoppers were put out that there had been so little information from the company while they waited in for orders that did not arrive.
Reports of problems peaked at 09:00 on the Downdetector website, with thousands of users logging problems with Tesco's service.
One shopper, Mark, said on social media that he had got up ""extra early"" at 08:00 for a delivery, only to find it cancelled ""without any real reason being given"".
Another customer wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, that they were housebound and had received a confirmation from Tesco that their delivery was on its way, only to receive news of the cancellation 20 minutes later.
Others described the experience as ""appalling"" after struggling to reach customer services to find out what had happened to their orders.
One mother was left ""furious"" as she said she could not leave the house and was left with no nappies.
Many said they were informed of the cancellation only 20 minutes before the delivery was due. Others said they only found out after the allotted slot had been and gone, with some waiting several hours before they found out what the problem was.
Tesco's spokesperson said: ""We're really sorry that due to a technical issue, we had to cancel some online orders today.
""Our technical team have worked around the clock and have now fixed it.""
""Customers who were impacted have been contacted directly. We apologise again for the inconvenience.""
Tesco advised customers to rebook to have orders delivered in the coming days. However, some customers said they were struggling to find suitable slots.

Chickerell Town Council said it was collecting warm clothes, shoes and toys for individuals and families and five van loads had so far been delivered to the camp.
Six cows have been rescued from an underground slurry pit by fire crews.
The animals became trapped after falling through an inspection cover on the farm near Tolpuddle on Thursday morning.
Two firefighters had to climb into the pit to attach strops around the cows so they could be lifted to safety.
A museum is fundraising to acquire two ""important and unusual"" hoards of Bronze and Iron Age treasure that were found in Dorset.
Dorset Museum and Art Gallery wants to buy a group of 40 coins dating from 2nd Century BC, as well as a Bronze Age axe head, bangle and sword.
The combined value of the hoards is estimated at more than Â£32,000.
A university has been awarded Â£1.6m from Research England to create a centre for studying plastic.
Arts University Bournemouth (AUB) has received the grant so it can explore how plastics degrade over time or behave in different environments.
The centre will work with experts at the AUB's Museum of Design in Plastics.

BL6FY5UTSX_JPI84CUETBFABVJ,Ukraine drones hit St Petersburg gas terminal in Russia,"By Sarah Rainsford, Eastern Europe correspondent in Kyiv and Oliver Slow in London",1 day ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68046347,"This video can not be played
Watch: Explosion at Russia gas terminal
An explosion at a major gas export terminal near the city of St Petersburg in Russia was carried out by Ukrainian drones, BBC News has been told.
The blast caused a large fire at the Ust-Luga terminal, but no injuries, Russian officials said.
An official source in Kyiv said the ""special operation"" of the SBU security service masterminded the attack, with drones that worked ""on target"".
Both Russia and Ukraine have used drones in the current conflict.
Russia launched its full-scale of invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago, but has made little progress in recent months.
Regarding the explosion near St Petersburg, regional governor Alexander Drozdenko said a ""high alert regime"" was in place after the incident at the terminal of gas producer Novatek, in Ust-Luga on the Gulf of Finland. He shared a video of what appeared to be a large fire.
Novatek later announced that work at the terminal had been suspended, and said the fire was the result of ""external influence"" - without providing further details.
The Ukrainians say fuel processed at the plant was being used to supply Russian troops in their war against Ukraine and that this strike ""significantly complicates"" logistics for the military.Â
They also describe the attack as an economic blow to Russia, which exports fuel from the terminal. Â
Russia's Fontanka.ru has published video showing tankers moored close to where the fire is raging. It reports two drones were spotted approaching the city of St Petersburg at about 01:00 local time (22:00 GMT) but swerved sharply at the outskirts before heading for the coast and the Ust-Luga port.
An eyewitness is heard saying the ground shook beneath his feet with the explosions.
The Russian Telegram channel Mash quotes a source saying they heard two explosions before the fire. The channel says around 150 staff were evacuated from the terminal.
Another video - posted on Russian social media - appears to show huge balls of orange fire, a man's voice is heard referring to hearing the buzzing of a drone before the explosion.
Fontanka.ru, usually a reliable source, says flights in and out of St Petersburg had been grounded before the explosions, as a plan known as ""Carpet"" was put in place.
Russia's defence ministry also said it shot down three Ukrainian drones in Smolensk Region, close to its border with Ukraine, on Saturday night.
It earlier said it had shot down drones over Tula and Oryol, both in western Russia. There were no reports of casualties.
Also on Sunday, at least 25 people were killed and 20 injured by shelling at a busy market in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, Russian-installed officials said. Kyiv has not yet commented on that attack.
Russia and Ukraine have been targeting each other's energy infrastructure, and on Friday a fire broke out at an oil depot in Bryansk, south-west Russia, which Moscow blamed on a Ukrainian drone strike.
That came a day after an attack targeted a major oil loading terminal in St Petersburg.
On Thursday, Russia claimed to have captured a village close to the devastated city of Bakhmut, in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. Kyiv has not confirmed the claim.
Ukraine has warned repeatedly that its army is facing severe ammunition shortages, but has set a target of producing a million drones domestically this year.
Russia launched the invasion of its neighbour nearly two years ago.

A speech by shadow foreign secretary David Lammy has been disrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters.
Ten minutes into his address at the Fabian Society conference on foreign policy in London, a woman climbed on stage carrying a Palestinian flag.
The demonstrators criticised Labour's response to the war between Hamas and Israel.
Lammy's speech was paused multiple times as security attempted to remove the hecklers.
The Free Palestine Coalition said in a statement that some of its members had infiltrated the event to ""call out"" Mr Lammy and his party.
""It's difficult to see how Lammy is upholding any commitment to human rights or international law as we enter into the 106th day of Israel's unrelenting assault on Gaza,"" the group said.

DEJ0TWBBKM_7B7H86NQWGEKV2B,Man convicted of French woman's murder dies aged 66,_,21 January 2024,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5168r5zj83o,"Ian Bailey denied his involvement in the killing of Sophie Toscan du Plantier
A man convicted in France of murdering French television producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier in the Republic of Ireland in 1996 has died.
Former journalist Ian Bailey, 66, who was originally from Manchester, died after he collapsed at home in west Cork on Sunday.
He had a severe heart condition and had been a candidate for surgery.
His solicitor Frank Buttimer, who has known Bailey since March 1997, said he was ""very upset"" to hear of his death.
""I knew Ian was very unwell. We were in communication in the past five days, but I didn't know he was terminally unwell,"" he told the PA news agency.
Sophie Toscan du Plantier was killed while holidaying in west Cork in 1996
Ms Toscan du Plantier's badly beaten body was discovered by neighbours in a laneway near her holiday home in Schull, County Cork, on 23 December 1996.
Nobody has ever been charged in Ireland in connection with the 39-year-old's death.
Bailey, who lived two miles away, was twice arrested for questioning by gardaÃ­ (Irish police) but released without charge.
The murder, and subsequent investigation, has received significant media attention in the years following Ms Toscan du Plantier's death, becoming a notorious and protracted case of unsolved murder.
In May 2019, a court in Paris convicted Bailey in absentia for the murder. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
He denied any involvement in Ms Toscan du Plantier's murder and, as he was not present in court for the French proceedings, he could not appeal the verdict.
Ireland's High Court blocked his extradition to France, where the law allows suspects to be tried for murdering French citizens abroad, on multiple occasions.

EW1K2E3HOO_VQWS4E0K37EEKEB,Ayodhya: Temple to open at Indiaâs religious fault-line,By Yogita Limaye,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68030712,"Santosh Dubey says he has no regrets he helped tear down the mosque.
""It was religious work and I was put on this Earth to complete the task,"" he says. ""There is no crime or sin in it.""
Mr Dubey, a ""kar sevak"" (religious worker), was one of tens of thousands of Hindu men who demolished the 16th Century Babri Masjid in the Indian holy city of Ayodhya on 6 December 1992.
It was one of independent India's darkest days. The disputed site sits on one of its biggest religious fault-lines - thousands were killed in the violence that broke out.
More than 30 years later, where the mosque once stood a grand temple to Lord Ram, one of Hinduism's most revered deities, is about to be opened by India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. That's controversial in a country with a secular constitution, but especially so because of the divisive history of the site.
Monday's ceremony is being seen as the informal start of his campaign for re-election this year, wooing India's Hindu majority. Across the country, millions of Hindus are gearing up to celebrate the day like a big festival, while employees of Mr Modi's federal government have been given a half day.
Sitting in his crumbling home, in a narrow alley in the city, paint and plaster peeling off its walls, Mr Dubey says he's proud of what he achieved.
""If we had not done what we did then the temple could never have been built,"" he says. ""Religious sentiments are greater than the constitution. I am extremely happy now. I had taken a pledge that I would not repair my home until Lord Ram got his.""
But for Muslims, who make up India's biggest minority, the day will evoke fear and painful memories. Some will send their children out of the city, fearing tensions might be stoked when the streets fill with Hindu devotees from around the country.
""We have been betrayed once, so we feel fear,"" says Mohammad Shahid. ""Many outsiders will come into Ayodhya and it's when outsiders come that there's trouble.""
6 December 1992 was a defining moment in India's history. It was also a pivotal event in the political rise of the Hindu right-wing that's now seeking a third consecutive term in power.
Many Hindus believe Muslim emperor Babur destroyed a temple that stood at the birthplace of Lord Ram and built a mosque over it more than 500 years ago.
Santosh Dubey and dozens of others have faced charges and spent time in jail over the years, but no-one has been convicted for demolishing the mosque.
He doesn't agree that what he did was against the law.
""Those who say that it was not Hindu to destroy the mosque are idiots. They are heretics, leftists, extremists and terrorists.
""We did not go to another country to destroy their places of worship, but if they destroyed ours, then it is right that we get them back.""
Muslims regularly offered prayers in the mosque until 1949, when idols of Lord Ram were placed in it, allegedly by Hindu priests. The gates of the mosque were then closed by a court order. In 1986, they were re-opened, many believe at the behest of the Congress party, then in power, in a rumoured attempt to woo the Hindu majority.
Then in 1990, the Hindu Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - then just a small political party with little electoral success - spearheaded a mass campaign for a Hindu temple at the site. The campaign would later be seen as one of the key moments which transformed BJP into the virtually unbeatable political giant it is today, which now has Mr Modi at its head.
That year, tens of thousands of kar sevaks congregated in Ayodhya. When they started moving towards the disputed site, police fired at them, killing dozens. ""Those bullets fuelled our anger,"" Santosh Dubey says. He was injured in the shooting.
Two years later, kar sevaks gathered in Ayodhya again.
""The people who were guarding the disputed structure fled when they saw a huge crowd walking towards them with swords and hammers. We had practised everything earlier. We climbed on the domes and brought it down within a few hours.""
Mr Dubey shows us a black and white photo that appeared in a newspaper of a group of men brandishing their weapons with raised arms, wide smiles on their faces. He says it was taken before the mosque was razed.
""We were happy, because we knew what was going to happen that day,"" he says, pointing to himself in the photo.
For Ayodhya's Muslims it was a day of terror.
""Hundreds of thousands of men were all over Ayodhya. They had sticks, swords and tridents. Our house was surrounded by them,"" says Anwari Begum, now 65.
""We ran from our homes. I ran with my six-month-old baby and small children. My husband was running behind us. When I turned, I saw that he had been caught by some men. We had to keep running for our lives.""
The next day she found out her husband Mohammad Amin had been killed, one of at least 17 Muslims who died in shocking violence in Ayodhya that day.
""An eyewitness told us that he had been caught, his arms and legs were chopped off, he was dumped into a sack and taken away. We never found his body,"" she says breaking down.
When she returned to her home, she found it had been burnt to the ground. It would take time, but over the years the family would manage to rebuild a small, two-room home on the same site.
""My husband used to take care of our family. I was left alone with six small children. We got some money from the government but it was not enough. My life was destroyed by that day,"" she says.
In the violence that swept across India after the mosque was torn down, nearly 2,000 people were killed. More than 900 died in the financial capital, Mumbai, alone, roughly two-thirds of them were Muslims.  There were killings in other cities including Jaipur, Bhopal, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.
In Ayodhya, Mohammad Shahid's father Mohammad Sabir was also killed brutally.
""They beat him and then they poured oil on both him and my uncle and set them on fire. We found their bodies,"" he says. ""The country wants to forget what happened. But Muslims can never forget. It was a black day for us.""
The family had a business supplying wooden carvings to temples in Ayodhya. The workshop was razed to the ground, and Mr Shahid was forced to become a rickshaw driver to earn a living.
Like Mr Shahid, Anwari Begum wants her son Sohrab, who's in his 30s, to leave for his safety around the inauguration.
""I'm not scared, but I am nervous,"" he told the BBC. ""It's being said that 70,000 to 100,000 people are coming. The atmosphere could become charged, that's why Muslims are thinking of leaving. But I won't go. I don't think anything will happen.""
In Ayodhya, the temple site is abuzz with cranes and diggers sending dust into the air ahead of the inauguration. Thousands of workers in hard hats dot the area.
It's costing $217m (Â£170m) to build the temple, funded from private donations, the temple trust says. The makeover of the city is being done by the government, estimated to cost more than $3bn.
Amid the construction, hundreds and hundreds of proud worshippers stream in to get a glimpse of the idols, with rituals for their consecration in the new temple already under way.
Poonam Ohri, 40, had tears of joy rolling down her cheeks. ""Our dream has come true because of Modi and the BJP government. I am overwhelmed.""
Badri Narayan, an elderly farmer who had travelled hundreds of miles, said his happiness knew no bounds.
""When I visited before, Lord Ram's idol was in a makeshift tent. It was getting wet in the rain. Tears started falling from my eyes seeing that,"" he told the BBC. ""And now he has been released because of Modi.""
Prime Minister Modi has asked people not to come to Ayodhya on 22 January and to light a lamp in their homes. But he's also said everyone can visit from the next day.
And it is those days following the official ceremony which worry some in the Muslim community.
""If the government reached out to us and gave assurances that nothing will happen, that would prevent people from leaving, but so far they haven't done that,"" said Azam Qadri, a Muslim community leader.
Sohrab says ""political leaders should have come to us and said what happened to you was wrong - they should have showed compassion, but they have not"".
As for the new temple that's being opened, he says: ""We feel happy they are building their temple, but we are also sad because it was built after destroying a mosque.""
Mohammad Shahid says Hindus have the right to build the temple after the Supreme Court gave them the site. ""We did not accept that decision happily, but what can we do,"" he says.
After years in the courts, the disputed site was handed over to Hindus by a Supreme Court judgment in 2019, despite the judges also finding that the mosque's demolition had been illegal. The ruling relied on archaeological evidence which showed that features of the foundations of the mosque ""are suggestive of a Hindu religious origin"".
It also said that evidence placed on the record proved that there was Hindu faith and belief that the site was the birthplace of Ram.
It was not proved that a temple had been destroyed to build the mosque.
The court also ordered a separate plot be given to Muslims to construct a mosque. It's 15 miles from Ayodhya, overgrown and empty.
It is simply too far away, says Mr Qadri: ""If the government had given it as much attention by building roads and ring roads as it's doing for the temple, then work would have started there too.""
Prime Minister Modi and the BJP are expected to sweep the general election later this year following the inauguration of the temple.
Many accuse him and his party of violating the constitution, of turning a religious event into a state-sponsored one.
But the BJP's local MP, Lallu Singh, saw no reason why Mr Modi shouldn't attend.
""If the prime minister is Hindu, why should he not visit the biggest centre of Hindu faith? What should stop him? Lord Ram is representative of the culture of this country,"" he told the BBC.
""The culture of the majority dominates the country, so it is 100% right that the PM do the opening. This does not mean we are discriminating on the basis of religion.""
There is also controversy around moving the idols into an unfinished temple, with some Hindu religious leaders accusing the government of prioritising electoral gains over the sanctity of Hindu rituals.
""I don't want to comment on what our religious leaders say. But the sanctum sanctorum where the idol will sit is complete. More worshippers will be able to come with ease now, that's why we are opening it,"" the MP says.
Back in 1992, the BJP's senior leaders expressed regret over the demolition of the mosque and said it should never have happened. How does Lallu Singh feel about it now?
""I believe what happened was right,"" he says.
Most Muslims and Hindus the BBC spoke to don't think longer-term there will be more hostilities in Ayodhya.
But some see Ayodhya as just the start - disputes and court cases are already ongoing over mosques in the cities of Mathura and Varanasi, referred to many by its ancient name Kashi.
""We had to wait for 450 years to get the birthplace of Lord Ram. I hope Kashi and Mathura will be ours soon too,"" says Aakash Jadhav, a 21-year-old Hindu devotee.

FCXZRXNOHK_P3VTUL3X1Q0BG85,US personnel injured in missile attack on Al Asad airbase in Iraq,By Sean Seddon,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68045254,"A number of US military personnel have been injured in a missile attack on an airbase in western Iraq.
The US military's Central Command said an Iran-backed militia targeted the Al Asad airbase, which hosts American troops, with ballistic missiles and rockets on Saturday evening.
An unspecified number of US personnel were ""undergoing evaluation for traumatic brain injuries"".
At least one Iraqi service member was wounded in the attack.
The strike against the base was claimed by a group calling itself the Islamic Resistance in Iraq. According to the US-based Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the group emerged in late 2023 and is comprised of several Iran-affiliated armed groups operating in Iraq.
It has claimed other attacks against US forces in recent weeks. And Al Asad base has been attacked repeatedly in recent years.
The US military said most of the missiles fired on Saturday were intercepted but some evaded air defences and hit the base, adding that an assessment of the damage is ongoing.
It is the latest in a series of attacks on US positions in Iraq and Syria by Iran's proxies in the region since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza conflict last October.
The US military and allies have also intervened to stop Houthi missile attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea.
US forces carried out another airstrike on Saturday against the Houthis - an Iran-backed rebel group controlling much of western Yemen. The US military said it targeted a launch site, after identifying an anti-ship missile ""that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and prepared to launch"".
The Iranian military has carried out a number of missile strikes in recent days against targets in Syria, Iraq and Pakistan.
Earlier on Saturday, Iran accused Israel of carrying out an airstrike in the Syrian capital Damascus which killed five senior members of Iran's security forces.

G8BQPODYIH_HGI8151DH3A9KZA,Bwari kidnapping: Nigeria police secure release of sisters taken from Abuja,By Oliver Slow,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-68047140,"Nigerian police say they have successfully rescued five sisters who were held hostage after being kidnapped in the country's capital.
The girls were freed in a joint police-army operation in a forest in northern Nigeria on Saturday night.
They were taken from their home in Abuja earlier this month, along with another sister who was later killed.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom for their release, but the statement made no mention of one being paid.
Nigerian police said the girls had been reunited with their family following the operation, which took place near the Kajuru forest in Kaduna State at around 23:30 local time (22:30 GMT) on Saturday.
The six sisters, aged from the early teens to 23, were taken hostage alongside their father, Mansoor Al-Kadriyar, on 2 January at the family home in Bwari, a suburb of Abuja.
Witnesses said the girls' uncle ran to find help but was ambushed and killed, as were three police officers.
The kidnappers released Mansoor on the condition he raise a large ransom, but his 21-year-old daughter, Nabeeha, a final year university student, was then killed as a warning, according to a family member who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity.
Kidnapping has become rife in Nigeria, with hundreds of people abducted in recent years, largely by criminal gangs who see it as an easy way to make money. It has been particularly bad in the north-west of the country.
The case of the Al-Kadriyar sisters prompted widespread anger in the country, with many arguing that the kidnapping emergency has continued despite government promises to bring it to an end.
First Lady Remi Tinubu urged security agencies to ""intensify their efforts"" to end the kidnapping and security crisis, and demanded a ""swift return of the Al-Kadriyar sisters"".
The ransom for the girls' return was set at 65m naira ($68,000; Â£53,000), leading to many Nigerians donating to a crowdfunding initiative.
However, Defence Minister Mohammed Badaru Abubakar urged people not to contribute towards the ransom, saying it would ""only worse the situation"".
""We believe we have to stop - as painful as it is. We have to stop responding to payment on ransom. If we stop, over time the kidnapping will not be profitable and they will stop,"" he said.
No matter how desperate the circumstances, Nigerian law prohibits the payment of ransom money. However, many victims pay up because they do not trust authorities to secure the release of their loved ones.
There has now been an outcry that the insecurity has reached the capital, prompting Abuja's police force to launch a special squad to tackle the kidnapping gangs.
Mr Abubakar said he believed operations against the gangs elsewhere had forced them to move to areas near the capital.
""The security agencies are working very hard to push them out and block the movements and finish them off once and for all,"" he said.

IO76CYZY0Q_9XGBDDNQ920RRH0,"More than 25,000 now killed in Gaza since Israel offensive began, Hamas-run health ministry says",By Mark Lowen,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68050172,"More than 25,000 people have now been killed in Gaza during Israel's offensive there, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
It said there had been 178 deaths in the last 24 hours, making it one of the deadliest days in the war so far.
As fighting continued, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rejected creating a Palestinian state.
The White House has said the US and Israel ""clearly see things differently"" when it comes to a two-state solution.
Israel began its offensive following the 7 October attack in which Hamas fighters killed 1,300 people in southern Israel and took more than 240 hostage.
In its first public account of the October assault, published on Sunday, Hamas described it as a ""necessary step"" against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.
Israel's air and ground operation is currently focusing on southern Gaza, where the military are convinced top Hamas commanders are holed up in, or beneath, the city of Khan Younis.
That is where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had discovered another tunnel, some 830m (2,700ft) long and containing booby-traps and blast doors.
The IDF footage showed what appeared to be a tunnel with mattresses and cells inside - it is where Israel believes around 20 hostages, including children, were held at various points. None were found when the tunnel was discovered, though.
Israeli soldiers have also faced renewed attacks in the north of the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is said to have seized an opening around the town of Jabalia as Israel moved troops and tanks south.
More than three months since the conflict erupted, Israel - whose army far outstrips Hamas's capabilities - is still facing significant resistance across Gaza.
US intelligence agencies reportedly estimate that the Israeli military has killed 20-30% of Hamas fighters, which falls far short of Mr Netanyahu's stated aim of ""completely destroying"" the armed group.
The classified report is also said to have found that Hamas still has enough munitions to continue striking Israel and Israeli forces for months, raising the spectre of a prolonged war in which Israel could get bogged down.
The apparent slow progress, the fact no top Hamas commander has yet been captured or killed, and the collective trauma over the 130 or so Israeli hostages still missing, is prompting growing anti-government anger in Israel.
Protests are continuing by relatives of those still held by Hamas, calling for Mr Netanyahu to prioritise their release over the potentially impossible aim of destroying Hamas. And a still relatively small anti-war movement is also demonstrating, horrified by the damage wrought on Gaza - one of the most intense and destructive military campaigns in recent history.
Most Israelis have rallied around their flag - but not around their prime minister, who, according to a recent poll, only 15% of the public believe should stay in office once the war ends.
How it does end is the subject of growing disagreement between Mr Netanyahu and Israel's western allies. After speaking to US President Joe Biden for the first time in almost a month, the Israeli prime minister reiterated his rejection of a future Palestinian state.
In a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said Israel must retain ""security control over the entire area west of [River] Jordan"", which also encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank territory.
Mr Netanyahu has been fiercely opposed to a Palestinian state throughout his political career. But by repeatedly asserting it now, an increasingly unpopular prime minister appears to be doubling down on a view that he feels chimes with the majority opinion in a nation too horrified by the attacks to countenance an independent Palestinian state.
His apparent fight for political survival is clashing with exasperated Israeli allies, who hope that the current bloodshed could force both sides into meaningful diplomacy over a sustainable two-state solution.
UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC earlier that Mr Netanyahu's stance was ""disappointing"". The White House has said the US and Israel ""clearly see things differently"".
Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, went further, calling the refusal to accept a Palestinian state ""completely unacceptable"". He added it ""would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security"".

The BBC visited the farm as part of an investigation that found fewer than five NHS patients have been given the medicine, leaving others to either pay privately or miss out.
It was thought the law change would mean the drug, which treats a range of conditions, could be freely prescribed by specialist doctors.

MVO5YKBAYY_2VGWMY10K9QW96S,Philippines president Marcos takes helicopter to Coldplay concert,By Vicky Wong,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68047606?at_bbc_team=editorial&at_campaign_type=owned&at_format=link&at_link_id=E7E14C62-B866-11EE-83E8-A353D0B4AF07&at_link_origin=BBCWorld&at_link_type=web_link&at_ptr_nam,"The president of the Philippines is facing criticism on social media for using a presidential helicopter to attend a Coldplay concert in a province north of the capital, Manila.
Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his wife were spotted arriving at the Philippine Arena via helicopter on Friday.
Critics have called this a misuse of government resources.
Mr Marcos Jr's office defended the move, citing ""unforeseen traffic complications"".
The head of Mr Marcos' Presidential Security Group (PSG), Brig Gen Jesus Nelson Morales, said in a statement published on Saturday that the ""unprecedented influx of 40,000 individuals eagerly attending a concert"" resulted in traffic complications, and that this posed a security threat to the president.
Brig Gen Morales went on to ask for the public's understanding, adding that the ""continued understanding and support for these measures are crucial in maintaining the safety and well-being of our nation's leadership"".
The Philippine Arena, located deep in the suburbs, is usually around 40 minutes by car from the presidential palace - absent the capital's notorious traffic jams. By public transport, the same route can take one to two hours.
Mr Marcos Jr and his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos were among the thousands of fans who attended Coldplay's concert at the Philippine Arena, the world's largest indoor arena.
Videos and photos of the first couple drew ire from social media users, who criticised the use of taxpayer money by Mr Marcos, who is the son and namesake of the late strongman president whose rule ended nearly four decades ago in a historic ""people power"" revolution.
""Using official resources, like the presidential chopper, for personal and non-official activities is generally considered an abuse of power or misuse of government resources,"" Facebook user James Patrick Aristorenas said in a post on Saturday.
""We paid for the use of the chopper, fuel and security, who knows even for the tickets for everyone,"" Facebook user Arvine Concepcion said.
In a survey published on Friday, Metro Manila topped the 2023 TomTom Traffic Index list of metro areas with the slowest travel time, taking an average time of 25 minutes and 30 seconds to travel 10km in the region. This has been blamed on creaking infrastructure and an inadequate public transport system.
Filipino office workers in the Metro Manila area often spend hours stuck in traffic. Many wake up before dawn in order to get to work on time.
According to news site Rappler, Coldplay's front man Chris Martin also remarked on the Philippine traffic, thanking fans for braving it to see the band live.
""We've seen some traffic. But I think you have the number one [traffic] in the world. Thank you for making the effort...to be here,"" he said.

N3RBQ4XPHT_78L06D5H98V45CG,Understanding a week of missile strikes across Middle East,By Raffi Berg,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68017051,"The past week has seen new rounds of violence across the Middle East, deepening fears of conflict spreading in an already unstable region.
Here is a brief guide to what has happened - and where it might lead.
On Tuesday, Iran unexpectedly carried out a missile and drone attack on Pakistani territory. Iran said it was targeting an Iranian Sunni Muslim militant group, Jaish al-Adl, that has staged attacks inside Iran. Pakistan said two children were killed and swiftly hit back, launching missiles at Pakistani ""terrorist hideouts"" on Iran's side of the border. Iran said three women, two men and four children were killed.
The flare-up has heightened tensions in a region already experiencing a multitude of crises. Although the area of the tit-for-tat strikes is far from the main theatres of fighting in the Middle East, the border is volatile and further incidents here could quickly escalate, for instance if Jaish al-Adl retaliates against Iran.
This week saw multiple rounds of US Navy missile strikes against the Houthi Zaidi Shia movement in Yemen, following Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a waterway crucial to world trade. The Houthis - backed by Iran - stepped up their attacks in November following the outbreak of the war in Gaza. They vowed to target ""Israeli-linked"" boats so long as Israel's offensive continued, to show solidarity with the Palestinians.
Consequently all merchant shipping in the international waters has been put under threat, something considered intolerable by Western powers. The US and UK, backed by allies, launched the first air strikes against the Houthis last week to try to deter them - but the group has remained defiant.
On Monday, the Houthis hit a US vessel in the Gulf of Aden in what appeared to be their first successful attack on an American ship since their campaign began. A second was hit in the Gulf of Aden on Wednesday and the Houthis have vowed to continue - raising the prospect of further US strikes and the question of whether Iran will feel forced to respond.
An increasingly intensifying years-long shadow war between arch-foes Israel and Iran ratcheted up on Monday when Iran fired missiles at what it described as headquarters of Israel's Mossad spy agency in Irbil in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, killing four people. Iraq - an ally of Iran and hostile to Israel - denied Mossad was there and condemned the attack.
Iran said its attack was a response to the alleged Israeli killings recently of a senior Iranian commander in Syria and two top Iran-backed militants in Lebanon - one a commander of the Shia militant movement Hezbollah and the other the deputy leader of the Palestinian group Hamas.
The Israel-Lebanese border, where Israel and Hezbollah - heavily armed and funded by Iran - have frequently traded strikes since the Hamas attack on Israel and start of the Gaza war on 7 October, is one of the most dangerous fronts in the region.
On Wednesday Israel's military chief of staff said ""the likelihood of [war in the north] happening in the coming months is much higher than it was in the past.""
At the same time as it struck in Iraq, Iran fired missiles into a rebel-held province in north-west Syria, saying it had targeted bases of the Islamic State (IS) group in retaliation for IS suicide bombings in southern Iran on 3 January which killed 94 people. IS, a Sunni jihadist group, considers Shia Muslims heretical, and Iran is the dominant Shia power in the region.
While Iran is a key ally of the Syrian government, directly striking militants in the rebel-held region is a rare step and a signal to its adversaries that Iran is prepared to act far afield.
An air strike on the Syrian capital, Damascus, on Saturday killed 10 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five of them were senior members of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Syria and Iran blamed Israel, with Iran vowing revenge.
It follows similar strikes around Damascus earlier in the week. Israel has not commented, but has previously acknowledged carrying out hundreds of aerial operations in Syria involving attacks on targets it says are linked to Iran. An interception of a fighter aircraft by Syrian air defences - which has so far not happened - or deadly retaliation could ignite a new crisis in a region beset by wars.
Intense fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza has continued, with the war there now in its 15th week. At least 891 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli bombardment since last Sunday, raising the death toll there since 7 October to more than 25,000, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. On the Israeli side, nine soldiers were killed in the same period, bringing its combat death total to 189.
Israel intensified its offensive on the southern city of Khan Younis this week, while troops reached their furthest point south since the start of the war, the Israeli military said. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the conflict could go on until 2025, Israeli TV reported this week.
Israel was also hit by a car-ramming and stabbing attack on Monday, for which police arrested two Palestinian suspects from the occupied West Bank. The attack, which was praised by Hamas, killed a woman and injured 17 other people. It was one of the first such attacks inside Israel since the start of the Gaza war, heightening anxieties among Israelis still reeling from the 7 October attacks.
Violence has also escalated in the West Bank alongside the war. Israeli air strikes there on Wednesday killed nine Palestinians, medics said. Israel said at least five of the dead were planning an imminent attack.
Missiles were fired at an air base used by US-led coalition forces in western Iraq on Saturday, injuring several US military personnel, US Central Command said. Iranian-backed militants are suspected of being behind the attack.
Bases housing US and coalition forces in Iraq and north-east Syria have been attacked dozens of times by Iranian-backed militants in recent months, drawing US retaliation. The attacks are seen as part of Iran's indirect conflict with the US, where it can strike US assets at arms length.
About 3,400 coalition personnel are in Iraq and Syria as part of efforts to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group, which still operates in pockets in the region.
Attacks by one country into another have also been happening in other places in the Middle East this week.
Turkey carried out air strikes against Kurdish militants in northern Iraq and a US-backed Kurdish-led militia alliance in northern Syria on Monday, its defence ministry said. The latest strikes are part of a decades-long and bloody conflict between Turkey and armed Kurdish groups which Turkey, which has a large Kurdish minority, regards as terrorist organisations. One of the strikes is reported to have hit a prison holding more than 3,000 IS prisoners.
There were also rare air strikes by Jordan across its border with Syria. Ten people, including children, are reported to have been killed. It is thought to have targeted drug smugglers. Iran-backed militias in Syria have been accused by Jordan of trafficking the amphetamine Captagon into the kingdom and on to Gulf Arab states."

A man convicted in France of murdering French television producer Sophie Toscan du Plantier in the Republic of Ireland in 1996 has died.
Former journalist Ian Bailey, 66, who was originally from Manchester, died after he collapsed at home in west Cork on Sunday.
He had a severe heart condition and had been a candidate for surgery.
His solicitor Frank Buttimer, who has known Bailey since March 1997, said he was ""very upset"" to hear of his death.
""I knew Ian was very unwell. We were in communication in the past five days, but I didn't know he was terminally unwell,"" he told the PA news agency.
Sophie Toscan du Plantier was killed while holidaying in west Cork in 1996
Ms Toscan du Plantier's badly beaten body was discovered by neighbours in a laneway near her holiday home in Schull, County Cork, on 23 December 1996.
Nobody has ever been charged in Ireland in connection with the 39-year-old's death.
Bailey, who lived two miles away, was twice arrested for questioning by gardaÃ­ (Irish police) but released without charge.
The murder, and subsequent investigation, has received significant media attention in the years following Ms Toscan du Plantier's death, becoming a notorious and protracted case of unsolved murder.
In May 2019, a court in Paris convicted Bailey in absentia for the murder. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
He denied any involvement in Ms Toscan du Plantier's murder and, as he was not present in court for the French proceedings, he could not appeal the verdict.
Ireland's High Court blocked his extradition to France, where the law allows suspects to be tried for murdering French citizens abroad, on multiple occasions.

RTUO2XDKA5_790OH2VRXV8MEFZ,Ugandan internet propaganda network exposed by the BBC,By Marco Silva,2 days ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-67803493,"A BBC investigation has uncovered a network of fake social media accounts in Uganda. Under false identities, they spread pro-government messaging and target critics with threats. But who are the people behind it?
It is not every day that you get to take a selfie with the long-serving President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni. When the opportunity arose, Dr Jamechia Hoyle went for it.
She is a senior consultant in the United States, focused on global health security. Back in October 2017, she had travelled to the Ugandan capital, Kampala, to attend an international conference.
Mr Museveni was there to welcome his foreign guests.
Making her way through the crowds, Dr Hoyle approached him, smartphone in hand. ""He was really happy to engage with us and take the picture,"" she recalls.
Seeing a broad-smiling Dr Hoyle and the president, surrounded by smiling faces trying to get in the shot, photographers couldn't resist - and they too captured that image.
Four years later, this exact photo would be used to create a fake social media account aimed at spreading state propaganda and targeting government critics.
Dr Hoyle only recently found out about it, after the BBC got in touch with her.
""Seeing my own picture and then understanding the context of some of the things that were shared... I couldn't believe it,"" she says. ""I was truly taken aback.""
Listen to BBC Trending: Crude fakes in Uganda on BBC Sounds.
The fake account using Dr Hoyle's photo was created on X, then called Twitter, in October 2021.
From early on, it appeared to have no interests outside Ugandan politics, regularly posting in praise of the Ugandan government and its policies.
Much harsher words - including occasional threats - were directed at opposition supporters and government critics.
""We know you support terrorist activities"", the account posted without presenting any evidence, in response to a tweet from opposition leader Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi.
""You will die"", read a separate tweet directed at Hillary Innocent Taylor Seguya, a Ugandan climate activist based in the US and a member of Mr Wine's party, the National Unity Platform.
On social media, Mr Seguya has become known for his criticism of one of Uganda's flagship projects: the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP).
When finished, the $3.5bn (Â£2.7bn) pipeline will connect Uganda's oil fields to Tanzania's port of Tanga, along a 1,445km (898 mile) route.
Supporters of the project say it will create thousands of jobs and generate millions in oil revenue.
But critics have argued that EACOP could prove disruptive for local communities, while having a significant impact on the environment.
""Trolls keep coming for me on a daily basis,"" he says. ""They keep labelling me as the enemy of progress in Uganda and Africa. Sometimes they call me a 'US-backed puppet' or a sell-out.""
The account belonging to ""fake Jamechia"" was just one of dozens attacking, harassing, and at times threatening Mr Seguya.
But, on closer inspection, the profiles all bore striking similarities to each other.
They all claimed to be Ugandan citizens - often women - whose accounts appeared to have the sole purpose of posting praise for the president and pushing back against critics.
The Ugandan Media Centre, which handles public communications on behalf of the government, did not respond to our requests for comment.
By analysing those accounts' behaviour, BBC Verify was able to map out a network of nearly 200 fake social media accounts operating on X and on Facebook (even though the latter has been blocked in Uganda since 2021).
The vast majority of these accounts used stolen images as profile pictures - often social media photos of models, influencers, and actresses from across the world. But none of the usernames used by them appeared to be linked to real individuals in Uganda or Tanzania.
These accounts often posted the same content within minutes of each other. By looking at the dates when they were created, we also found that many had been set up on the very same day.
This suggests that, while they may look like separate accounts, they have been working together.
It is unclear how successful this network may have been in actually shifting people's views of the government, as very few of its posts earned large numbers of likes, comments, or shares.
For all its sophistication, could this network be failing to fulfil its mission then? Not quite, experts say.
""[Their] goal can be to push the message out there - whether or not people engage with it is kind of irrelevant, as long as people have seen it,"" says Tessa Knight, a research associate for the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab who investigates disinformation.
Contacted by the BBC, Meta removed most of the Facebook accounts we identified.
Meta believes that individuals linked to the Government Citizen Interaction Centre (GCIC) - a Ugandan government agency - may have been running several of the accounts it removed.
The company did not share the evidence it said it held to back this assertion. And, as a result, the BBC has not been able to independently verify it.
But, in a statement, the GCIC denied this allegation, saying that agency accounts ""are not operating on Facebook"".
And yet, it is not the first time the agency has been accused of running what Meta describes as ""influence operations"": in 2021, Facebook's parent company took action against hundreds of accounts it said were linked to the GCIC.
X did not reply to our requests for comment and the platform took no action against any of the accounts identified by the BBC's investigation.
Asked whether it recognised any of the accounts on X, the GCIC said: ""we recognise the accounts of our staff whose terms of reference include disseminating factual information about government programmes. We are only aware and responsible for accounts of our staff meant for work.""
The GCIC did not respond to follow-up questions attempting to clarify whether the accounts identified were indeed run by state employees.
Mr Seguya says he is ""not surprised"" by the existence of this network, but he urges whoever is behind it to consider the human cost of their campaign against critics.
""They may not know the negative impacts they are creating on someone's mental health by sending out such threats to people like me and different activists.
""Let them not silence dissent. Dissent is democracy.""

T8XW4E4VEG_SKTKDUC5SDAWBVJ,Israel-Gaza: Netanyahu defies Biden over Palestinian state,"By Mark Lowen, in Jerusalem, and Sean Seddon",2 days ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68045247,"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has again rejected the idea of creating a Palestinian state.
His comments came hours after a phone call with US President Joe Biden after which the US leader indicated Mr Netanyahu may still accept the idea.
Mr Netanyahu's remarks appeared to deepen a public divide with the US.
The US believes a Palestinian state alongside Israel - known as a ""two-state solution"" - is vital for long-term stability.
But the White House acknowledged this week the US and Israeli governments ""clearly see things differently"".
Speaking to reporters after the two leaders held a call for the first time in almost a month, Mr Biden insisted a two-state solution was still possible with Mr Netanyahu in office.
""There are a number of types of two-state solutions. There's a number of countries that are members of the UN that... don't have their own militaries,"" he said.
But on Saturday Mr Netanyahu doubled down on his position, which he has held for much of his political career and repeated earlier this week.
A statement released by his office read: ""In his conversation with President Biden, Prime Minister Netanyahu reiterated his policy that after Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel, a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty.""
Also on Saturday, in a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said Israel must retain ""security control over the entire area west of [River] Jordan"", an area which also encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank territory.
UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps said on Sunday that Mr Netanyahu's statement was ""disappointing"", even though it was not a surprise.
The comments will dampen hopes in some circles that the Gaza crisis could result in Israeli and Palestinian leaders restarting diplomatic negotiations and kickstarting the dormant peace process.
Mr Netanyahu's increasing isolation abroad comes amid continuing support for the war at home, coupled with protests over the fate of the estimated 130 hostages still being held inside Gaza by Hamas.
Hamas killed about 1,300 people - mostly civilians - and took 240 hostages in their surprise attack on southern Israel on 7 October.
Thousands of protesters, including relatives of those still missing, gathered in Tel Aviv on Saturday, urging Mr Netanyahu to reach a truce to allow the hostages home.
Gil Dickmann, whose cousin was captured on 7 October, said: ""Dear Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we believe that you can bring them back. We believe in you.
""We know that you can sign this deal and bring about this victory to all the citizens of Israel. Just do it, Bibi. Just do it. Bring the hostages back home.""
Israeli forces have continued to push into southern Gaza, saying they are searching for top Hamas officials they believe are hiding in Khan Younis, the Strip's second biggest city.
The Israel Defense Forces said they had raided a tunnel in Khan Younis that had been used to hold hostages, although they were not there when it was discovered.
While the focus of the fighting is now in southern Gaza, there have been renewed clashes around the northern town of Jabalia, as Palestinian fighters reportedly advanced while Israel tried to move its soldiers and tanks south.
Almost three months since Israel launched its ground invasion of Gaza, its army - vastly superior to Hamas in strength and equipment - is still facing significant resistance across the territory.
The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that 25,105 people had been killed in the territory since 7 October. More than 60,000 had also been injured, it said.

Denis Pushilin described the strike on a busy market as ""horrendous"", and said the number of casualties could rise.
A Ukrainian army group operating in the region said it did not carry out the attack. Mr Pushilin blamed Ukraine.
BBC News was not able to immediately verify the circumstances around the strike.
Photographs published by Reuters news agency appeared to show destroyed shop fronts, as well as bodies lying in the street.
According to AFP, a local resident named Tatiana told local media she heard an incoming projectile overhead, and hid under her market stall.
""I saw smoke, people screamed, a woman was crying,"" she was quoted as saying.
In a statement posted on Facebook, the Tavria unit - part of the Ukrainian army - said its forces ""did not engage in combat operations in this case"".
It continued: ""Donetsk is Ukraine! Russia will have to be held accountable for the lives of Ukrainians taken.""
The Russian Foreign Ministry called it ""a barbaric terrorist act against the peaceful people of Russia"" by Ukrainian forces who, it said, had ""used weapons supplied by the West"".
Donetsk city and parts of the wider region in eastern Ukraine were first seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014, and the area has been partially controlled by Moscow ever since.
The city is around 20km (12 miles) from the frontline. Areas near Donetsk city - including Mariinka and Avdiivka - have seen some of the fiercest fighting of late.
It has been almost two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it has made little progress in recent months.
On Saturday it claimed to have captured the village of Krokhmalne in north-eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv region. A Ukrainian military spokesman confirmed its forces had withdrawn from the area, but said the territory was of little military importance.
Days earlier Moscow also claimed to have taken control of a settlement named Vesele in Donetsk. Kyiv has not confirmed the claim.

XOMKLXK2SR_G2XMF9XGJX1XPOS,Ron DeSantis drops out of presidential race and backs Trump,By Bernd Debusmann Jr & Kayla Epstein,1 day ago,20240121,bbc.com,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68051757,"This video can not be played
Watch: Highs and lows of Ron DeSantis's presidential bid
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Donald Trump.
He quit ahead of the Republican primary election in New Hampshire, where he was polling in the single digits.
Mr DeSantis was once considered a strong contender for the party's nomination - but on Sunday he said he did not ""have a clear path to victory"".
Nikki Haley, Mr Trump's last remaining challenger, said she was the ""only one"" able to beat US President Joe Biden.
Ms Haley will go head-to-head with Mr Trump in New Hampshire on Tuesday, the second in a series of state-by-state contests to pick a Republican nominee for the November general election.
In a nearly five-minute long video on X, formerly Twitter, released on Sunday afternoon, Mr DeSantis said his campaign had ""left it all out on the field"".
""If there was anything I could do to produce a favourable outcome - more campaign stops, more interviews - I would do it,"" he added, as he ended his seven-month campaign.
The Florida governor said he was endorsing Mr Trump, who is the clear frontrunner after winning the first contest in Iowa with 51% of the vote. Mr DeSantis said it had become clear that a majority of Republican voters ""want to give Donald Trump another chance"".
He acknowledged ""disagreements"" with the former president, but said Mr Trump was ""superior"" to Mr Biden, who is almost certain to be the Democratic nominee in November's general election.
""I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honour that pledge,"" Mr DeSantis said.
There were loud cheers when Mr Trump made his first comments about Mr DeSantis's withdrawal and endorsement to a room in New Hampshire full of supporters on Sunday afternoon.
Later, addressing an audience at a rally, Mr Trump described his former opponent as a ""really terrific person"", adding: ""He ran a really good campaign, it's not easy.""
Mr DeSantis had presented himself as the Republican candidate who could deliver Mr Trump's populist agenda without the drama or baggage.
But one of the speakers at the event, Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, referred to him as ""diet Trump"". And several supporters of Mr Trump told the BBC they liked the Florida governor but felt this was not the right time for him.
Lynne Mason, 60, said she thought Mr DeSantis's campaign was ""a little weak"" and she had ""expected more from him"". Mr Trump, she added, was the ""only person at this time who can save this country"".
BethAnne Tatro, another local backing Mr Trump, agreed. ""I think that President Trump has proven, from being in office previously, that he can do this again and get things back on track.""
After Mr DeSantis' announcement, the Trump campaign called on all Republicans to rally behind Mr Trump, slamming his former UN Ambassador as ""the candidate of the globalists and Democrats who will do everything to stop the America First movement"".
Mr DeSantis also took a swipe at Ms Haley, calling her a member of ""the old Republican guard of yesteryear - a repackaged form of warmed-over corporatism"".
Ms Haley, a former South Carolina governor, responded by insisting she was the conservative candidate - the ""only one"" - who could beat Mr Biden.
""There's two people in this race,"" she told CNN in New Hampshire. ""That's what we wanted all along, and we're going to keep going.""
Mr DeSantis narrowly finished ahead of Ms Haley in last week's Iowa caucuses with 21% of the vote, compared to her 19%, both well behind Mr Trump.
At the time, Mr DeSantis framed the second-place finish as a victory, but it was a major disappointment after he had spent the bulk of his time and resources courting its conservative evangelical voters.
His departure from the race allows Mr DeSantis to avoid an embarrassing potential third-place finish in New Hampshire to Ms Haley, who has focused far more of her resources in the state.
But a person familiar with Mr DeSantis' election night plans in New Hampshire was completely caught off guard by the news of his exit.
The source told the BBC the campaign had just confirmed plans with them on Saturday for their election night celebration this coming Tuesday.
Chris Ager, the state committee chair of New Hampshire's Republican Party, told the BBC that ""the race has been moving toward a one-vs-one between Trump and Haley for a while"".
""This makes it so,"" he added.
