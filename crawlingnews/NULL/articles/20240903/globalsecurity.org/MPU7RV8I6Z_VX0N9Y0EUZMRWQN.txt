It is our sincere hope that the parliamentary elections held yesterday (1 September) will be auspicious for brotherly Azerbaijan.
We consider these parliamentary elections as historic, as they were held in the entire country, including the territories that were liberated from occupation.
We believe that the elections, in which the will of the Azerbaijani people has been expressed, will contribute to the establishment of lasting peace and stability in the South Caucasus.
