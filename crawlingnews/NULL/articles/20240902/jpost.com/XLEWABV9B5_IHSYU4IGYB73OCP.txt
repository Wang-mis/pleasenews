Chants of “fight, fight, fight” echoed with the applause welcoming former President Donald Trump to the Republican Jewish Coalition’s annual summit in Las Vegas on Thursday.He has been a fixture at the gathering for the past eight years, but this year, the Republican candidate for president appeared via satellite because a court appearance in New York prevented him from attending.Delegates waved signs, including “Kamala... oy vey!” and “We are Jews for Trump.”  Trump began his remarks by paying tribute to Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was murdered by Hamas terrorists.“As we speak today, we’re all devastated by the horrific death of our fellow American, Hersh Goldberg, and this is so sad to even say Hersh Goldberg-Polin,” he said. “I’ve been watching the parents. I’ve been watching everybody talking about it for so long, and it’s just so sad to see the five other innocent hostages slaughtered late last week at the hands of Hamas.”Hersh Goldberg-PolinHersh was a brother, a son, and an American citizen, Trump said.After being held captive for nearly a year following the “monstrous October 7 attack on Israel,” Hersh was “barbarically executed with a bullet to the back of his head,” he said. “To Hersh’s family and everyone touched by these atrocities, we pray that God will grant you comfort, healing, and peace, and as for the evil savages responsible for these murders, may they never know peace or comfort ever again,” he added.Trump reiterated his opinion that any Jewish supporters of President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris should have their heads examined.“They’re not going to win because they can’t win, because we wouldn’t have a country any longer, and then Israel would not have an ally,” he said.

I tell you, I’ve been very good at predicting things. You will not have a country. This is a radical-left Marxist that we have running. You will not have a country.” If Harris wins, terrorists will wage an “unceasing war to drive Jews out of the holy land,” he said.“And you know it, and we’ve had a great relationship with Israel, but I can say honestly that we got 25% of the vote,” Trump said. “We got 26% after four years, after I did more for Israel than any other president, by far, and this year, we’re probably around the 50% mark.“But I only ask you, who are the 50% of Jewish people that are voting for these people that hate Israel and don’t like the Jewish people? Why are they? Why are they voting?”Harris will “totally abandon Israel,” he said, adding that “you’re going to be abandoned if she becomes president.”“And I think you have to explain that to your people, because they don’t know it,” Trump said. “They have no idea what they’re getting into. You’re not going to have an Israel if she becomes president. Israel will no longer exist.”
